      <p>PORTLAND, Ore. — Independent tests appear to support an
        inventor's claim that his skunk-works antenna design can shrink
        antenna size by up to 70 percent while maintaining equivalent
        sensitivity and increasing bandwidth. </p>
      <p><b>The four-part antenna cancels out the normal inductive
          loading in traditional antenna designs, thereby linearizing
          the energy radiation along its mast and enabling its
          diminutive size.</b> </p>
      <p>"When we announced my smaller antenna design last year, I got
        lots of doubting Thomases worldwide. Now, with the help of the
        Naval Undersea Warfare Center and its antenna test range on
        Fishers Island, N.Y., we have independent test results to back
        up our claims," said inventor Rob Vincent, a research engineer
        in the University of Rhode Island's physics department. </p>
      <p>Vincent calls his invention a distributed-load monopole (DLM)
        antenna. The novel design uses a helix plus a load coil to
        shrink the size of a normal quarter-wave monopole. According to
        Vincent, his design can shrink the size of every antenna in use
        today, from the tiny gigahertz units inside cell phones to
        giant, kilohertz AM antennas. For instance, a 3-inch-long
        gigahertz antenna could be shrunk to an inch, and a
        300-foot-tall AM band antenna could be reduced to 80 feet high.
      </p>
      <p>In the tests, various DLM antennas from Vincent's portfolio
        were tested from 7 to 27 MHz. The results indicated that
        equivalent performance was achieved with antennas 30 to 70
        percent shorter than an ideal quarter-wave antenna. </p>
      <p>"Basically I am utilizing the distributed capacitance around
        the antenna to reduce the normally required inductive loading,"
        Vincent said. </p>
      <p>Vincent spent almost 30 years at Raytheon Co. and at KVH
        Industries (Middletown, R.I.), before becoming a research
        engineer at the University of Rhode Island (Kingston). He began
        experimenting with antennas there as a skunk-works project. </p>
      <p>Vincent chose the Navy's Fishers Island Antenna Complex to test
        his design because it is located in a low-lying, remote coastal
        area free from radiation obstructions and man-made
        electromagnetic interference. The complex offers a 1-mile range
        over seawater between two sites for testing antennas ranging in
        frequency from 2 to 30 megahertz. All gain measurements were
        done relative to an ideal quarter-wave monopole antenna. </p>
      <p>Vincent's antenna designs were tested using the official regime
        the Navy uses to certify its antennas. Vincent's Plano Spiral
        Top Hat antenna, at 7 MHz, was shown to have equal sensitivity
        to a normal quarter-wave antenna but at 50 percent the
        quarter-wave unit's size. In addition, bandwidth of the Vincent
        design was nearly twice as wide as that of the quarter-wave
        unit. </p>

      <p>The test antenna was a 7MHz monopole, 50% of the normal&nbsp;
        quarter-wave size. Now one thing from an illustration that begs
        more information was the ground system. It shows 150' radials,
        which appear to terminate at the sea water's edge. There is
        about a mile of seawater between the test antenna and the
        calibrated receive antenna. </p>
      <p>The article concludes; "Vincent's antenna designs were tested
        using the official regime the Navy uses to certify antennas.
        Vincent's Plano Spiral Top Hat antenna, at 7MHz, was shown to
        have equal sensitivity to a normal quarter-wave antenna but at
        50% the quarter-wave unit's size. In addition, bandwidth of the
        Vincent design was nearly twice as wide as that of the
        quarter-wave unit." </p>
      <p>The initial Vincent claim read almost like CFA, CTHA, Fractal,
        and E-H antenna claims. A very short antenna with makeshift
        construction was claimed to produce better than full size
        performance. The claims have evolved now to 50% shortening over
        a nearly perfect ground produces equal FS. </p>
      <p>The difference in FS between a conventional 1/4 wl tall antenna
        and a 1/8th wl tall antenna is within measurement error when the
        antenna is over a very good ground system and when it uses a
        good loading inductor regardless of where loading is placed.
        Brown, Lewis, and Epstein knew that in the 1930's. </p>
      <p>As a matter of fact even with a loading coil Q as low as 250
        (typically like air core #16 wire) and using base loading there
        is less than 1dB difference between a 1/8th wave and quarter
        wave antenna! </p>
      <p>The apparent endorsement of the DLM antenna by the U of RI does
        prove one thing....we need to work on our&nbsp; educational
        system and stop the backslide in science. The U of RI and
        Vincent are now at the level of early 20th century antenna <br>
        technology. </p>

      </center>
      <p>A research engineer at the University of Rhode Island has
        invented an antenna 70 percent smaller than conventional
        designs, but which has comparable sensitivity and increased
        bandwidth. The antenna, called a distributed-load monopole
        (DLM), uses a helix and a load coil to shrink the size of a
        normal quarter-wave monopole. In testing research engineer Rob
        Vincent's antenna design, which cancels out the normal inductive
        loading, the U.S. Navy found that the antenna achieved

      <p>Portland, Ore. - A four-year skunk works effort at the
        University of Rhode Island in Kingston has cut the size of an
        antenna by as much as one-third for any frequency from the kHz
        to the GHz range. Using conventional components, the four-part
        antenna design cancels out normal inductive loading, thereby
        linearizing the energy radiation along its mast and enabling the
        smaller size. </p>
      <p>"The DLM [distributed load monopole] antenna is based on a lot
        of things that currently exist," said the researcher who
        invented the smaller antenna, Robert Vincent of the university's
        physics department, "but I've been able to put a combination of
        them together to create a revolutionary way of building
        antennas. It uses basically a helix plus a load coil." </p>
      <p>The patent-pending design could transform every antenna-from
        the GHz models for cell phones to the giant, kHz AM antennas
        that stud the high ground of metropolitan areas-Vincent said. </p>
      <p>For cell phones, for example, Vincent said he has a completely
        planar design that is less than a third the size of today's cell
        phone antennas. And those 300-foot tall antennas for the 900-kHz
        AM band that dominate skylines would have to be only 80 feet
        high, with no compromise in performance, using Vincent's design,
        he said. </p>
      <p>"When looking at these antennas, you pretty much have to forget
        everything you ever knew about antennas and keep an open mind,
        because some of the things I have done are very radical," said
        Vincent. "With my technique, I reduce the inductive loading that
        is normally required to resonate the antenna by as much as 75
        percent . . . by utilizing the distributed capacitance around
        the antenna." <br>
        NIMBY factor <br>
        Vincent, an amateur radio operator, embarked on his project
        after he moved to a new neighborhood and his neighbors objected
        to the 140-foot tall antenna he planned to erect for a
        quarter-wave 1.8-MHz transmitter. So he surveyed the literature,
        took the best of the best designs and combined them into a
        21-MHz test antenna that was 18 inches high, as opposed to the
        12- to 24-foot height of the antennas normally used for that
        band. Building on that work, he eventually devised a
        46-foot-tall 1.8-MHz antenna his neighbors could accept. </p>
      <p>"I looked at all the different approaches used to make antennas
        smaller, and there seemed to be good and bad aspects" to each,
        Vincent said. "A helix antenna is normally known to be a core
        radiator, because the current profile drops off rapidly; they
        are just an inductor, and inductance does not like to see
        changes in current, so it's going to buck that. "But what I
        found was that for any smaller antenna, if you place a load coil
        in the middle you can normalize and make the current through the
        helix unity; that is, you can maximize it and linearize it." </p>
      <p>Vincent has verified designs from 1.8 MHz to 200 MHz by
        measuring and characterizing the behavior of his DLM antenna
        compared with a normal quarter-wave antenna of the same
        frequency. He found that many of the disadvantages of
        traditional antennas were not problems for the much lighter
        inductive loading in a DLM. </p>
      <p>"For instance, in a normal quarter-wave antenna the current
        continually drops off in a sinusoidal shape, but these antennas
        don't do that," said Vincent. "The current at the top of the
        antenna is 80 percent of the current at the base." </p>
      <p>The reason more current can be pumped into a DLM design than in
        a conventional equivalent at the same size, Vincent theorized,
        is that the DLM distributes energy more evenly along the
        antenna's length. Using a DLM antenna one-third to one-ninth the
        size of standard quarter-wave antenna, he measured nearly 80
        percent efficiency, when conventional wisdom would dictate that
        an antenna the size of a DLM should be only 8 to 15 percent
        efficient. </p>
      <p>To check his theory, Vincent analyzed and compared the current
        profiles, output power and a score of other standard tests for
        measuring antenna performance. All measurements were in
        reference to comparative measurements made on a quarter-wave
        vertical antenna for the same frequency, on the same ground
        system and same power input. </p>
      <p>"I was able to increase the current profile of the antenna over
        a quarter-wave by as much as two to 2.5 times," said Vincent.
        "That is, the magnitude of the current in these antennas is two
        to 2.5 times larger than for a normal quarter-wave antenna. </p>
      <p>"However, if you measure the current profiles for both antennas
        and integrate the area under the curves, you come out with the
        same volume, indicating that the much smaller antenna is filling
        the airwaves with the same amount of radio energy." </p>
      <p>Vincent plans to publish the results in a scientific journal
        soon, but with a patent decision imminent, he couldn't hold off
        a preliminary announcement that his theories regarding DLM
        antennas were being supported by the experimental results.
        According to the researcher, the DLM antenna profiles look just
        like the theoretically ideal antenna profile-operating on a
        single frequency with very high efficiency, while not producing
        any interfering frequencies or wasting thermal energy. </p>
      <p>"The phase and amplitude of this antenna are a perfect mimic of
        the universal resonance curve," said Vincent. "This makes the
        antenna completely predictable well beyond its bandwidth.
        Another unique feature is that these antennas have no harmonic
        response whatsoever; as a matter of fact, to a certain extent I
        used filter synthesis to design the antennas." <br>
        Nondescript <br>
        To the naked eye, the DLM antenna looks unremarkable, said
        Vincent, who jokes that you could put a flag on his antennas and
        they would look like flagpoles. But under the skin are four main
        sections to the antenna (from bottom to top): an inductive
        helix, a capacitive midsection, an inductive load coil and a
        capacitive top section. The different lengths of the mid- and
        top sections give them different resonant frequencies, which,
        together with the exact values of inductance and capacitance,
        define the antennas design specifications for any desired
        frequency. </p>
      <p>"The technology is completely scalable: Take the component
        values and divide them by two, and you get twice the frequency;
        take all the component values and multiply them by two, and you
        are at half the frequency," said Vincent. "There are two poles
        in the antenna, and where I place the poles in relation to one
        another-how much I bring the two resonant frequencies together
        or spread them apart-enables me to emulate different antennas,
        from a quarter-wave to a five-eighths wave." </p>
      <p>Vincent said no existing modeling software could adequately
        model his antenna design. So he rolled his own simulation with
        Mathcad, making use of some of Mathcad's filter design
        algorithms for the inductive/capacitive-canceling effect. </p>
      <p>"Eight years ago, antenna design was 90 percent black magic and
        10 percent theory," said Vincent. "But now, with my design, they
        are 10 percent black magic and 90 percent theory." </p>
      <p>The antennas are also well-behaved, with wide bandwidth and
        easy to connect to standard equipment, according to Vincent. For
        instance, they can directly connect to standard 50-ohm antenna
        inputs without any adapters. </p>
      <p>"All I have to do is tap the helix at its base, and you get a
        perfect 50-ohm match with out any lossy networks [as are
        required for other advanced antenna designs]," said Vincent. </p>
      <p>For the future, Vincent is moving up into the GHz bands for use
        with cell phones and radio-frequency ID equipment. A problem in
        the past has been that as components are downsized, they become
        too small to utilize standard antenna materials. At 1 GHz, for
        example, the helix is only eight-thousandths of an inch in
        diameter and requires more than 100 turns of wire. </p>
      <p>"So I came up with a new way of developing a helix for high
        frequencies that is a fully planar design; it's a
        two-dimensional helix," said Vincent. </p>
      <p>With the new helix design, Vincent has built a prototype 7-GHz
        antenna that he claims is indistinguishable from a quarter-wave
        antenna in all but its size. "Because the new design is
        completely planar, we could crank these out using thin-film
        technologies," Vincent said. </p>
      <p>Vincent received the 2004 Outstanding Intellectual Property
        Award from the University of Rhode Island's Research Office,
        joint applicant for the patent. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Newswise — The news last June that Rob Vincent, an employee in
        the Physics Department at the University of Rhode Island, had
        shrunk the antenna size without shrinking its effectiveness,
        produced a large group of Doubting Thomases worldwide. Prove it,
        they demanded. </p>
      <p>Vincent and URI, with the help of the Naval Undersea Warfare
        Center and its antenna test range on Fishers Island, N. Y., have
        done just that. </p>
      <p>On March 31, 14 versions of Vincent’s Distributed Load Monopole
        (DLM) antennas were put through a battery of validation tests.
        The results exceeded Vincent’s and URI’s expectations. Smaller
        is better. </p>
      <p>The Navy center responds to a wide variety of military and
        commercial requests for testing antennas at its Fishers Island
        over water range, the only such range of its kind in the world.
        Water provides a better path for transmission and reception than
        land. The site is located on a low-lying, remote coastal area,
        free of local interference. </p>
      <p>The Fishers Island range is a far-field ground wave antenna
        test range capable of measuring the performance of antennas
        ranging in frequency from 2 to 30 megahertz. Gain measurements
        are done relative to an ideal quarter wave monopole antenna. The
        URI antennas were tested using the same methods and
        instrumentation as those used to test and certify Navy antenna
        systems. </p>
      <p>Industry regards such testing as dependable as science permits
        and often includes the center’s data with products to assure
        customers of its performance specifications. </p>
      <p>Vincent’s Plano Spiral Top Hat antenna at 7 megahertz is half
        the size of a normal quarter-wave antenna operating at that
        frequency. The URI antenna gain matched the performance of the
        ideal quarter-wave antenna, and its bandwidth was nearly twice
        as wide. This type of antenna has multiple uses, including
        military, marine, amateur radio communications and AM
        broadcasting. <br>
        In addition, the gain of Vincent’s capacity Top Hat DLM antenna,
        which incorporates a helix, a load coil, a capacitive top hat
        utilizing radial spokes at the top of the antenna and a
        horizontal plane was nearly identical to the ideal quarter wave
        antenna. Its bandwidth was greater than 5 percent of the
        operating frequency and the antenna is more than 70 percent
        shorter than an ideal quarter wave antenna. </p>
      <p>Vincent’s standard DLM antennas with a standard helix and load
        coil were also tested at various frequencies. All exhibited
        gains nearly equal to the ideal antenna with bandwidths of 3 to
        10 percent. The antennas were 33 to 40 percent shorter. </p>
      <p>More than 200 businesses, companies, and government agencies
        have contacted URI seeking information for automotive, marine,
        and military applications, among others, since the antenna
        announcement last year. A patent is pending on Vincent's
        technology. The inventor has made the University of Rhode Island
        and its Physics Department partners that will benefit from any
        revenue his invention earns. </p>
      <p>URI is close to securing several license agreements. In
        addition, prototypes have been developed for numerous
        applications. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Antenna Technology Shrinks Size, Not
              Effectiveness</font></b> </p>
        <p>by </p>
        <p><b>Ralph Raiola</b></p>

      <p>Tests at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center's antenna test range
        have shown that a new antenna technology, dubbed Distributed
        Load Monopole (DLM), can shrink antenna sizes without loss of
        performance. Developed last year by Rob Vincent, a technician in
        the University of Rhode Island's physics department, the
        technology could produce chip-mountable cell-phone antennas that
        can be applied to WLAN applications, and promises to at least
        double the range of walkie-talkies used by police, fire, and
        other municipal personnel. </p>
      <p>The DLM antenna technology promises antennas up to 70% shorter
        than an ideal quarter-wave antenna. </p>
      <p>Several versions have been developed, including the Plano
        Spiral Top Hat, a 7-MHz version that is half the size of normal
        quarter-wave devices operating at that frequency. The device's
        gain matched the performance of the ideal quarter-wave antenna,
        and its bandwidth was nearly twice as wide. </p>
      <p>The Top Hat DLM antenna incorporates a helix, load coil, and
        capacitive top hat using radial spokes at the top. More than 70%
        shorter than an ideal quarter-wave antenna, its bandwidth is
        greater than 5% of the operating frequency. </p>
      <p>Standard versions featuring a standard helix and load coil were
        also tested at various frequencies, all exhibiting gains nearly
        equal to the ideal antenna with bandwidths of 3% to 10%. The
        antennas were 33% to 40% shorter. </p>
      <p>The technology is also being focused toward applications such
        as naval ships, baby monitors, RFID, and portable antennas for
        military equipment. The university is close to securing several
        license agreements and prototypes have been developed for
        numerous applications. For more information, call Rob Vincent of

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention generally relates to antennas, and
        relates in particular to antenna systems that include one or
        more monopole antennas. </p>
      <p>Monopole antennas typically include a single pole that may
        include additional elements with the pole. Non-monopole antennas
        generally include antenna structures that form two or three
        dimensional shapes such as diamonds, squares, circles etc. </p>
      <p>As wireless communication systems (such as wireless telephones
        and wireless networks) become more ubiquitous, the need for
        smaller and more efficient antennas such as monopole antennas
        (both large and small) increases. Many monopole antennas operate
        at very low efficiency yet provide satisfactory results. In
        order to meet the demand for smaller and more efficient
        antennas, the efficiency of such antennas must improve. </p>
      <p>There is a need, therefore, for more efficient and cost
        effective implementation of a monopole antenna, as well as other
        types of antennas and antenna systems. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>In accordance with an embodiment, the invention provides a
        distributed loaded antenna system including a monopole antenna.
        The antenna system includes a radiation resistance unit coupled
        to a transmitter base, a current enhancing unit for enhancing
        current through the radiation resistance unit, and a conductive
        mid-section intermediate the radiation resistance unit and the
        current enhancing unit. The conductive mid-section has a length
        that provides that a sufficient average current is provided over
        the length of the antenna. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>A distributed loaded monopole antenna in accordance with an
        embodiment of the invention includes a radiation resistance unit
        for providing significant radiation resistance, and a current
        enhancing unit for enhancing the current through the radiation
        enhancing unit. In certain embodiments, the radiation resistance
        unit may include a coil in the shape of a helix, and the current
        enhancing unit may include load coil and/or a top unit formed as
        a coil or hub and spoke arrangement. The radiation resistance
        unit is positioned between the current enhancing unit and a base
        (e.g., ground), and may, for example, be separated from the
        current enhancing unit by a distance of
        2.5316.times.10.sup.-2.lamda. of the operating frequency of the
        antenna to provide a desired current distribution over the
        length of the antenna. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 1, an electrical schematic diagram of an
        antenna 10 in accordance with an embodiment of the invention
        includes a radiation resistance unit 12 and a current enhancing
        unit 14. The radiation resistance unit 12 (such as, for example,
        a helix) may be formed in a variety of shapes, including but not
        limited to round, rectangular, flat and triangular. The
        radiation resistance unit 12 may be wound with wire, copper
        braid or copper strap or other conductive material around the
        form and is such that it's length is very much longer than it's
        width or diameter. </p>
      <p>The current enhancing unit 14 may also be formed of a variety
        of conductive materials and may be formed in a variety of
        shapes. The unit 14 is positioned above the unit 12 and is
        separated a distance above the unit 12 and supported by a
        mid-section 16 (e.g., aluminum tubing). The current enhancing
        unit 14 when placed a distance above the radiation resistance
        unit 12 performs several important functions. These functions
        include raising the radiation resistance of the helix and the
        overall antenna. </p>
      <p>The above antenna provides continuous electrical continuity
        from the base of the helix to the top of the antenna. The base
        of the antenna is grounded as shown at 18, and the signal to be
        transmitted may be provided at any point along the radiation
        resistance unit 12 (e.g., near but not at the bottom of the unit
        12). The signal may also be optionally passed through a
        capacitor 22 in certain embodiments to tune out excessive
        inductive reactance as discussed further below. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows an implementation of the above antenna system in
        which the radiation resistance unit is formed as a helix 30, and
        the current enhancing unit is formed as a load coil 32. The
        helix 30 is formed as a conductive coil that is wrapped around a
        non-conductive cylinder wherein the coil windings are mutually
        spaced from one another by a distance of approximately the
        thickness of the coil. The bottom of the helix coil is connected
        to ground as shown at 34, and the top of the helix coil is
        connected to a conductive mid-section 36 between the helix 30
        and the load coil 32. The load coil is formed as a tightly
        wrapped spiral, the base of which is connected to the
        mid-section 36 and the top of which is connected to a
        top-section 38. The mid-section 36 may separate the helix 30 and
        load coil 32 by a distance as indicated at A. The signal to be
        transmitted is coupled to the antenna by a coaxial cable 40
        whose signal conductor is coupled to one of the lower helix coil
        windings near the base as shown at 42, and whose outer ground
        conductor is coupled to ground as shown. </p>
      <p>The choice of the distance A of the load coil above the helix
        impacts the average current distribution along the length of the
        antenna. As shown in FIG. 3, the average current distribution
        over the length of the antenna varies as a function of the
        mid-section distance for a 7 MHz distributed loaded monopole
        antenna. The mid-section distance is shown along the horizontal
        axis in inches, and the percent of average current over the
        antenna length is shown along the vertical axis. The
        relationship between the mid-section distance and the percent of
        average current is shown at 50 for this antenna. The current
        distribution for this antenna peaks at about 42 inches as shown
        at 52. The conductive mid-section has a length that provides
        that a sufficient average current is provided over the length of
        the antenna and provides for increasing radiation resistance to
        that of 2 to nearly 3 times greater than a 1/4.lamda. antenna
        (i.e., from for example, 36.5 Ohms to about 72 100 Ohms or
        more). </p>
      <p>The inductance of the load coil should be larger than the
        inductance of the helix. For example, the ratio of load coil
        inductance to helix inductance may be in the range of about 1.1
        to about 2.0, and may preferably by about 1.4 to about 1.7. In
        addition to providing an improvement in radiation efficiency of
        a helix and the antenna as a whole, placing the load coil above
        the helix for any given location improves the bandwidth of the
        antenna as well as improving the radiation current profile. The
        helix and load coil combination are responsible for decreasing
        the size of the antenna while improving the efficiency and
        bandwidth of the overall antenna. </p>
      <p>In further embodiments, a top unit 60 may also be provided that
        includes eight conductive spokes 62 that extend from a
        conductive hub 64 as shown in FIG. 4. The spokes 62 may be held
        within small holes by set screws through which they are
        electrically connected to the conductive top-section 38 of the
        antenna. As shown in FIG. 5, the top unit 60 may be placed atop
        an antenna such as the antenna shown in FIG. 2. This may further
        reduce the inductive loading of the helix and load coil to allow
        even wider bandwidth and greater efficiency. The top unit is
        included as part of the current enhancing unit. In further
        embodiments, the top unit may be used in place of the load coil
        as the current enhancing unit. </p>
      <p>A current profile for a 12 foot antenna employing a helix and
        load coil (starting at 7.5 feet) was found to show 100 percent
        current up to an elevation of about 7 feet, while a similar 9.5
        foot antenna using an additional top unit was found to show 100
        percent current up to an elevation of about 8 feet. The
        structure provides electrical continuity from the base of the
        helix to the top of the top section. The top unit may, in
        further embodiments, include a planar spiral winding that
        extends radially from, and in a transverse direction with
        respect to, the antenna as discussed below in connection with
        FIG. 6. </p>
      <p>There is an electrical connection from the bottom of the helix
        up through the helix and through the midsection and continues
        through the load coil to the top section. The helix at the
        bottom has provisions for tapping the turns of the helix. This
        allows connection from a source of radio frequency energy and
        proper matching by selecting the appropriate tap to facilitate
        maximum power transfer from the radio frequency source to the
        antenna. The placement of the load coil provides linear phase
        and amplitude responses through the bandwidth of the antenna and
        even beyond the normally usable bandwidth of the antenna. It has
        also been found that such an antenna has no harmonic response,
        and that its response is similar to that of a low Q band pass
        filter. </p>
      <p>The antenna shown in FIG. 2 may be mounted by clamping the base
        of the helix to a mounting pole that has been driven into the
        ground. Clamps may be used to affix the antenna sufficiently to
        the ground mounting post. In this embodiment the antenna is
        shown grounded to earth through a grounding rod, ground wire and
        connected to the base of the antenna and electrically connected
        using a ground clamp. Radial wires extending above ground or
        buried in the ground are electrically connected to the antenna
        using the ground wire and the ground rod and extend out from the
        antenna base for a uniform distance but not limited to any
        specific length. This grounding system comprised of a ground rod
        and radial wires may also take on many forms such as a large
        piece of copper or other conductor screen of any given geometric
        shape. This grounding system may also take on the form of a
        metal plane such as a ship, automobile, or a metal roof of a
        building among others. The antenna may also be elevated above
        ground on a conductive post with radial wires extended as guy
        wires to support and keep antenna in the upward erect position.
        These guy wires serve as an elevated ground poise or radial
        system. </p>
      <p>The feed for the antenna from a radio frequency source is
        tapped a few turns from the base of the helix driven by a radio
        frequency source and connected by a coax cable. The shield of
        the coax cable is connected to the base of the helix which is
        grounded to the ground rod. The radio frequency source is used
        to excite the antenna and cause a radio frequency current to
        flow which causes the distributed loaded monopole antenna to
        radiate. </p>
      <p>As indicated above, the design of the helix and interaction of
        the load coil are such that the antenna exhibits a large and
        uniform current distribution for various lengths along the
        antenna. The length and uniformity of this current profile is
        dependent upon the ratios of inductance between the load coil
        and the helix as well as location of placement of the load coil
        above the helix. In addition, the placement of the load coil
        allows larger than normal bandwidth measured as deviation from
        resonant frequency either side of resonance in which sufficient
        match between the source of radio frequency energy and the
        antenna can be maintained to allow the antenna to radiate with
        reasonable efficiency. In addition, the interaction of the helix
        and load coil allows reduction of the physical height of the
        overall antenna without reducing electrical height and provides
        for an increase in radiation resistance. This increase in
        radiation resistance reduces the effect of losses associated
        with short antennas. These losses include resistance in the
        wires of the helix and load coil and Ohmic resistance of the
        antenna conductors and that of the ground system. All or any of
        these has a pronounced effect on antenna radiating efficiency,
        reduction of antenna bandwidth and overall performance in
        shortened antennas. The design of the distributed loaded
        monopole antenna with a helix and load coil above the helix
        overcomes those losses and provides a high level of radiating
        efficiency with excellent bandwidth in a small compact easily
        implemented antenna. </p>
      <p>The physical structure of an antenna and the interaction of the
        components as described above allow for maximum use of
        distributed capacity along the antenna to ground to reduce
        inductive loading required to resonate the antenna to a given
        desired radio frequency. This increases efficiency, raises
        radiation resistance and improves bandwidth. This also allows
        the antenna to have amplitude and phase response through
        resonance that resembles a universal resonance response curve
        with linear deviations in amplitude and phase for bandwidths far
        exceeding the normal half power bandwidth of the antenna. </p>
      <p>The antenna of FIG. 5 may be formed as follows. A helix is
        formed by wrapping a conductive material around a tubular
        non-conductive form, such as fiberglass, PVC or other suitable
        tubular insulator. In further embodiments, any form may be used
        such as those that are also square, rectangle or triangular in
        cross section. Attached to the top of the helix is a top fitting
        that is formed of a conductive material such as aluminum or
        other suitable conductive material. In this embodiment these are
        machined but can also be cast from aluminum or other suitable
        conductive material. Slots are cut in the top fitting to allow
        clamping on to a aluminum tubing of such diameter that they form
        a tight mechanical fit when such tubing is inserted. This
        fitting is inserted into the helix tube and in this embodiment
        is epoxy bonded together with the helix and fitting. It may also
        be fastened with machine screws provided the helix form is
        drilled and the fitting has been drilled and threaded. Likewise
        a bottom helix fitting is machined or cast of aluminum or other
        conductive material is attached to bottom of helix. This fitting
        is solid aluminum and has mounting rod. A helix insertion rod
        has been epoxy bonded to the helix form. The main section forms
        a conductive mounting point for this lug and helix winding. A
        helix winding is attached at the base fitting with a solder lug
        or other conductive connecting material and fastened
        electrically and mechanically to the helix end fitting with a
        machine screw. The helix is wound with copper strap but not
        limited to this material but can be wire or copper braid wound
        in a circular manner over the entire length of the helix form
        and attached to the helix top fitting using, for example, a
        solder lug. Other conductive connecting devices may be used to
        allow electrical and mechanical assembly with a machine screw
        into the drilled and threaded hole. The helix at the bottom has
        machine nuts or similar connecting devices soldered to the
        winding for attachment of the center conductor of a coax cable.
      </p>
      <p>Inserted into the top of the helix fitting is a tubing that is
        held rigidly in the helix top fitting using a clamp. The load
        coil includes a section of fiberglass tubing that is attached
        with end fittings that are epoxy bonded to form a strong
        mechanical connection with both the mid-section and the
        top-section. The load coil end fittings are machined or cast
        aluminum. Each of these fittings is slotted and formed, or
        machined to accept mid-section tubing or top section tubing,
        which are electrically connected to the load coil itself. The
        load coil form is wound with heavy copper wire but may be any
        other heavy conductive material that is closely wound as shown
        to form a solenoid. Each end is connected to the load coil end
        fitting with a lug on each end, and attached electrically and
        mechanically with machine screws that are screwed into holes
        that have been drilled and threaded into load coil end fittings.
        Two pieces of tubing form the top section. The lower tube
        section at the top has been slotted to allow the upper tubing
        section to be inserted in a telescoping manner into tubing
        section to permit adjustment of the overall top section length
        to tune the antenna. Once adjusted, the tubing sections are
        secured with a clamp to form a rigid mechanical and electrical
        connection. There is now an electrical connection from the
        bottom of the helix winding from the helix bottom fitting to the
        top of the top section. </p>
      <p>The completed distributed loaded monopole antenna consisting of
        the helix 30, the mid-section 36, the load coil 32 and the top
        section 38 is shown in FIG. 5 mounted on a ground mounting pipe
        of conductive material using clamps. The coax cable with a
        center conductor is shown connected to one of the tap points at
        bottom of helix. The coax shield is electrically connected to
        the helix base fitting with an electrical clamp. The ground wire
        34 is connected to the electrical clamp (and therefore to the
        ground base of helix) and to a ground rod 44 in the ground.
        Attached to the ground rod 44 and ground wire are radials 46
        that are either buried or lying on the ground. The radials 46
        may be of sufficient length and number to provide an adequate
        counterpoise for operation of the distributed loaded monopole
        antenna. </p>
      <p>The hub 64 of the hub and spoke top unit 60 shown in FIG. 4 may
        be fabricated from an aluminum disk of sufficient size to
        accommodate the eight radial aluminum conductors or spokes 62.
        To use the top unit 60, the normal antenna design inductance for
        the helix and load coil must be decreased by 1/2 in order to
        resonate the antenna to the same frequency. The overall antenna
        height decreases by about 25%. The bandwidth of the antenna
        increases by a factor of 2.5 times or more over that of a normal
        design. In addition the antenna increases in efficiency by more
        than 10% as compared to a normal distributed loaded monopole
        design. </p>
      <p>The top unit hub 64 is drilled with eight holes spaced every 45
        degrees around the circumference of sufficient diameter and
        depth to accept the conductive radial spokes 62. Eight holes are
        also drilled in the top of the hub along the outer rim and are
        aligned over the eight holes previously drilled and are threaded
        to accept set screws that secure the radial conductive spokes
        62. All the spokes 62 are of the same length and of sufficient
        diameter and strength to be self-supporting extending
        horizontally out from the hub as shown in FIG. 5. The complete
        top unit with hub and spokes is slipped over the top section of
        the distributed loaded monopole antenna and horizontally extends
        in all directions as shown in FIG. 5. The antenna is tuned by
        decreasing or extending the height of the top unit above the
        load coil of the antenna. The top unit is provided to maximize
        and make uniform the current profile of the antenna from the
        base to as high along the antenna length as possible while
        providing improved bandwidth and efficiency. </p>
      <p>In other embodiments, the top unit 70 may include a
        non-conductive hub 72 with eight non-conductive rods 74
        extending from the center-insulated hub 72 as shown in FIG. 6.
        These rods may be formed of an insulating material that may be
        used for radio frequencies. The top section extends through the
        hub 72 and is then connected to a large conductor or wire 76 at
        a first end 78 of the wire. The other end 80 of the wire is not
        electrically connected to any conductive material. This wire 76
        is wound in a spiral form from the center in an increasing
        diameter. This forms a large spiral conductor at the very top of
        the antenna as well as provides capacitive loading. The function
        of this configuration is to maximize and make uniform the
        current profile from the base of the antenna extending all the
        way to the top of the antenna. </p>
      <p>When using the top unit 70 with a load coil and helix of the
        antenna shown in FIG. 2, the inductance for the helix and the
        load coil must be reduced by about 1/2(50%). This will allow the
        antenna to resonate at the same frequency. </p>
      <p>For the combined capacitive top unit and load coil of FIG. 5,
        the load coil and helix inductance is also reduced by about 50%.
        The overall antenna height decreases by about 25% for the
        capacitive top unit antenna and for the combined load inductor
        and top unit combination the antenna height remains the same or
        in some cases may be slightly larger. </p>
      <p>In further embodiments, the bandwidth of the antenna may be
        enhanced by including an additional coiled wire 82 in a top unit
        as also shown in FIG. 6. The additional wire 82 includes first
        and second ends 84 and 86 that are each not electrically
        connected to any conductive material. It has been found that
        interlacing a false winding into a current enhancing unit (such
        as the top unit winding shown in FIG. 6) or a radiation
        resistance unit (such as a helix as shown in FIG. 7) enhances
        the bandwidth of the top unit as well as improves the current
        profile along the antenna. The interlaced false winding has
        little effect on the resonant frequency of the antenna system. </p>
      <p>Similarly, a false winding may be provided in a helix of an
        antenna in accordance with an embodiment of the invention as
        shown in FIG. 7 to enhance the bandwidth of the helix. In this
        embodiment, a radiation resistance unit 90 includes a helix
        winding 92 that is wound around a non-conductive tube and
        electrically connected at each end to electrical couplings. An
        additional winding 94 is interlaced within the helix winding but
        is not connected electrically to any point within the helix or
        at the ends of the winding 94. The winding 94 is merely
        suspended within the helix winding 92 as shown in FIG. 7. This
        false winding 94 has been found to enhance the bandwidth of an
        antenna by as much as 100% (i.e., doubling it). The effect of
        this false winding is to reduce the capacitance between helix
        and load coil windings, which has been found to be a bandwidth
        limiting mechanism in helix coils and load coils. </p>
      <p>In further embodiments, the resonance of an antenna of the
        invention that includes a helix may be changed by adding to or
        removing from the helix, a turn of winding turns of the helix to
        change coil inductance. This may be accomplished by employing a
        coil adjustment unit such as units 100 or 110 as shown in FIGS.
        8 and 11 respectively. The coil adjustment unit 100 shown in
        FIG. 8 includes an electrically conductive slotted tubing 102
        (shown in FIG. 9) that is received within the tubing of the
        helix, i.e., the tubing around which the helix coil (not shown)
        is wrapped. An electrically conductive tapered sleeve 104 is
        then inserted within the tubing 102. The slotted tubing 102 may
        be made from aluminum or any other non-ferrous conductive
        material. The slot 106 in the tubing 102 is cut lengthwise as
        shown and may be any convenient width but not greater than 1/6
        of the tubing circumference. The top of this tubing should have
        slots cut to allow a clamp to securely fasten telescoping tubing
        to be inserted into tubing (102). The total length of this
        tubing should be such that the portion slotted will fit into the
        helix tubing and locked into the helix top fitting clamp
        assembly using a clamp as discussed above. </p>
      <p>A portion of the tubing 102 should also protrude from the helix
        for the additional non-ferrous sleeve 104 to easily slide inside
        and be secured using a clamp. This sleeve 104 is cut lengthwise
        as shown to create a long angled section 108. This sleeve 104
        when fitted into the slotted tubing 102 provides variations in
        opening or closing the slot responsive to turning the sleeve 104
        with respect to the tubing 102. This permits eddy currents to
        circulate within this tubing combination where the slot has been
        closed by the twisting action of tubing. The effect of the
        slotted tubing when the slot is open is minimal on the helix
        inductance. When the slot is filled or closed by the rotation of
        the sleeve 104, eddy currents will be allowed to flow and
        electrically short out turns of the helix therefore allowing
        variations of the helix inductance. This same technique may be
        used for solenoid coils of any length thereby allowing
        adjustment of the inductance. The number of windings and/or the
        length of a load coil may also be adjusted using such an
        adjustment unit. </p>
      <p>Similarly, the coil adjustment unit 110 shown in FIG. 11
        includes an electrically conductive slotted tubing 112 having a
        slot 114, and a conductive sleeve 116. In this case the sleeve
        116 does not include a tapered edge, and the unit 110 is
        adjusted by varying the distance to which the sleeve 116 is
        inserted within the slotted tubing 112. In both cases, once the
        adjustment has been made to satisfaction the adjusting tubing is
        clamped securely. </p>
      <p>In addition to these embodiments, the distributed loaded
        monopole antenna may take on other forms. These include reducing
        the height of the antenna and inductance of the helix and load
        coil, and affixing at the top of the top section a horizontal
        series of electrical conductors extending out from the center in
        the form of spokes for a given distance. These conductors may be
        any arbitrary number and are arranged as spokes from a hub as
        discussed above. In accordance with further embodiments, a plain
        sheet of metal or conductive screen may also be used. Other such
        embodiments may also be employed where they provide for a large
        capacitance from the top of the antenna to ground. This
        capacitance provides for further uniform distribution of current
        for an even greater distance along the antenna height or length.
        This further allows for wider bandwidth operation and higher
        efficiency. </p>
      <p>Further embodiments provide that a helix may be constructed as
        a lattice network of wider width than thickness as discussed
        below with reference to FIGS. 14 17. This embodiment may take on
        the form of a latticework constructed of insulating material
        that is adequately braced along its height or length. The ends
        of the latticework consist of fabricated aluminum pieces so
        shaped to support the lattice structure at each end. Winding
        suitable conductors as described above around the structure from
        the base to the top forms a helix. The winding is such that the
        number of turns per unit length is higher at the bottom than at
        the top. The top of this helix winding is electrically
        terminated to the conductive lattice termination. These aluminum
        pieces or suitable conductors provide for affixing additional
        conductors in the form of tubing, rod or pipe. In this manner,
        the antenna may be extended in length or height and provide for
        electrical connection of the helix winding. This extends the
        electrical connection from ground up through the helix to the
        top of the antenna through the load coil. The aluminum or any
        conductive material at the top of the helix structure allows for
        terminating the helix winding and provides electrical connection
        to the above mentioned upper structures of the antenna. These
        upper structures include a mid-section as discussed above. A
        load coil of any of a variety of geometric shapes may also be
        employed as further discussed below. To allow connection and
        proper matching between a radio frequency source and the antenna
        this above-described helix provision is allowed for tapping the
        helix conductor anywhere along its length from the bottom of the
        antenna. The rectangular helix geometry and various load coil
        geometry allow further reduction of required loading in the form
        of inductance and enhance further the distributed loading affect
        of capacity along the length of the antenna to ground. This
        allows even further improved bandwidth and radiation efficiency.
        This embodiment may also be used with variations in load coil
        inductance and helix length and helix inductance, together with
        a series capacitor match between helix tap and the source of
        radio frequency energy. These variations allow equivalent
        performance to a conventional antenna as much as 9 times larger
        in size. </p>
      <p>Current profiles have been developed for various such
        embodiments of 1/2 wave and 5/8 wave distributed loaded monopole
        antennas. The manipulation of helix length and inductance as
        well as the ratio of load coil to helix inductance may achieve a
        wide variety of suitable antennas. </p>
      <p>In addition to the above embodiments, providing a remotely
        controlled top section length may yield a distributed loaded
        monopole antenna that is continuously tunable over a large
        frequency range. This may be achieved utilizing a motor driven
        worm gear or any other method of varying remotely the adjustment
        of the top section length. Similarly the antenna may be tuned by
        varying the helix inductance. This may be accomplished by
        varying the electrical length of the helix but without changing
        the mid-section length between the helix top and load coil. </p>
      <p>In particular, an antenna in accordance with further
        embodiments may include a radiation resistance unit 120 having a
        non-electrically conductive structure 122 around which is
        wrapped a conductive material 124 in the form of a helix as
        shown in FIG. 14. The structure 122 may be provided by four
        elongated edge elements 126 that are each connected to internal
        non-conductive bridges 128. The end portions 130, 132 are
        conductive and are electrically connected to each of the ends
        134, 136 respectively of the conductive material 124. Each of
        the bridge portions 128 includes a central hole through which a
        non-conductive tube may pass, and the conductive end portions
        130, 132 also include such an opening as well as a clamp for
        attaching the unit 120 to the conductive mid-section of an
        antenna at the upper end of the unit 120 and to ground at the
        lower end of the unit 120. The mid-section may further include a
        reinforcing fiberglass rod. </p>
      <p>The conductive material 124 may be any suitable conductor such
        as copper strips (that are thin in depth and wide in width) or
        copper braid, wire or similar material. The bottom of the
        winding is fastened and electrically connected to the aluminum
        or similar conductive bottom plate. The end of the helix winding
        material is fastened using suitable wire connecting lug or
        conductive strip and soldered to provide a low loss electrical
        connection. The lug or connecting strip is fastened with a
        machine screw to a hole drilled into bottom plate which has been
        threaded to accept a machine screw. This provides a secured
        electrical connection. A similar fastener may be used to connect
        the top end of the helix winding to the helix top plate. </p>
      <p>The antenna shown in FIG. 16 may provide near 1/2 wave vertical
        antenna performance. The mid-section may be lengthened or
        shortened as discussed above to tune the resonance of the
        antenna. Similarly, the antenna shown in FIG. 17 may provide
        improved performance with additional bandwidth, The current
        enhancing unit 140 of FIG. 17 may be formed using a conductive
        planosprial coil 142 that is sandwiched between two
        non-conductive discs 144 and mounted to a non-conductive tube
        section 146 as shown in FIGS. 15A, 15B and 15C. The ends of the
        coil 142 are passed through two openings 148 and 150 in the
        inner disc and connected to the conductive mid-section and
        top-section of the antenna. Adjustment of the length of the
        top-section (as discussed above) may further be used to tune the
        antenna to resonance. In either antenna, various ratios of load
        coil to helix inductance may permit various performance levels
        of the antenna to be optimized. </p>
      <p>When a flat antenna is designed for resonance much lower than
        normal, it will give 5/8 wave performance. The embodiment shown
        in FIG. 14 uses the flat helix but this helix is a little longer
        by about 10%. This allows a slightly higher inductance in the
        helix. </p>
      <p>The embodiment shown may be ground mounted as discussed above
        using a base mounting rod. Attached to this base mounting rod
        may be an enclosure housing a capacitor (e.g., 22 as shown in
        FIG. 1) and a standard coax receptacle. The center conductor of
        this coax receptacle is connected to one side of the series
        capacitor using a short wire. The coax shield is connected
        electrically through the enclosure box mounting plate and clamps
        to the base of the antenna, mounting post and the radial/ground
        system. The other side of the capacitor is connected to a feed
        through also using a short wire from the capacitor, and this
        short wire exits outside the box for connection of an additional
        wire that is used to tap the helix base a few turns from the
        bottom. Also connected to the base mounting rod is a grounding
        wire that is connected to a ground rod. The base mounting rod is
        a conductive material and is driven into the ground. This rod is
        securely connected to the helix base plate which is also
        conductive. This allows grounding the base of the helix and the
        beginning of helix winding to the ground using the ground wire
        and the ground rod. </p>
      <p>Radials are run on top of or in the ground by burying them
        under the surface. The radials are extended out from the base in
        a circular manner like the spokes extending from the hub of a
        wheel (similar to the hub and spoke structure of the top unit
        shown in FIG. 4). The radials are electrically connected to the
        base of the antenna through the ground rod and wire. This allows
        including the radials as part of the antenna ground system and
        serves as an electrical counterpoise. </p>
      <p>The antenna shown in FIG. 17 may be made for 1/4 wave
        performance using suitable values of helix and load coil,
        together with proper dimensions of the top and bottom sections.
        This provides extended bandwidth performance and improved
        efficiency. The antenna may utilize either load coil (32 or
        140), and the helix length is reduced slightly to permit the
        antenna to resonate just below the lower frequency of operation.
        In this antenna, there is no need for the capacitor coupling (22
        of FIG. 1) to tune out the added inductance. </p>
      <p>In further embodiments, antennas of the invention may be
        combined to form other antenna systems such as dipoles where two
        antennas are placed back to back and their helixes electrically
        connected at a mutual base. The method of connecting the radio
        frequency source is to tap the helix from the middle and extend
        to each side till a suitable match between source and load can
        be achieved. A balanced matching transformer or BALUN can be
        used to drive the feed point. In addition, the antenna may be
        arranged in vertical positions along the ground and formed into
        arrays of antenna elements providing directional transmission.
        Distributed loaded monopole elements combined into dipoles may
        be further combined to form horizontally or vertically polarized
        arrays such as yagis or phase driven arrays of any number of
        elements. Such elements may also be combined into loops
        providing directional characteristic with improved sensitivity
        compared to other loop forms. </p>
      <p>For example, as shown in FIG. 18 multiple antennas 150, 152,
        154 of different resonant frequencies resulting in different
        physical sizes may be used together to provide a multi-frequency
        system on a common, electrically conductive, mounting stage 156.
        An equivalent electrical schematic diagram of three such
        antennas sharing the common mounting stage is shown in FIG. 19.
        This mounting stage (which may be elevated from ground) may be
        any conductive surface such as a vehicle or a ship or a large
        metal sheet such as a roof of a building. When mounting in an
        elevated manner using a long pole such that the antennas and the
        mounting surface are some height above ground, the ground
        radials may be used to as a counterpoise as well to stabilize
        the structure. It is not required that any counterpoise or
        radial system be resonant </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 19, a single coaxial feed line 160 is used
        from the source of radio frequency excitation. All three
        antennas are connected to the coaxial feed in a parallel manner.
        The proper selection of antenna is provided by the series tuned
        circuits connecting to the proper tap point on each helix 162,
        164, 166. At the frequency of operation and resonance of the
        particular antennas selected the series resonant coupling
        circuits will be of sufficiently low impedance to couple the
        coaxial feed to the proper antenna. The series coupling elements
        not in use will be sufficiently de-coupled by virtue of their
        relatively high impedance. This configuration by virtue of this
        operation will provide efficient operation for each antenna to
        be automatically selected. </p>
      <p>Antennas used in accordance with further embodiments of the
        invention may provide a pair of distributed loaded monopole
        antennas as a half wave loop or two pairs may be used form a
        full wave loop. FIG. 20 shows two such antennas used as a half
        wave loop. A first antenna 170 includes a helix 172 and a load
        coil 174, and a second antenna 180 includes a helix 182 and a
        load coil 184. A variable capacitor may be coupled between the
        upper ends 176 and 186 of the antennas 170 and 180. The taps
        near the lower ends 178 and 188 of the antennas 170 and 180 may
        be coupled to a first balanced transformer winding while a
        second transformer winding is coupled to a coaxial connector
        port 190. In other embodiments, the end 192 of the one antenna
        170 may be coupled to the first conductor of the coaxial
        connector 190, while the second conductor of the coaxial
        connector is coupled to a tap near the lower end 188 of the
        antenna 180. </p>
      <p>During operation, the loop may be resonant at a higher
        operating frequency, and the loop may be tuned to resonance
        using the variable capacitor between the ends 176 and 186 of the
        antennas 170 and 180. If the loop is used for transmitting, the
        variable capacitor must be of sufficiently high voltage rating
        so as not to be broken down by the very large high radio
        frequency voltages generated across this capacitor. To implement
        the configuration or embodiment as shown, the midsections of
        each monopole element are bent into a 90-degree right angle. The
        bottoms of the helixes are joined using a conductive coupling.
        The entire loop is mounted on an insulated pole and may be
        rotated. The loop is feed with an unbalanced coax feed line and
        the transformer may be used to balance the loop. A virtual
        ground exists where the helix bases are joined. Because of this
        virtual ground the loop may be fed unbalanced while the coax
        shield is grounded at the helix joining point. To match the loop
        to the source in either case, it is only necessary to select the
        proper tap of the helix. </p>
      <p>Antennas in accordance with various embodiments of the
        invention may also be coupled as a distributed loaded dipole as
        shown at 200 in FIG. 21. The dipole antenna 200 includes two
        load coils 202 and 204 that are each mutually spaced from an
        intermediate (double length) helix 206, which is formed by
        joining two helixes together at their ends. Taps taken from
        either side near the center of the helix are coupled to either
        side of a first winding of a balanced transformer 208. The
        second winding of the transformer is coupled to each of the two
        conductors of a coaxial connector 210 as shown. The transformer
        may be mounted in an enclosure. Selection of the proper tap
        points from the middle to each side of the helix winding should
        provide a sufficient impedance match to the radio frequency
        source. The transformer enclosure may be mounted a short
        distance from the dipole antenna and connected with short wires
        as indicated. </p>
      <p>Antennas in accordance with further embodiments of the
        invention may include a current enhancing unit 210 and a
        radiation resistance unit 212 wherein the radiation resistance
        unit 212 is not formed as a helix or even a spiral that rotates
        about the longitudinal axis of the antenna, but rather as a
        planospiral that rotates about an axis that is orthogonal to the
        longitudinal axis of the antenna as shown in FIG. 22. The coil
        of the unit 212, therefore, is formed as a coil that extends
        back and forth along a length of the unit 212. The antenna may
        be driven by a transmission signal (as indicated at 214) by
        tapping onto a portion of the coil of the unit 212 near but not
        at the ground end of the coil in unit 212. </p>
      <p>For example, as shown in FIG. 23, the current enhancing unit
        may comprise a load coil 32 as discussed above with reference to
        FIG. 2. The radiation resistance unit 220, however, includes a
        coil 222 that extends from one end 224 (at ground) to a second
        end 226 by wrapping up and down the length of the unit 220 as
        shown in FIG. 23. The antenna includes four main parts similar
        to the antenna shown in FIG. 2. The current enhancing unit shown
        in FIG. 23 includes a central support element 228, the coil of
        wire 222, and coil wire stringers 230 and 232 at the top and
        bottom of the center support element. </p>
      <p>Inserted into the center support element (which consists of a
        1-inch square fiberglass pole) is an aluminum mounting rod 234
        and a mid-section attachment rod 236. The coil wires 222 are
        strung vertically along the support element 228 to form an
        elongated spiral loop. This loop is fastened to the mid-section
        236 using solder lugs and bolted to the mid-section attachment
        rod. The mid-section is attached by slipping this mid section
        tubing over the attachment rod and clamping them together using
        clamps. The lower part of the loop is attached to the aluminum
        mounting post 234 using wire lugs that arc screwed into the
        mounting post through the fiberglass main support holding the
        wire coil 222. The ground wire is clamped to the ground rod
        using a ground damp. In further embodiments, a false winding may
        also be added to the unit 220 as discussed above with reference
        to FIGS. 6 and 7. </p>
      <p>The performance of this antenna as shown in FIG. 2 at 7 MHz has
        been measured and it compared well with a 1/4 wave antenna. This
        full size antenna is 33 feet in height and this antenna with a
        plano spiral radiation resistance unit is 1/3 this size or
        approximately 11 feet in height. Both antennas were mounted on
        the same ground system and fed with the same power as measured
        at the base of each antenna. A driving power of 1 watt was used.
        Measured levels of radiating signal strength were so close to a
        1/4 wave measured signal strength that the two antennas appear
        to be equal in radiating performance. </p>
      <p>The current profile was measured using an indirect current
        sensor, and it compared well with a current profile for the
        antenna of FIG. 2 employing a three dimensional helix. The
        antenna of FIG. 23 appeared to provide uniform current
        distribution. </p>
      <p>One feature of the design of an antenna such as that shown in
        FIG. 2, is that normally an antenna of such a size as discussed
        above requires 25 .mu.H of combined helix and load coil
        inductance to resonate at 7 MHz. This also requires considerable
        lengths of wire (about 42 feet for the helix and 20 feet or so
        for the load coil). The planospiral design uses 10% less wire
        and is resonant at 7 MHz using 10% less inductance. The
        planospiral helix appears to make better use of distributed
        capacity loading to ground than does the standard DLM. This has
        also been noticed in the three dimensional flat board-like frame
        helix used with planospiral load coils. Due to better
        utilization of distributed loading techniques by the piano
        spiral antenna, it may achieve better efficiency and wider
        bandwidth especially when utilizing the false helix winding. The
        system of FIG. 23 also appears to provide excellent linearity of
        the amplitude and phase and the relative linear progression of
        reactive to non reactive changeover in the antenna through the
        bandwidth. </p>
      <p>Certain of the above distributed loaded monopole antennas
        utilizes a helix with a load coil to improve the radiated
        efficiency of the helix and antenna overall. The addition of the
        load coil raises the radiation resistance of the antenna,
        increases and makes uniform the current distribution along the
        antenna, and increases the useful bandwidth of the antenna.
        These structures, though practical and useful for many ranges of
        frequency applications (such as very low, low, medium, high and
        very high frequency systems), present practical limitations for
        ultra high frequency and microwave radio frequency applications.
        For example, a 1000 MHz system might require a helix that is
        eight thousandths of an inch in diameter and 0.3 inches in
        length of which upwards of 100 turns of very fine wire must be
        wound. </p>
      <p>Applicant has further discovered that a plano-spiral antenna
        may be created in accordance with a further embodiment of the
        invention that provides coils fabricated in two planes. In
        further embodiments, such an antenna may be scaled to provide
        operation at ultra high frequencies and microwave radio
        frequencies by providing a similarly planar load coil 240 and
        radiation resistance unit coil 242 on a printed circuit board as
        shown in FIG. 24. The coil 242 may also include a plurality of
        tap points 244 for easy matching to a standard feed line. The
        circuit provides a continuous conductive path through the pass
        through holes shown at 246 and 248 as is well known in the art.
        In further embodiments, fewer windings on the load coil 250 and
        radiation resistance coil 252 with taps 254 may be used as shown
        in FIG. 25, and the load coil 260 and radiation resistance coil
        262 with taps 264 may be formed in many difference shapes such
        as circular spirals as shown in FIG. 26. </p>
      <p>Such antennas may be suitable for applications such as radio
        frequency identification tags (RFID) at high frequencies. It is
        expected that these may be implemented on a silicon substrate of
        a very small scale, providing for example a 1/4 wave antenna up
        to or above 4.2 GHz. </p>
      <p>For example, the helix inductance for an antenna at 100 200 MHz
        may be 0.131 .mu.H or 131 nH, and the load coil inductance may
        be 0.211 or 211 nH. The helix to load coil ratio for inductance
        is 1.61. To be a true 1/4 wave distributed loaded monopole
        antenna the load coil to helix inductance ratio should be 1.4
        1.7. </p>
      <p>Another such antenna that is 1/2 the physical size was also
        measured, and the helix inductance for the antenna may be 0.088
        .mu.H or 88 nH, and the load coil inductance may be 0.135 or 135
        nH. The helix to load coil ratio for inductance is 1.56. This
        resulted in an antenna with a resonance around about 400 500 mH.
      </p>
      <p>Those skilled in the art will appreciate that numerous
        modifications and variations may be made to the above disclosed
        embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the
        invention. </p>
