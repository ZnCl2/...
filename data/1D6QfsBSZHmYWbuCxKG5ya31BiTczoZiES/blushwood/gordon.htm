        <b>Cancer 'cure' in Qld rainforest</b><br>
        <br>
        <div align="left"> CANCER patients are offering themselves as
          human guinea pigs as researchers investigate a possible cure
          for cancer that was found in north Queensland rainforests.<br>
          <br>
          Scientists have identified a compound in the fruit of the
          native blushwood shrub that appears to "liquefy and destroy
          cancer with no side-effects", according to latest research.<br>
          <br>
          Found deep in the remnants of a 130 million-year-old
          rainforest, the fruit extract may yet hold the secret antidote
          to Australia's No.1 killer disease.<br>
          <br>
          Victoria Gordon, of EcoBiotics, an Atherton Tableland-based
          company, said they hoped to go to human clinical trials later
          this year.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Gordon said a single dose injection of the extract, known
          as EBC-46, had been effective in 50 critically ill dogs and
          about a dozen cats and horses.<br>
          <br>
          "This is proving to be something exceptional," she said.<small>
          </small>"The tumour literally liquefies. There is a rapid
          knock-down of the tumour, it disintegrates within 24 hours and
          we have a rapid healing response. The biggest tumour we
          treated was the size of a Coke can in a dog, and that animal
          is fully healed and healthy."<br>
          <br>
          Dr Gordon said it had worked on skin cancers, such as
          carcinomas and melanomas, and bone cancer, and was a possible
          treatment for breast, colon and prostate cancer.<br>
          <br>
          But she warned wannabe human guinea pigs against seeking
          under-the-table treatment.<br>
          <br>
          She said it was "immoral, illegal, and unscientific" to seek
          to be administered the drug before approval, likely to take up
          to seven years, by the Therapeutic Goods Administration.<br>
          <br>
          "We have been inundated with calls – it shows there is such a
          need for a breakthrough in anti-cancer treatment," she said.
          "Most people understand when we explain the situation."<br>
          <br>
          Former breast cancer sufferer Mena Crew, 65, said many dying
          of cancer would "do anything for a miracle cure".<br>
          <br>
          "We would all like a magic cure, that would be wonderful, and
          I hope in my lifetime we find it," the breast cancer support
          volunteer said.<br>
          <br>
          She has worked with more than 200 sufferers and some victims
          in her role with the Cancer Council Queensland.<br>
          <br>
          "I don't want to kill the enthusiasm of all the wonderful
          research, but until it is proven it will do the job, we
          recommend they go with proven and conventional treatments,"
          she said.<br>
          <br>
          "It is good, however, to think the secret antidote may be
          growing in the jungle above Cairns."<br>

          <b>About QBiotics</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          QBiotics Limited is an Australian lifesciences company in the
          business of human and veterinary pharmceutical product
          development for the oncology and wound healing markets.&nbsp;
          QBiotics was established in 2004 and is a subsidiary of
          EcoBiotics.<br>
          <br>
          QBiotics current product portfolio consists of:<br>
          <br>
          1. The anticancer drug EBC-46<br>
          <br>
          EBC-46 is being developed for the intralesional treatment of
          solid tumours in both humans and companion animals.&nbsp;
          EBC-46 is a novel small molecule isolated from Blushwood, a
          native shrub found in the Australian tropical rainforest. To
          date, EBC-46 has been successful in the local treatment of a
          range of&nbsp; tumour types in horses, dogs and cats. Tumour
          destruction usually occurs within days with rapid healing of
          the site and no significant adverse effects when the drug is
          used at therapeutic doses.&nbsp; EBC-46 is currently at mid
          clinical development as a veterinary pharmaceutical and late
          preclinical development as a human pharmaceutical.<br>
          <br>
          2. The wound healing product WH-1 <br>
          <br>
          WH-1 is proving to have promising potential as a wound healing
          agent. Anecdotal evidence gained from ‘real world’ animal
          clinical case studies treating dogs in the veterinary
          environment supports the ability of WH-1 to stimulate rapid
          wound closure, reduction or elimination of infection with good
          cosmetic outcomes in the form of low rate of scarring. In
          addition, in vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of
          WH-1 to selectively stimulate the migration of ‘wound healing’
          cells to rapidly close the wound.&nbsp; WH-1 is currently in
          early preclinical development for both the human and
          veterianary markets.<br>

        <div align="left"><br>
          EBC-46 is a novel natural product small molecule with
          anticancer activity being developed as a local treatment for
          solid tumours in humans and companion animals (dogs, cats and
          horses).&nbsp; EBC-46 was discovered by applying the EcoLogic™
          approach to drug discovery from the tropical rainforests of
          Far North Queensland.&nbsp; EcoLogic™ was developed by
          QBiotics parent entity EcoBiotics.<br>
          <br>
          QBiotics plans to develop and register EBC-46 as a veterinary
          pharmaceutical for the treatment of solid tumours in dogs,
          cats and horses.&nbsp; To date, EBC-46 has been successful in
          the treatment of a diverse range of inoperable spontaneous
          solid tumours in dogs, cats and horses.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Incidence of cancer in animals</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          EBC-46 has the potential to revolutionise the treatment of
          many solid tumours in animals.<br>
          <br>
          Accurate data on the rates of cancer (either incidence of new
          cases or overall prevalence in the population) in companion
          animals are difficult to obtain due to the lack of formal
          registries which gather population-based health statistics
          (e.g. population sizes and breed structure, longevity,
          neutering patterns, mortality rates and causes, etc).<br>
          <br>
          Nonetheless, it is possible to make realistic estimates of the
          occurrence and epidemiology of different cancers in companion
          animals from survey data collected from university veterinary
          hospitals and large veterinary practices.<br>
          <br>
          EBC-46 is a new experimental drug for treating cancers in
          dogs, cats and horses.<br>
          <br>
          In treatment of over 100 dogs, cats and horses, intralesional
          injection of EBC-46 has successully ablated or significantly
          palliated a range of advanced, inoperable tumours (melanomas,
          sarcomas, carcinomas, mast cell tumours and sarcoids) while
          causing no significant long-term side effects. A topical
          formulation of EBC-46 has also been used to successfully treat
          ulcerative squamous cell carcinomas on cats and horses.<br>
          <br>
          EBC-46 is delivered locally in a single treatment by direct
          injection into tumours, or by topical application onto the
          tumour surface.<br>
          <br>
          EBC-46 is active against a wide range of tumour types and is
          potentially useful in treating any solid tumour that can be
          accessed for direct injection or topical application of the
          drug.<br>
          <br>
          EBC-46 only works locally at the site of delivery and there is
          no current evidence to suggest that EBC-46 has any systemic
          efficacy against metastatic disease in affecting remote
          secondary tumours.<br>
          Veterinary Trials<br>
          <br>
          QBiotics is currently conducting trials of EBC-46 for treating
          selected solid tumours in dogs and horses.&nbsp; Trials in
          cats will follow in the near future.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;
          trials are focusing on treatment of tumours that are
          accessible for, and amenable to, direct injection of the drug
          including cutaneous and subcutaneous tumours.&nbsp; EBC-46
          will become available through veterinarians following primary
          registration of the drug.<br>

          <b>An outstanding candidate for a human anti-cancer treatment</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          EBC-46 is a novel natural product small molecule with

          Far North Queensland.&nbsp; EcoLogic™ was developed by
          QBiotics parent entity EcoBiotics.<br>
          <br>
          QBiotics plans to develop EBC-46 as a human pharmaceutical to
          Clinical Phase II and then seek a development partner for
          final development and marketing of the drug.&nbsp; The
          principles behind the development of cancer in animals and
          humans are similar. Consequently, it is likely that EBC-46
          will have similar effects in human as in animals.<br>
          Potential indications for the drug include:<br>
          <br>
          <b>What is ebc46</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Skin cancers including melanomas, squamous cell carcinomas
          (SCC) &amp; basal cell carcinomas (BCC)<br>
          Head &amp; neck cancers<br>
          Breast cancers<br>
          Prostate cancers<br>
          Other tumours where injection can be guided by imaging<br>
          <br>
          Although only in late pre-clinical development for the human
          market, QBiotics has already demonstrated very compelling
          proof-of-concept of the drug's efficacy and safety both in
          cancer models in mice and in succussful treatment of advanced,
          spontaneous tumours in dogs, cats and horses that were
          considered untreatable with current standards of care. <br>

          The invention thus also relates to compounds in substantially
          pure isomeric form at one or more asymmetric centres e.g.,
          greater than about 90% ee, such as about 95% or 97% ee or
          greater than 99% ee, as well as mixtures, including racemic
          mixtures, thereof. Such isomers may be obtained by isolation
          from natural sources, by asymmetric synthesis, for example
          using chiral intermediates, or by chiral resolution. The
          compounds of the invention may exist as geometrical isomers.
          The invention also relates to compounds in substantially pure
          cis (Z) or trans E) forms or mixtures thereof.<br>
          <br>
          The compounds of the present invention may be obtained by
          isolation from a plant or plant part, or by derivatisation of
          the isolated compound, or by derivatisation of a related
          compound.<br>
          <br>
          Yet another aspect of the invention provides a method of
          isolating one or more compounds of formula (I) to formula
          (IV), which method includes the step of extracting said one or
          more compounds from a plant or plant part.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Preferably, the plant is of the genus Fontainea or
            Hylandia.</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Preferably the species is Fontainea pancheri, Fontainea
          australis, Fontainea borealis, Fontainea fugax, Fontainea
          oraria, Fontainea picrosperma, Fontainea rostrata, Fontainea
          subpapuana, Fontainea venosa or Hylandia dockrillii,
          especially Fontainea picrosperma, Fontainea venosa or Hylandia
          dockrillii.<br>
          <br>
          The parts of the plant may include fruit, seed, bark, leaf,
          flower, roots and wood.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably the extract is obtained from the seed, bark and/or
          flowers.<br>
          <br>
          For example, the biomass obtained from seeds, leaves, flowers
          and bark of the plant is subject to initial solvent
          extraction, for example with a polar solvent such as methanol.
          The initial extraction is then concentrated and diluted with
          water and subject to extraction with a second solvent, for
          example, ethyl acetate. The solvent samples from the second
          extraction are pooled and subject to separation by preparative
          HPLC fractionation. The fractions are analysed by analytical
          HPLC and pooled according to the retention time of compounds
          found in the samples. The pooled fractions are weighed,
          bioassayed and analysed by analytical HPLC. Further
          fractionation using one or more preparative HPLC is performed
          to isolate specific compounds. Each compound is bioassayed and
          its structure identified by UV, NMR and mass spectrometric
          techniques.<br>
          <br>
          Other compounds of the invention may be obtained by
          derivatising compounds isolated from plants or parts of
          plants, especially from the genus Fontainea, especially from
          the species Fontainea picrosperma, especially the seeds, bark
          and/or flowers of Fontainea picrosperma...<br>
          <br>
          A person skilled in the art would be able to determine
          suitable conditions for obtaining derivatives of isolated
          compounds, for example, by reference to texts relating to
          synthetic methodology, examples of which are Smith M. B. and
          March J., March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, Fifth Edition,
          John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., 2001 and Larock R. C.,
          Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers Ltd.,
          1989. Furthermore, selective manipulations of functional
          groups may require protection of other functional groups.
          Suitable protecting groups to prevent unwanted side reactions
          are provided in Green and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic
          Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., 3&lt;rd &gt;Edition,

          An "effective amount" means an amount necessary at least
          partly to attain the desired response, or to delay the onset
          or inhibit progression or halt altogether, the onset or
          progression of a particular condition being treated. The
          amount varies depending upon the health and physical condition
          of the individual to be treated, the taxonomic group of
          individual to be treated, the degree of protection desired,
          the formulation of the composition, the assessment of the
          medical situation, and other relevant factors. It is expected
          that the amount will fall in a relatively broad range that can
          be determined through routine trials. An effective amount in
          relation to a human patient, for example, may lie in the range
          of about 0.1 ng per kg of body weight to 1 g per kg of body
          weight per dosage. The dosage is preferably in the range of 1
          [mu]g to 1 g per kg of body weight per dosage, such as is in
          the range of 1 mg to 1 g per kg of body weight per dosage. In
          one embodiment, the dosage is in the range of 1 mg to 500 mg
          per kg of body weight per dosage. In another embodiment, the
          dosage is in the range of 1 mg to 250 mg per kg of body weight
          per dosage. In yet another embodiment, the dosage is in the
          range of 1 mg to 100 mg per kg of body weight per dosage, such
          as up to 50 mg per kg of body weight per dosage. In yet
          another embodiment, the dosage is in the range of 1 [mu]g to 1
          mg per kg of body weight per dosage. Dosage regimes may be
          adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For
          example, several divided doses may be administered daily,
          weekly, monthly or other suitable time intervals, or the dose
          may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies
          of the situation...<br>
          <br>
          Reference herein to "treatment" and "prophylaxis" is to be
          considered in its broadest context. The term "treatment" does
          not necessarily imply that a subject is treated until total
          recovery. Similarly, "prophylaxis" does not necessarily mean
          that the subject will not eventually contract a disease
          condition. Accordingly, treatment and prophylaxis include
          amelioration of the symptoms of a particular condition or
          preventing or otherwise reducing the risk of developing a
          particular condition. The term "prophylaxis" may be considered
          as reducing the severity or onset of a particular condition.
          "Treatment" may also reduce the severity of an existing
          condition.<br>
          <br>
          In another aspect of the invention, the compounds of the
          invention are suitable for use as a pesticide. The invention
          therefore further provides a pesticidal composition comprising
          a compound of formula (I) or formula (II) or an agriculturally
          or pesticidally acceptable salt thereof and a pesticidally
          acceptable carrier...<br>
          <br>
          In yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided a
          method of controlling infestations of pests in a subject or an
          environment comprising applying a pesticidally effective
          amount of a compound of formula (I) or formula (II) to a

          <b> </b><b>EXAMPLE 1</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b>Methods</b><br>
          <b> </b><b>Extraction</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Biomass samples, including seeds, leaves and bark, from
          Fontainea picrosperma where collected and subject to the
          following extraction process. These samples and their
          subsequent fractions are referred in the below example as
          EB548.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Phase 1-Extraction</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The biomass is generously covered with methanol and shaken (~2
          L, overnight) followed by filtration to give the first
          extract. This process is repeated a second time (~2 L, ~5
          hours) to generate the second extract. Each extract is
          examined by analytical HPLC and bioassayed (FIG. 1). The
          sequential methanol extracts are combined and the solvent
          removed by rotary evaporation to afford an aqueous
          concentrate.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Phase 2-Solvent Partition</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The aqueous concentrate from the extraction is diluted with
          water to 400 mL. The diluted sample (code 'Cr') is subsampled
          for HPLC and bioassay, then shaken with an equal volume of
          ethyl acetate (EtOAc) in a separatory funnel and the
          individual layers, EtOAc1 and H2O1, collected. Note,
          occasionally a precipitate would form that was insoluble in
          either layer. This precipitate was collected by filtration and
          dissolved in methanol (code 'Me'). The lower aqueous layer
          (H2O1) was twice more extracted with ethyl acetate to give
          EtOAc2 and EtOAc3 along with the remaining H2O3 layer.
          Subsamples of all layers are examined by analytical HPLC and
          bioassay (FIG. 2A).<br>
          <br>
          The sequential ethyl acetate extracts are pooled and the
          solvent removed by rotary evaporation to afford a residue that
          is weighed. On occasions, analytical HPLC indicated the EtOAc
          extract contained considerable amounts of extremely lipophilic
          (RT&gt;9 minutes) material. To remove this material a
          10:9:1-hexane:methanol:water partition was performed (FIG.
          2B).<br>

          <b>Phase 3-Preparative HPLC Fractionation</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The residue from the solvent partition is investigated by
          analytical HPLC to find optimum chromatographic conditions for
          separation of the metabolites present. Using these optimum
          conditions the residue (~2 g) is fractionated by preparative
          reverse phase HPLC (C18, single injection) into 100 fractions
          (FIG. 3). Subsamples of all 100 fractions are examined by
          analytical HPLC. After analysis of the HPLC traces, the 100
          fractions are consolidated into 20 to 30 pooled fractions
          (pools), some of which may be &gt;80% pure. These pooled
          fractions are weighed, bioassayed and examined by analytical
          HPLC.<br>

          <b>Preparative HPLC</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The preparative HPLC was carried out on a system consisting of
          two Shimadzu LC-8A Preparative Liquid Chromatographs with
          static mixer, Shimadzu SPD-M10AVP Diode Array Detector and
          Shimadzu SCL-10AVP System Controller. The column used was
          50*100 mm (diameter*length) packed with C18 Platinum EPS
          (Alltech).<br>
          <br>
          Approximately 2 grams of ethyl acetate extracted material was
          dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (4 mL) and subjected to
          preparative HPLC with typically conditions being 60 mL/min
          with gradient elution of 30% to 100% acetonitrile/water over
          20 minutes followed by acetonitrile for 10 minutes. One
          hundred fractions (20 mL) were collected, evaporated under
          nitrogen, and then combined on the basis of HPLC analysis...<br>

          <b> </b><br>
          Extraction and solvent partitioning of EB548 afforded 318 g of
          material. Each of the extraction and solvent partition layers
          were tested for bioactivity using the above bioassays. It can
          be seen from Table 2 that the extracts and ethyl acetate
          layers of the solvent partition all contain high CyTOX and
          NemaTOX activity.<br>

          <br>
          The successive aqueous concentrated extracts were subjected to
          HPLC. The column used was 50*100 mm (diameter*length) packed
          with C18 Platinum EPS (Alltech). Approximately 2 grams of
          extracted material was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (4 mL)
          and subjected to preparative HPLC with typical conditions
          being 60 mL/minute with gradient elution of 30% to 100%
          acetonitrile/water over 20 minutes followed by acetonitrile
          for 10 minutes.<br>
          <br>
          For comparison purposes the first ethyl acetate partition and
          the third water layers were analysed by HPLC. There was little
          or no compounds of interest remaining in the third water layer
          of the third water/ethyl acetate solvent partition.<br>
          <br>
          <b>First Preparative HPLC Fractionation</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          In a manner similar to that described in Phase 3 above the
          EB548 ethyl acetate solvent partition samples where pooled and
          further worked up using preparative HPLC chromatograph.<br>
          The preparative HPLC was used to produce 100 fractions. These
          fractions were pooled depending on the relative concentration
          of compounds indicated in the preparative HPLC chromatograph.<br>
          The bioactivity of each fraction or pooled fraction resulting
          from the preparative HPLC was determined using the above
          bioassay method. The results are summarized below at Table 3.<br>

          <b>Second Preparative HPLC Fractionation</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          To prepare additional material a second preparative HPLC
          fraction was performed. The HPLC pools from the second
          preparative HPLC fraction did not require bioassay as the
          active bands were chosen based on the UV spectra from the
          first preparative HPLC.<br>
          <br>
          In performing the second preparative HPLC fractionation it was
          discovered that of the major active bands, fractions
          EB548.LA3.139-22/24, -35/38, -41/43 and -51/53, the latter
          three showed substantial instability. This instability was
          observed upon nitrogen evaporation but not while in
          acetonitrile/water solution at room temperature or on vacuum
          evaporation. To avoid decomposition the equivalent four bands
          of active metabolites from the second preparative HPLC were
          individually back extracted in the ethyl acetate and
          evaporated under vacuum. Analytical HPLC of these samples
          confirmed minimal decomposition... <br>

          <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><br>
          <b> </b><b>Mode of Activity</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b>While not wanting to be bound by any one theory the
          compound EBI-46 is considered to be a protein kinase C
          activator on the basis of it's similar in vitro growth
          inhibition profiles to phorbol ester (TPA), selective
          inhibition of the growth of K562 leukemia, MCF-7 breast
          cancer, Colo-205 colon cancer and D04 and SKMel-5 melanoma at
          doses approximately 100-fold lower than for other human tumour
          cell lines and for normal human fibroblasts. In addition,
          scattering of MCF-7 and HT-29 colon tumour cells was observed,
          typical of PKC activators. A particular human melanoma cell
          line MM96L undergoes a characteristic change to bipolar
          morphology when treated with TPA or with EBI-46. Additionally,
          given their similarity in structure, EBI-47, EBI-59 and EBI-61
          are also considered to be protein kinase C activators.<br>

          <b> </b><br>
          The raw plant material of Fontainea picrosperma (EB548 or
          EB610) was chopped, extracted with methanol, and partitioned
          between water and an organic solvent (diethyl ether or ethyl
          acetate). Pilot studies included HPLC and HPTLC
          activity-guided analysis, then optimization of the conditions
          for purification of bioactivity, and confirmation of
          stability. Fractionation of the bulk was conducted on silica
          gel 60 in petroleum spirit/acetone/methanol or in petroleum
          spirit/ethyl acetate/methanol, followed by HPLC. The latter
          involved reverse phase separation on a C18 Phenomenex Lunar 5
          micron, 250*4.6 mm column in methanol-water.<br>

          <b>Results</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b><b>1. Purification of EBI-46 and Related Compounds</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The organic extract was fractionated by chromatography on
          silica giving a fraction (548-35) containing a bioactive peak
          of high purity (RT: 25.131 minutes). Further purification by
          HPLC yielded &gt;2 g of EBI-46 (RT: 25.262 minutes), from 2 kg
          of plant material.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Purity, Stability and Solubility</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The bulk sample of EBI-46 was found to be &gt;95% pure by UV
          and NMR, the limit of detection of the instruments.<br>
          <br>
          Retention of bioactivity through extraction and chromatography
          steps implied that the structure was stable, and this has been
          confirmed to the extent that solutions of EBI-46 in ethanol
          retain bioactivity when held at 4[deg.] C. for 4 weeks. This
          was confirmed by an HPLC study of stability in the preferred
          delivery vehicle for intralesional injection (PEG 400
          containing 10% ethanol) held at 37[deg.] C. The structure has
          no readily reactive groups which might otherwise confer
          instability.<br>
          <br>
          Being a diterpene ester, EBI-46 is highly soluble in organic
          solvents including biocompatible solvents such as acetone,
          alcohols and PEG 400. It requires a small amount of such
          solvents to form aqueous solutions. Solubility tests have
          demonstrated 100% solubility at all 3 concentrations tested so
          far: 450 [mu]g/mL in 90% water, 50 [mu]g/mL in 99% water and 5
          [mu]g/mL in 99.9% water. Higher solubilities may well be
          achievable.<br>
          <br>
          Note that EBI-46 is a potent drug and only small amounts are
          required. Thus for intralesional injection of EBI-46, the
          concentration was 400 [mu]g/mL (and no water was required in
          this case).<br>
          <br>
          3. Bioactivity Profile of EBI-46 and Related Compounds In
          Vitro: Arrest of Cell Growth<br>
          <br>
          The ability of the EB548 crude extract (Table 13), and
          purified EBI-46 (FIG. 4) to block the growth of cultured human
          tumour cell lines and a normal strain (human diploid
          fibroblasts) was tested in a clonogenic-type assay where many
          generations were allowed to elapse (5-6 days treatment) before
          measuring cell growth (Sulfurhodamine protein stain). Changes
          in morphology were also scored, and these were identical to
          those induced by the known protein kinase C (PKC) activator
          TPA (tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate), namely extreme bipolar
          morphology in the MM96L cell line and scattering of the MCF-7
          cell clusters.<br>
          <br>
          These compounds are therefore also considered to be PKC
          activators and of potential utility in the same indications as
          demonstrated for EBI-46 below.<br>
          <br>
          4. Efficacy of EBI-46 in Treatment of Subcutaneous Tumours in
          Mice: Topical Application<br>
          <br>
          Topical application of EBI-46 in an isopropanol gel was
          carried out on the aggressive B16 mouse melanoma in its
          natural (syngeneic) host, C57BL/6 mice (0.5 million tumour
          cells injected per site).<br>
          <br>
          The frequency (1 daily dose for 3 days only) and dose level
          for topical application of PKC activators was selected on the
          basis of in vitro activity on cell lines. The materials were
          dissolved in acetone and diluted into an isopropanol gel for
          topical application.<br>
          <br>
          The aggressive and rapidly growing B16 mouse melanoma is
          recognised as a very stringent tumour model in which to test
          anticancer agents. Stringency was further increased by
          injecting at least 10* more tumour cells than the minimum
          required to form a tumour in the animal. A confounding factor
          in determining the efficacy of topical treatments was that
          some tumour cells escaped from the subcutaneous site at a
          early stage and became established in the underlying muscle
          where it is assumed that the drug and its associated dermal
          host response did not reach. Such tumours could be
          distinguished from subcutaneous tumours by their immobility
          when the skin was pulled around the body of the animal.<br>
          <br>
          It was therefore highly significant that approximately 150
          [mu]g EBI-46/site gave a good response (4 mice and 4 controls,
          2 sites/mouse), with one site apparently cured but the mouse
          had to be euthanased because the other site was growing. The
          inflammatory response was mild. There was no sign of systemic
          toxicity or lung metastases with any of the drugs.<br>
          <br>
          The regrowth of tumour cells after 10 days was not surprising,
          given the stringency of the model (FIG. 5) and the somewhat
          arbitrary choice of dose and regimen.<br>
          <br>
          The above was repeated using the UVB-induced mouse squamous
          cell carcinoma (SCC) grown on nude mice (FIG. 6) and treated
          with partially-purified EBI-46. This more realistic model for
          skin cancers showed an extremely high response rate which was
          maintained over a long period.<br>
          <br>
          Again, an excellent result was obtained, with relapses
          occurring after 6 weeks due primarily to outgrowth of tumours
          from the underlying muscle, presumably due to being out of
          reach of the topical drug.<br>
          <br>
          The most recent experiment with topical application used 2
          different doses of EBI-46 (FIG. 7). The low dose was 100
          [mu]g/site and the high dose was 350 [mu]g/site/treatment.<br>
          <br>
          This experiment gave an excellent result at 350 [mu]g
          EBI-46/site, and showed that it was important to achieve a
          certain dose level to achieve efficacy.<br>
          <br>
          5. Efficacy of EBI-46 in Treatment of Subcutaneous Tumours in
          Mice: Intralesional Injection<br>
          <br>
          A pilot study was conducted on 6 mm*6 mm LK-2 tumours
          established in nude mice. Approximately 50 [mu]L of a solution
          of EB548 fractions (approximately 20 [mu]g EBI-46 in the
          EB548-35 fraction) in saline containing 20% acetone were
          injected in 3 sites around the periphery of each lesion. This
          was only done once.<br>
          <br>
          The result showed rapid ablation of visible tumours, (FIG. 8)
          and an inflammatory response at the site of injection. Tumour
          growth eventually recovered, presumably due to non-optimal
          delivery.<br>
          <br>
          The above procedure was then modified by using PEG 400
          containing 10% ethanol as the vehicle. EBI-46 is freely
          soluble in this mixture and the increased viscosity served to
          restrict delivery of drug to the tumour site.<br>
          <br>
          With PEG 400 delivery, 10 [mu]g EBI-46 in 25 [mu]L solution
          was injected (29 gauge) with a 0.5 mL insulin needle into a 7
          mm*7 mm tumour, highly visible on the left flank of a nude
          mouse.<br>
          <br>
          By 16 hours, a marked inflamed area had developed and the
          tumour lump had largely gone. A small area of normal skin on
          the ridge of the back was accidentally treated topically with
          the preparation, and developed a mild inflammatory response.<br>
          <br>
          Seven days later, the tumour site was still flat and a scab
          had formed. The normal treated skin on the ridge of the back
          also formed a scab. This mouse remained tumour-free for over 9
          months and was finally euthanased due to an unrelated
          condition (swollen penis).<br>
          <br>
          In addition to the advantage of viscosity for localization of
          drug, PEG 400 gave fewer problems with leaking out after
          withdrawal of the needle. PEG 400 alone had no effect when
          injected into an LK2 tumour on another mouse.<br>
          <br>
          A second mouse model was tested in a pilot study, involving an
          8 mm diameter human nasopharyngeal tumour implanted and
          growing subcutaneously on the neck of a SCID-NOD mouse. Up to
          3 injections of EBI-46 (total of 25 [mu]g in 75 [mu]L 25%
          propylene glycol-saline) were made into the NPC tumours of 2
          mice. The scab sloughed off the treated site in one mouse,
          with no sign of residual tumour. Growth of the tumour in the
          second mouse was delayed but not ablated.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Systemic Administration of EBI-46</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          A variety of reports using cultured cells suggest that PKC
          activators may have potential for the treatment of lymphoid
          neoplasms. The murine B-cell lymphoma line A20 was used as an
          experimental model because it has been reported to grow well
          in mice and closely models the human situation.<br>
          <br>
          SCID-NOD mice (BALB/c background) were shaved and 10E7 A20
          cells injected subcutaneously (2 sites per mouse). The tumours
          tended to grow in a flat, diffuse manner and became raised and
          measurable at the 10E7 sites only after about 15 days. One
          mouse with 10E7 tumours was then injected intraperitoneally
          from day 18 with a total of 5 doses of 20-25 [mu]g EBI-46 in
          25% propylene glycol-saline. The solution was stable for weeks
          at 4[deg.] C., and there was no sign of insolubility at this
          concentration (250 [mu]g/mL).<br>
          <br>
          The results suggest that tumour growth in the injected mouse
          was strongly inhibited by EBI-46, compared with an untreated
          10E7 mouse. Growth increased when the treatment stopped and
          the mouse was euthanased at 27 days.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Delivery Vehicles for EBI-46</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Consideration of the structure and stability of EBI-46 leads
          to the use of protic solvents that are biocompatible. Benzyl
          alcohol and Cremaphor would be possibilities but have not been
          tested. PEG 400 was chosen because of its common usage, but
          similar solvents could well be suitable; and the use of larger
          needles would obviate the need to dilute slightly with
          ethanol. None of the above materials were deliberately
          sterilized, despite being used in the immunocompromised nude
          mice.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Safety Issues</b><br>
          <br>
          The operator, as with any potent drug, should wear personal
          protection (gloves, coat/gown, eye protection). EBI-46 can
          cause inflammation of skin. It can be deactivated with sodium
          carbonate solution.<br>
          <br>
          The animals have shown no weight loss, signs of distress or
          side effects. Internal organs appeared to be normal on
          dissection but no histology or formal toxicology has been
          done.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Discussion</b><br>
          <br>
          EBI-46 is solvent extractable from EB548 material and although
          other compounds with similar activity are present, EBI-46
          travels in an uncluttered region of the chromatogram and
          therefore is relatively easy to purify. The same bioactivities
          were obtained from the crude extract through to the purified
          structure. Properties relevant to its potential use as a
          pharmaceutical have so far been favourable: availability,
          purity, stability and solubility in delivery vehicle.<br>
          <br>
          The cell growth inhibition profile revealed EBI-46 to be a PKC
          activator, showing very high selectivity for a subset of solid
          tumour and leukemia cell lines, compared with normal cells and
          some other tumour cell lines. Local application such as
          topical cream or intralesional injection into lesions is
          likely to clear these sites because of a combination of direct
          killing (high local dose) and elimination of peripheral tumour
          cells by the host's innate immune response as evidenced by the
          early inflammatory reaction at the site of application.<br>
          <br>
          Intralesional injection required less drug than topical
          application, and only one treatment, to obtain a significant
          response. If relapse occurs, for example on one side of the
          original lesion, repeated injections would be possible.
          Injection also provides a more positive delivery than relying
          on topical application on sites of different skin thickness.<br>
          <br>
          It is important to note that efficacy of local treatment does
          not require the target tumour to be intrinsically sensitive to
          EBI-46. The aggressive B16 mouse melanoma cells for example
          are quite resistant in culture but respond to the drug
          topically in the mouse. Presumably, the vigorous host response
          is a major factor. This C57BL/6 strain is very different from
          the BALB/c background of the nude mouse, indicating that
          neither strain differences nor lack of adequate T-cell
          immunity inhibit the efficacy of EBI-46.<br>
          <br>
          The ability of local treatment with EBI-46 to work in species
          other than mice remains to be evaluated. Mouse skin is very
          thin (half the thickness of human skin), thus making
          intralesional injection more attractive. PEG 400 was chosen as
          a vehicle because it is used extensively for drug delivery and
          because its viscosity (lowered slightly with 10% ethanol to
          achieve injectability) may limit spreading away to far from
          the injection site.<br>
          <br>
          Note also that EBI-46 causes an inflammatory response in
          normal skin. There are anecdotal reports of various plant saps
          being used to treat warts. This raises the possibility of
          using EBI-46 to ablate keloid scars, psoriasis, warts, proud
          flesh and other non-malignant conditions of the skin.<br>
          <br>
          Local treatment may find significant application beyond skin
          lesions. It may be feasible to locally treat, by injection or
          suitably-formulated topical preparations, life-threatening
          tumours such as those of the oral cavity, esophagus and bowel.
          This could be carried out in conjunction with physical or
          pharmacological means of limiting escape of the drug into the
          circulation.<br>
