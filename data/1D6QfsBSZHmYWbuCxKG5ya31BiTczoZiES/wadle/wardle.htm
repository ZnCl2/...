      <p><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] The present invention concerns a shielding material for
        a magnetic field, and more specific to a magnetic shield
        containing the shielding material. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] Magnetic fields are present around all electrical
        equipment and power lines. Although we cannot see or feel them,
        these fields interact with the components inside the equipments,
        causing a slow undulation of displayed images, frequently
        described as swimming, shimmy, jitter or even hula, making the
        screen illegible. In addition, magnetic interference may
        generate incorrect data, operator eyestrain, operator fatigue
        and disability. </p>
      <p>[0003] Unlike X-rays and light rays, magnetic fields do not
        travel in straight lines. Magnetic field lines are continuous
        curves, emitting from a source of field and eventually returning
        to the point of origin. </p>
      <p>[0004] Therefore, shielding is essential in electronic
        equipments and various kinds of equipments radiating undesired
        magnetic waves; thus, the radiation of the electromagnetic waves
        and invasion of the electromagnetic waves from the exterior is
        prevented. </p>
      <p>[0005] A magnetic shield is traditionally made of a metallic
        material such as steel, iron, and nickel. Because metallic
        materials have a strong attraction for magnetic fields, the
        shield traps the magnetic force and diverts it around the
        equipment generating heat. In addition, lead, for example, is
        extremely hazardous, heavy, and is very expensive to produce.
        Steel requires massive amounts of refinement; it is heavy, and
        prone to corrosion. Alloys of steel, iron, copper and nickel are
        very expensive to produce and will corrode quickly. Furthermore,
        the cost of forming these materials into shapes for current
        shielding is high as well as dangerous. </p>
      <p>[0006] As components of equipments are made more sensitive,
        susceptibility to magnetic waves increases dramatically; thus,
        the prior art developed a variety of materials for the shield. </p>
      <p>[0007] The prior art shows the use of plates of a metal having
        high magnetic permeability and saturation magnetic flux density
        such as permalloy. Unfortunately, shields made of this material
        are bulky and heavy. In addition, in most of the cases, it is
        necessary to cut, bend, or even weld the plates. This is a
        laborious and expensive process. </p>
      <p>[0008] Furthermore, the prior art shows the use of paramagnetic
        materials (e.g. titanium) to encapsulate and shield medical
        devices due to their low magnetic susceptibilities. These
        materials operate by deflecting electromagnetic fields. However,
        although paramagnetic materials are less susceptible to
        magnetization than ferromagnetic materials, they can also
        produce unwanted images due to eddy currents generated by
        externally applied magnetic fields, such as the radio frequency
        fields used in the MRI procedures. These eddy currents produce
        localized magnetic fields, which disrupt and distort the
        magnetic resonance image. In addition, since the paramagnetic
        materials are electrically conductive, the eddy currents
        produced in them can result in ohmic heating and injury to the
        patient or the medical device. </p>
      <p>[0009] As steel, iron, and nickel are ferrous materials,
        saturation of these materials will occur after a period of time
        being exposed to magnetic fields. </p>
      <p>[0010] In recent years, Mu-Metal is considered the premier
        shielding material for electronic devices. Mu-Metal is the
        generic name for a high-permeability, magnetically "soft" alloy
        used for magnetic shielding. It includes about 80% nickel and
        15% iron, with the balance being copper, molybdenum or chromium,
        depending on the recipe being used. Unfortunately, Mu-Metal
        material is very expensive. In addition, the Mu-metal contains
        ferrous materials; thus, the shield will become saturated,
        becoming a magnet itself, to the use of the shield is useless. </p>
      <p>[0011] The present inventors have seen the necessity of
        providing a magnetic shielding material that overcomes the above
        disadvantages. In addition, the present inventors have seen the
        necessity of providing a magnetic shield that does not trap the
        magnetic forces. Furthermore, the present inventors have seen
        the necessity of providing an inexpensive magnetic shielding
        material for a magnetic shield. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0012] It is an object of the present invention to provide a
        magnetic shielding material that overcomes the disadvantages of
        the shielding materials of the prior art. </p>
      <p>[0013] It is an object of the present invention to provide a
        magnetic shield that does not trap the magnetic forces. </p>
      <p>[0014] It is yet another object of the present invention to
        provide a magnetic shield made of a non-metallic, non-ferrous
        material. </p>
      <p>[0015] It is yet another object of the present invention to
        provide substrate having a layer of the non-metallic material
        according to the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0016] It is yet another object of the present invention to

        construction. </p>
      <p>[0017] It is yet another object of the present invention to
        provide a lightweight magnetic shield. </p>
      <p>[0018] It is yet another object of this invention to provide a
        magnetically shielded substrate which is shielded against strong
        magnetic fields. </p>
      <p>[0019] The present invention concerns a shielding material for
        a magnetic shield comprising: [0020] A. coal slag, [0021] B.
        silver powder; [0022] C. a mixture of calcium powder, magnesium
        powder, and zinc powder; and [0023] D. silica powder. </p>
      <p>[0024] The shielding material is in powder form and can be
        encapsulated into any form and shape desired. </p>
      <p>[0025] The main advantage to the shielding material, according
        to the present invention, is this material is non-ferrous. Thus,
        the shield will not become saturated, attract a field or become
        ineffective. </p>
      <p>[0026] The shielding material, according to the present
        invention, further contemplates using nano-silver. </p>
      <p>[0027] The present invention also relates to a magnetic shield
        comprising: [0028] A. a substrate and, disposed above said
        substrate, [0029] B. a powdered shielding material comprising:
        [0030] C. coal slag, [0031] D. silver powder; [0032] E. a
        mixture of calcium powder, magnesium powder, and zinc powder;
        and [0033] F. silica powder. </p>
      <p>[0034] The substrate may be substantially any size, any shape,
        any material, or any combination of materials. The shielding
        material(s) disposed on the substrate may be disposed on and/or
        in some or all of the substrate. </p>
      <p>[0035] Furthermore, the present invention relates to a method
        for preparing a powdered shielding material for a magnetic
        shield comprising the steps of: [0036] A. providing coal slag;
        [0037] B. coating the coal slag with a silver powder; [0038] C.
        adding silica powder; [0039] D. adding a mixture of calcium
        powder, magnesium powder, and zinc powder. </p>
      <p>[0040] Finally, the present invention contemplates adding
        nano-silver to the shielding material. </p>
      <p>[0041] The magnetic shield of the present invention deflects
        the magnetic fields of high power magnets. </p>
      <p>[0042] In one embodiment of the present invention, a thin layer
        of the shielding material is directly applied onto the surface
        of the substrate. </p>
      <p>[0043] In another embodiment, the shielding material is
        suspended in an appropriate vehicle, and then mixed with
        sprayable coating materials. </p>
      <p>[0044] The foregoing detailed description is intended to be
        illustrative and non-limiting. Many changes and modifications
        are possible in light of the above teachings. Thus, it is
        understood that the invention may be practiced than as otherwise
        specifically described herein and still be within the scope of
        the appended claims. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
      <p>[0045] For a more complete understanding of the nature and
        objects of the present invention, reference should be made to
        the following detailed description taken together with the
        accompanying drawings, in which: </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0047] The present invention now will be described more fully
        hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in
        which some, but not all, embodiments of the invention are shown.
        Indeed, this invention may be embodied in many different forms
        and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set
        forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that
        this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like
        numbers refer to like elements throughout. </p>
      <p>[0048] At the present time, the inventors do not understand the
        exact reactions that occur when the chemicals are mixed to form
        the shielding material of the present invention. The elements
        and the order of mixing was only achieved by preconceived notion
        and year's of trial and error </p>
      <p>[0049] The magnetic shield of the present invention is based on
        the concept that the magnetic field is actually "deflected" away
        from the area shielded. This is possible in view of the
        shielding materials used to produce the magnetic shield. </p>
      <p>[0050] The shielding material for a magnetic shield, according
        to the present invention, comprises: [0051] A. insulating
        material, [0052] B. non-magnetic, non-ferrous material; [0053]
        C. a mixture of calcium powder, magnesium powder, and zinc
        powder; and [0054] D. inorganic insulating material. </p>
      <p>[0055] The shielding material is in powder form and can be
        encapsulated into any form and shape desired. </p>
      <p>[0056] The following explains the purpose of addition of the
        shielding material components and the reasons for limiting the
        material compositions. </p>
      <p><b>Insulating Material</b> </p>
      <p>[0057] The insulating material may be any oxide having
        electrically insulating properties. Use may be made of at least
        one of oxides of silicon, boron, phosphorus, tin, zinc, bismuth,
        alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, germanium, copper, aluminum,
        titanium, zirconium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium,
        manganese, tungsten, iron, chromium, cobalt, rare earth metals,
        coal slag, and molybdenum which can form a vitreous material. </p>
      <p>[0058] The present invention preferably uses coal slag as the
        insulation material. Most preferably, the present invention uses
        a 30/60 coal slag. </p>
      <p>[0059] Coal slag is made from quenched liquid coal slag and
        fresh water washed, this product is extremely inert, has a low
        moisture content, a high degree of etch for permanent bonding of
        coatings, is ready used, is economical, and leaves minimum dust.
        Containing virtually no free or crystalline silica, coal slag is
        one of the safest and most inexpensive insulation materials. </p>
      <p>[0060] Coal slag generally has the following composition: </p>
      <p>[0061] SiO.sub.2, preferably in the range of about 20 to 60
        weight percent, more preferably in the range of about 40 to 55
        weight percent; </p>
      <p>[0062] Al.sub.2O.sub.3, preferably in the range of about 10 to
        35 weight percent, more preferably in the range of about 15 to
        30 weight percent; </p>
      <p>[0063] Fe.sub.2O.sub.3 and FeO, preferably in the range of
        about 5 to 35 weight percent, more preferably in the range of
        about 10 to 20 weight percent; </p>
      <p>[0064] CaO, preferably in the range of about 1 to 20 weight;
        Na.sub.2O and K.sub.2O, preferably in the range of about 0.1 to
        4 weight percent. </p>
      <p>[0065] Coal slag has conductivity at 230.degree. C.
        (cal/s-cm-.degree. C.) of less than 25 micron Siemens. Thus, the
        material may be use as insulator. </p>
      <p>[0066] The present invention contemplates using from about 20
        to about 50 weight percent of a coal slag, preferably 35 weight
        percent. </p>
      <p><b>Non-Magnetic Material</b> </p>
      <p>[0067] The present invention uses a metal barrier layer to cut
        any possible magnetic interaction. The metal barrier layer is
        preferably made of a non-magnetic metal material. The
        non-magnetic metal material forming the metal barrier layer is
        not limited to a specific material, but may be selected from
        various kinds of non-magnetic metal materials. However,
        particularly preferable materials are: metals, such as Sc, Ti,
        Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Ti and
        Pb, and non-magnetic alloys containing them. </p>
      <p>[0068] The present invention preferably uses silver. Most
        preferably, a 6.mu. silver powder. </p>
      <p>[0069] As known by a person skilled in the art, silver has
        sterilizing, anti-microbial, deodorizing, antistatic, and
        electromagnetic shielding effects. </p>
      <p>[0070] Silver is a lustrous, white metal, more ductile and
        malleable than any other metal, excluding gold. Silver is the
        best reflector of visible light known until air causes it to
        tarnish. In pure air and in water, it is stable. </p>
      <p>[0071] The silver powder (damp) is added to improve the
        smoothness of the coal slag (dry) and to form the base layer on
        the shielding material. Furthermore, the silver powder is added
        to the insulation material to make the particle surface
        reflective. </p>
      <p>[0072] The present invention contemplates using from about 4 to
        about 30 weight percent of a silver powder, preferably 15 weight
        percent. </p>
      <p><b>Insulating Inorganic Material</b> </p>
      <p>[0073] The insulating inorganic material used in the surface of
        the shielding material is not limited specifically. Any material
        may be used if it has electric insulation properties. For
        example, silica fine powder or alumina fine powder may be used.
        Especially, the silica fine powder is preferably used. </p>
      <p>[0074] Silica is noncombustible, colorless or white, tasteless
        "crystals". It occurs naturally in the crystalline and amorphous
        forms. The specific gravity and melting point depend on the
        crystalline form. Silica is known to occur in 17 crystalline
        phases or modes and five amorphous phases. </p>
      <p>[0075] Of the silica fine powder, spherical silica fine powder,
        triturated silica fine powder, granular type silica fine powder,
        and the like, may be used. In addition, from the point of view
        of fine particle size, the silica fine powder, having an average
        primary particle size of 1-1,000 nm, may be used. Especially,
        the silica fine powder having 250 sieve screen size is
        preferably used. </p>
      <p>[0076] The present invention contemplates using from about 15
        to about 45 weight percent of a silica powder, preferably 25
        weight percent. </p>
      <p><b>Pharmacy Grade Calcium, Magnesium and Zinc Finely Ground to
          a Powder.</b> </p>
      <p>[0077] Any over the counter pharmacy grade calcium, magnesium,
        or zinc may be use in the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0078] The chemical must be ground to a fine powder before
        adding to the shielding material according to the present
        invention. </p>
      <p>[0079] The present invention contemplates using from about 15
        to about 45 weight percent of a mixture of calcium powder,
        magnesium powder, and zinc powder, preferably 25 weight percent.
      </p>
      <p>[0080] The mixture of the three chemical contains 60% of
        calcium, 28% of magnesium, and 12% zinc. This mixture is
        preferably 25% weight of the shielding material according to the
        present invention. </p>
      <p><b>Nano-Material</b> </p>
      <p>[0081] In one embodiment of the present invention, the
        invention contemplates coating the shielding material with a
        nano-material. </p>
      <p>[0082] In general, and as is known to those skilled in the art,
        nano-material is material which has an average particle size
        less than 100 nanometers and, preferably, in the range of from
        about 2 to 50 nanometers. </p>
      <p>[0083] The present invention preferably uses nano-silver. Nano
        Silver has upgraded beneficial effects of silver by making it
        into very small particles of one over one billion meter. This
        material is environment-friendly and not toxic. </p>
      <p>[0084] The nano-silver has the ability to deflect
        electromagnetic fields while remaining electrically
        non-conductive. </p>
      <p>[0085] The nano-silver, when placed on an object, is capable of
        deflecting electromagnetic fields, thereby protecting sensitive
        internal components, while also preventing the formation of eddy
        currents in the object. </p>
      <p>[0086] The present invention contemplates using from about 3 to
        about 10 weight percent of nano-silver, preferably 7 weight
        percent. </p>
      <p><b>Magnetic Shield</b> </p>
      <p>[0087] FIG. 1 is a side view of the magnetic shield according
        to the present invention. The magnetic shield 10 comprises:
        [0088] A. a substrate 20 and, disposed above said substrate,
        [0089] B. a shielding material 30 comprising: [0090] C. coal
        slag, [0091] D. silver powder; [0092] E. a mixture of calcium
        powder, magnesium powder, and zinc powder; and [0093] F. silica
        powder. </p>
      <p>[0094] The substrate may be substantially any size, any shape,
        any material, or any combination of materials. The shielding
        material(s) disposed on and/or in such substrate may be disposed
        on and/or in some or all of such substrate. </p>
      <p>[0095] The actual process for producing the shield material is
        very simple and safe. No extreme heat is required. No advanced
        mix processing is required. </p>
      <p>[0096] In one embodiment of the present invention a thin layer
        (in the figure, shown by hatching of dots) of the shielding
        material is directly applied onto the surface of the substrate.
      </p>
      <p>[0097] In another embodiment, the shielding material is
        suspended in an appropriate vehicle, and then mixed with a
        sprayable, brushable, or rollable coating. </p>
      <p>[0098] Objects and advantages of this invention are further
        illustrated by the following examples, but the particular
        materials and amounts thereof recited in these examples, as well
        as other conditions and details, should not be construed to
        unduly limit this invention. All parts and percentages are by
        weight unless otherwise indicated. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>[0099] Step 1. 35 grams of 30/60 coal slag was provided. The
        coal slag contained 25% Aluminum Oxide, 25% Iron Oxide, and 50%
        Mineralized Glass. </p>
      <p>[0100] Step 2. The coal slag was coated with 15 grams of a six
        micron (6.mu.) silver powder. The silver powder was slightly
        moistened and adhered to the coal slag. </p>
      <p>[0101] Step 3. Then, 25 grams of white silica powder--250 sieve
        screen was added to the top of the silver powder. The silica
        powder adhered to the silver powder. </p>
      <p>[0102] Step 4. Finally, 25 grams of a mixture of pharmacy grade
        calcium, magnesium, and zinc powder. The 25% of the mixture
        contains 60% weight of calcium, 28% weight of magnesium, and 12%
        weight of zinc. </p>
      <p>[0103] The three elements of step 4 are pharmacy grade and were
        purchased over the counter at a local drug store in tablet form
        and then finely ground. </p>
      <p>[0104] Results of the test for example 1: </p>
      <p>[0105] A test was done using a 21/2 ounce round spherical
        container 3/4'' diameter.times.11/2'' long of iron filings, a 28
        lb pull 3/4'' diameter.times.1/2'' long rare earth magnet, and
        one 3/8'' thick 4''.times.4'' square sheet of each of the
        following materials: [0106] A. Plastic [0107] B. Lead [0108] C.
        Stainless Steel [0109] D. Copper [0110] E. the sheet covered
        with the shielding material of the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0111] The test went as follows: </p>
      <p>[0112] Each individual sheet of shielding material was set
        upright. The 28 lb rare earth magnet was held against one side
        of the shielding material and the iron fillings against the
        other side. The magnet and the iron fillings were held against
        each side of the shielding material listed above A-E in the same
        manner. </p>
      <p>[0113] The magnet attraction from the 28 lb magnet to the iron
        fillings on shielding sheets A-D was strong enough to hold the
        iron fillings and the magnet in place. </p>
      <p>[0114] Test results with sheet E. (present invention). The
        shield element E deflected the magnetic pull of the 28 lb rare
        earth magnet preventing the attraction to the iron fillings,
        thus the magnet and the iron filing fall down due the earth
        gravitation pull. </p>
      <p>[0115] The shielding material is in powder form and can be
        encapsulated into any form and shape desired. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p>[0116] Step 1. 33 grams of 30/60 coal slag was provided. The
        coal slag contained 25% Aluminum Oxide, 25% Iron Oxide, and 50%
        Mineralized Glass. </p>
      <p>[0117] Step 2. The coal slag was coated with 15 grams of a six
        micron (6.mu.) silver powder. The silver powder was slightly
        moistened and adhered to the coal slag. </p>
      <p>[0118] Step 3. Then, 25 grams of white silica powder--250 sieve
        screen was added to the top of the silver powder. The silica
        powder adhered to the silver powder. </p>
      <p>[0119] Step 4. Finally, 20 grams of a mixture of pharmacy grade
        calcium, magnesium, and zinc powder. The 25% of the mixture
        contains 60% weight of calcium, 28% weight of magnesium, and 12%
        weight of zinc. The 20% of the mixture contains 60% weight of
        calcium, 28% weight of magnesium, and 12% weight of zinc. </p>
      <p>[0120] The three elements of step 4 are pharmacy grade and were
        purchased over the counter at a local drug store in tablet form
        and then finely ground. </p>
      <p>[0121] Step 5. 7 grams of nano-silver were mixed with the
        mixture of step 4. </p>
      <p>[0122] Results of the test for example 2: </p>
      <p>[0123] A test was done using a 21/2 ounce container of iron
        filings, a 28 lb pull rare earth magnet, and one 3/8'' thick
        4''.times.4'' square sheet each of the following materials:
        [0124] A. Plastic [0125] B. Lead [0126] C. Stainless Steel
        [0127] D. Copper [0128] E. the sheet covered with the shielding
        material of the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0129] For the shielding material E, a 1/4'' thick
        4''.times.4'' square sheet was used. The sheet thickness was
        reduced from 3/8'' to 1/4''. This included the plastic sidewall
        that held the shielding material place while testing. Each wall
        thickness of about 1/32'' actually decreased the true thickness
        of the shielding material to 3/16''. Thus, the actual thickness
        of the shielding material on the substrate was at about 1/2 the
        thickness of the material that was tested, with the same results
        as the first test. </p>
      <p>[0130] The test went as follows: </p>
      <p>[0131] Each individual sheet of shielding material was set
        upright. The 28 lb rare earth magnet was held against one side
        of the shielding material, and the iron fillings against the
        other side. The magnet and the iron fillings were held against
        each side of the shielding material listed above A-E in the same
        manner. </p>
      <p>[0132] The magnet attraction from the 28 lb magnet to the iron
        fillings on shielding sheets A-D was strong enough to hold the
        iron fillings and the magnet in place. </p>
      <p>[0133] Test results with sheet E. (present invention). The
        shield element E deflected the magnetic pull of the 28 lb rare
        earth magnet preventing the attraction to the iron fillings;
        thus, the magnet and the iron fillings fall down due to the
        earth's gravitation pull. </p>
      <p>[0134] The shielding material is in powder form and can be
        encapsulated into any form and shape desired. </p>
      <p>[0135] Adding nano-silver to the mixture of example 1 shows
        8-10% improvement for the magnetic field deflection over
        original formula mixture. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 3</b> </p>
      <p>[0136] The objective of the experiment was to create a static
        distortion on a radio. </p>
      <p>[0137] An AM radio and another electronic device were set
        approximately 12 inches apart. </p>
      <p>[0138] An adhesive was sprayed on a plain sheet of paper, and
        the shielding material of example 1 was applied to the paper. </p>
      <p>[0139] The paper was then lowered between the two devices. </p>
      <p>[0140] The result was a very noticeable reduction in the static
        on the radio. </p>
      <p>[0141] The magnetic shield, according to the present invention,
        is of much lighter weight than the ferrous shields of the prior
        art. </p>
      <p>[0142] The magnetic shield of the present invention may be used
        with: [0143] MRI units for shielding of errant and stray fields;
        [0144] power transfer for AC power line transformers; [0145]
        security installations, conference rooms, command centers, and
        test facilities; [0146] electronic equipments such as computers
        and other sensitive systems; and [0147] auto industry for
        everything from propulsion to electronic protection. </p>
      <p>[0148] The main advantage to this shield is that it is
        non-ferrous. By being non-ferrous, the shield will not become
        saturated and become ineffective. Because of the non-ferrous
        makeup of the magnetic shield of the present invention, there
        will be no loss of power from the magnet(s) when used next to
        the shield. </p>
      <p>[0149] In addition, the present invention contemplates the use
        of the magnetic shield in outer space. With the magnetic shield
        deflecting the magnetic fields towards the core of the earth by
        means of gravity, the use in space would be far superior. With
        no gravity to deal with, the deflection would not be focused
        downward. This may very well create a true "reflection" shield.
      </p>
      <p>[0150] The use of the shielding material in radiological work
        has many possibilities. As a deflector of magnetic fields, the
        shield could have the same effect on radioactive material as
        well. This is a very distinct possibility. Further testing would
        be required to establish the impact in this field. </p>
      <p>[0151] The major advantage of the magnetic shield of the
        present invention is that it is environmentally safe. The shield
        itself is formulated from elements that are earth friendly and
        will not hurt the environment. </p>
      <p>[0152] Many modifications and other embodiments of the
        invention set forth herein will come to mind to one skilled in
        the art to which this invention pertains, having the benefit of
        the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the
        associated drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the
