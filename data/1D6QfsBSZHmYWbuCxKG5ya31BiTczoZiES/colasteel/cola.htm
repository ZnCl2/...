      You'd be forgiven for dismissing an amateur metallurgist if he
      claimed to have improved upon the presumably perfected technology
      of steel making. But Flash Bainite, the creation of Detroit
      entrepreneur Gary Cola, wowed a team of Ohio State University
      engineers by turning centuries of alloy processing on its head.
      Instead of heating the metal for hours or days, this well-equipped
      DIYer boosted the temperature -- quickly baking, then cooling
      sheets of steel that are 7-percent stronger than other forms and
      tougher than some titanium alloys. Flash Bainite is also more
      ductile than other steels, allowing it to crumple more before
      breaking -- perfect for absorbing impacts. Obviously this means
      stronger and lighter cars, laptops, and armored vehicles but,
      since the process takes all of about 10 seconds, it's also more
      energy efficient and cheaper than traditional steel making. Now,
      who has the number for the Nobel Prize committee? <br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] These inventions relate to treated iron-based alloys, and
      more particularly relate to processes and apparatuses for
      transforming and/or shaping the same and the various materials
      resulting therefrom obtained by treating low, medium, and high
      carbon steel and other iron-based alloys to a complex steel
      microstructure which may include portions of bainite, coalesced
      bainite, acicular ferrite, retained austenite and/or martensite
      and combinations thereof by micro-treating said iron based alloy.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] Traditionally, metallurgists have wanted to take low
      quality metals, such as low carbon steel, and turn them into high
      quality steels and more desirable products through inexpensive
      treatments, including annealing, quenching, and tempering to name
      a few. Previous attempts have met with limited success in that
      they did not always produce a desirable product. Other attempts
      have failed on a large scale due to high processing costs or the
      need to ultimately incorporate expensive alloying.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Processing of high strength steel generally takes intense
      capital equipment, high expenditures, expensive and dangerous
      heated fluids, such as quenching oils and quenching salts, and
      tempering/annealing processes which include the use of ovens,
      heated equipment, and residual heat from pouring molten steel.
      These quenching procedures are intended to raise the hardness of
      the steel to a desirable value. Bainite and martensite can be made
      by these processes and are very desirable materials for certain
      high strength applications as they generally have Rockwell C
      hardness of from about 30 and up. The increased hardness
      correlates to a comparable increase in tensile strength.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Typical Advanced High Strength Steels have generally
      included bainitic and/or martensitic phases. Bainite is generally
      acicular steel structured of a combination of ferrite and carbide
      that exhibits considerable toughness while combining high strength
      with high ductility. Usually formed by austempering, bainite is a
      very desirable product. One practical advantage of bainitic steels
      is that relatively high strength levels can be obtained together
      with adequate ductility without further heat treatment, after the
      bainite reaction has taken place. Such steels, when made as a low
      carbon alloy, are readily weldable, and bainite will form in the
      heat-affected zone adjacent to the weld metal, thereby reducing
      the incidence of cracking. Furthermore, these steels having a
      lower carbon content tend to improve the weldability and reduce
      stresses arising from transformation. When bainite is formed in
      medium and high carbon steels, weldability is reduced due to the
      higher carbon content.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The other conventional high strength steel, martensite, is
      another acicular steel made of a hard, supersaturated solid
      solution of carbon in a body-centered tetragonal lattice of iron.
      It is generally a metastable transitional structure formed during
      a phase transformation called a martensitic transformation or
      shear transformation in which larger workpieces of austenized
      steel may be quenched to a temperature within the martensite
      transformation range and held at that temperature to attain
      equalized temperature throughout before cooling to room
      temperature. Martensite in thinner sections is often quenched in
      water. Since chemical processes accelerate at higher temperatures,
      martensite is easily destroyed by the application of heat. In some
      alloys, this effect is reduced by adding elements such as tungsten
      that interfere with cementite nucleation, but, more often than
      not, the phenomenon is exploited instead. Since quenching can be
      difficult to control, most steels are quenched to produce an
      overabundance of martensite, and then tempered to gradually reduce
      its concentration until the right structure for the intended
      application is achieved. Too much martensite leaves steel brittle,
      whereas too little martensite leaves it soft.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0007] In accordance with the present invention, low grade ferrous
      alloys in strips, sheets, bars, plates, tubes, workpieces and the
      like are converted into multi-phase high strength steels with a
      minimum of cost, time and effort. Dual and multiple phase
      materials are achievable by practicing the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] There are provided methods and apparatuses for extremely
      rapid micro-treating of low carbon iron-based alloys and articles
      made from and containing those alloys. The iron-based, or ferrous,
      alloys/articles start out having a first microstructure prior to
      the micro-treating, and are converted into a second microstructure
      by rapid heating and rapid cooling into high strength steels on at
      least a portion of the alloy/article.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] A method for rapidly micro-treating an iron-based alloy is
      disclosed for forming at least one phase of a high strength alloy,
      where the method comprises the steps of providing an iron-based
      alloy having a first micro-structure with an austenite conversion
      temperature. This first microstructure is capable of being
      transformed to an iron-based alloy having a second micro-structure
      including the above mentioned phases by rapidly heating at an
      extremely high rate, such as 600[deg.] F./sec to 5000[deg.]
      F./sec. The traditional austenitic conversion temperatures are
      elevated for given alloys due to the short duration of the thermal
      cycle initiated by the rapid heating.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] This heating step involves nearly immediate heating of the
      iron-based alloy to a selected temperature above its austenite
      conversion temperature. Then, the alloy is immediately quenched,
      also at an extremely fast rate, i.e. 600[deg.] F./sec to
      10,000[deg.] F./sec on at least a portion of the iron-based alloy
      in a quenching unit adjacent the heating unit. This procedure
      forms at least one phase of a high strength alloy in a desired
      area, depending upon where the treatment was performed. Extremely
      rapid quenching will form at least one phase of a high strength
      alloy, as described more fully herein below.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Quenching may be accomplished nearly instantaneously by
      various methods and apparatuses, including water baths, water
      sprays, chilled forming dies, air knives, open air convection,
      final operation chilled progressive dies, final stage chilled line
      dies, chilled roll forming dies, and quenching hydroforms among
      others.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Rapid quenching closely following rapid austenization has
      been shown to develop a dual hardness microstructure as
      illustrated in the attached drawings, herein incorporated by
      reference. Experimentation has shown that flash processing of AISI
      4130 yields multiple hardness peaks of approximately 525 and 625
      Vickers hardness. The combination of hardnesses has been verified
      by single sensor differential thermal analysis showing that two
      temperature ranges have transformation occurring during the single
      quenching operation. In AISI 4130, transformation occurs from 650C
      to 550C and again from 470C to 360C during water cooling.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] While the phenomena for this double cooling transformation
      is not fully understood, multiple theories are present. The first
      is that since the steel is rapidly heated and carbon leveling has
      not occurred that carbon enriched areas transform to martensite
      while lesser carbon areas transform to bainite.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Another possible theory is that the upper transformation
      temperature occurs when austenite transforms to nano-scale
      platelets. The second transformation occurrence during cooling is
      the coalescing of the platelets into larger plates. This leads us
      to another embodiment of this invention. Since a double
      transformation is occurring, one could allow the first
      transformation to occur but halt the second. For example, rapidly
      heat the iron based alloy, a few seconds later, quench the iron
      alloy in a medium that is below the first transformation finish
      temperature but above the second transformation start temperature.
      The material would complete the first transformation but never get
      to the second transformation.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] This may cause for example, the first stage of Flash
      Bainite to form, for example, just the nano coalesced bainite
      phase, but then leave a significant amount of another phase,
      possibly retained austenite, or some other austenite daughter
      product. The material could then be brought down from the
      temperature between the first transformation end temperature (i.e.
      550C) and the second transformation start temperature (470C).<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        DRAWINGS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0026] It is a first aspect of the present invention to provide an
      inexpensive, quick and easy way to produce a low, medium, or high
      carbon iron-based alloy containing an appreciable percentage of
      nano-sized platelet bainite while having some of the desirable
      mechanical properties of nano-sized laths of martensite. While
      other thermo-mechanical processing techniques require lengthy
      thermal processing to obtain a complex bainitic-martensitic
      microstructure, flash bainite processing does so with a single,
      rapid quenching operation which takes less than 10 seconds from
      above the lower austenitic temperature to below the lower
      martensitic temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] It is a second aspect of the present invention to provide a
      method and apparatus for micro-treating low, medium, or high
      carbon iron-based alloys to contain a desirable quantity of flash
      bainite processed complex microstructural material with bainite
      and martensite interspersed within the same prior austenitic
      grains. The micro-treated low, medium, or high carbon iron-based
      alloy may have varying thicknesses for different applications and
      may be readily weldable while having high tensile strength, along
      with the ability to save material and reduce weight. One aspect of
      the present invention for the elevated interruption temperature is
      to use a quench medium at this temperature that could be molten
      salts, among others. This aspect causes the first iron based alloy
      transformation that is stopped by molten salt. All other iron
      alloy transformations are intentionally occurring in molten salt
      through either continuous cooling transformation or time
      temperature transformation. From this temp, 550-470[deg.] C., the
      steel could be cooled in a manner in which the remaining austenite
      is brought down to ambient temperature with either no further
      transformation occurring or transformation to some other desirable
      austenite daughter phases.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Another aspect of this invention has to do with the heating
      and quenching apparatus. Other previously filed patent
      applications for apparatus employ single or multiple heating and
      quenching heads to cool the material. The present method employs a
      single heating unit to heat multiple pieces of material. For
      example, a rectangular induction coil could have material passing
      by it and heated both inside and outside of the coil. If the coil
      were appropriately sized, a rectangular tube could be heated
      inside the coil while other pieces, such as pieces of bar stock
      could be heated on the outside of the coil simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Another aspect of this invention has to do with heating
      interrupted pieces of material. For example, a strip could have
      multiple cutouts removed from its shape. These pieces could be
      manufacture in the soft state and then Flash Bainite Processed in
      their final hardness state. Sometimes, when such a strip is
      heated, the edges near the cutouts will concentrate heat and melt
      the corners. The present aspect of this invention will allow plugs
      of similar material to be held in place of the interruptions to
      absorb the heat. This will thus prevent the melted corners.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The concept of rapid heating, quenching, reheating, and
      quenching was discussed in my previous patent applications filed
      on Oct. 2, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference,
      referring to an iron based alloy component. The method could be
      applied as well to a rolling strip of metal. A similar thermal
      technique known as quench and partitioning has been used. Quench
      and partitioning technology austenizes steel over many minutes,
      quenches to below the martensite start temperature, either holds
      temp or reheats below martensitic start temperature and then
      quenches to ambient. Another aspect of Quench and partitioning
      technology austenizes steel over many minutes, quenches to below
      the martensite start temperature, reheats above martensitic start
      temperature and bainite finish temperature and then quenches to
      ambient after a desired amount of transformation has occurred. The
      present innovation is a new technique of Quench/Partition
      technology. As before with an iron based alloy part, the heater
      will rapidly austenize the steel strip, quench the material to
      enact a transformation, hold or reheat with the second heater to a
      subaustenitic temperature to stabilize or transform the existing
      microstructure, and then quench to room temp with the second
      quench.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The resulting high strength steel may include at least one
      portion of the resulting high strength material made of coalesced
      bainite, bainite, martensite, ferrite, austenite, pearlite, and/or
      dual or complex phase combinations thereof, depending on the
      placement of the treatments described and claimed herein below.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Complex phase materials can be made, such as martensite and
      bainite located next to ferrite. These highly desired complex
      phase materials are achievable in the same workpiece by quenching
      only in various patterns so that a pattern of high strength steel
      can be manufactured in desired areas across the surface and/or
      cross section of an article after it has been heated. By only
      quenching certain areas, various material phases are possible in
      various locations where desired.<br>

      [0033] Looking first with combined reference to FIGS. 1A and 1B,
      there can be seen that the flash bainite includes a bi-modal
      distribution of platelets or plates which exhibit highly desirable
      combinations of strength, ductility and toughness. The flash
      processing of the present invention creates almost distortion free
      flat sheets, bars, plates and straight tubing. As can be seen in
      these figures, the microstructure produces a fine grain structure
      within the bi-modal distribution of microstructures which yields
      the surprising strength and ductility.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] With reference to FIG. 2A, a graph is shown charting
      temperature in degrees C. versus time in seconds to illustrate the
      cooling cycle as processed at the inside wall of one of the test
      tubes. Typical temperature measurements of this inside wall are
      showing that there is a very low temperature-time history ratio.
      In this particular example, utilizing AIS 414130 sheet metal
      tubing has a lower temperature to time history ratio.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Looking now to FIG. 2B, there is shown a graph of
      temperature versus time showing the flash processing temperature
      to time history ratio in addition to the conventional continuous
      annealing temperature to time history. Clearly, the temperature to
      time history ratio for the continuous annealing is much greater
      than that ratio for the flash processing.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] FIG. 3 illustrates an analysis of temperature in degrees
      centigrade versus the change in temperature also in degrees
      centigrade. This analysis shows transformations at between 550 and
      649 degrees C. and 360 to 459 degrees C. This analysis suggests
      that we have two different transformation conditions leading to
      very localized microstructural heterogeneity, although
      experiencing homogeneity on a macro scale.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Looking now to FIGS. 4A and 4B collectively, there can be
      seen two mechanical heterogeneity analyses showing that there are
      two distinct regions of microstructure between the raw material
      and the flash processed material in accordance with the present
      invention. These findings are consistent with the previous
      analyses showing two separate transformations during the flash
      processing procedure. Both FIG. A and FIG. B are graphs of
      normalized frequencies versus hardness, which illustrates the
      distribution of hardness. FIG. 4A shows the base metal hardness
      distribution as very slight, while the material that has proceeded
      through flash processing illustrates both a high hardness zone as
      well as a low hardness zone over a broader distribution of
      hardness.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Looking now to FIG. 5, yet another aspect of the invention
      is illustrated with fully strengthened with AISI 1010 material
      that has been flash processed. This graph shows elongation versus
      peak flash temperatures, to show that the highest flash
      temperature, 1180 degrees C. having an elongation of 7.9%. At a
      peak flash temperature of 1010 degrees C., the elongation
      percentage is 5.6. Optimum elongation is found at larger grain
      sizes. The chemistry of this material in percent by weight is 0.10
      C, 0.31 Mn, less than 0.01 Si, sulfur, phosphorus, and 99.41 iron.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Last, we look at FIG. 6, which is a graph of tensile
      strength in KSI versus tensile strain in percentage. With an
      example of AISI 1020 after heating to various temperatures in a
      range from 400 to 700 degrees C., 8 examples are shown with
      varying widths in inches. This experiment shows that even after
      300 seconds of tempering at 500 degrees C., flash processed AISI
      1020 will retain 79% of its "as quenched" tensile strength.
      Furthermore, the elongation does not drop to + or -5% with less
      than 5 seconds of tempering.<br>
      <br>
