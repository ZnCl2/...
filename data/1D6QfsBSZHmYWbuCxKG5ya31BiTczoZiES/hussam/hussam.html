            $1Million Prize</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      <b>Professor Abul Hussam</b>, who teaches chemistry and
      biochemistry at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., won the
      Grainger Challenge Gold Award for Sustainability for inventing the
      filter, which consists of two polyurethane buckets lined with
      sand, brick, wood and iron composites that eliminate arsenic,
      which can cause organ failure and death. Hussam and his brother,
      Dr. Abul Munir, a physician, established a laboratory in
      Bangladesh that they called SONO. The filter was invented there
      after Hussam spent two years developing procedures to effectively
      measure arsenic levels in water. He introduced the filter in 1999.
      "This is amazing," said George Mason President Alan Merten.
      "Having access to clean water is a basic human right. If you don't
      have clean water, the rest are irrelevant." The filters are
      inexpensive to produce and easy to use. Once water is drawn from a
      well, it is poured directly into the SONO filter. The clean water
      is then collected by a bucket attached to the filter, which can
      produce 20 liters of arsenic-free water per hour. Hussam says
      tainted drinking water affects many poor residents of Bangladesh.
      Since he developed the filter, he has distributed 30,000 of them,
      most for free. His brother runs the SONO laboratory and works to
      spread the word on the filters. Part of the challenge is educating
      people to change their ways and use the filters on a regular
      basis, Hussam said. "We've learned how to popularize the filter.
      Basically what were doing is changing people's habits," Hussam
      said. For about US $35 they can last at least 5 years without
      presenting a toxic waste disposal hazard. New models are developed
      for community scale use with flow rate exceeding 100 L per hour.
      The filters are made from indigenous materials.<br>

      </b><b>Abul Hussam</b><br>
      <br>
      Abul Hussam is the inventor of the Sono arsenic filter. He is a
      chemistry Professor at George Mason University (GMU) in Fairfax,
      Virginia and a member of advisory board at Shahjalal University of
      Science and Technology.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Life and career</b><br>
      <br>
      Dr. Abul Hussam was born in Kushtia, and raised in Bangladesh,
      Hussam moved to the United States in 1978 for graduate studies.
      Later he received a doctorate in analytical chemistry and became a
      naturalized citizen of USA. The Centreville, Virginia resident has
      spent much of this career trying to devise a solution to the
      problem of arsenic contamination of groundwater in Eastern India
      and Bangladesh.<br>
      <br>
      Hussam started working on this problem since 1993.[1] His final
      innovation is a simple, maintenance-free system that uses sand,
      charcoal, bits of brick and shards of a type of cast iron. The
      filter removes almost every trace of arsenic from well water. The
      wells brought fresh groundwater to farmers and others who
      previously had been drinking from bacteria- and virus-laced ponds
      and mudholes.[2]<br>
      <br>
      He also had to devise a way to find an accurate way to measure
      arsenic in water. This was achieved in the early to the mid 90's.<br>
      <br>
      The National Academy of Engineering announced on 1 February 2007
      that the 2007 Grainger challenge Prize for Sustainability would go
      to Hussam.[3] Hussam's invention is already in use today,
      preventing serious health problems in residents of the professor's
      native Bangladesh. This includes a $1 million engineering prize -
      and Hussam plans to use most of the money to distribute the
      filters to needy communities around the world.<br>
      <br>
      Hussam said he plans to use 70 percent of his prize so the filters
      can be distributed to needy communities. He said 25 percent will
      be used for more research, and 5 percent will be donated to
      GMU.[2]<br>
      <br>
      The 2007 sustainability prize is funded by the Grainger Foundation
      of Lake Forest, Illinois, and the contest was set up to target the
      arsenic problem. Among the criteria for winning was an affordable,
      reliable and environmentally friendly solution to the arsenic
      problem that did not require electricity...<br>

      amount of at least approximately 4 µg per gram of an active
      material. In embodiments, sulfur may be present in an amount
      between approximately 300 µg per gram of an active material and
      1000 µg per gram of an active material. In embodiments, chromium
      may be present in an amount between approximately 300 µg per gram
      of an active material and 500 µg per gram of an active material.
      In embodiments, copper may be present in an amount between
      approximately 300 µg per gram of an active material and 600 µg per
      gram of an active material. In embodiments, zinc may be present in
      an amount between approximately 8 µg per gram of an active
      material and 20 µg per gram of an active material.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] According to embodiments, a support material may include
      one or more fibers. In embodiments, one or more fibers may include
      one or more polymers, which may be synthetic and/or natural

      may include a cylinder, cone, square, rectangle and/or amorphous
      shape, and/or may include one or more removable portions. In
      embodiments, one or more fabrics may be removeably and/of
      replaceably disposed in a housing, and/or may be in any
      configuration. In embodiments, one or more fabrics may be disposed
      in a housing in a stacked configuration, horizontal and/or
      vertical configuration. In embodiments, a housing may include any
      selected dimension, for example a length of approximately 9.0 cm
      and a diameter of approximately 1.5 cm.<br>

      [0024] Referring to example FIG. 2, a filter apparatus may include
      a plurality of filter compositions 230, 240 disposed in housing
      210. In embodiments, filter compositions may be substantially the
      same and/or different. In embodiment, for example, filter
      composition 230 may include a different weight percent of iron
      than filter composition 240, may have an average diameter particle
      size larger than the average particle size of filter composition
      240, and/or include a support material having different
      composition and/or morphology than filter composition 240.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] As illustrated in one aspect of embodiments in FIG. 2,
      housing 210 may be in the approximate form of a cylinder, and/or
      filter compositions 230, 240 may be round cut to form a filter
      stack in a housing. Housing 210 may include an input, for example
      input 212 to input influent 250, and/or may include an output, for
      example output 214 to output effluent 260 in one aspect of
      embodiments. In embodiments, influent may include a target, and/or
      effluent may include relatively less target than influent, which
      may include substantially no target and/or an accepted amount of
      target for a desired use. In embodiments, one or more fabric
      compositions may sequester one or more targets.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] According to embodiments, influent may be admitted to
      housing 210 and/or effluent may leave housing 210 by any suitable
      process, including pressure and/or gravity. In embodiments, input
      212 and/or output 214 may be any suitable input and/or output,
      including an opening, a valve, a stopper, a pipe and/or a spigot.
      In embodiments, housing 210 may include one or more removable
      portions, for example a removable portion of a sidewall, such that
      influent, effluent and/or a filter composition may be added,
      deleted and/or replaced.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] According to embodiments, an input and/or output may be
      included at any location of a housing. Input 212 may be on an
      opposite side of housing 210 relative to output 214, as
      illustrated in one aspect of embodiments in FIG. 2, and/or input
      212 may be on the same side of housing 210 relative to output 214,
      as illustrated in one aspect of embodiments in example FIG. 3. In
      embodiments, a portion of an input and/or an output may be
      adjacent a side of a housing and/or may be partially and/or
      completely disposed in a housing. As illustrated in one aspect of
      embodiments in FIG. 3, a portion of input 212 may be disposed in
      housing 210 and/or a portion of output 214 may be adjacent a side
      of housing 210. In embodiments, a portion of an input and/or an
      output may traverse one or more filter compositions. In
      embodiments, an input may employ the same flow path as an output.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] According to embodiment, a filter apparatus may include one
      or more layers of other components. In embodiments, other
      components may include sand, sand-charcoal, sand-brick chips
      and/or sand-gravel interface. As illustrated in one aspect of
      embodiments in example FIG. 4, one or more layers 410 may be
      disposed between filter composition 240. In embodiments, any
      suitable combination of component layers and filter compositions
      may be employed, including within the same housing and/or across a
      plurality of housings, in any arrangement such as in series and/or
      in parallel arrangements.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] According to embodiments, a filter composition and/or a
      filter apparatus may be employed to filter a liquid, which may
      carry a target to be sequestered. In embodiments, inorganic and/or
      organic material may be removed from a liquid, for example toxic
      and/or non-toxic anions and/or cations. In embodiments, arsenic,
      for example As(III) and/or As(V), chromate, for example Cr(VI),
      cadmium, for example Cd(II), manganese, zinc, lead and/or other
      heavy metal ions may be removed from a liquid, which may include
      water. In embodiments, a fluid contacting one or more filter
      compositions to filter one or more targets may include allowing a
      fluid to pass through one or more filter compositions.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] According to embodiments, a process of filtering a target
      may include providing a support material, allowing an active
      material to be embedded in a support material and/or allowing a
      target to contact a filter composition. According to embodiments,
      a process of filtering a target may include removing one or more
      targets from a liquid. In embodiments, a liquid may include water,
      for example fresh water, such as tap, distilled, deionized, well,
      lake, pond, river, stream, portable and/or well water. In
      embodiments, a filtered liquid may be used for any suitable
      purpose, for example for consumption and/or industrial use.
      Industrial use may include, for example, biomedical and/or
      manufacturing use.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] As illustrated in one aspect of embodiments in FIGS. 2 and
      3, influent 250 is admitted to housing 210 through input 212,
      passes through filter compositions 230, 240 and leaves housing 210
      as effluent 260 through output 214. As illustrated in one aspect
      of embodiments in example FIG. 4, influent 250 is admitted to
      housing 210 through input 212, passes through filter composition
      240 and component layer 410, and leaves housing 210 as effluent
      260 through output 214. In embodiments, influent may be water
      including arsenic, and/or filter compositions 230, 240 may include
      one or more fibers in the form of one or more fabrics having one
      or more active materials embedded therein, disposed in housing 210
      in a stacked configuration.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] According to embodiments, for example where water is
      filtered for consumption, a filter composition and/or device may
      be employed in a home, in a water plant and/or therebetween.
      Referring to example FIG. 6, a filter apparatus is illustrated in
      accordance with one aspect of embodiments. In embodiments, filter
      apparatus 620 may include one or more filter compositions. In
      embodiments, filter apparatus 620 may be configured to be
      removeably attached to faucet 610, for example including a
      threaded portion that cooperates with a corresponding faucet
      threaded portion. In embodiments, water exiting faucet 610 may be
      admitted to filter apparatus 620 and contact one or more filter
      compositions. In embodiments, water contacting one or more filter
      compositions may be allowed to exit filter apparatus 620 such that
      effluent includes a reduced concentration of a target, which may
      be a substantially free amount of a target. In embodiments, a
      fluid contacting one or more filter compositions may include
      allowing a fluid to pass through one or more filter compositions.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Referring to example FIG. 7, a filter apparatus is
      illustrated in accordance with one aspect of embodiments. In
      embodiments, filter apparatus 730 may include one or more filter
      compositions. In embodiments, one or more filter composition may
      be removable from filter apparatus 730 and/or container 700, for
      example when a filter composition is saturated with target.
      Removing one or more filter compositions may be determined by any
      criteria, for example according to the volume of filtered fluid,
      lapsed time and/or visual inspection.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] According to embodiments, water exiting faucet 710 may be
      admitted to reservoir 720 and contact one or more filter
      compositions. In embodiments, one or more reservoirs 720 and/or
      one or more filter apparatuses 730 may be removable from container
      700. In embodiments, water contacting one or more filter
      compositions may be allowed to exit filter apparatus 730 such that
      effluent is collected in fluid chamber 740 of container 700. In
      embodiments, effluent may include a reduced concentration of a
      target, which may be a substantially free amount of a target. In
      embodiments, a target may be sequestered by one or more filter
      compositions. In embodiments, a fluid contacting one or more
      filter compositions may include allowing a fluid to pass through
      one or more filter compositions.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] According to embodiments, a process of forming a filter
      composition may include providing a support material and/or
      allowing an active material to be embedded in a support material.
      Referring to example FIG. 5, a process of forming a filter
      composition is illustrated in accordance with one aspect of
      embodiments. In embodiments, a process of forming a filter
      composition may include providing a support material having one or
      more fibers, which may be in the form of one or more fabric 510.
      In embodiments, a process of forming a filter composition may
      include allowing an active material to be embedded in a support
      material 520. In embodiments, an active material may include iron,
      manganese, carbon, phosphorous, aluminum, silicon, cerium, sulfur,
      chromium, copper and/or zinc.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] According to embodiments, a process of forming a filter
      composition may include any suitable process to provide a desired
      property of a filter composition, for example a desired dimension,
      elasticity, rigidity, porosity, tortuiosity, absorption and/or
      density of a filter composition. In embodiments, allowing an
      active material to be embedded in a support material may include
      maximizing active material surface area (m&lt;2&gt;) and/or
      particle density (g/m&lt;2&gt;). A process of forming a filtering
      composition may include sieving and/or separating an active
      material 530 as illustrated in one aspect of embodiments in FIG.
      5. In embodiments, an active material may be sieved to separate an
      active material based on morphology, for example to provide active
      material including particles having an average particle size of
      250 µm. In embodiments, an active material may be sieved for any
      reason, for example to purify an active material and/or to
      minimize particle size.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] According to embodiments, a process of forming a filter
      composition may include suspending an active material in a
      suspension. A process of forming a filtering composition may
      include contacting support material with a suspension having an
      active material, for example by soaking a support material in a
      suspension 540, as illustrated in one aspect of embodiments in
      FIG. 5. In embodiments, an active material may be processed, for
      example ground, sieved, and/or filtered prior to soaking a support
      material in a suspension. In embodiments, a support material may
      be soaked by placing a support material in a suspension and/or
      depositing a suspension on one or more sides of a support
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] According to embodiments, the filtration capacity of a
      filter composition and/or filter apparatus may be maximized. In
      embodiments, filtration capacity may be greater than approximately
      30 mg of target per gram of embedded active material. Filtration
      capacity may be relatively higher than related 10 mg capacity,
      although any capacity may be selected for a filtration
      composition, apparatus and/or process in accordance with aspects
      of embodiments. In embodiments, approximately 1 gram of embedded
      active material may remove approximately 100 µg/L of arsenic from
      approximately 50 gallons (approximately 200 L) in water.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Referring to example FIG. 8, filtration capacity is
      illustrated in accordance with one aspect of embodiments. In
      embodiments, approximately 3.1 mg of arsenic may be substantially
      completely sorbed per gram of embedded active material. In
      embodiments, arsenic content may be below the detection limit of a
      sensor, for example a Hydride Generation Atomic Fluorescence
      Spectrometer (HGAFS), which may be approximately 100
      parts-per-trillion (approximately a nanogram per liter), for
      example when 100, 300 and/or 1000 µg/L of arsenic contacts a
      filter composition in a approximate 16.0 mL filter apparatus. In
      embodiments, water may contact a filter composition at any desired
      rate, for example at a rate between approximately 1.8 mL/min and
      2.0 mL/min.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] According to embodiments, breakthrough may be minimized. In
      embodiments, there may be no substantial breakthrough even when
      influent may include approximately 100 times the United States
      Environmental Protection Agency limit for arsenic in drinking
      water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example Filter Embodiments</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>A. Overview</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0041] Preparation and/or testing efficiency of three filters was
      examined. CIM was embedded in two different types of polyester
      filter fabrics to prepare two relatively small filters, a first
      filter used in a Brita-type pitcher (filter BCF/Container 1) and a
      second filter used in a Rubbermaid type pitcher (filer
      DBF/Container 2), to filter drinking water. In one aspect of
      embodiments, approximately 3.6 g CIM material was embedded
      including a surface density of approximately 2.5 g/m&lt;2&gt;. A
      third filter was made in accordance with one aspect of embodiments
      illustrated in FIG. 2 and/or FIG. 8 (filter F2/Mini Column), where
      a total bed volume of approximately 16-18 ml and a surface density
      of 55.6 g CIM/m&lt;2 &gt;with a flow rate of approximately 1.8
      ml/min was employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Upon testing with 100 ppb, filter BCF provided
      approximately 75% removal on average for the first 6.0 L when
      unconditioned. Approximately 96% removal was observed for the
      first 6.0 L for a conditioned filter BCF. For filter DBF,
      approximately 60% removal was observed, on average. For filter F2,
      removal to concentration below 10 ppb target in effluent was
      achieved from a 4.0 L influent sample having 1000 ppb arsenic, and
      a capacity was calculated to be between approximately 12.3-30.0 mg
      As/g CIM material (embedded).<br>
      <br>
      <b>B. Embodiment Processes, Compositions and/or Devices</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Embodiment Filter Compositions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0043] Two different fabrics were selected for CIM embedding. One
      was polyester (approximately 0.05 cm thick) and the other was
      relatively bulky polyester (thickness approximately 0.40 cm). The
      fabrics were cut out pieces of approximately 5×5 and 10×10 cm
      size. The CIM was grounded and sieved through a 60 mesh
      (approximately 250 micron or 0.250 mm) standard testing strainer.
      A suspension of CIM was prepared in a ratio of approximately 1.0
      g/100 mL DI water. The fabrics of approximately 5×5 cm pieces were
      soaked in a 500 mL plastic beaker containing the CIM suspension of
      approximately 500 mL and 5.0 g of CIM, accompanied with
      discontinuous stifling over night. The fabrics were weighted and
      numbered before placing into the CIM suspension.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The following day, the fabrics turned a dark brownish color
      and were embedded with CIM. The fabrics were taken out and air
      dried. The substantially dry fabrics were weighted. Continued
      stirring appeared to be more effective in embedding compared to a
      process which omitted the use of a stirrer. The quantity of CIM
      embedding was calculated by the gravimetric method. The CIM
      embedding data for the approximate 5×5 cm pieces of the fabric was
      recorded, and is illustrated in Example Table 1, discussed below.
      On an average, the CIM sorption was found to be between
      approximately 2.5 and 55.6 g/m&lt;2 &gt;in relatively thin and
      thick fabric, respectively. However, any sorption may be provided
      by modifying peramaters, for example particle size, embedding
      processes and/or support material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Embodiment Filter Apparatus</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0045] A Brita-type column with changing cone radius of 2.0 and
      2.5 cm was used. CIM embedded fabrics were cut out in the
      approximate shape of a circle, with a radius of 2.0 cm and 2.5.
      Two filters were made using the two different type CIM embedded
      fabrics. Relatively thin fabrics were used to make filter BCF and
      relatively thicker fabrics were used to make filter DBF. The
      compartment housing the filter compositions were filled
      substantially completely with CIM embedded fabrics. A total of 364
      thin circular pieces of fabric were used for filter BCF and 156
      thick pieces were used for filter DBF. The calculated amount of
      CIM in filter BCF and/or filter DBF was between approximately 2.5
      and 55.6 g/m&lt;2&gt;, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Arsenic solution was allowed to flow through the column bed
      (top to bottom; end flow mode) and to drain out. For filter BCF,
      arsenic (III) spiked DI water samples (100 ppb) were passed with a
      down flow direction at a flow rate of approximately 38.5 mL/min to
      evaluate column efficiency for arsenic (III) removal. The effluent
      filtered water was sampled at approximately every 1.0 L until the
      completion of the experiment. For filter DBF, 100 ppb arsenic
      (III) solution was passed through with substantially the same flow
      rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] A third filter apparatus was manufactured in accordance
      with one aspect of embodiments as illustrated in example FIG. 2.
      Filter fabric (e.g., polyester) was used as a support material. It
      was a relatively coarse and thick material, for example having a
      thickness of approximately 0.4 cm. This column was made with 33
      circular pieces having a CIM loading density of approximately 55.6
      g/m&lt;2 &gt;to substantially fill the column.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The substantially dried cloths were cut into an approximate
      shape of a circle with the radius of approximately 0.8 cm. The CIM
      embedded fabrics were relatively tightly packed to create part of
      a mini column. A total of 33 pieces were wet-packed in an
      approximate 5.2 inch (13.2 cm) column height. The area of each
      circular piece was the surface area of the disk.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Embodiment Chemicals Used</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0049] Chemicals used were analytical grade, and substantially all
      stock solutions were prepared with double distilled water from a
      Millipore purification system (Billerica, Mass., USA). Glass
      materials and plastic bottles were washed with distilled water and
      exposed overnight to a 5% nitric acid solution. The standard stock
      As (III) solution (1000 mg/L) was prepared by the dissolution of
      reagent grade NaAsO2 in approximate 1.0 L double distilled water
      containing approximately 0.1% ascorbic acid. This solution was
      kept refrigerated in an amber bottle. An approximate 1.0 mg/L
      working stock solution was made by dilution with approximately
      0.1% ascorbic acid solution and refrigerated in an amber bottle.
      Dilute As (III) standards were prepared daily. The reducing
      solution was sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Sigma-Aldrich, USA)
      approximately 0.7% (m/v) in approximately 0.5% (m/v) sodium
      hydroxide (ACS grade). The HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) concentration
      of approximately 3.0 M was prepared contained approximately 1% KI
      and 0.2% ascorbic acid.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Embodiment Analytical Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0050] Automated Hydride Generation Atomic Fluorescence
      Spectrometer (HGAFS) was used for determination of arsenic to
      trace and ultra trace levels. The gaseous products were flushed
      from the gas/liquid separator by a controlled stream of purge gas,
      for example argon. As the reaction liquids are pumped into the
      separator and the purge gas carries the gaseous products into the
      measurement system, a pressure differential is set up the two arms
      of the U-tube. The gaseous products from the gas/liquid separator
      pass through a Perma Pure Dryer System to the detector. A boosted
      hollow cathode arsenic lamp excitation source was used to excite
      the atomized arsenic and obtain the fluorescence spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] A flow injection-hydride generation-atomic florescence
      spectrometry (FI-HG-AFS) technique was used for determination of
      arsenic in the samples. The system was maximized with
      approximately 3.0 M HCl, flow rate of approximately 4.5 ml
      min&lt;-1&gt;, 0.7% NaBH4 flow rate of approximately 2 ml
      min&lt;-1 &gt;and carrier gas (e.g., argon) flow rate of
      approximately 325 ml min&lt;-1&gt;. In the FI-HG-AFS system, the
      sample was introduce into a carrier stream of approximately 3.0 M
      HCl in approximately 1% KI and 0.2% ascorbic acid using a
      peristaltic pump. The sample, together with carrier solution, met
      subsequently with a continuous stream of NaBH4 dissolved in
      approximately 0.5% sodium hydroxide. Mixing HCl with NaBH4
      generated hydride (arsine), which subsequently entered into the
      gas-liquid separator apparatus. Concentration of NaBH4 should be
      maintained to ensure flame ignition. The stability of the flame is
      dependent on the regulation of H2 gas flow. The reaction is as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      As(O)(OH)3+H&lt;+&gt;+BH4&lt;-&gt;?As(OH)3+H2O<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      As(OH)3+3BH4&lt;-&gt;+3H&lt;+&gt;?AsH3+3BH3+3H2O<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      BH3+H2O?H3BO3+H2<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The hydrides and excess hydrogen are swept out of the
      generation vessel using a stream of argon into a chemically
      generated hydrogen diffusion flame. The hydrides are atomized and
      the resulting atoms are detected by atomic fluorescence. Peak
      signals were recorded using a computer linked to the atomic
      florescence spectrophotometer (AFS) that is capable of both peak
      height and peak area measurement. The detection limit of our
      HG-AFS with 95% confidence level was 1 µg/L for arsenic.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Samples were prepared. Approximately one milliliter of
      filtered water and 4.0 mL of reagent (approximately 3.0 M HCl in
      1% KI and 0.2% ascorbic acid) solution was prepared, and analyzed
      after a period of time, for example at least after 30 minutes. The
      samples were made from each consecutive liters of arsenic (III)
      contaminated water passed through a filter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>C. Embodiment Results</b><b><br>

      <b>1. Embodiment Arsenic Sorption in Filter BCP</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0054] Filter BCP was used to examine arsenic removal efficiency
      without conditioning the filter. Conditioning for arsenic removal
      may allow oxidation and/or rusting of CIM and/or may maximize
      effectiveness. Example Table 1 illustrated arsenic removal
      efficiency and total volume of water filtered by the filter BCF
      before conditioning. The results of amount of arsenic removed
      began to decline as more and more liters of H2O were passed
      through the column. On the 6th liter, the arsenic concentration
      was 16.1 ppb.<br>

      <br>
      [0055] A filter column was filled with water for one week to
      maximize hydration of the CIM for the formation of hydrous ferric
      oxide (HFO) through oxidation and/or rusting, and thus conditioned
      for active sorption site generation. Thereafter, each day
      approximately 1 L of water containing 1000 ppb arsenic was passed
      though the filter to measure if there was a difference due to the
      conditioning. The results were promising, as each day after the
      first week of conditioning the concentration of arsenic in the
      water decreased and on the 6th liter, the concentration was 1.6
      ppb much below the EPA 10 ppb limit for drinking water. The
      results are illustrated in example Table 2.<br>

      arsenic is illustrated at example FIG. 9. A linear trend is
      observed in decreasing percent removal of arsenic with increasing

      <b>2. Embodiment Arsenic Sorption in Filter DBF</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0057] Filter DBF was prepared using a polypropylene bottle that
      had a radius of approximately 2.0 cm. Fabrics, approximately 0.4
      cm thick polyester in an amount of 156 circular pieces, were used
      to make this bottle cartridge. This system is designed like a
      table-top water filter. A reservoir that is connected to a filter
      apparatus at a lower sidewall is fitted in a Rubbermaid-type
      container. About 500 ml water may be filtered at a time before
      filling up. Using this system, 6.0 L of water was filtered;
      however it was not conditioned first. The CIM embedded in the
      support material was approximately 2.5 grams, as illustrated in
      example Table 3.<br>

      [0058] The flow rate was approximately 500 ml/11 minutes. The
      relatively high flow rate and relatively less contact time could
      account for the effectiveness of this embodiment, as 60% of target
      in the first six liters of water was removed on average. The data
      is illustrated in example Table 4.<br>

      [0059] A graph was plotted to show the percent removal by filter
      DBF. It shows relatively good results for the first two liters
      passed. The graph is illustrated at example FIG. 10. Modifying
      parameters, for example filter composition size and/or flow rate
      may enhance effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Embodiment Arsenic Sorption in Filter F2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0060] Approximately 4.0 Liters of 1000 ppb water was passed
      through a column as illustrated in one aspect of embodiments in
      FIG. 2. Removal of arsenic may be enhanced, as illustrated in one
      aspect of embodiments at FIG. 11. Generally, the sorption capacity
      for arsenic of CIM may be 4.25 mg As/g CIM. Comparing the sorption
      capacity of CIM with the sorption capacity of a filter embedded
      with CIM, there appears to be a capacity of approximately four
      times greater than previously achieved, for example 12.33 mg As/g
      CIM. The graph is illustrated at example FIG. 12. Without being
      bound to any theory, active material surface area (e.g., CIM size)
      and/or embedding in a matrix may enhance capacity.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] While various embodiments have been described above, it
      should be understood that they have been presented by way of
      example, and not limitation. It will be apparent to persons
      skilled in the relevant art(s) that various changes in form and
      detail can be made therein without departing from the spirit and
      scope. In fact, after reading the above description, it will be
      apparent to one skilled in the relevant art(s) how to implement
      alternative embodiments. Thus, the present embodiments should not
      be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] For example, while embodiments show faucet and/or pitcher
      filters, filters may be employed in any device and/or container,
      for example in refrigerators and/or dispensers. Furthermore,
      filter compositions and/or devices may be employed at any position
      of a liquid flow path, for example disposed at an intermediate
      portion of a pipe by threaded couplers, adhesive couplers, elastic
      couplers, soldered couplers, etc. Moreover, a filter composition
      may be employed without a housing, for example disposing one or
      more filter compositions directly in a container having water,
      which may include gravitational, mechanical, and/or magnetic
      process to enhance sequestering of a target.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] As another non-limiting example, it may not be necessary to
      physically remove a filter composition, as any suitable process
      may be employed to desorb bound target to regenerate one or more
      filter compositions. Regeneration may be accomplished, for
      example, by washing one or more filter compositions with dilute
      aqueous sodium hydroxide and water, respectively. As a final
      non-limiting example, one or more filter compositions may be
      magnetically active and/or attracted to a magnetic filed, such
      that separation of species with similar magnetic properties,
      including paramagnetic species with externally induced magnetic
      fields, may be enhanced.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In addition, it should be understood that any figures which
      highlight the functionality and advantages, are presented for
      example purposes only. The disclosed architecture is sufficiently
      flexible and configurable, such that it may be utilized in ways
      other than that shown. For example, the steps listed in any
      flowchart may be re-ordered or only optionally used in some
      embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Further, the purpose of the Abstract of the Disclosure is
      to enable the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the public
      generally, and especially the scientists, engineers and
      practitioners in the art who are not familiar with patent or legal
      terms or phraseology, to determine quickly from a cursory
      inspection the nature and essence of the technical disclosure of
      the application. The Abstract of the Disclosure is not intended to
      be limiting as to the scope in any way.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Finally, it is the applicant's intent that only claims that
      include the express language “means for” or “step for” be
      interpreted under 35 U.S.C. 112, paragraph 6. Claims that do not
      expressly include the phrase “means for” or “step for” are not to
      be interpreted under 35 U.S.C. 112, paragraph 6.<br>
