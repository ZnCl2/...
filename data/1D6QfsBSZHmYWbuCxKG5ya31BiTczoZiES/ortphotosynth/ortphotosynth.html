Ort - Improving Photosynthetic Efficiency for Improved Crop Yield</span><br

</div>
<br>
April 28, 2018 - Increasing demands for global food production due to
global economic and population growth over the next several decades in
combination with globally shrinking cropland represents a huge
challenge to agriculture and the research enterprise that underpins it.
UN FAO and others forecast that increasing agricultural productivity by
as much as 60&#8211;120% over 2005 levels will be needed to meet agricultural
demand. This near doubling of food production will have to be
accomplished on globally declining acreage and during a time in which
there will be ever increasing demand on cultivated lands for the
production of bioenergy crops, while in the face of a changing global
environment that has already resulted in decreasing global yield of
some of the world&#8217;s most important food crops. Multiple new strategies
will be needed to meet this daunting challenge. There are good reasons
to believe that improving photosynthetic efficiency of crop plants
could make a large contribution toward meeting this food security
imperative. Ort represents Class VI.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixing photosynthetic inefficiencies</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
In some of our most useful crops (such as rice and wheat),
photosynthesis produces toxic by-products that reduce its efficiency.
Photorespiration deals with these by-products, converting them into
metabolically useful components, but at the cost of energy lost. South
et al. constructed a metabolic pathway in transgenic tobacco plants
that more efficiently recaptures the unproductive by-products of
photosynthesis with less energy lost (see the Perspective by Eisenhut
and Weber). In field trials, these transgenic tobacco plants were ~40%
more productive than wild-type tobacco plants.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">INTRODUCTION</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
Meeting food demands for the growing global human population requires
improving crop productivity, and large gains are possible through
enhancing photosynthetic efficiency. Photosynthesis requires the
carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) by
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO), but
photorespiration occurs in most plants such as soybean, rice, and wheat
(known as C3 crops) when RuBisCO oxygenates RuBP instead, requiring
costly processing of toxic byproducts such as glycolate.
Photorespiration can reduce C3 crop photosynthetic efficiency by 20 to
50%. Although various strategies exist for lowering the costs of
photorespiration, chamber- and greenhouse-grown plants with altered
photorespiratory pathways within the chloroplast have shown promising
results, including increased photosynthetic rates and plant size.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">RATIONALE</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
To determine if alternative photorespiratory pathways could effectively
improve C3 field crop productivity, we tested the performance of three
alternative photorespiratory pathways in field-grown tobacco. One
pathway used five genes from the Escherichia coli glycolate oxidation
pathway; a second pathway used glycolate oxidase and malate synthase
from plants and catalase from E. coli; and the third pathway used plant
malate synthase and a green algal glycolate dehydrogenase. All enzymes
in the alternative pathway designs were directed to the chloroplast.
RNA interference (RNAi) was also used to down-regulate a native
chloroplast glycolate transporter in the photorespiratory pathway,
thereby limiting metabolite flux through the native pathway. The three
pathways were introduced with and without the transporter RNAi
construct into tobacco, which is an ideal model field crop because it
is easily transformed, has a short life cycle, produces large
quantities of seed, and develops a robust canopy similar to that of
other field crops.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">RESULTS</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
Using a synthetic biology approach to vary promoter gene combinations,
we generated a total of 17 construct designs of the three pathways with
and without the transporter RNAi construct. Initial screens for
photoprotection by alternative pathway function under
high&#8211;photorespiratory stress conditions identified three to five
independent transformants of each design for further analysis. Gene and
protein expression analyses confirmed expression of the introduced
genes and suppression of the native transporter in RNAi plants. In
greenhouse screens, pathway 1 increased biomass by nearly 13%. Pathway
2 showed no benefit compared to wild type. Introduction of pathway 3
increased biomass by 18% without RNAi and 24% with RNAi, which were
consistent with changes in photorespiratory metabolism and higher
photosynthetic rates. Ultimately, field testing across two different
growing seasons showed &gt;25% increase in biomass of pathway 3 plants
compared to wild type, and with RNAi productivity increased by &gt;40%.
In addition, this pathway increased the light-use efficiency of
photosynthesis by 17% in the field.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">CONCLUSION</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
Engineering more efficient photorespiratory pathways into tobacco while
inhibiting the native pathway markedly increased both photosynthetic
efficiency and vegetative biomass. We are optimistic that similar gains
may be achieved and translated into increased yield in C3 grain crops
because photorespiration is common to all C3 plants and higher
photosynthetic rates under elevated CO2, which suppresses
photorespiration and increases harvestable yield in C3 crops.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
The world&#8217;s crop productivity is stagnating whereas population growth,
rising affluence, and mandates for biofuels put increasing demands on
agriculture. Meanwhile, demand for increasing cropland competes with
equally crucial global sustainability and environmental protection
needs. Addressing this looming agricultural crisis will be one of our
greatest scientific challenges in the coming decades, and success will
require substantial improvements at many levels. We assert that
increasing the efficiency and productivity of photosynthesis in crop
plants will be essential if this grand challenge is to be met. Here, we
explore an array of prospective redesigns of plant systems at various
scales, all aimed at increasing crop yields through improved
photosynthetic efficiency and performance. Prospects range from
straightforward alterations, already supported by preliminary evidence
of feasibility, to substantial redesigns that are currently only
conceptual, but that may be enabled by new developments in synthetic
biology. Although some proposed redesigns are certain to face obstacles
that will require alternate routes, the efforts should lead to new
discoveries and technical advances with important impacts on the global
problem of crop productivity and bioenergy production.<br>
<br>
Increasing demands for global food production over the next several
decades portend a huge burden on the world&#8217;s shrinking farmlands.
Increasing global affluence, population growth, and demands for a
bioeconomy (including livestock feed, bioenergy, chemical feedstocks,
and biopharmaceuticals) will all require increased agricultural
productivity, perhaps by as much as 60&#8211;120% over 2005 levels (e.g.,
refs. 1 and 2), putting increased productivity on a collision course
with environmental and sustainability goals (3). The 45 y from 1960 to
2005 saw global food production grow ~160%, mostly (135%) by improved
production on existing farmlands (4). If agricultural production is to
double by 2050, it will require at least a doubling of productivity per
hectare because cropland areas are shrinking, with little opportunity
to sustainably reverse this trend. Alas, growth in productivity of the
world&#8217;s major crops is stagnating in most of the important growing
areas (5, 6).<br>
<br>
What limits crop productivity? For most terrestrial crops it is usually
the availability of water (7, 8), and, although there are some
promising avenues to modestly increase water use efficiency, there are
few options for dramatically reducing the amount of water required to
grow a crop. The inability of photosynthesis to efficiently use high
midday light intensities (9) also strongly limits productivity compared
with hypothetical plants able to use high intensity light as
efficiently as low intensity light. The slow catalytic rate of the
carboxylation enzyme Rubisco is a major barrier to increasing the rate
of carbon assimilation at the leaf level. Although current Rubisco
properties may be an insurmountable barrier to increasing
photosynthetic rate to make full use of direct midday sunlight at the
level of an individual leaf, limitations due to Rubisco might be
substantially mitigated by improved sharing of light within a crop
canopy (10), by reengineering Rubisco (11), or by actively
concentrating CO2 at the active site of Rubisco (ref. 12 and as
discussed in Targets of Opportunity).<br>
<br>
The remarkable gains in productivity of the Green Revolution of the
late 20th century depended on improving yield potential: i.e., the
yield obtained with good nutrition in the absence of pests, diseases,
and drought. To a first approximation, yield potential is dependent on
the amount of solar energy available during the growing season and the
efficiencies with which the crop captures the photosynthetically active
light, converts it to biomass, and partitions the biomass into the
harvested product (13). During the Green Revolution, increases in yield
potential were driven primarily by large increases in the portion of
biomass partitioned into grain (i.e., harvest index), which is now near
its theoretical upper limit. Improved solar energy conversion
efficiency (i.e., photosynthetic efficiency) has so far played little
role in improving yield potential, yet photosynthesis is the only
determinant that is not close to its biological limits (14, 15). For
example, the progenitors of modern crop plants evolved in, and are thus
adapted to, an atmospheric [CO2] of about 240 ppm. The accelerated rate
of Rubisco-catalyzed carboxylation at today&#8217;s [CO2] of &gt;400 ppm has
led to a kinetic limitation in the regeneration of the CO2 acceptor
molecule ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), which will become
increasingly limiting as [CO2] increases further (16, 17). Fortunately,
there are a wide range of potential avenues to improve photosynthetic
efficiency along radically different paths than those dictated by
evolutionary selection on extant and emergent natural variation.<br>
<br>
Research over many decades has produced a sophisticated continuum of
understanding of photosynthesis from the initial photophysics of light
absorption and excitation energy transfer to gas exchange in leaf and
canopy. Recent advances in in silico modeling and increases in
computational power have been critical enabling technologies for
understanding photosynthetic processes, which can be used to predict
the outcomes of various redesigns of photosynthesis (e.g., refs. 10,
14, and 16). The remarkable achievements in synthesizing whole genomes
(18) are evidence that ambitious goals are within reach. Creative and
radically new ideas for redesigning photosynthesis are therefore worth
pursuing because even strategies that presently seem fanciful may
inspire new thinking in unimagined directions.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Targets of Opportunity</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Light Capture.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
A principal limitation of efficient photosynthesis is that organisms
absorb more light in full sunlight than they can use productively. The
reason seems clear: high absorptivity provides effective capture at low
light intensities, such as at dawn and dusk and on cloudy days, and it
obviates competition from other phototrophs by absorbing the light
before they do. It is generally agreed that the season-long solar
energy conversion efficiencies for crop plants in both temperate and
tropical zones typically do not exceed a few percent, which should be
compared with the theoretical maximum yield of about 12% (15, 19). A
large part of this inefficiency can be ascribed to the absorption of
more photons than can be used to drive useful photochemistry. This
excess energy needs to be carefully extinguished to avoid deleterious
photooxidations. Plants have a variety of mechanisms for safely
diverting excess absorbed energy, principally as thermal dissipation
(9), but they represent a significant loss in efficiency. If plants had
fewer light-harvesting pigments (e.g., chlorophylls and carotenoids)
per photosystem (10) and fewer photosystems in their uppermost leaves,
light might be absorbed more judiciously, and a greater proportion of
absorbed photons converted to biomass. This avenue has been pursued for
some years in algae and cyanobacteria, often with notable success (20,
21), but not yet convincingly in crop plants. Lowering leaf
absorptivity remains a significant opportunity for improving crop yield
(10) although it is worth noting that such highly efficient plants
might be at a disadvantage under some conditions, compared with
normally pigmented competitors, and could require careful plant
husbandry to realize their increased yield.<br>
<br>
'<span style="font-weight: bold;">Light Energy Conversion.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The fundamental thermodynamic principles controlling the conversion of
energy from sunlight to chemical or electrical potential energy have
been defined and demonstrated in the last 60 y. For reasons having more
to do with biological success than thermodynamic efficiency,
water-oxidizing (oxygenic) photosynthesis uses only about one half of
the sun&#8217;s energetically competent photons (&lt;700 nm) and uses two
photosystems operating in series (Fig. 1A) to span the redox space from
water oxidation to NADP+ reduction and to pump protons to provide
proton motive force (PMF). The two photosystems compete with each other
for photons rather than one of them taking advantage of the near-IR
region of the solar spectrum as do many photosynthetic bacteria (19).<br>
<br>

Schematics of tandem-photosystem, energy-coupling membranes for
water-oxidizing photosynthesis and synthesis of NAD(P)H. The region of
the solar spectrum driving each reaction center (RC) is indicated above
it. Black arrows indicate reactions, blue arrows represent electron
flow, and yellow arrows represent proton flow. (A) In current oxygenic
photosynthesis, photosystem II (PSII) uses visible light (400&#8211;700 nm)
to drive water oxidation and quinone reduction whereas photosystem I
(PSI) oxidizes plastocyanin (PC, or in some cases cytc) and reduces
NADP+ (via ferredoxin:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase). The Rieske/cytb complex
connects the two photosystems by catalyzing quinol oxidation and PC
reduction in a Q-cycle mechanism, resulting in additional PMF
generation (represented by the yellow arrow through the complex). PMF
is consumed by ATP synthase to drive phosphorylation of ADP (not
shown). Cyclic electron flow involving PSI and the cyt b6f complex is
not shown. (B) The PSII RC from A. marina (using light from 400 to 730
nm) delivers electrons from water oxidation for quinone reduction
whereas the BChl b-containing type 2 RC (operating out to 1,075 nm) and
the cyt b6f complex collaborate to maintain PMF via a cyclic electron
transfer loop. The NDH-1 complex consumes some proton-motive force
(PMF) to drive electron transfer from quinol to NAD(P)+ whereas the
rest is used by ATP synthase (not shown).<br>
<br>
Could a more efficient arrangement be engineered? One option would be
to replace photosystem I (PSI) (Fig. 1A) with a reaction center and its
associated cyclic electron transport machinery from a purple
photosynthetic bacterium that uses bacteriochlorophyll b in place of
the chlorophyll a used by oxygenic organisms. Blastochloris viridis is
one example, with its antenna system and reaction center acting in
concert with the cytochrome (cyt) b6f complex that would use light up
to 1,075 nm (19) to provide PMF. Further, if the chlorophyll a in
photosystem II (PSII) were replaced by chlorophyll d (as occurs in the
cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina, which uses light up to 730 nm) and
if the reduced quinone produced by this photosystem delivered electrons
directly to a NADH dehydrogenase operating &#8220;backwards&#8221; as it does in
purple bacteria (using PMF to drive the production of NADPH from
reduced quinone), one can envision the system of Fig. 1B. A
photosynthetic membrane having this arrangement of energy-transducing
complexes would have more than twice the energetic efficiency of
current oxygenic photosynthesis (19, 22) if the appropriate wavelengths
of light were directed to the two now very distinct photosystems.
Indeed, as our understanding of quantum coherence develops (22?&#8211;24), it
can be imagined that specific antenna could be &#8220;wired&#8221; to appropriate
reaction centers. Of course other possibilities can be envisioned, but
even before the powerful potential of synthetic biology is brought into
play, we can initiate the research required to reengineer
photosynthesis because, as illustrated in Fig. 1B, nature has provided
us with energy-transducing complexes that, in thought experiments,
could be combined in new tandem configurations to achieve a
near-optimum match of the solar spectrum to water oxidation and
carbohydrate/lipid synthesis.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Carbon Capture and Conversion.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Improving carbon uptake.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
A major limiting factor in carbon fixation is CO2 transport from the
intercellular airspace of leaves to the site of carboxylation within
the mesophyll chloroplast, entailing movement across several
compartments (25, 26). Although carbonic anhydrases are expected to
play a critical role, their function in CO2 conductance and delivery to
Rubisco has yet to be clearly defined. Algae and photosynthetic
bacteria have various CO2 channels and bicarbonate transporters to
increase the inorganic carbon flux into the cells, but these inorganic
transport devices are not present in the chloroplast membranes of
terrestrial plants. Introduction of CO2 channels and bicarbonate
transporters into photosynthetic cells of C3 plants and even into the
mesophyll cells of C4 plants is a logical strategy to improve
photosynthetic performance (12, 27). Achieving a higher CO2
concentration in the chloroplast would allow the endogenous Rubisco to
be replaced by a Rubisco with a lower CO2 affinity, but a higher kcat
(16), thus reducing the amount of Rubisco required by the plant and
improving nitrogen use efficiency. The lower intercellular CO2
concentration that would result from higher photosynthesis would likely
speed its diffusive replacement from the outside air, allowing stomata
to be open less, with the added benefit of improving water use
efficiency.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Improving carbon conversion.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
A major productivity limitation for many phototrophs is
photorespiration, an energetically expensive process in which the
undesirable oxygenase activity of Rubisco leads to a net loss of fixed
carbon and metabolic energy. Nature has evolved several strategies to
suppress oxygenation by sequestering Rubisco into compartments in which
CO2 is concentrated. C4 plants [for example, tropical grasses such as
sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and corn (Zea mays)] use
oxygen-insensitive phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase to initially capture
CO2 as malate in mesophyll cells. The malate is subsequently
decarboxylated in bundle sheath cells that contain Rubisco. Although
this concentrating of CO2 requires an additional investment of ATP,
there is an adequate return on this investment in the form of more
biomass. A coordinated international effort to introduce this ability
into rice has already produced exciting results (28). Although
significant hurdles remain, success will open the door to dramatically
improving the efficiency and yield of many of the world&#8217;s most
important staple crops. We note that, although classical C4 plants
exhibit substantial spatial separation of the carbon concentrating and
carbon fixation pathways within the leaf, there are plants that do this
C4 metabolism (albeit somewhat less efficiently) (29) within a single
cell (30), which has structurally simpler requirements and thus may be
easier to install in C3 leaves.<br>
<br>
An alternative approach would copy cyanobacterial CO2-concentrating
mechanisms, which are characterized by bicarbonate transporters and the
occurrence of Rubisco-containing microcompartments called carboxysomes.
Although plant chloroplasts clearly originated from a cyanobacterial
progenitor through endosymbiosis, none contain these devices, making
their introduction an attractive target for improving plant
photosynthetic efficiency. An important advance toward this goal was
the introduction of a carboxysome protein and functional cyanobacterial
Rubisco into a land plant that led to the aggregation of Rubisco within
chloroplasts as occurs during carboxysome biogenesis (31).<br>
<br>
Attempts to reengineer Rubisco with increased activity and substrate
specificity have failed, despite being guided by well-resolved crystal
structures and detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism (11,
32, 33). With seemingly little prospect for improving the kinetic and
catalytic features of native Rubiscos, it may be worthwhile to try to
&#8220;evolve&#8221; a new carboxylase with different kinetic constraints from a
different (perhaps smaller) protein scaffold. A smaller carboxylase
would have the additional benefit of reducing the nitrogen requirement
of the plant, a goal that might also be achieved by editing the
existing Rubisco to remove high-nitrogen content amino acids (such as
arginine) (34).<br>
<br>
If Rubisco&#8217;s oxygenation reaction cannot be significantly reduced, an
alternative approach would replace the native photorespiratory pathway
with more efficient synthetic pathways. Three different pathways that
metabolize glycolate have been explored so far (35, 36). Among them,
the conversion of glycolate into glycerate via glyoxylate and tartronic
semialdehyde can increase leaf photosynthetic CO2 uptake due to both
the decreased energy demand of photorespiration and increased CO2
concentration in chloroplasts (36). Another promising experimental
strategy is to introduce new anaplerotic pathways to recycle glycolate
without an associated CO2 loss, such as the 3-hydroxypropionate pathway
that converts glyoxylate to pyruvate in some bacteria (37, 38). It
might also be possible to design entirely novel pathways, including the
hypothetical one shown in Fig. 2, to reduce phosphoglycolate to
phosphoglycolaldehyde and then combine that product with
dihydroxyacetonephosphate to make xylulose bisphosphate, which could be
dephosphorylated to form the carbon reduction cycle intermediate
xylulose-5-phosphate.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 2.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Proposed de novo 2-phosphoglycolate salvage pathway. Calvin cycle in
red, photorespiratory pathway in black, de novo 2-phosphoglycolate
(2PG) salvage pathway in blue fonts, respectively. In the C3 cycle (not
all steps shown), Rubisco fixes CO2 to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate to
generate two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate. Approximately 25% of the
time, Rubisco oxygenates ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, generating 2PG and
3-phosphoglycerate. The photorespiratory pathway consumes ATP to
regenerate 3-phosphoglycerate from two molecules of 2PG.
Photorespiration is metabolically inefficient, requiring eight
enzymatic steps (here the amino donor/acceptor is designated R), taking
place across four different subcellular compartments, and resulting in
an overall loss of carbon dioxide and ammonia that needs to be refixed
at the cost of substantial additional energy (3 ATP and 2 NADPH per
CO2, and 1 ATP and 1 NADPH per NH3). The proposed de novo 2PG salvage
pathway would efficiently convert 2PG to xylulose-1,5-bisphosphate in
three steps in a single compartment using only one ATP and one NADPH,
without loss of fixed carbon. The three enzymes needed in the proposed
de novo 2PG salvage pathway are as follows: kinase (step 1), reductase
(step 2), and aldolase (step 3). Xylulose-1,5-bisphosphate is a stromal
metabolite that is converted to the C3 cycle intermediate
xylulose-5-phosphate by the cbbY protein (63). The capacity of the cbbY
may not be sufficient to sustain the flux and may need to be
up-regulated.<br>
<br>
More ambitious would be to import oxygen-insensitive pathways for the
key carbon fixation reaction to bypass Rubisco altogether. One could be
the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle of aerobic Archaea (39)
and another the 4-hydroxybutyrate/dicarboxylate pathway of anaerobic
Archaea [although this later pathway has at least one O2-sensitive
enzyme (40), and directed evolution may be required to increase the O2
tolerance of selected enzymes]. The hypothetical C4/glyoxylate cycle
(41) may be easier to implement because it requires only four enzymes,
although a pathway to convert glyoxylate, the product of this cycle,
into a metabolically useful intermediate would also be required. In
fact, the second cycle of the recently demonstrated 3-hydroxypropionate
bicycle produces a metabolically useful product by converting glycolate
to pyruvate (38). Another exciting approach would be to design a
completely orthogonal pathway involving intermediates that are not
shared by any existing pathway in the organism. By avoiding the
intermediates of native metabolism until the final step, this strategy
should simplify regulatory networks and minimize metabolic interference
with native pathways.<br>
<br>
Initial work on new carbon-fixation pathways may be best performed with
algae and cyanobacteria because they grow faster than higher plants,
they are easier to manipulate, and their homogeneous cell cultures
simplify metabolite and other analyses. Some potential carbon-fixation
pathways produce acetyl-CoA, which could also be used for lipid
(biofuel) production. If algae are to host new pathways, there is a
choice between introducing enzyme-genes into the chloroplast genome for
higher expression and better control of gene placement via homologous
recombination, or into the nuclear genome where newly emerging
gene-editing tools may be poised for breakthrough impact (more on gene
editing in Enabling Technologies). Inserted enzymes might be engineered
via directed evolution or global and targeted mutagenesis, but
high-throughput enzyme assays will be essential to screen or select for
desired catalysis outputs (42, 43). Systems biology, metabolic flux,
and control analysis will identify bottlenecks in pathways, and
expression of appropriate enzymes will be increased through an
iterative process (44, 45).<br>
<br>
Metabolic modeling will be critical for identifying bottlenecks and
unanticipated diversion of metabolites, as well as for suggesting
possible solutions. If new intermediates are toxic, consecutive enzymes
might be tethered in a scaffold to encourage channeling and minimize
release of problematic intermediates. If unusual cofactors are in high
demand (e.g., bicarbonate-dependent carboxylases use biotin), then
appropriate cofactor synthesis would need to be up-regulated or even
introduced to avoid cofactor limitation.<br>

The smart canopy concept envisions an assemblage of plants that
interact cooperatively (rather than competitively) at the canopy level
to maximize the potential for light harvesting and biomass production
per unit land area. Although selection by plant breeders for traits
such as yield in a monoculture may act at the population level, natural
selection acts at the level of the individual plant to maximize the
genetic fitness of the individual rather than the fitness of the canopy
as a whole. Therefore, engineering a smart canopy will require a
detailed understanding of opportunities for cooperativity among crop
plants. How could leaves in a &#8220;smart&#8221; canopy be engineered to behave
optimally for productivity, as opposed to success of the individual?
Light flux and spectrum, wind speed, and humidity vary with depth into
a canopy but also vary minute by minute, depending on cloud movement,
time of day, and wind gusts. One variable within canopies that plants
are able to sense is the ratio of red to far-red radiation (R/FR) (Fig.
3). Leaves absorb strongly in the red but transmit most far-red
radiation, and this absorptivity ratio is scarcely affected by
variation in the amount of incoming sunlight. The phytochrome system
senses this ratio (46) so that promoters downstream of phytochrome
signaling could be used to make smart canopies wherein leaves are
adapted to the prevailing light conditions to benefit total crop
production.<br>
<br>

<br>
The heterogeneity of microenvironments inside a canopy. Light and wind
speed decline toward the base of a crop canopy, generating gradients in
relative humidity (RH), CO2, and the red to far-red ratio (R/FR). In a
typical canopy (Left), most light is absorbed by the upper leaves,
which are dark green and often tend toward being horizontal. An
optimized canopy (Right) would have lighter green upright leaves at the
top of the canopy and dark green horizontal leaves at the base. A
hypothesized smart canopy would also be more efficient if the Rubisco
in the upper canopy (protein diagram) had a high catalytic rate that is
replaced by a Rubisco with a high specificity in the lower canopy. The
canopy would also be more efficient with fewer antenna pigments per
photosystem (cones) in the upper canopy, replaced by large antennas
serving fewer reaction centers in the lower canopy.<br>
<br>
What changes are desirable in a smart canopy as leaves become
increasingly shaded? Metabolic and biophysical modeling suggests
significant benefits from three distinct changes (Fig. 3). First,
transitioning from vertical leaves in high light in the upper canopy to
horizontal leaves in low light deeper in the canopy permits a more even
distribution of sunlight and minimizes saturation of the upper leaves
and light starvation of the lower leaves (47). Recent insights into the
molecular basis of hinging in grass leaf blades at the ligule and
auricles provide a means to produce controlled variation in leaf angles
(48). Secondly, the amount of Rubisco is a major limitation to
light-saturated photosynthesis, despite being as much as 50% of leaf
soluble protein (16). Canopy photosynthesis would be increased by
deploying a Rubisco with a high catalytic rate in the upper leaves,
even at the expense of specificity for CO2 over O2, and replacing
Rubisco with a high specificity form in the lower canopy where light is
limiting to minimize the diversion of the limiting light energy into
photorespiratory metabolism (16). Thirdly, upper canopy leaves are
typically light-saturated, and reaction centers may be limiting. In a
smart canopy, the leaves receiving the most light would form small
antenna systems feeding many reaction centers. Reaction centers are
expensive to maintain and not limiting in low light. Therefore,
reaction center numbers should be decreased in low light but antenna
sizes increased and pigment composition changed to maximize
interception of light, which would be enriched in the green (46).<br>
<br>
The ideal architectural and metabolic features of such a smart canopy
need to be explored for different crops using systems biology (49).
Although optimal properties such as height, leaf area index, leaf
angle, albedo, and orientation will differ among crops or even within a
single crop in different environments, a number of common features can
be proposed for individuals in a smart canopy. First, although
semidwarf phenotypes were a major contributing factor in the success of
the Green Revolution, new molecular approaches to enhance lodging
resistance should allow increased canopy height as a promising option
to increase crop biomass and thus grain yields on a per area basis if
the harvest index can be held constant. Furthermore, repositioning
floral organs and panicles inside the canopy would avoid shading
photosynthetically active leaves; indeed, this strategy is used by many
elite hybrid rice lines. Decreasing leaf chlorophyll content in
sun-exposed leaves is another promising approach to increase total
canopy photosynthetic rate (10). This increase would be achieved both
through increasing quantum yield of PSII via decreasing photoprotective
energy loss and improving light energy distribution inside the canopy.
This strategy could be combined with the optimization of light
harvesting in the canopy by using different pigments to extend the
absorption properties to the infrared spectral range and by exploiting
the capacity of the proteins to tune the absorption properties of their
bound pigments (Fig. 1B). Chl d, which is red-shifted compared with Chl
a, could be produced in the lower leaves of the canopy, which mainly
receives IR light, thus increasing the light-harvesting capacity (50).
A similar effect might be obtained by mutating the protein sequence of
the natural antenna complexes to influence protein&#8211;protein and
protein&#8211;pigment interactions to shift the absorption of some of the
Chls to the red by up to 20 nm. This second option could eliminate
possible problems due to assembly and regulation with nonnative
pigments because changing the absorption spectrum of native pigments
requires mutations only of existing components of the photosynthetic
apparatus (51).<br>
<br>
Given the difference in the light and CO2 environments inside a canopy,
it would conceptually be beneficial to use different photosynthetic
machineries for leaves at the top of the canopy versus lower layers.
Considering that C4 assimilation or other carbon-concentrating
mechanisms require extra ATP for assimilating CO2, it is preferable to
operate such carbon-concentrating mechanisms only in the top canopy
layers whereas the light-limited lower region would use only the C3
pathway. Such partitioning of C3 and C4 metabolism requires the
engineering of a switchable system where a leaf in a nascent canopy
initially operates a light-driven CO2-concentrating mechanism and later
conducts C3 photosynthesis after it is shaded during canopy development.<br>

<br>
Due to limited natural genetic variation in the enzymes and processes
of plant photosynthesis, most of the limitations in photosynthetic
efficiency will not likely be decisively overcome by conventional
breeding approaches. Instead, key improvements will need to be pursued
through genetic engineering and synthetic biology guided by
well-validated mechanistic models. The implementation of concepts for
radical redesign of the photosynthetic apparatus and/or its regulation
(such as those discussed above in Targets of Opportunity) will
especially call for the introduction of dozens of transgenes&#8212;possibly
on synthetic chromosomes&#8212;and require genetic engineering at an
unprecedented scale, as well as public discussion of the costs and
benefits of such organisms (52). Genetic engineering of this large
scale poses a number of significant technical challenges (Table 1).<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tools and technologies relevant to
engineering photosynthesis, their potential applications, and current
limitations</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Thirty years of transgenic research have assembled an impressively
large toolbox for genetic engineering of cyanobacteria, eukaryotic
algae, and land plants. Recently developed plant biotechnology and
synthetic biology tools have included synthetic promoters, artificial
chromosomes, and large DNA fragment assembly (of entire bacterial
genomes and eukaryotic chromosomes) (18, 53). Improved transformation
methods are poised for the redesign of at least some aspects of
photosynthesis for rapid progress. However, there are still critical
bottlenecks and unsolved problems (Table 1). In photosynthetic
eukaryotes, many of the key components of the electron transport chain
(e.g., the reaction center subunits of the photosystems), as well as
the catalytic large subunit of Rubisco, are encoded in the plastid
genome. Thus, many strategies toward redesigning photosynthesis would
be substantially enabled by technologies allowing the plastid genome to
be engineered in a greater number of species. In addition, plastid
genome transformation offers a number of further benefits, including
(i) the capacity for high-level transgene expression, (ii) the
convenient stacking of multiple transgenes in synthetic operons, (iii)
the high precision of plastid engineering due to the presence of an
efficient homologous recombination system, and (iv) the greatly
increased transgene containment conferred by the maternal mode of
plastid inheritance in most crops, which largely excludes plastid
(trans)genes from pollen transmission.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, efficient plastid transformation technology is presently
available in very few species. Despite significant efforts, the
development of plastid transformation protocols for cereals, the
world&#8217;s most important staple crops, has remained unsuccessful (54,
55). Major technical challenges include the development of suitable
selectable markers and efficient tissue culture and selection systems.
In addition, the sometimes very high expression levels of plastid
transgenes would almost certainly need to be managed to achieve optimal
outcomes. Expanded research efforts will be needed to further optimize
plastid transformation technology by, for example, increasing the
number of transgenes that can be effectively expressed and by ensuring
proper folding and posttranslational modification of proteins expressed
in the plastid. Overcoming these challenges will require major
investments in long-term research programs, which are presently not
being made, at least not in the public sector.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, it will be appropriate to test radical redesign
concepts in established model systems, such as cyanobacteria and the
green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. It will also be essential to
develop an intermediate land plant model as a chassis to implement
strategies for improving photosynthesis and to optimize the
reengineered systems for transfer to staple crops once the transgenic
technologies are sufficiently developed. A possible model could be a
diploid tobacco species (e.g., Nicotiana sylvestris), whose chloroplast
and nuclear genomes are readily transformable. An intermediate land
plant model would provide the ability to test the efficacy of different
photosynthetic manipulations in a closed canopy paralleling that of
major crops.<br>
<br>
Important new technologies (18) promise to greatly improve efficiency
and feasibility of nuclear transformation (Table 1). Novel
technologies, such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases
(TALENs) (56, 57) and the RNA-guided Cas9 system (58, 59), are enabling
the precise engineering of genomes, including gene replacement and
editing of genomic sequences within their authentic regulatory
contexts. However, to take full advantage of these emerging tools, our
knowledge about the factors and regulatory processes involved in the
assembly and functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus must keep
pace. For example, the catalog of protein factors that participate in
the assembly, stability, and degradation of thylakoid protein complexes
is incomplete, and many key players remain to be discovered. Likewise,
there are significant gaps in our knowledge of the proteins and small
molecules that regulate electron transfer processes and the biochemical
pathways of carbon metabolism. Developments in mass spectrometry to
improve scale and sensitivity for quantitative and targeted proteomics
are needed to improve our knowledge of posttranslational modifications
and protein degradation (60). Although advanced methods in quantitative
biology, systems biology, and new modeling approaches (61, 62) will
certainly improve our understanding of the architecture of the genetic
and biochemical networks underlying photosynthesis and will also aid
the design of novel regulatory circuits, the predictive power of these
methods will remain limited by the still rather large number of unknown
variables in the networks (Table 1). The mitigation of these
limitations will require significant investments in basic research on
primary metabolism, gene expression, and their regulation at all levels.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Outlook</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
Stimulated by the exciting new opportunities of synthetic biology, we
have considered an array of redesigns to improve photosynthetic
efficiency and performance, with a primary focus on improving the
productivity of food and bioenergy plants. Our intent was neither to
produce an exhaustive list of all current ideas nor to focus
exclusively on a new generation of strategies. Rather, we sought to
broadly consider several potential routes to improving photosynthesis.
We confined our focus to the processes in chloroplasts although we are
aware that important downstream processes, such as the export of
photosynthate from cells and leaves, can exert strong metabolic and
genetic feedback on this organelle. We have indicated where there is
already proof-of-concept evidence for improved photosynthetic
efficiency, as well as notions for complete redesigns that are only
conceptual, but which are consistent with what we currently understand.
An important conclusion is that the implementation of many key ideas is
limited by our ability to introduce, position, and regulate inserted
genes. Finally, we emphasize that a central challenge to improving
photosynthetic efficiency is knowing how alterations made to the
photosynthetic process at the level of the chloroplast will scale to a
whole canopy, whose complex seasonal development ultimately determines
biomass production and yield. Thus, an overarching continuum of models
that span from cellular metabolism to the agricultural field will be
essential for successfully redesigning photosynthesis to sustainably
meet global food and bioenergy demand.<br>

Presented herein are plants with altered photorespiratory
characteristics. Disruption of transport proteins involved in shuttling
glycolate and/or glycerate results in reductions in photosynthetic
rates, reduced plant growth and alterations in gene expression and
photosynthetic metabolite profiles. Such disruptions are also combined
with introduced genes expressing components of alternate
photorespiratory enzyme pathways to increase photosynthetic efficiency.<br>
