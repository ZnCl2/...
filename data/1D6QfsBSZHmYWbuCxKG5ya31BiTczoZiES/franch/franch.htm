      <p>Wouldn’t it be nice if we could burn water for fuel? Think of
        all the money we could save, since water costs only 25 cents a
        gallon this week! </p>
      <p>It’s a wet dream that has been fulfilled several times. The
        most recent instance occurred in 1996 at the Indian Institute of
        Technology (ITT), where 30-years old Ramar Pillai demonstrated
        the apparent conversion of water to a hydrocarbon fuel by mixing
        it with a secret herbal formula he had discovered. Scientists
        were understandably amazed by the experiment, which was
        organized by ITT chemist N. K. Jha. "It is incredible but true",
        Jha said. </p>
      <p>About two ounces of leaves and bark were boiled in a liter of
        water, cooled, and a small amount of salt, citric acid, and
        secret chemicals were added. About a pint of combustible liquid
        that smells and burns like kerosene was produced within 30
        minutes. The National Chemical Laboratory (Pune, India) analyzed
        the substance and found it to be a pure hydrocarbon with a
        boiling point of 170° C. The new fuel is more efficient than
        gasoline, and produces no sulfur exhaust. Researchers at the
        Indian Institute of Petroleum confirmed the reality of the
        process. </p>
      <p>Ramar Pillai was granted 20 acres of land on which to cultivate
        the marvelous bush, and he applied for patents on the process.
        Then Pillai was accused of being a charlatan; allegedly he had
        added oil to the process by legerdemain even as scientists
        watched him perform the experiment. </p>
      <p>In 1916, Louis Enricht announced that he had invented "a
        substitute for gasoline that can be manufactured for a penny a
        gallon". As a demonstration, Enricht allowed reporters to
        inspect the empty gas tank of an automobile. The reporters also
        tasted the water that Enricht then poured into the tank. He
        added a green pill, started the car, and gave the reporters a
        ride around Farmingdale, Long Island. William Haskell, publisher
        of the <i>Chicago Herald</i>, investigated Enricht’s claims. He
        wrote: </p>
      <p>"I examined the entire engine and tank. I even tasted the water
        before the mysterious green pill was dropped into the tank. Then
        I opened the petcock and examined the liquid, which now tasted
        like biter almonds. I also tasted the liquid at the carburator
        which was the same. I was amazed when the auto started. We drove
        it around the city without any trouble". </p>
      <p>A few days later, however, reporters learned that Enricht had
        been indicted for fraud in 1903, and had been involved in other
        phony schemes. Despite his lack of credibility, Enricht was able
        to get Benjamin Yoakum to finance him and organize the National
        Motor Power Company. Investigators from the British Army were
        given a demonstration, and they reported that, "The car operated
        as expeditiously and efficiently as it would have on gasoline".
      </p>
      <p>The deal soured, however, and Yoakum sued Enricht, who was
        forced to open a safe deposit box in which he supposedly had
        placed the formula and a sample of the substance. It wasn’t
        there, and the National Motor Power Company folded. Enricht
        eventually was convicted of another fraud (extracting gasoline
        from peat) and served several years in Sing Sing prison. </p>
      <p>In 1917, John Andrews approached the US Navy with his claim
        that he could convert fresh or salt water into a fuel with the
        same power as gasoline. The chemical costs were about 2
        cents/gallon. </p>
      <p>Andrews was allowed to demonstrate his invention at the
        Brooklyn Navy Yard, where a motor boat was fitted with a
        dynamometer for the test. Commander Earl P. Jessup, who was
        Captain of the yard, said: </p>
      <p>"We gave Andrews a bucket of water drawn from the Navy Yard
        [fresh water] hydrant by one of the yard attaches. He got into
        his car with a gallon can which we inspected and found to be
        empty and a little satchel he carried with him. In about a
        minute he handed out the filled can which I personally carried
        to the open fuel tank. While pouring the liquid into the tank,
        Andrews held a lighted cigarette close to the liquid, which did
        not ignite. That showed it was not gaseous or inflammable at
        that part of the demonstration, which to me was most important.
        The engine caught just as quickly as it would have done with
        gasoline, and after a moment’s adjustment of the carburator, it
        settled down to its work, developing 75% of its rated
        horsepower, a remarkable showing with any fuel with so slight a
        readjustment of the carburator". </p>
      <p>In a second test, Andrews was put in an empty room with no
        possible way to get rid of the bucket of salt water with which
        he had been supplied, except to empty it into his one-gallon gas
        can. Commander Jessup said: </p>
      <p>"In a minute he emerged with the can filled, and the engine
        again used it up, no difference being noted between the salt
        water and fresh. Besides myself, Rear Admiral G.E. Burd, the
        Industrial Manager of the yard, was present and with the
        precautions we had taken --- our own Navy engine, tank and
        carburator and our own men supplying the water --- there was no
        possibility of deception. </p>
      <p>"From a military viewpoint, it is almost impossible to
        visual"ze that such an invention means. It is so important that
        we have hurried an officer to Washington to make a report to the
        navy Department. It is obvious that Andrews has discovered a
        combination of chemicals which breaks down water to a form that
        is inert until mechanically vaporized by the carburator, when
        the spark causes it to burn as gasoline burns". </p>
      <p>Walter Meriwether, the Navy editor of the <i>New York World</i>,
        met with Andrews at his home in McKeesport, PA. Andrews was
        extremely paranoid. He said: </p>
      <p>"Somebody poisoned my watchdog last week. The only reason my
        dog was poisoned was so somebody could get at me more easily. I
        am being followed everywhere, day and night. A lot of people
        know about my invention --- how it will put every oil company in
        the world out of business. Two cents a gallon for a substitute
        as good as the best they can refine? I tell you, my life is not
        worth that [snapping his fingers]! Think of what my invention
        means to nations at war". </p>
      <p>Meriwether offered to arrange for a thorough test of his
        invention with the Navy Department in Washington DC, and Andrews
        accepted his help. Meriwether managed to arouse the interest of
        Secretary Josephus Daniels, who said: </p>
      <p>"Tell the man to come on at once; I will have a submarine and
        airplane detailed and ready for him on his arrival". </p>
      <p>Meriwether telegraphed Andrews, but received no reply. He
        returned to McKeesport, but Andrews could not be found.
        Meriwether then accompanied the police to Andrews’ home, where
        they found signs of a violent struggle in the ransacked house.
        No trace was found of Andrews. </p>
      <p>But Andrews had not been kidnapped or murdered; he had simply
        reported back to his seaman’s post in the Canadian Navy. He
        returned to the USA in the 1930s. In 1942, a reporter named
        James Kilgallen found Andrews living on a farm near Library,
        Pennsylvania. Andrews said that he had forgotten the formula. </p>
      <p>Another version of the Andrews mystery states that he was found
        murdered in his home in 1937, and all of his notes and supply of
        green powder were missing. His sister allegedly took the notes
        and fled to Scotland, where she too was murdered only a year
        later. The eminent journalist Tom Valentine, who has written
        numerous articles about suppressed technologies, once received a
        phone call from a man who claimed to be John Andrews, Jr. His
        innuendos could not be proven, of course: </p>
      <p>"My aunt was killed and then some of my relatives suddenly got
        rich and I believe the process for making the powder is known
        and the people who know are the Phillips Petroleum Company". </p>
      <p>The next person to demonstrate the conversion of water to fuel
        was Guido Franch, a former coal miner who tried for nearly 50
        years to find financiers for his product. He too used a green
        powder to turn water into 105-octane fuel. He called it "Mota",
        which is atom spelled backwards. </p>
      <p>Franch demonstrated Mota hundreds of times, but never produced
        it commercially. He did, however, sell about 3000% of his rights
        to interested investors. In 1973, Franch was subpoenaed to
        appear in Chicago’s Federal Circuit Court "with any records
        relating to the purchase or the proposed purchase of any fuel,
        fuel powder, or fuel formula in your possession". He
        demonstrated his Mota transmutation in the presence of judges
        William Bauer and Philip Romiti, who believed what they saw, and
        Franch was acquitted of charges of fraud. </p>
      <p>The fuel is produced with one pound of the reagent in 50
        gallons of water. It burns clean and leaves no residue. In one
        demonstration with a lawnmower, it ran for about 15 minutes on a
        small amount of Mota-treated water. An equal amount of gasoline
        lasted only 3 minutes. Mota fuel is very sensitive to sunlight,
        which will turn it back to water with a white powder residue. </p>
      <p>Gary Bolz, a consultant on carburetion and fuel engineering,
        was able to test Mota with the help of chemists at Michigan
        State University and Havoline Chemical Laboratories. Bolz
        stated: </p>
      <p>"The granules are dark olive green. As they enter water, they
        dissolve in a string of green, which begins to spread fiber-like
        throughout the water. As the water begins to react, there is a
        swirling effect. Reaction is complete in a few minutes. If the
        crystals are mixed in 1:1 ratio with water, the resulting fluid
        is highly explosive and can be detonated by a small shock. But
        it isn’t shock-sensitive when mixed at a normal ratio of one
        ounce of powder per half gallon of water. The finished fuel is
        lighter than water". </p>
      <p>Franch claimed that the manufacture of Mota was taught to him
        and others in 1925 by a German scientist named Alexander Kraft,
        who died in 1941. One pound of the green crystals can be
        produced from 25 pounds of coal at a cost of about $100. </p>
      <p>Franch received about $100,000 from small investors over a
        period of 40 years. He used that money to live on, and never
        manufactured any Mota. He received several serious offers from
        major investors, but his financial demands were unreasonable and
        nothing practical ever came of his demonstrations and
        negotiations. </p>
      <p>It appears that we are obliged to continue burning gasoline
        until some genius rediscovers the secret of extracting green
        crystals from coal.<br>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Alternative Energy? What about "those
              little green granules"?</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>by Jimmy Ward</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 13, 1979, the story of Guido Franch
        and his "Mota-Fuel" made the papers nationwide. He claimed he
        could turn ordinary tap water into 105 octane gasoline by merely
        adding some green crystals to it. With a gasoline shortage in
        full swing, his announcement was met with a great deal of
        interest. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Franch, 69, of Villa Park, Illinois, had
        been subpoenaed to appear in Federal Court with records
        "relating to the purchase of any fuel, fuel powder, or fuel
        formula in (his) possession or under (his) control" since 1968.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Franch did not claim credit for discovering
        the mysterious fuel, only for converting the formula for use as
        a motor fuel. The real inventor, he claimed, was Alexander
        Craft, a German scientist who died in 1941. Kraft was a rocket
        fuel expert involved in&nbsp; "doing research way ahead of his
        time." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Franch claimed he could make one pound of
        granules out of 25 pounds of coal and that it cost him about
        $100 to make a pound of granules, but mass production would
        drive the cost down to about $4.00 a pound or about 8 cents per
        gallon of gasoline. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was later charged, tried and convicted of
        bilking large sums of money from his investors who were never
        allowed to see how he made his granules or even how he converted
        water to "gasoline". They were given containers filled with a
        greenish liquid that smelled like cleaning fluid instead. It did
        burn and even power cars, however. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was he only a con artist, or did he really
        convert water to fuel --- or both? It is interesting to note
        that during the trial, the matter of whether he actually could
        or couldn't convert water to fuel was hardly mentioned. More
        curiously, the allegation that his "Mota-Fuel" was a hoax was
        NEVER mentioned. In fact, there was no mention of any hoax at
        all, only that he had "stolen" money from his investors. Does
        this mean "Mota-Fuel" was real? And that it was made from
        coal-derived granules? </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, this is not the first time those
        green granules made from coal have turned up. In the <i>Cincinnati







          Enquirer</i> for April 25, 1897, an aeroship (see Aero files
        in the Gravity section of KeelyNet), was reported to have
        landed, the occupants of which claimed their craft used a
        "volatile substance" that somehow NEGATED THE FORCE OF GRAVITY.
        C.A.A. Dellschau died in 1924 leaving behind several books of
        drawings of strange-looking airships allegedly designed in the
        mid-1800s which used a gas that negated gravity in order to fly.
        The gas was made by adding green crystals to ordinary water.
        Coincidence? These crystals were made from coal too. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even more bizarre is the story of one Dr.
        Rhinelander (apparently a pseudonym) who allegedly was contacted
        by aliens toward the end of the century. They supposedly gave
        him plans to build an aerial craft which would operate on a
        propulsion principle totally unknown to him. He was instructed
        tocollect scientists and migrate to a coal mining area of the
        MidWest. The nearby coal mines were to supply the basic
        ingredients for a new fuel which could be made from ordinary
        water. Those green granules again! </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More "down to earth" is the story of John
        Andrews. In 1917, he used a green powder to convert sea water to
        gasoline before the astonished eyes of several US Navy brass.
        Even though it was tested in the tank of a motorboat and proved
        more than satisfactory, the Navy was "not interested". In fact,
        he seems to have been unable to find anyone who was interested!
        In 1935, he converted tap water into fuel before members of the
        Bureau of Standards and gave a demonstration of its power, but
        they too declined to take action. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other stories of other inventors
        who appear to have been able to transform water into something
        resembling gasoline. All of them have the same basic elements:
        green granules or powder MADE FROM COAL. Demonstrations are
        given, often before such people as Earl Eisenhower (brother of
        the president), or large companies such as Ford Motor Co. or
        Standard Oil. Typically the alleged inventor never takes full
        credit for his discovery and declines to divulge the secret
        process for creating the mysterious granules. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fact or fiction? FOCUS doesn't know either.
