        Abstract -- Device for electroculture with minimum two metal
        grates or plates (2, 3) arranged in parallel in the cultivated
        soil (4), in a north-south direction, and with a voltage source
        (6) with an antenna (7) and that supplies the metal grates (2,
        3) with an electric current of natural origin, device for
        electroculture characterized in that the aforesaid voltage
        source (6) consists, on one hand, of the antenna (7) for
        collecting atmospheric electricity and, on the other hand, of
        one or several photocells (8). </span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      The invention relates to an apparatus of electroculture comprising
      at least two grids or panels in parallel laid out in the ground of
      culture according to a North-South direction, and a voltage source
      providing an electrical current of natural origin to the metallic
      grids.<br>
      <br>
      Several apparatuses are known for the use of the beneficial effect
      of the electricity on the vegetation, which is known of long date.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, it was noted that the electricity could have a powerful
      action on the rise of the sap in the plants, and consequently, on
      the quick and spectacular development of those.<br>
      <br>
      Numerous apparatuses were already proposed to subject plantings to
      the influence of the electricity, mainly with the level of the
      roots. The purpose of these known apparatuses consists to collect
      electricity preferably natural, such as the atmospheric
      electricity and to channel it towards the roots in the form of
      electrical current. Thus, according to one of these known
      apparatuses, a seven antenna to eight metres of high is placed
      vertically in the ground and is surmounted, on the one hand, by a
      whole of stems in galvanized iron wire and, on the other hand, by
      a whole of brass or copper tubes. Each one of these sets of iron
      elements galvanized or out of copper is connected separately to a
      conducting wire which goes down along the vertical antenna. Each
      of two wire is then buried in the ground with one depth of about
      fifty centimetres, and this in the shape of coiled web, in order
      to define a couple copper-iron. Thus, the spiral obtained is used
      as traprock with the tension fields of the magnetic field, and it
      is established a D.C. current on the spiral, which makes it
      possible to activate the growth of the plants located above the
      coiled web.<br>
      <br>
      This apparatus has the disadvantage of being relatively expensive,
      and application moreover a performing particularly neat comprising
      numerous insulations and welds. Moreover, it requires an antenna
      large height particularly unaesthetic but especially, the results
      obtained with the level of the plantings are of a large
      irregularity and are substantially tributary distribution of the
      electric voltages in the basement.<br>
      <br>
      One knows another apparatus of electroculture also based on the
      collection of the atmospheric currents, and composed of a provided
      metallic antenna of copper strands to his upper part. This antenna
      is isolated earth via an insulator, but is connected to a
      galvanized iron grid placed vertically in the ground. Compared to
      this galvanized iron grid, laid out according to a North-South
      direction, one anode screen identical but connected only to the
      earth is placed. In this way, the atmospheric currents collected
      by the antenna are transmitted to the quoted first grid, and it is
      established between the two grids an electric field which ends in
      the circulation of low running in the part of the ground which
      separates the two grids, this current benefitting the growth from
      vegetal placed on its passage.<br>
      <br>
      However, this apparatus is partly characterized by its
      inefficiency, resultant low current levels and of tension
      observed, as well as variations of those.<br>
      <br>
      Whereas the aforementioned apparatuses of electroculture are based
      on the use of the atmospheric electricity, which is free, other
      apparatuses consist in feeding directly from the grids placed in
      the ground via electric generators such as stacks or others, which
      considerably increases the cost of use of these apparatuses.<br>
      <br>
      Lastly, certain performings are based on a juxtaposition of strips
      of compost acids and basic laid out alternately in the ground, in
      order to generate electrical currents crossing the plat bands. It
      is clear that it is there about an electric power of a more
      expensive use and that it is periodically necessary to renew.<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of the present invention is curing these
      disadvantages. The invention, such as it is characterized in the
      claims, solve the problem consisting to create an apparatus of
      electroculture comprising at least two grids or panels in parallel
      laid out in the ground of culture according to a North-South
      direction and a source of ten Sion providing an electrical current
      of natural origin to the metallic grids and of which the voltage
      source is composed, on the one hand, of an antenna of collecting
      of the atmospheric electricity and, on the other hand, of one or
      several cells photovoltaic.<br>
      <br>
      The advantages obtained thanks to this invention consist
      substantially of what in consequence of the presence of the
      photovoltaic cells and a regulator, the apparatus of
      electroculture makes it possible to have same the night an
      available electric voltage on the positive grid metallic, which
      increases the profitability of the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      Another purpose of the present invention is to propose an
      embodiment practice, simple and effective of apparatuses of
      electroculture, while being based on an electrical energy source
      entirely free.<br>
      <br>
      Another purpose of the present invention is to provide an
      extremely economic apparatus of electroculture, and which makes it
      possible to make circulate in the flat-strips of culture, a
      relatively substantial D.C. current compared to those obtained by
      the known apparatuses in the current state of the technical one.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is hereafter exposed more in detail using drawings
      representing only one embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 1</span> in accordance

      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 690px; height:

      <br>
      One refers on figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus of electroculture 1 in accordance with the invention
      is composed mainly of two metallic grids 2 and 3d' a height from
      thirty to fifty centimetres in parallel laid out in the ground of
      culture, in order to laterally delimit a plat band of culture 4
      intended for the planting and the culture vegetal unspecified 5.<br>
      <br>
      The metallic grids 2 and 3, preferably out of galvanized iron, are
      intended in a known way, to be spans with a relative electrical
      potential in order to make circulate between they an electrical
      current limited by the earth strength of plat band 4. Of course,
      the metallic grids 2 and 3 can be replaced by full metal patches
      ensuring the same function.<br>
      <br>
      It is substantial to note that the metallic grids 2 and 3, hidden
      in the ground, are directed according to a North-South direction,
      in order to make profit the electrical charges in movement between
      the two grids, of the influence of the terrestrial magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus of electroculture 1 in accordance with the invention
      comprises moreover a voltage source 6 connected electrically to
      grids 2 and 3, the first playing the role of a positive pole, the
      second playing the role of a negative pole.<br>
      <br>
      For this purpose, the voltage source 6 which provides an
      electrical current of natural origin to the metallic grids 2 and
      3, is composed, on the one hand, of an antenna 7 making it
      possible to collect the atmospheric electricity and, on the other
      hand, of one or several cells photovoltaic 8 as represented figure
      2.<br>
      <br>
      Antenna 7 is intended to collect the present electricity in the
      atmosphere in the form of ions, especially by thundery weather.
      For this purpose, it is composed of a conductive tube 9 out of
      electric aluminium or other good conducting, surmounted by strands
      of wire of copper or equivalent, laid out in “sunshade” as
      schematized on figures 1 and 2. These strands of copper 10 wire,
      necessarily of odd number, are attached on the apex of conductive
      tube 9 by an unspecified connection ensuring a good electric
      continuity, and are distributed according to a cone in order to
      present a slope to the top 11 from fifteen to thirty degrees.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, conductive tube 9 of antenna 7 is attached on one
      isolated tor made up for example by a wood 12 stake driven in the
      ground, the whole of antenna 7 being installed near the metallic
      grids 2 and 3 in order to shorten electric connections necessary.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be noted that point of view of the dimensioning of this
      antenna, several performings with the span of the Expert are
      possible. It proves nevertheless that an antenna 7 made up of a
      conductive tube 9 of two metres high and copper strands of about
      thirty centimetres long and of a diameter from 2,5 to 3
      millimeters are optimum.<br>
      <br>
      It is clear that antenna 7 collecting the atmospheric electricity
      constitutes in itself a voltage source, the aforementioned tension
      being able to be taken in an unspecified point of tube 9. However,
      this tension is substantially variable and fluctuating with the
      rhythm of the variations of the atmospheric conditions, and its
      application with the one of the metallic grids 2 or 3 does not
      give good results with regard to the growth from vegetal the 5.<br>
      <br>
      Also, in accordance with the invention, voltage source 6 is
      composed moreover of one or several photovoltaic cells 8 producing
      a continuous tension starting from the received light energy by
      the sun, the respective voltages from antenna 7 and from
      photovoltaic cells 8 being brought on the metallic grid 2 playing
      the role of positive pole, via a regulator 13.<br>
      <br>
      This regulator 13 comprises two inlets 14 and 15 and one outlet
      16. To ensure the operation of the apparatus of electroculture as
      described previously, the inlet 14 of regulator 13 takes the
      electric voltage produced by antenna 7 with the level of an
      unspecified point 17 of tube 9 of this one. In addition, the
      positive voltage produced by the photovoltaic cell 8 is taken with
      the level of positive terminal 18 of this one and is brought on
      inlet 15 of the regulator via an isolated electric wire 19.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, so that a current can circulate in direction 20
      represented on figure 1, it is necessary that outlet 16 of
      regulator 13 is connected to the metallic grid 2 playing the role
      of positive pole, and that moreover negative terminal 21 of the
      photovoltaic cell 8 is connected by an electric wire isolated 22
      to the metallic grid 3 playing the role of negative pole of the
      apparatus. Thus, the metallic grid 2 being span with a positive
      electrical potential compared to the earth, and the metallic grid
      3 being intimately connected to the earth via an earth 23 stake,
      an electrical current can be established between two grids 2 and 3
      in direction 20 represented.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the invention, the improved results of
      electroculture are obtained when the metallic grid 2 is supplied
      by a continuous tension of about 0,2 to 0,4 volts. Regulator 13 in
      conformity with the invention makes it possible to obtain such a
      tension starting from the elementary voltage sources consisted by
      antenna 7 on the one hand, and the photovoltaic cell 8 on the
      other hand.<br>
      <br>
      For this purpose, regulator 13 schematized figure 3 comprises a
      stage rectifier 24 with low losses intended to manufacture a
      continuous tension from 0,2 to 0,4 volts to be left, on the one
      hand, fluctuating tension delivered by antenna 7, and on the other
      hand, of the substantially continuous tension delivered by the
      photovoltaic cell 8. So the stage rectifier 24 is consisted two
      groups 25 and 26 of diodes 27 laid out into parallel, and located
      respectively between each inlet 14 and 15 and outlet 16 of
      regulator 13.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be noted that the tensions delivered by antenna 7 and the
      photovoltaic cells 8 are relatively low values, and so it is
      necessary to limit the voltage drops inside regulator 13 to their
      simpler expression. Also, diodes 27 are they preferably
      constituted by diodes “signal” with germanium, with low losses. It
      is also remarkable that the provision of two or several diodes 27
      into parallel between an inlet 14 or 15 and outlet 16 of regulator
      13 makes it possible to limit the equivalent strength of each
      whole of diodes into parallel, and consequently to limit the
      voltage drops.<br>
      <br>
      In order to return the whole of voltage source 6 as compact as
      possible, the photovoltaic cell 8 can be judiciously placed at the
      apex of tube 9 of antenna 7 as represented on figures 1 and 2.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, the spacing of the metallic grids 2 and 3 depends on
      the strength of the ground in the region of culture, and the
      number and the dimension of the metallic grids 2 and 3, as well as
      the number of photovoltaic cells 8 and antennas 7 necessary by
      surface of culture are entirely with the span of the Expert.<br>
      <br>
      Among the advantages of the apparatus of electroculture describes
      previously, one can notice that the presence of the photovoltaic
      cells 8 as of regulator 13 allow to have always an available
      electric voltage on the grid metallic positive 2, same if for a
      reason or another one of the two voltage sources remainder dumb
      woman, which is the case each night for the photovoltaic cell 8.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the apparatus of electroculture in conformity with
      the invention is very simple and compact all into giving
      spectacular results, and makes it possible to put a profitable and
      effective electroculture at the service of any gardener, who will
      be able, so to do without chemical manures. <br>
