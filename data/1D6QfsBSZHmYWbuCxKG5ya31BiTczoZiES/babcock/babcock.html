      Dear Friend,<br>
      <br>
      Let me cut right to the chase! Harnessing magnetism as a source of
      energy is not difficult, but you do have to know a few things.<br>
      <br>
      I'll begin by explaining a bit about what you find in Magnetic
      Energy Secrets, PART 1.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MAGNETIC ENERGY SECRETS, Part 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The first thing you have to know is this: there is no direct
      relationship between the strength of a magnetic field and the
      quantity of electricity used to produce it.<br>
      <br>
      When I tell this to engineers, physicists, and other experts in
      the field, it really drives them nuts!<br>
      <br>
      Too bad for them, it's a FACT! I've been arguing with these
      acedemic types for years, and I have never lost an argument yet.
      But I am sick of winning arguments. I just want to get on with the
      work of harnessing magnetism for energy, and show YOU how to do it
      too!<br>
      <br>
      OK. The next thing you have to learn is which Electrical Laws are
      immutable and which ones can be circumvented. When you understand
      this, you can start to engineer your own electrical circuits to
      harness magnetism effectively.<br>
      <br>
      I'll show you some simple experiments you can duplicate, so you
      can learn this stuff, first hand. After all, I don't want you to
      take my word for it. You've got to see it for yourself!<br>
      <br>
      Next, I'll show you the mathematical proofs, even the formulas you
      need to use to design your own experiments. I'll even show you an
      advanced electric motor I built to demonstrate all of these
      principles.<br>
      <br>
      Theoretically, the math shows that this kind of motor could
      possibly produce 1 mechanical horsepower output for as little as
      200 watts of electrical input. The implications are obvious!<br>
      <br>
      By the time I'm done, you'll have no doubt. MAGNETISM REALLY IS A
      SOURCE OF ENERGY!!!<br>
      <br>
      Once you understand the REAL Laws of Nature, engineering new and
      radical solutions to today's energy problems becomes much easier!<br>
      <br>
      Now I want to get into some details on what is covered in Magnetic
      Energy Secrets PART 2.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MAGNETIC ENERGY SECRETS, Part 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I pretty much pick up here where I left off at the end of Part 1.<br>
      <br>
      First, I quantify how much of Nikola Tesla's "Radiant Energy" is
      available in a circuit with a big inductor in it.<br>
      <br>
      Second, I show you how to modify the ratio of standard electricity
      to Radiant Energy in the circuit by changing the ratio of the
      resistance with respect to the inductance.<br>
      <br>
      Third, I reduce all of this to simple Algebra and a set of
      equations that any High School Sophomore can understand.<br>
      <br>
      And finally, I show you how to engineer much more heat and light
      from a plasma arc, using the same amount of electricity, by using
      these methods instead of classical circuits.<br>
      <br>
      As an extra bonus, I finally got permission from my Stockholders
      to show you a movie clip of my super-efficient electric motor
      running, and even explain to you how it works, using diagrams from
      my recently issued US Patent!<br>
      <br>
      I finish with an expose on my interest in the development of
      "super-low" resistance materials (not super-conductors), and why
      these new materials will open up the field of tapping Magnetism as
      a source of Energy in the near future!<br>

      <br>
      From: Jim Murray &amp; Paul Babcock<br>
      Date: Wednesday, July 08, 2015<br>
      RE: THE SECRET OF TESLA'S POWER MAGNIFICATION<br>
      <br>
      Dear Friend,<br>
      <br>
      At the recent 2014 Energy Science &amp; Technology Conference, the
      S.E.R.P.S. machine was demonstrated publicly for the first time in
      history.<br>
      <br>
      S.E.R.P.S. is a Switched Energy Resonant Power Supply, which
      operates on the same power magnification principles that Nikola
      Tesla used to amplify the power in his generators.<br>
      <br>
      In layman's terms, energy is supplied by a power transformer to
      run the lights and then is stored in a capacitor. The capacitor is
      then discharged back through the lights again to the power supply
      in a way that neutralizes the load seen by the power supply.<br>
      <br>
      The consequences of this energy oscillation is that the load
      (bulbs) can be powered twice while the net energy supplied by the
      power supply is reduced to a very small value. The implications of
      this technology for energy use in the future is absolutely
      astonishing!<br>
      <br>
      This is all done without violating any laws of physics or
      electrical engineering principles and uses all standard electronic
      components.<br>
      <br>
      Here is an example of the input compared to the output as measured
      by a Tektronix scope... What this graph shows is that the SERPS
      device is drawing 1.1 WATTS net from the power supply but the
      light bulbs are actually burning 52.7 WATTS. 52.7 watts divided by
      1.1 watts = a COP or coefficient of performance of 47.90, which is
      4790% more energy than is required to run the machine.<br>
      <br>
      The input represents the difference between the energy provided
      and the energy returned. The output represents the work
      accomplished as this energy oscillates in and out of the system. <br>

      This is slide #5 included in the powerpoint that is a part of this
      package. It quotes Nikola Tesla claiming that he could use 100
      horsepower to provide 5-10 Million horsepower from his
      transmitter. This is Nikola Tesla testifying under oath during a
      court deposition where he explained much of his technology in
      layman's terms. The technology he is explaining here is what we
      have taken years to decipher and redevelop into working models.<br>

      Apparatus and associated methods involve thrust generation by
      interaction of an armature field with a stator field in an
      arrangement with substantially reduced flux coupling from the
      armature to the stator coil. In an illustrative example, solenoid

      Counter-electromotive force may be substantially reduced, for
      example, by stopping current flow in a stator coil while

      examples, by interaction of armature and stator coil flux in
      arc-shaped regions external to and between each of the leading and
      trailing edges of the armature and their respective nearby stator
      coils.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This application claims benefit to U.S. Application Ser. No.
      61/290,259, entitled “Electric Machine System,” as filed on Dec.
      28, 2009 by Babcock, et al., the entire contents of which are
      fully incorporated by reference herein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Various embodiments relate generally to electromagnetic thrust
      production.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Electric motors are widely used in the production of many
      different types of products. Pumps for refrigeration, fans, water
      wells, hand tools, and even electric propulsion for various types
      of motor vehicles are widely adopted.<br>
      <br>
      In general, electric motors produce mechanical work based on some
      manipulation of one or more magnetic fields. Magnetic fields are
      associated with electrical current. Under proper circumstances,
      the energy stored in a magnetic field by a current can be
      translated into mechanical torque on a rotating shaft, or thrust
      in a linear system. Torque or thrust represent a mechanical force
      that can accelerate or decelerate an object.<br>
      <br>
      In general, rotating motors may easily outnumber linear motors.
      There are several types of rotating motors. For example, DC
      (direct current) motors can operate from a DC voltage or current
      source, such as a battery. Induction and synchronous motors may
      call for a time-varying excitation (e.g., AC) to couple flux
      through a small air gap between a rotor and a stator. Reluctance
      motors may produce torque based on preferred paths for a magnetic
      field through a core, for example.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Apparatus and associated methods involve thrust generation by
      interaction of an armature field with a stator field in an
      arrangement with substantially reduced flux coupling from the
      armature to the stator coil. In an illustrative example, solenoid
      coil segments may be arranged as the stator along a path of motion
      for the armature. In some examples, each armature may surround and
      overlap with at least one of the toroidal coil segments.
      Counter-electromotive force may be substantially reduced, for
      example, by stopping current flow in a stator coil while
      overlapped by the armature or while substantial armature flux
      couples to the stator coil. Thrust may be generated, in some
      examples, by interaction of armature and stator coil flux in
      arc-shaped regions external to and between each of the leading and
      trailing edges of the armature and their respective nearby stator
      coils.<br>
      <br>
      In one exemplary aspect, an electromagnetic device includes a
      plurality of stationary field generator modules arranged along a
      path of motion. Each one of the stationary field generator modules
      includes a central axis extending between first and second
      opposite ends and lying substantially along the path of motion,
      and an electric coil arranged to produce a stator magnetic field
      oriented radially with respect to the path of motion and lying
      substantially within a field interaction plane that is orthogonal
      to the path of motion. The device further includes at least one
      armature. Each of the at least one armatures includes a base
      member extending between opposite first and second faces and
      arranged to partially surround one or more of the plurality of
      stationary field generator modules as the armature travels along
      the path of motion, and an armature field generator module
      arranged to produce an armature magnetic field comprising magnetic
      flux oriented radially with respect to the path of motion and
      lying substantially within the field interaction plane. The device
      further includes a linking member to support and guide the
      armature along the path of motion in response to thrust on the
      armature generated in response to interaction of the stator
      magnetic field and the armature magnetic field in the field
      interaction plane.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the field interaction plane is disposed in a
      region between the stationary field generator module producing the
      stator magnetic field and the armature producing the armature
      magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      In another exemplary aspect, a method to accelerate a load
      includes providing a plurality of toroidal coil segments, each of
      the coil segments being arranged with a central axis aligned
      substantially tangential to a path of motion. The method further
      includes providing an armature base movable along the path of
      motion, and generating from the armature base a first
      radially-directed magnetic flux in a first substantially
      arc-shaped region in a first plane exterior to the armature base.
      The first plane intersects and is substantially orthogonal to the
      path of motion. Another step includes generating from at least one
      of the plurality of toroidal coil segments a second
      radially-directed magnetic flux in at least a portion of the first
      substantially arc-shaped region.<br>
      <br>
      In examples, the step of generating from at least one of the
      plurality of toroidal coil segments the second radially-directed
      magnetic flux in at least a portion of the first substantially
      arc-shaped region may include applying a current signal of a first
      polarity to a winding associated with the at least one of the
      plurality of toroidal coil segments. The step of applying the
      current signal may include injecting a current signal of the first
      polarity when the armature is positioned relative to one of the
      plurality of toroidal coil segments such that the second
      radially-directed magnetic flux generated in response to the
      applied current signal lies within the first plane exterior to the
      armature base. The step of applying the current signal further may
      include ceasing to inject the current signal to the toroidal coil
      segment while an amount of flux coupling from the armature to the
      toroidal coil segment exceeds a predetermined threshold level. The
      method may further include injecting a second current signal of
      opposite polarity to the first polarity when the armature is
      positioned relative to the toroidal coil segment such that the
      second radially-directed magnetic flux generated in response to
      the second current signal lies within a second plane exterior to
      the armature base and on an opposite side of the armature relative
      to the first plane.<br>
      <br>
      The method may include disabling current flow in each one of the
      toroidal coil segments to reduce counter-electromotive force
      (CEMF) as each one of the coil segments is overlapped by the
      armature. The method may further include disabling current flow in
      each one of the toroidal coil segments to reduce
      counter-electromotive force (CEMF) as each one of the coil
      segments couples more than a predetermined amount of magnetic flux
      from the armature.<br>
      <br>
      The method may include the following further steps: generating
      from the armature base a third radially-directed magnetic flux in
      a second substantially arc-shaped region in a second plane
      exterior to the armature base on an opposite side of the armature
      relative to the first plane. The second plane may intersect and/or
      be substantially orthogonal to the path of motion. The method may
      include generating from at least one of the plurality of toroidal
      coil segments a fourth radially-directed magnetic flux in at least
      a portion of the second substantially arc-shaped region. The third
      radially-directed flux may be directed in an opposite orientation
      with respect to said first radially-directed flux, and said fourth
      radially-directed flux may be directed in the same orientation
      with respect to said second radially-directed flux.<br>
      <br>
      In another exemplary aspect, an electromagnetic device includes a
      plurality of stationary field generator modules arranged along a
      path of motion. Each one of the stationary field generator modules
      includes a central axis extending between first and second
      opposite ends and lying substantially along the path of motion,
      and an electric coil responsive to a current signal in a first
      polarity to produce a north pole having a magnetic field oriented
      radially and directed outward substantially within a first plane
      that is orthogonal to a line extending from the central axis to a
      point exterior to the first end, and responsive to the current
      signal in the first polarity to produce a south pole having a
      magnetic field oriented radially and directed inward substantially
      within a second plane that is orthogonal to a line extending from
      the central axis to a point exterior to the second. The device
      also includes at least one armature. Each of the at least one
      armatures includes a base member extending between opposite first
      and second faces and arranged to partially surround one or more of
      the plurality of stationary field generator modules as the
      armature travels along the path of motion, and an armature field
      generator module arranged to generate a north pole magnetic field
      comprising magnetic flux oriented radially outward substantially
      within a third plane that is orthogonal to the path at a point
      exterior to the first face. The armature further includes an
      armature field generator module arranged to generate a south pole
      magnetic field comprising magnetic flux oriented radially inward
      substantially within a fourth plane that is orthogonal to the path
      at a point exterior to the second face. The device also includes a
      linking member to guide the armature along the path of motion in
      response to thrust of the armature generated upon intersection of
      either of the first or second planes with either of the third or
      fourth planes.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the device may further include a shaft
      coupled to the linking member for coupling to a load to transfer
      energy from the at least one armature to the load. The central
      axis may be linear in at least one of the plurality of stationary
      field generators, or it may include a curved portion in at least
      one of the plurality of stationary field generators. The
      stationary field generator modules define a substantially
      cylindrical geometry with a central axis disposed tangential to
      the path.<br>
      <br>
      The north pole may be orthogonal to a line extending from the
      central axis to the point exterior to the first end, and the south
      pole may be orthogonal to a line extending from the central axis
      to the point exterior to the second end. The intersecting planes
      may be approximately co-planar. The path may include at least one
      curvilinear portion.<br>
      <br>
      Various embodiments may achieve one or more advantages. For
      example, some embodiments may achieve substantially improved
      acceleration and thrust or torque at high speed, which may be
      associated with the control of counter-electromotive force (which
      may also be referred to herein as back-emf or CEMF). Some
      embodiments may achieve high thrust/torque with a substantial
      reduction in machine weight and cost, for example. For example,
      with non-metallic housing and/or reduction or elimination of
      metallic or high magnetic permeability shielding to control a
      relatively low level of stray flux. Advantageously, switching may
      be performed at low (e.g., synchronous) frequency using flyback
      capture techniques and apparatus, which may further enable
      stronger magnetic field production at enhanced efficiency levels
      with substantially negligible electromagnetic emissions (e.g.,
      EMI). Robust speed control speed may be implemented in some cases
      with simple angular position feedback. Embodiments may further
      benefit in volume manufacturing cost and reliability from a highly
      modular construction. High thrust/weight ratios may be implemented
      for rotational, curvilinear, and/or linear motor applications.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To aid understanding, this document is organized as follows.
      First, exemplary motor construction in various embodiments is
      introduced with reference to FIGS. 1-5. Disclosed structures may
      generate torque-producing field interactions in arc-shaped regions
      surrounding the stator and located ahead of a leading edge and/or
      behind a trailing edge of each armature. Second, with reference to
      FIGS. 6-9, the discussion turns to exemplary embodiments that
      illustrate external flux interaction for torque generation. Next,
      with reference to FIGS. 10-12, further discussion explains
      exemplary stator drive and control approaches, including
      discussion of operation of the motor with substantially reduced
      counter-emf. Finally, the detailed description section concludes
      with additional disclosure of various embodiments, features and
      implementation examples.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 1-2 show top and cross-section views of an exemplary motor
      with external field interaction for torque production.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 is a top-down view, which shows the mechanical arrangement
      of electric motor 100, depicted in this example as a rotating
      machine, although this is only by way of example and not
      limitation. Various embodiments and features disclosed herein can
      be readily adapted to a stator arranged along a motion path that
      includes linear and/or curvilinear segments.<br>
      <br>
      The motor 100 includes a segmented stator 105 formed by a number
      of solenoidal coils disposed along a path of motion for a pair of
      armature modules 110. In this example, the two opposing armature
      modules 110 rotate about an axis 115, to which each of the
      armature modules 110 are connected by an armature linkage member
      120.<br>
      <br>
      The stator 105 includes a series of segments 125. Each of the
      segments 125 may include a solenoid-wound coil, which may be
      independently controllable by a segment drive, examples of which
      will be described with reference to FIGS. 10-12. Each of the
      segments 125 is depicted as having an arc shape with opposing ends
      that each lie in a plane that contains the axis 115. Each of the
      segments 125 may be formed into a shape that follows a path of
      motion. In various applications, the armature modules 110 may
      traverse a path of motion that includes curvature (e.g., rotating
      machines, non-linear paths for a linear motor) and/or straight
      lines (e.g., point-to-point transfer). For example, material
      transfer devices, high-speed trains or light rail applications
      could implement a series of stator segments 125 disposed along a
      rail line to accelerate a load, such as a rail car, which may be
      coupled to one or more of the armature modules 110.<br>
      <br>
      The motor 100 includes a housing 130 that substantially encloses
      the stator 105 and armature modules 110. This housing 130 may
      provide safety against injury or damage during high speed
      operation of the motor 100. In some applications, the housing may
      be formed of a low magnetic permeability. For example, the housing
      130 may have a relative magnetic permeability of up to about 1.02,
      1.05, 1.08, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, or up to about 2.0. In
      examples with low stray magnetic flux levels, the motor 100 may
      advantageously have a lightweight design, for example, by
      providing a plastic housing 130. In some applications, the weight
      of the motor 100 may be reduced and/or the stator may be held in
      position by a non-metallic, nonconductive housing 130. Low
      permeability and/or non-conductive housings 130 may advantageously
      reduce manufacturing cost, materials cost, lower maintenance
      and/or reduce motor weight, in some examples. Advantageously, the
      solenoidal coil segments 125 may generate relatively low stray
      magnetic flux, as will be described in further detail with
      reference to, for example, FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 depicts a cross-sectional view showing an exemplary
      interior view of the motor 100. The motor 100 includes a shaft 205
      along the rotational axis 115. The shaft 205 is supported within
      the housing by a bearing 210. The shaft 205 is joined to the
      armature modules 110 by the armature linkage member 120.
      Electromagnetic torque generated by interaction of the external
      fields between the armature 110 and the stator 105 is transferred
      to the shaft 205 and thereby to any load (not shown) that may be
      coupled to the shaft 205.<br>
      <br>
      The stator 105 is shown supported on the housing 130 by support
      member 215. The armature 110 wraps substantially around a solenoid
      coil 220 of the stator 105. In various embodiments, the motor 100
      may generate torque by interaction of the armature field with a
      stator field in a region (e.g., several degrees) ahead of the
      leading face of the armature module 110, where the leading face is
      understood to be the face oriented toward the direction of
      armature motion. By proper selection of the orientation of the
      stator fields in selected ones of the segments 125, reinforcing
      field interactions may be achieved in the spatial region ahead of
      the leading face and behind the trailing face, which is opposite
      the leading face. These reinforcing field interactions may
      accelerate or decelerate the motor 100. In some examples, the
      segment(s) 125 that are overlapped by the armature modules 110 may
      be maintained in a substantially zero current state, thereby
      substantially reducing the counter-electromotive force (e.g.,
      back-emf) associated with time-varying coupling of armature flux
      to the stator coils. Dramatic reduction or substantial elimination
      of significant back-emf may advantageously enhance acceleration
      (or deceleration), torque at high speed ranges, and/or maximum
      speed capability for a given excitation voltage level.<br>
      <br>
      For purposes of controlling operation of the stator and/or
      regulating speed, some embodiments may include a feedback sensor
      that detects position of the armature modules. By way of example
      and not limitation, armature position may be determined by hall
      effect sensors or search coils mounted, for example, on or
      embedded in the plastic interior wall of the housing 130. Some
      precision embodiments may include a shaft-mounted high resolution
      encoder or resolver to measure angular position of the shaft 205
      and thus determine position of the armature modules 110.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows a top view of an exemplary stator with segmented
      coils. This depicted stator 305 shows the physical and electrical
      arrangement of the stator. In this example, the core 310 of the
      stator is a continuous ring of ferrous material. The conductive
      windings 315 are segmented to produce individually controlled
      electromagnets. In some applications, the electromagnets may be
      driven by multi-polarity D.C. switches, examples of which are
      described with reference to FIGS. 10, 12. Each segmented winding
      315 may be driven by a dedicated multi-polarity switch. This makes
      it possible to generate moving, multiple magnetic fields of either
      polarity through the stationary stator.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 shows top views of exemplary stators with exemplary
      armature embodiments. In addition to the two armature embodiment
      of FIG. 1, other embodiments may have (a) three, (b) four, (c)
      five or more armature modules 405. In some example, there may be
      air gaps between the core segments 410 to permit localized stator
      fields to be generated to support both even and odd numbers of
      armatures. Further embodiments may include 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
      14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24 or more coplanar armatures on each shaft.
      Sets of coplanar armatures may be coupled to a common shaft in
      parallel planes, for example. Each armature may contribute
      additional torque through external field interactions with the
      stator in the regions ahead of each armature's leading edge and
      behind each armature's trailing edge. Increased numbers of
      armatures may substantially reduce, for example, torque ripple
      amplitude.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to FIG. 1, symmetry may allow two or more of the
      segments 125 to be controlled by a single driver, for example,
      where excitation timing (e.g., turn-on, turn-off times) are
      substantially the same. This may be the case, in the depicted
      example of FIG. 4b, for each pair of the segments 125 that are 180
      degrees apart.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 shows side and top cross-section details of an exemplary
      armature with an array of permanent magnet elements in a horseshoe
      arrangement around the periphery of a horseshoe armature. The
      figure depicts the armature module 110 supported by the armature
      linkage member 120. At a distal end of the armature linkage member
      120 is a support member 505 to surround and support a high
      permeability ring 510, which may be formed of a steel or ferrous
      material, for example, in a substantially cylindrical shape around
      a central axis. Armature fields are generated by permanent magnet
      515, which is depicted in this view from a north pole. If the
      armature module 110 were viewed from the opposite side, the
      permanent magnet 515 may present a south pole, for example.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 shows a schematic diagram of exemplary embodiments of the
      permanent magnet elements of FIG. 5, with illustrative magnetic
      flux lines shown. In the depicted examples, an armature field
      generator element 600, 605 includes the high permeability ring 510
      providing a low reluctance path for magnetic flux generated by
      permanent magnets 610, 615, 620, 625.<br>
      <br>
      The permanent magnets 610, 615 are magnetized in an orientation
      with north and south poles adjacent the respective end poles of
      the ring 510 such that flux is oriented along respective axes
      orthogonal to the respective pole faces. The permanent magnets
      620, 625 are magnetized in an orientation with north and south
      poles aligned to direct flux substantially parallel to the
      respective end poles of the ring 510.<br>
      <br>
      In the armature field generator element 600, the permanent magnets
      610 generates a radial field directed inward with respect to a
      central axis of the armature on a first face of the armature
      module 110. The permanent magnet 615 generates a radial field
      directed outward with respect to a central axis on a second face
      of the armature module 110, where the second face is on a side
      opposite from the first face. In one direction of rotation, one of
      the first and second faces would be considered the leading edge
      face, and the remaining face would be considered the trailing edge
      face.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, in the armature field generator element 605, the
      permanent magnets 620 generates a radial field directed inward
      with respect to a central axis of the armature on a first face of
      the armature module 110. The permanent magnet 625 generates a
      radial field directed outward with respect to a central axis on a
      second face of the armature module 110.<br>
      <br>
      In these examples, a ferrous horseshoe ring, such as the ring 510,
      may be used to shape the magnetic fields produced by the permanent
      magnets in the armature heads. The ferrous horseshoe ring may
      provide a highly permeable path for the magnets lines of force.
      This creates a magnetic field shape like doughnuts, with a
      south-pole magnetic doughnut on one side of the armature head and
      a north-pole magnetic doughnut on the other side of the armature
      head.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, a suitable arc-shaped armature field may be
      generated in the region ahead of the leading edge and in the
      region behind the trailing edge of the armature by a discrete
      array of several modules 600 or 605 arranged at intervals around
      the periphery of the support member 505. With reference to FIG.
      5a, the armature module 110 may include three modules 600, as
      shown as 515 in the depicted example.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 shows a top view schematic diagram of the motor of FIG. 1,
      showing exemplary magnetic fields during thrust-generating
      operation. This depicted drawing represents the relationship
      between the rotating magnetic fields of the stator to the
      permanent magnetic fields of the armature. In this two armature
      system, there are four points of force on the armature heads all
      in the same direction. N to N push, S to N pull, S to S push, N to
      S pull. The armature heads become trapped between the rotational
      stator fields causing the armature to rotate. The force of the
      push and pull points produces torque at the output shaft of the
      motor.<br>
      <br>
      A motor 700 includes a pair of armatures 705, 710 adapted for
      traversing a circular motion path. In operation, torque may be
      produced by field interactions, for example, in one or more planes
      715, 720 in a region ahead of a leading edge of the armatures 705,
      710, respectively. Additional torque may be produced by field
      interactions, for example, in one or more planes 725, 730 in
      regions behind a trailing edge of the armatures 705, 710,
      respectively. Selective current injection into selected stator
      coil segments generate, in this example, stator fields 735, 740
      with radial components in the planes 715, 720, respectively, and
      stator fields 745, 750 with radial components in the planes 725,
      730, respectively. The interaction of radial components of the
      armature and stator fields generates a thrust on the armatures
      705, 710. Polarity of the field interactions to produce positive
      or negative torque are disclosed in further detail with reference
      to FIGS. 8-9.<br>
      <br>
      The depicted example presents exemplary shape and orientation of
      the magnetic fields generated by the stator. As will be described
      with reference to FIG. 11, the fields may be advanced
      incrementally by the binary logic generator with at least one
      de-energized stator segment between the two stator magnetic
      fields. Spacing, direction and density of the magnetic fields may
      be controlled by the switching circuitry and the binary logic
      pattern.<br>
      <br>
      As depicted in the figure, stator segment coils 755, 760, 765
      generate the fields 735, 745, and no field is generated by the
      coil 760 while it is in proximity (e.g., overlap) by the armature
      705. Similarly, stator segment coils 770, 775, 780 generate the
      fields 740, 750, and no field is generated by the coil 775 while
      it is in proximity (e.g., overlap) by the armature 710. By not
      allowing current to flow in coils while overlapped by the
      armature, back-emf may be substantially reduced or avoided at high
      speeds.<br>
      <br>
      In various embodiments, electrical induction from the armature's
      permanent magnets to the stator may be substantially eliminated
      because the armature heads are always positioned over stator
      segments that are in the off or open (e.g., non-conductive)
      electrical condition. No current path is completed in that stator
      segment so induction cannot occur. As such, the armature heads
      cannot produce opposing magnetic fields in the overlapped stator
      winding.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 shows a top view schematic diagram of an armature and
      stator to illustrate exemplary operation of magnetic fields in
      additional detail. In this illustrative example, a motor 800
      includes an armature 805 with a trailing edge in motion away from
      a stator coil 810 and a leading edge in motion toward a stator
      coil 815. In operation, repulsive thrust is generated, by way of
      example and not limitation, by interaction of fields in an
      arc-shaped region that includes an interaction plane 820 behind
      the trailing edge of the armature 805. Attractive thrust is
      generated, by way of example and not limitation, by interaction of
      fields in an arc-shaped region that includes an interaction plane
      825 in front of the leading edge of the armature 805.<br>
      <br>
      In the interaction plane 820, an outward-directed radial magnetic
      field 830 generated by current in a solenoid winding of the stator
      coil 810 reinforces an outward-directed radial magnetic field 835
      generated by permanent magnets and shaped by magnetic structures
      of the armature 805. The interacting fields may be distributed
      over an arc or horse-shoe shaped region in a volume on either side
      of the interaction plane 820. The interaction of the fields 830,
      835 generate a repulsive force on the armature 835 in the
      direction away from the stator coil 810.<br>
      <br>
      In the interaction plane 825, an outward-directed radial magnetic
      field 840 generated by current in a solenoid winding of the stator
      coil 815 weakens an inward-directed radial magnetic field 845
      generated by permanent magnets and shaped by magnetic structures
      of the armature 805. The interacting fields may be distributed
      over an arc or horse-shoe shaped region in a volume on either side
      of the interaction plane 825. The interaction of the fields 840,
      845 generate an attractive force on the armature 835 in the
      direction toward the stator coil 815.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the solenoidal coil segments 810, 815 may generate
      relatively low stray magnetic flux. The flux generated by each of
      the stator segments, when active, includes a closed path that may
      be strongest in the region immediately in and around the segment,
      and substantially weaker elsewhere. As depicted in this example
      with reference to the coil 810, the closed magnetic path for an
      active segment includes: an external tangential component directed
      substantially parallel to the segments 810 from a first end to an
      opposing second end of the segment, an exterior and
      radially-directed segment of inward directed flux adjacent the
      second end, an internal tangential component directed
      substantially parallel to the segment from the second end to the
      first end, and an exterior and radially-directed segment of
      outward directed flux adjacent the first end.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 shows schematic diagrams exemplary armature and stator
      magnetic fields in an interaction plane from an end view
      perspective.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9a depicts a cross-section of outward-directed radial flux
      distributed across an arc-shaped (e.g., horse shoe-shaped) region,
      as may be generated by the armature 805 in the previously
      described interaction plane 820, for example. FIG. 9b depicts a
      cross-section of inward-directed radial flux distributed across an
      arc-shaped (e.g., horse shoe-shaped) region, as may be generated
      by the armature 805 in the previously described interaction plane
      825, for example. FIG. 9c depicts a cross-section of
      inward-directed radial flux distributed across an annular region,
      as may be generated by the stator coil 810 at an end opposite from
      the interaction plane 820, for example. FIG. 9d depicts a
      cross-section of outward-directed radial flux distributed across
      an annular region, as may be generated by the stator coils 810,
      815 at the respective interaction planes 820, 825, for example.<br>
      <br>
      Attraction forces may occur in response to radial field components
      oriented in opposite direction between the stator field and the
      armature field. For example, thrust may be directed to attract the
      armature toward a stator coil in the following combinations:
      [9a,9c] or [9b,9d]. Repulsive forces may occur in response to
      radial field components oriented in the same direction between the
      stator field and the armature field. For example, thrust may be
      directed to repel the armature away from a stator coil in the

      FIGS. 10-11 show schematic diagrams of exemplary stator drive and
      control systems arranged at the per-stator segment and system
      levels.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 depicts an exemplary drive configured to a single stator
      segment. A segment drive sub-system 1000 includes an electronic
      switching circuitry module (ESCM) 1005 coupled to provide positive
      or negative polarity signals to a stator solenoid coil 1010. A gas
      tube 1015 provides a transitional voltage clamp between pulse and
      capture circuits. Polarity, pulse width, timing, and on/off states
      are controlled by the binary logic input signals 1020. In some
      examples, the logic inputs may be connected by a logic buss that
      is common to all stator segments switching modules. The ESCM 1005
      may be synchronized by a master control pulse 1025 provided by a
      master control module that controls motor operations and receives
      motor performance and command input signals.<br>
      <br>
      The ESCM 1005 includes a DC supply input 1030 to power the module
      and supply energy to drive the solenoid coil. The ESCM 1005
      further provides an output signal 1035 for sending capturing
      inductive (e.g., flyback) energy from the load that may otherwise
      be lost as heat. An exemplary circuit for controlling the solenoid
      coil 1010 during rapid switch turn-off and capturing and recycling
      the stored inductive energy are described in further detail with
      reference to FIG. 12.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 11 shows a series of the segment drive sub-systems 1000
      configured for control by a Motor Controller/Binary Logic
      Generator (MC) 1105. The MC 1105 produces the clock-generated
      logic binary patterns that drive the switching modules. A binary
      data buss carries the binary logic pattern to the switching
      modules. In response to each clock step, the appropriate segment
      drive sub-systems 1000 generate magnetic fields that increment in
      a rotational pattern.<br>
      <br>
      The speed of the motor may be controlled by the speed of the clock
      steps. The master control pulse may be generated by the control
      unit and is an output common to all switching modules. The master
      control pulse synchronizes the switching modules to each other.
      Output shaft torque may be controlled by the pulse width of the
      master control pulse. The MC 1105 receives motor sensor signals
      1035 from one or more position and/or speed sensors, for example.<br>
      <br>
      An electronic switching module drives each stator electromagnet.
      The switching module is a multi-polarity switch that operates from
      a single polarity electrical supply source. The switching module
      acts as a pulse width modulator and also captures Reverse
      Electro-Motive Force. The fly-back energy produced by the stator
      segment is routed to a load or storage device as usable electrical
      energy. This produces a reduction in input impedance by the stator
      segment which makes it possible to drive the stator segment with
      high frequency Direct Current input pulses. The pulse width (e.g.,
      duty cycle) determines the average field density of the magnetic
      field produced by the electromagnet. The ESCM 1005 may output
      pulses and capture flyback energy in either magnetic polarity.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 12 shows an exemplary electronic switching circuit module
      suitable for the segment drive sub-system 1000 of FIGS. 10-11. A
      segment drive sub-system 1200 includes an input rectifier 1205
      that permits flyback capture energy from either of switch modules
      1210a, 1210b to be stored in capacitor 1215 at a voltage above the
      source input voltage. During operation, the MC 1105 selects one of
      the switch modules 1210a, 1210b to deliver a positive or negative
      polarity pulse to the solenoid coil. At the appropriate time, as
      predetermined by the MC 1105 to control the armature position,
      speed, or torque, for example, the MC 1105 causes the switches in
      the selected module 1210 to connect the desired polarity input to
      the solenoid.<br>
      <br>
      Initially, current flows from the capacitor 1215 to the load
      through current path A, A'. When the capacitor discharges its
      previously stored flyback energy, the source supplies current to
      the load via current path B, B'. At the end of the pulse, the MC
      110 may activate a transitional voltage clamp which passes current
      for a short interval while the switches turn off, forcing load
      current to flow through current path C, C'. The current then
      switches to path D, D' to allow the leakage energy remaining in
      the solenoid coil to be recaptured and stored for use on the
      subsequent cycle.<br>

      modules. For all purposes, including for example its disclosure of
      exemplary switching modules as described with reference to FIGS.

      of U.S. Pat. No. 7,602,157 to Babcock, et al., entitled “Supply
      Architecture for Inductive Loads.”<br>
      <br>
      Some disclosed embodiments include switch modules in combination
      with transformers. For all purposes, including for example its
      disclosure of AC operation as described with reference to FIG. 3A,
      this document incorporates by reference the entire contents of
      U.S. Publ. 2009/0073726 to Babcock, et al., entitled “Current
      Waveform Construction to Generate AC Power with Low Harmonic
      Distortion from Localized Energy Sources.”<br>
      <br>
      In an exemplary embodiment, the force or thrust generated on the
      armature may be a function of the size of the region of
      interaction among the fields. In various embodiments, the armature
      may be attracted toward a stator coil when, for example, the field
      lines interact to cancel, or weaken, the energy stored in the
      magnetic field. Field interactions between stator and armature may
      occur between radial, tangential, and/or axial components of flux.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the stator design may be a split toroid
      arrangement of solenoid type coils with ferrous cores and
      conductive windings that act as individually controlled
      electro-magnets. Individual control of the electro-magnets may be
      accomplished electronically with semiconductors. Each coil may
      have an electronic switching module that is controlled by binary
      data. The electronic switching module may be used to control
      magnetic polarity, control average coil magnetic field density
      with pulse width modulation and to capture counter Electro-motive
      force from the coil. Counter Electro-motive force that has been
      captured by the switching modules may be used as a secondary power
      source for the motor. The stator may be the stationary element of
      the motor but generates moving magnetic fields. This may be
      accomplished by driving the electronic switching modules with
      binary data from a logic generator. The stator may be mounted in a
      non-conductive, non-metallic housing. Using non-conductive
      material prevents counter-motive magnetic forces that would be
      produced in a metallic housing from opposing armature rotation.
      The stator may be mounted on a circular ring inside the housing
      that elevates the stator, leaving 320 degrees of open space around
      the circumference of the stator. The 320 degrees of open space
      around the stator may be where the magnetic fields between the
      stator and the armature interact. The armature may be composed of
      non-metallic arms mounted perpendicular to a metallic drive shaft.
      The drive shaft may be mounted on bearings perpendicular to the
      stator toroid and in the exact center of the stator toroid. On the
      end of each arm may be a non-metallic horseshoe shaped ring that
      holds a horseshoe shaped ring of permanent magnets. This may be
      called a horseshoe on horseshoe arrangement. The horseshoe arrays
      of permanent magnets on each end of the armature wrap around the
      stator. The magnetic fields produced by the magnet arrays may be
      circular in shape and occupy the space around the stator coils.
      The circular magnetic fields of the armature either push or pull
      against the magnetic fields of the stator. This push-pull action
      may be the force that drives the armature into rotation. This
      mechanical configuration between stator and armature may be
      designed to reduce or eliminate counter-motive forces between
      stator and armature.<br>
      <br>
      In some examples, the magnetic fields in the armature may interact
      with the stator fields while interaction with the stator windings
      is reduced. The increased area that the fields interact in
      compensates for loss of force. Other examples for reducing or
      eliminating counter-motive force may be accomplished by the
      electronic control.<br>
      <br>
      In various embodiments, the rotating magnetic fields in the stator
      may be always separated by at least one segment of the stator in
      the off or open circuit condition. The armature's magnet arrays
      may be always trapped between the stator's rotating magnetic
      fields and may be always positioned over segments of the stator in
      the off condition. As the magnetic fields of the armature pass
      over the segmented windings of the stator it cannot induce
      counter-motive force because those windings may be in open
      condition and electrical current cannot flow from induction and
      cannot produce any opposing magnetic fields to the armature. A
      motor armature that produces little or no counter-motive force can
      be driven to a given amount torque and speed with much less
      electrical power. This armature to stator configuration also
      reduces vibration because the push-pull arrangement between
      armature and stator magnetic fields produces a vibration dampening
      effect. The armature also uses increased length between the points
      of force and the output shaft to increase leverage and thus shaft
      torque. The design of the electric drive system of this motor may
      promote advantages in operation. The design of the electromagnetic
      elements of the motor is of a high induction concept with long
      lengths of conductor and efficient, highly permeable core
      material. In some implementations, this may produce electromagnets
      that have a high current to magnetic field ratio with minimal
      hysteresis and core loss.<br>
      <br>
      The semiconductor circuits may be used to drive the electromagnets
      with a high frequency stream of pulsed D.C. current. The width of
      the D.C. current pulse may be used to control the average field
      density of electromagnet. The current switches may be designed to
      switch at high speeds with very steep on/off slopes and may be
      immune from destruction from polarity reversals and fly-back
      energy (reverse EMF) produced by the electromagnets. The current
      switches also operate through a broad voltage range. Substantially
      precise timing may be used and binary logic is used to accomplish
      precision high-speed timing of the electronic switches that drive
      the electromagnetic elements of the motor. Reverse EMF produced by
      the electromagnets may be controlled by a switching circuit that
      collapses the Reverse EMF from a high-voltage low-current state to
      a low-voltage high-current state while at the same time diverting
      the Reverse EMF energy to an output as usable energy. This
      technique used to control Reverse EMF greatly reduces the input
      impedance of the electromagnets. As such, various examples may
      input a high-frequency high-current pulse stream into a high
      induction electromagnet. Impedance to high frequencies may be
      reduced or eliminated so the electromagnets offer little
      resistance to high frequency current flow. The captured reverse
      EMF can be used to supplement the input power source to increase
      motor efficiency or it can be used to run external devices or
      circuits. Each electromagnet in the stator has its own switching
      and capture circuits that may be controlled by a two-bit binary
      input and a pulse width control input. All the electromagnet
      switching circuits may be tied to a master control pulse so that
      the switching circuits pulse on and capture Reverse EMF
      synchronously. Changing the master control pulse's width changes
      the average on time of all electromagnets in the stator. This
      translates into a change in the average magnetic field density of
      the rotating magnetic fields. This gives electronic control of the
      ft/lbs. of force exerted on the armature drive shaft. The two-bit
      binary input controls on/off and selects the magnetic polarity of
      the electromagnet. All the switching circuits input controls may
      be tied to a logic generator via a data buss. The logic generator
      may be clock driven, and generates a new switching pattern every
      time the clock cycles. The switching pattern changes in such a way
      as to advance north and south magnetic fields around and through
      the stator. The faster the logic generator clocks the faster the
      fields propagate through the stator and the faster the armature
      spins. Logic generator clock speed determines RPM. Changing the
      generator logic pattern can reverse the direction of the armature
      spin. A microprocessor can be used to generate logic patterns. A
      microprocessor can also be used to control and monitor other
      functions of the motor such as matching torque to load, speed
      control and many other functions. Using the innovative approaches
      of eliminating magnetic counter-motive forces between armature and
      stator, controlling and using reverse EMF as a power source,
      eliminating high induction impedance from electromagnets. Using
      semiconductor circuits that can switch high-current at
      high-voltages in multi-polarity conditions that may be immune from
      destruction of fly-back collapse, and controlling all motor
      function with a digital logic system has produced an extremely
      efficient and powerful D.C. electric motor.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, various machines as
      described herein may be operated as a generator by allowing
      current to flow in a coil segment while armature flux has
      substantial coupling to the coil. Accordingly, regenerative
      braking may be implemented, for example, in an electric vehicle
      application. Kinetic energy of the armature and any connected load
      (e.g., flywheel) can be recovered by storing the energy coupled
      into the stator coil segments in a battery, for example.<br>

      Apparatus and associated systems and methods may relate to a
      process for supplying unidirectional current to a load,
      controlling a reverse electromotive force (REMF), capturing
      inductive energy from the load, and supplying the captured
      inductive energy to the load. In an illustrative example, an
      operating cycle may include a sequence of operations. First,
      inductive energy captured from the load on a previous cycle may be
      supplied to the load. Second, energy may be supplied to the load
      from an external power source. Third, a REMF voltage may be
      substantially controlled upon disconnecting the power source from
      the load. Fourth, the load current may be brought to zero by
      capturing the inductive energy for use on a subsequent cycle. In
      some embodiments, a single power stage may supply a DC inductive
      load, or a pair of power stages may be operated to supply
      bidirectional current to an AC load.<br>

      Methods and apparatus to provide low harmonic distortion AC power
      for distribution by converting energy from natural or renewable

      converted electrical energy into substantially sinusoidal AC
      voltage at a secondary winding of the transformer. For example, AC
      power may be supplied to a utility power grid from raw electrical
      energy from renewable energy sources (e.g., solar cells). An
      inverter may construct the primary winding current waveform using
      two unidirectional switches. On each half cycle, one of the
      switches first applies energy previously recaptured from primary
      winding inductance, and then applies the raw energy to the
      transformer primary winding at the utility power grid frequency.;
