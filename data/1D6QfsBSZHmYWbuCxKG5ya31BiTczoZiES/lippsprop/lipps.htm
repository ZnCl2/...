      Many aircraft manufacturers design their cowls with the inlets as

      designed to produce thrust at the root, allowing the cooling

      <b>The Program</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Several years ago I loaded Peter Talbot’s “Prop Performance” BASIC
      program on my computer. I obtained this program from a listing in
      Modern Propeller and Duct Design by Hollman and Bettosini. After
      playing around with the program for a while, I used it as the
      basis for developing a program of my own. I read about propeller,
      wing, and airfoil theory in several books and tried to incorporate
      what I had read into my program. These were things that were not
      contained in the original program - things such as the effects on
      lift and drag coefficients from Reynolds number and high Mach
      compressibility, as well as lift distribution, design lift
      coefficient, and planform.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Propeller is a Wing</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      All books on wing theory state that the most efficient wing makes
      use of an elliptical planform/elliptical lift distribution. Since
      a propeller is basically a wing in rotary motion, creating its
      lift and thrust from the combination of rotary and forward motion,
      I reasoned that an elliptical lift would be my “E” ticket choice.<br>
      <br>
      Lift on a wing is a function of the flow of air generating a force
      that is resolved into lift and drag. That force is proportional to
      the square of the velocity. Double the speed and the available
      lift goes up by a factor of four. Cut the speed in half and the
      available lift is only one-fourth as much.<br>
      <br>
      All parts of the wing of an airplane basically go through the air
      at the same airspeed, except in a tight turn at low airspeed. But
      now consider that on a propeller, the rotational velocity at any
      point on it is mainly based on the radius at that point. Except
      for propeller-induced inflow, the static flow of a 72-inch
      rotating propeller will be six times as fast at the 36-inch tip as
      it is at the 6-inch hub/spinner radius. This means that the
      available force at 36 inches will be 36 times as great as at 6
      inches! A propeller having a constant chord, with correct helical
      twist, would be similar to having a wing on a plane that had a tip
      chord 36 times wider than at the root! This would be exactly the
      opposite of an elliptically loaded wing. Think of the incredible
      bending force that would result from a wing like that.<br>
      <br>
      To obtain a propeller with an elliptical lift distribution, it is
      first necessary to start off with a planform that has a constant
      lift distribution and then modify this by the coordinates of an
      ellipse. Without considering forward speed, a constant lift
      planform would result from tapering the prop inversely
      proportional to the radius squared, making it extremely wide at
      the root and very narrow at the tip. See the propellers on the
      CarterCopter and AeroVironment’s 14-motor solar-powered flying
      wing.<br>
      <br>
      A wing has to operate over a wide range of speeds, in some cases
      as much as 5:1, and 3:1 is not at all unusual. That means the
      available lift force will vary over a 9:1 to 25:1 ratio. At the
      lower end, near stall, the wing will operate near the peak lift
      coefficient (CL). For a wing with flaps, that would be about 2.0.
      At high speed, the CL would only be one-ninth as much, or 0.22. A
      propeller, on the other hand, does not have nearly as much
      velocity variation along its span, except in the root area, since
      its major velocity is due to rotation, so it does not need as much
      CL range. This is a real advantage, as it is possible to make use
      of the higher lift/drag (L/D) ratio of a more highly loaded
      airfoil. Some of the laminar-flow airfoils in the 63-65 series
      have L/D ratios in excess of 100 at high CL.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Airfoils</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A laminar-flow airfoil will have a minimum drag coefficient, CD,
      of about .004. On a symmetrical section, that minimum occurs at CL
      = 0. Dividing the CL by CD gives a zero lift/drag ratio. Not
      something to write home about. But taking that same section and
      giving it sufficient camber so that this CD minimum occurs at a CL
      of 0.55 would yield an L/D of 110 to 138!<br>
      <br>
      A symmetrical airfoil must operate at a high angle of attack (AOA)
      in order to generate lift, so it also has a high induced drag,
      which results from the rearward tilt of the airfoil. A cambered
      section can generate a moderate CL at zero AOA, so it has minimum
      induced drag. Did you ever look at where the bugs are smashed on
      the leading edge of your wing? Notice that they are usually just
      above the leading edge. That’s because you usually pick them up
      when landing over a field that’s next to a runway. With the flaps
      down, the airfoil is very highly cambered and generates lift at a
      negative AOA; the bugs hit on the top of the airfoil, not the
      bottom!<br>
      <br>
      Most wood propellers generally have a flat-bottom airfoil that is
      somewhat similar to a Clark or RAF section. These are referred to
      as turbulent flow sections. Two of the big-name prop makers I’m
      aware of use a section that has a completely flat bottom with a
      sharp leading edge! A sharp leading edge will only perform
      reasonably well when it intercepts the incoming flow on a line
      that bisects the edge angle (i.e., where the point is pointed into
      the relative wind). At small flow angles off this line the flow
      will get tripped right at the leading edge, creating much drag.
      How many subsonic jets have you seen with a flat-bottom airfoil?
      None, right? Those airfoils have drag coefficients almost 50
      percent greater than the laminar-flow airfoils. For that matter,
      when have you seen a high-performance sailplane with a flat-bottom
      airfoil? Does this give you a clue as to proper airfoil selection
      and use? Granted, laminar-flow sections are harder to carve but
      are well worth the extra time it takes to make them. Why use
      high-drag airfoils on the high velocity of a prop? As long as the
      Reynolds number is greater than about 400,000, the laminar-flow
      section will outperform the turbulent-flow sections.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Blade Angle</b><br>
      <br>
      Now it is necessary to determine the blade angle versus the
      radius, the helical path each portion of the blade follows as it
      passes through the air. Without consideration of the AOA, the
      tangent of the helical path at any radius is obtained by dividing
      the design forward speed by the rotational velocity at that
      radius. For a plane with a design speed of 200 mph, we multiply by
      22/15 to get the speed in feet/second. To get the rotational
      velocity at a given radius, we multiply the radius, in inches, by
      2 x p x rpm/60 x radius/12. With the engine operated at its rated
      2800 rpm, we would obtain 63.4 degrees at 6-inch radius, 36.9
      degrees at 15-inch, and 21.8 degrees at 30-inch.<br>
      <br>
      Some would look at that high angle at 6-inch radius and have a
      tizzy! The inner portion of a prop generates no thrust, right?
      Wrong! The portion right up to the spinner can generate very high
      thrust-to-horsepower ratios.<br>
      <br>
      But you’ll say, “Look how steep the prop is here. It’s working
      against the engine.” Trigonometry to the rescue. We can resolve
      the lift force at any radius of the blade into a forward thrust
      force and a rotary force acting against the engine’s rotation.
      Using the root and tip angles we just obtained, one unit of lift
      at 6-inch would give 0.45 units of thrust and 0.89 units of rotary
      force. One unit of lift at 30-inch would give 0.93 units of thrust
      and 0.37 units of rotary force. But—now we have to multiply the
      rotary force by the radius, in feet, to get the torque force
      acting against the engine. That means that the thrust/torque ratio
      at 6-inch is 0.45/(6-inch/12-inchx 0.89) = 1.00, and at 30-inch is
      0.93/(30-inch/12-inchx 0.37) = 1.00.<br>
      <br>
      The root section can do one of three things: generate thrust as
      well as drag, generate no thrust as well as drag, and generate
      reverse thrust as well as drag. The drag is always there; only
      thrust can be designed in!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cowling and Inlets</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      If the prop has too little angle in the root region, it develops
      reverse thrust, slowing down the air needed for cooling. That’s
      why so many cowlings have cooling inlets mounted so far outboard
      where the prop’s angles are more conducive to producing thrust.
      The inlets on my Lancair are mounted with their inner wall in line
      with the spinner. So too is my induction inlet. In this way I pick
      up the accelerated flow displaced by the spinner. My O-235, with
      123 horsepower, gets its cooling air from 1.5—inch-by-4-inch
      inlets—6 square inches per side! Compare that to others! And guess
      what? My engine runs too cool; I can’t always get the CHT up to
      the correct temperature of 385 F/195 C.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Another Myth</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Many propeller articles state that there is increased drag from
      having the prop accelerate the air over the cowl. In other words,
      if the prop is producing thrust there, the cowl will have more
      drag. So by having the prop not produce thrust at its inboard
      region, there will be no additional drag. Following this line of
      reasoning, it would seem to be better to have a lot of reverse
      thrust in front of the cowl and so reduce its drag! Wow! That
      really makes sense! Why not just use a pusher prop on a tractor
      airplane so that there will be no air flowing to the rear over the
      fuselage and thus no drag? The air being sucked in by the prop
      from rear to front flowing over the fuselage will propel the plane
      forward?<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Truth</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      My prop in cruise at 200 mph gives a delta-v to the air behind the
      prop of less than 10 feet/second, even less in the inner 6 inches.
      Two hundred miles per hour is 293 feet/second; (293 + 10)/293 =
      3.4 percent increase in the airspeed over the cowl. Not too much
      cowling drag created here.<br>
      <br>
      A school of propeller theory says that the cowling behind the
      propeller causes a large bubble of air to be pushed ahead, which
      causes a slowing of the flow into the prop. With this supposed
      slower flow field, it would be necessary to take this into account
      when calculating the helix angle, which would result in reduced
      angles. I think much of this theory is from the 1930s, when planes
      had radial engines with large surface areas normal to the airflow.<br>
      <br>
      I’ve even seen illustrations showing the view looking downward on
      the front of the cowl/prop, which shows the cheeks of the cowl
      sticking out each side apparently blocking the airflow. But when
      the cowling is viewed from the side, it can be seen that the line
      from the spinner usually blends in smoothly to the top and bottom
      of the cowling. Only that portion of the cowling around the inlets
      is normal to the flow, and if the inlet apertures are properly
      sized, there is little reverse flow. But consider: If the prop
      angles are reduced in this area, when they pass through the top
      and bottom region unblocked by the cowling, they will be at too
      low an angle of attack, producing either no or reverse thrust
      there. Only in the small region where the flow velocity is
      somewhat reduced will the prop be producing thrust. With the
      correct helix angles, the prop will be at the correct AOA through
      most of its revolution (especially the 180-degree arc over the top
      of the cowl, as viewed from the front), and at a higher AOA in the
      blocked area, but still producing thrust!<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Tip</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This brings up another issue. It is easy to see that a drag force
      acting near the tip can generate large values of torque due to the
      long lever arm. A Cessna 182 flying at 7,500 feet, 2700 rpm, 156
      mph, on a standard day, with a 72-inch prop, will have a tip Mach
      of 0.81. Its drag coefficient will be at least three times as much
      as in the root area—that is, if the tip is in good, smooth
      condition without a lot of pitting from stones and rain. But on a
      propeller, as on a wing, there is no lift at the tip. The lift
      pressure differential on a wing or prop goes to zero at the
      tip—therefore, no lift. But there is drag, and lots of it, due to
      the high Mach. And since area is a product of span and chord, the
      wider the tip chord, the greater the area and the greater the
      drag. This is one of the main reasons why props with wide, rounded
      tips are so inefficient. A high-efficiency prop will have a
      pointed tip, zero chord. The high-Mach, wide, rounded-tip props
      are also the ones that generate so much noise. That noise is
      engine power being thrown away. And any prop that further
      complicates a wide tip with a wide, turned-under or turned-up tip
      really throws away engine power. Those may look very techie, but
      they aren’t very efficient!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Another Propeller</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following will illustrate how important to efficiency it is to
      have the root section of the prop produce thrust and to minimize
      tip drag. We had a prop with turned-under tips, absolutely flat
      bottom, sharp leading edge, and a root angle about 15 degrees less
      than the correct helix angle. This prop gave 214 mph TAS at 8,000
      feet density altitude (D.Alt.) and 2950 rpm. Removing the
      turned-under portion of the tips and creating a “slashed” tip,
      along with adding fiberglass layers from the spinner out 12-inch
      to increase chord 1-inch and increase its angle, gave a prop that
      gave 218 mph TAS at 8,000 feet D.Alt. and 2720 rpm. By a method to
      be shown later, the efficiency of the prop was increased by 15
      percent! More speed at less power!<br>
      A slashed tip on a square-tip prop is created by first drawing a
      line across the blade on the bottom surface about 15 percent of
      the tip chord in from the tip. Shape the tip from this line
      straight radially outward up to the top surface of the tip,
      forming a very sharp edge. This sharp edge trips the vortex at the
      very outer edge, giving the most efficient tip. It will increase
      full-throttle rpm by 20 to 50 and give a 1- to 5-mph speed
      increase.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Practical Application</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The first prop I designed (with my prop design program) was for
      use on a Lancair 235 with an O-320. It was to be used for mild
      racing and was intended to be capable of turning 10 percent over
      redline rpm. It was carbon fiber over a laminated wood core. The
      wood core was carved on a CNC (computer numerical control) machine
      specially made for propeller carving. When I gave the chord and
      angle data to my friend who makes props, he wanted to know if I
      really wanted him to make it for me, as its chord and angle
      distribution was like nothing else he had ever seen. He and others
      felt that it would not work well, if at all.<br>
      <br>
      I can tell you I had a lot of trepidation at this point, not only
      because of the feedback from those I respected, but also because
      the prop really did have an extremely unusual planform and helix
      angle distribution. One of my programs predicted the Lancair’s
      speed at 1,000 feet, 5,500 feet, and 10,000 feet density altitudes
      at 100 rpm increments from 2400 rpm to 3100 rpm. Since this was my
      first go at prop design, I would have been happy if it had
      performed within 5 percent to 10 percent of my predictions. The
      prop met or slightly exceeded the speeds at all test points. We
      were able to get 2,000 feet/minute rate of climb at 110 mph IAS,
      2,700 rpm and 240 mph at 5,500 feet D.Alt. at 3150 rpm.<br>
      <br>
      The program predicted the peak cruise efficiency at 90 percent.
      Some other props that we tested on the Lancair were from 12
      percent to 27 percent less efficient than this prop. The 27
      percent figure was relative to that flat-bottom, turned-under tip
      prop that I later modified! That’s like throwing away 19 hp to 43
      hp on a 160-hp engine.<br>
      <br>
      My latest prop is a 63-inch-diameter three-blade for my Lancair
      235 with an O-235-L2C. It is fiberglass over a laminated wood core
      and was made by Craig Catto of Catto Props. It uses a 13 percent
      thick, 63series laminar-flow airfoil. The blades have a lot of
      flex near the tip and can be bent forward about 1 inch without too
      much effort. It should be remembered, though, that there is little
      lift/thrust near the tip, and combining that with the centrifugal
      stiffening, this flex usually occurs only in static conditions and
      not in cruise.<br>
      <br>
      I designed it to give 200 mph TAS at 10,000 feet density altitude
      at 2800 rpm. I am actually getting about 202 to 203 mph. With me
      and 20 gallons of fuel for 1,350 pounds gross, I get a 1,550
      feet/minute rate of climb at 2370 rpm, 110 mph IAS, at sea-level
      density. That computes to about 82 percent to 84 percent
      efficiency in a climb! That’s better than most fixed-pitch props
      get in cruise! On a recent trip with a friend, the plane had 211
      mph TAS at 8,330 feet density altitude at 2840 rpm, 6.8-7.0 gph!
      Several people I have spoken with who own Lancairs with an O-235
      tell me they get more like 180 to 200 mph.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Efficiency Can Mean Economy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To see what fuel economy I could get by slowing the plane down, I
      got a fuel flow of 2.8-3.3 gph at 130 knots true airspeed (KTAS),
      150 mph on May 17, 2004. That’s 45-54 mpg! As a point of
      comparison, I had a Great American 62-inch-diameter prop that I
      tried. At 8,042 feet density altitude, I got 202 mph TAS at 2950
      rpm, 7.9 gph.<br>
      <br>
      To get a full-throttle efficiency comparison between two
      propellers operated on the same plane at about the same density
      altitude, multiply Prop2 rpm times Prop1 TAS3 and then divide by
      Prop1 rpm times Prop2 TAS3. So 2950 rpm x (211 TAS)3 / 2840 rpm x
      (202 TAS)3 = 1.18—that is, 18 percent more efficient.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Single-Blade Myth</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One of the myths that has been propagated in the aviation
      community, to the point that it’s almost become gospel, is that
      the most efficient prop is a single-blade and that all props with
      higher numbers of blades fall further and further short of this
      paragon. Did you ever consider that a single-blade prop,
      developing thrust on only one side of the plane as it revolves,
      would cause the engine to cone violently in its mounts as it is
      twisted by the prop?<br>
      <br>
      Airbus Military’s latest turboprop transport, the A400M, has
      eight-blade props! The Boeing MD-900 helicopter has a five-blade
      rotor. A popular regional turboprop airliner has a five-blade
      prop. Hasn’t anybody filled these aircraft manufacturers in on the
      errors of their ways? In a past issue of a popular aviation
      magazine, the author of an article on props uttered the same
      fallacy. He maintained that multiple blades interfere with each
      other.<br>
      <br>
      When I pointed out to him that at 200 mph and 2800 rpm the blades
      on my three-blade prop follow three distinct helical paths through
      the air, and each blade is 25 inches ahead of the previous blade
      at the same point of rotation, he rather lamely explained that in
      static conditions interference occurs. Static? Who uses static
      thrust? Airplanes are meant to fly, not pull tree stumps!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Static And Aerodynamic Balance</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Another thing to consider about props is balance. Whenever people
      speak of balancing a prop, they are always referring to mass
      balance. But just as with the case of the single-blade prop, if
      any one blade or a combination of more than one pulls harder than
      the others, there will be a thrust imbalance that will cause the
      engine to cone in its mounts. This effect is exactly the same as
      the effect from a mass imbalance. In a mass imbalance, the mass
      center of the blades is not coincident with the crankshaft
      rotational center; this causes the engine-propeller system to
      rotate about its common mass center, generating a whirling or
      coning on its mounts. With an aerodynamic imbalance, due to
      blade-to-blade differences in chord or angle distribution, the
      thrust center does not coincide with the rotational center. The
      result? Engine whirl! This can also result from the plane of the
      prop hub face not being equidistant from all of the blade angles.
      To illustrate, consider what would happen if you placed a shim
      between the hub and crankshaft flange on the side of a two-blade
      prop hub 90 degrees from a line between the two blades. That would
      cause one blade to be at an overall lower angle and one to be at a
      higher angle.<br>
      <br>
      I had a prop that I balanced over and over, and it still shook the
      plane. When I took a piece of paper and drew an outline around
      each blade and compared them, it immediately became apparent that
      one blade had about 1/4 inch more chord than the other over a
      short span. After correcting this, the prop was very smooth. I
      have found that a prop could actually have a slight imbalance, and
      you would never detect it over a four-cylinder engine’s own
      roughness.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pitch - The “P” Word</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      You’ll notice I never once used the word “pitch” in reference to
      my propeller. In my opinion, that word should be reserved for use
      with screws and worm gears that travel a definite linear distance
      per revolution. In order to discuss a propeller using “pitch,”
      it’s necessary to introduce another word: slippage! Here again, I
      feel that slippage should only be used to describe a condition in
      which a device, such as a v-belt or clutch, is supposed to have a
      1:1 relation between input and output does not. Since a propeller
      is nothing more than a wing in rotation, if pitch and slippage are
      appropriate for a propeller, then they should also be appropriate
      for a wing, which they’re not! Nowhere have I seen these terms
      applied to the main and tail rotors of a helicopter or the rotor
      of an autogyro. Why? Aren’t they also propellers? In a hover, the
      helicopter’s main and tail rotors must have 100 percent slip,
      since they go nowhere. See what I mean?<br>
      <br>
      It is really an inappropriate, nontechnical term for use with
      props and introduces the idea that all propellers of a certain
      diameter and pitch are alike. It’s as if chord and planform have
      no bearing on a propeller’s characteristics; but nothing could be
      further from the truth! Go buy the same diameter and pitch prop
      from three different prop makers and you’ll get three different
      performances. That is the source of much frustration for someone
      shopping for a prop for his plane. To properly characterize a
      prop, the prop maker should tell you the engine horsepower
      required to turn the prop at a given rpm, density altitude, and
      speed, as well as the efficiency under those conditions. I’d like
      to see you get that information from any of them!<br>
      <br>
      I would like to design propellers for various aircraft, but in
      order for me to design a prop for a plane, I have to be able to
      form a drag model of the plane for my equations. The best way to
      do this is to have one of my props installed on a plane and then
      measure the plane’s performance with it. I can form a less
      accurate model by measuring the chord and angle of someone’s prop
      every inch from the spinner to the tip and using those data along
      with the full-throttle performance of the plane with that prop to
      obtain the drag model. This requires the use of a very accurate
      electronic tach and flying the plane around a wide circle while
      measuring GPS-derived groundspeed and holding a constant altitude
      to minimize speed variations. It’s also helpful to have a
      fuel-flow meter in order to determine the actual installed engine
      horsepower, not the exaggerations of some of the engine makers!
      This makes use of the fact that a moderate-compression-ratio
      four-cycle engine (8:1-9:1), leaned for best power, will burn
      about 0.5 pounds/hp-hour. Using this and 5.9 pounds/gallon, you
      can estimate the installed horsepower to within about 5 percent.<br>
      <br>
      By the way, the name ELIPPSE is a faux spelling of the word
      “ellipse,” using my last name, Lipps. I chose it because it refers
      to the elliptical lift distribution of my propeller design. My
      prop’s logo consists of a 3:1 ellipse surrounding the LIPPS name,
      with the Greek letter epsilon in front of my name and behind it in
      reverse. Epsilon looks like a squashed, somewhat triangular “C”
      with a horizontal line in the middle to form a rounded “E.”
      Epsilon in mathematics is used to denote the long/short axis ratio
      of an ellipse—its eccentricity.<br>
      <br>
      There are people writing articles about props who say that the
      elliptical lift distribution does not work for props and mention
      the work of theorists such as Theodorsen, Goldstein, and Betz.
      But, as they used to say, the proof of the pudding is in the
      eating! If someone can design a prop for a particular aircraft and
      predict beforehand its efficiency and its performance to within 1
      percent, well, I’ll tell you, that’s where you want to put your
      money!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Some Final Thoughts</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It’s important for makers of UAVs and UCAVs to understand how
      improved propeller efficiency can add much to the performance of
      their product. A 1 percent efficiency increase will add 1 percent
      to the range or loiter time of the vehicle, and a 3 peecent
      increase will increase the speed 1 percent, plus additional
      efficiency will increase rate-of-climb. For a plane with 80 hp
      weighing 1,000 pounds that requires 20 thrust hp at best L/D, an
      80 percent efficient prop will give 1,452 fpm and an 81 percent
      efficient prop will give 1,478.4 fpm for a 1.8 percent increase!
      And an efficiency increase from 80 percent to 85 percent is not a
      5 percent increase but an 85/80 increase or 6.25 percent!<br>
      <br>
      Testing of the fixed-pitch, three-blade ELIPPSE prop on my Lancair
      shows that it is performing at 82 percent efficiency in a climb at
      105 mph IAS and at least 90 percent efficiency in cruise at 200
      mph TAS. Also, multi-blade, fixed-pitch propellers with correct
      aerodynamic shape where the blades enter the spinner have as good
      a cruise efficiency as a two-blade propeller, but will have better
      static thrust and climb performance. And because a multi-blade
      propeller can be made smaller in diameter than a two-blade and
      still pump as much mass flow, it will be quieter because of the
      reduced tip speed at a given rpm. Tom Aberle’s “Phantom” Reno
      biplane qualified at 221 mph with its 64-inch two-blade prop in
      2003, 241 mph with its 59-inch diameter three-blade propeller in
      2004 at 250 rpm less than in 2003, and 251 mph with its 59-inch
      diameter four-blade propeller in 2007 at the 2003 rpm. Many
      commented on how quiet his propeller was as he flew by on the home
      course, where his noise was mainly from the engine exhaust. This
      in contrast to the T-6-like scream of the other racers!<br>
      <br>
      Paul Lipps spent many years in the aerospace industry, 28 of which
      were with General Electric (GE), where he worked on the Atlas
      Space Launch Vehicle radar/computer guidance system at Vandenberg
      Air Force Base. While with GE, Paul developed high-accuracy
      refraction-correction equations and a tropospheric radar noise
      model for use in the Kalman filter guidance equations. He also
      designed a computer-driven radar simulator, with phase- and
      amplitude-modulated X-band signals that were injected into the
      radar’s antennas to produce a high-fidelity, interactive radar
      simulation of an ATLAS flight. This allowed radar checkout,
      training of radar and computer operators, and simulation of radar
      and computer problems and gave accurate ATLAS flight simulation
      for checkout of the computer guidance program under non-nominal
      trajectory, booster performance, and high tropospheric noise
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Prior to these accomplishments, Paul worked for Bell Telephone of
      Pennsylvania for six years and then spent five years working for
      Burroughs Corp., on the guidance computer for the ATLAS D ICBM at
      Vandenberg Air Force Base.<br>
      <br>
      Since his retirement, Paul has developed equations and the
      computer program for the design of high-efficiency propellers. In
      addition, Paul has worked with Klaus Savier of Light Speed
      Engineering in the design of the Plasma series of electronic
      ignitions and is now working on an electronic fuel injection
      system.<br>
      <br>
      At 17, Paul’s flying passion came to life while he worked at a
      seaplane base in his native Pittsburgh. Although at the time he
      logged 14 hours on floats, his flying had to take a back seat to
      life. He spent some time with a J-3 flying club and in 1989 earned
      his private pilot certificate in a Cessna 172. He has since logged
      more than 780 hours single-engine land, with 577 of that being in
      his (and another’s) Lancair 235. - Pat<br>
