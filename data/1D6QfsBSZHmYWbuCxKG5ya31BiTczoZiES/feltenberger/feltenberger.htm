      After nearly six years of research and development, we are now
      entering the commercialization stage with our Gravity Assisted
      Power (GAP) technology.<br>
      <br>
      The Feltenberger Pendulum, a unique double reciprocating device
      (Patent Pending) uses the force of gravity to help provide the
      power to pump water. We have combined a new power off-take system
      with a rigid arm pendulum, which makes it much easier to pump
      water manually than a conventional lever arm pump, which requires
      a constant push or pull type of action; or a hand crank, with a
      constant turning action. Due to the nature of the pendulum
      swinging back and forth, it is far easier to provide a short
      intermittent push to the pendulum once every arc or every over and
      back cycle to maintain the pumping process, thereby substantially
      reducing operator fatigue. In this manner, we have achieved a
      “gravity assist” in helping us do work.<br>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>Our first commercially available GAP machine, the
          Feltenberger Pendulum Pump, is a general-purpose piston pump,
          the GP210, which provides four different settings for a wide
          range of pumping capability.&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined with the
          Aquathin filtration and reverse osmosis systems, the
          Feltenberger Pendulum pump becomes a complete hand-operated
          water treatment facility capable of producing 1,000 gallons
          per hour of clean drinking water.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The general-purpose pump is specifically designed to pump
          surface water by suctioning and can lift water approximately
          25 feet from the water source to the pump.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
          pump is very durable, easy to maintain and can be set up and
          operating near a river, creek, pond, lake or any flooded area
          within about one hour.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In addition to treating virtually any type of contaminated
          water source, the machine can also be set to bypass all
          filters when it is needed to pump out a cistern or flooded
          area or for irrigation or sanitation needs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the near term, we expect to offer a deep-water piston
          pump, which will be capable of pumping from depths approaching
          400 feet, as well as a desalinating piston pump to produce
          clean drinking water from salt water.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In areas where no electricity or fuels are available, Gravity
          Assisted Power can be the answer.&nbsp; Let gravity help you
          do the work.</p>
      </div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Specifications</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <div class="text-box"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span
            style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
          </span></span>The Feltenberger Pendulum is a unique
        double-reciprocating pendulum.&nbsp; Our videos show this quite
        well.&nbsp; As the pendulum rotates, the axle reciprocates in a
        linear (straight line) manner, causing a pumping action.&nbsp;
        The amount of water being pumped is determined by the distance
        that the axle slides in and out of the pump while it
        rotates.&nbsp; The axle is connected to a piston rod that pushes
        or pulls the piston in the pump.&nbsp; Water is pumped while the
        piston moves in both directions during the in and the out
        strokes.&nbsp; The further the piston moves, the greater the
        amount of water that is pumped.
        <p>The distance the piston moves varies based on the mode of
          operation and the Pressure/Volume (P/V) setting.&nbsp; The
          pendulum can be pushed in a gentle manner, describing a
          relatively low over and back succession of arcs.&nbsp; If
          compared to the face of a clock a good example would be from 4
          o’clock to 8 o’clock and back again.&nbsp; This will produce
          about one half the pumped water that would result from a
          higher arc of 2 o’clock to 10 o’clock.&nbsp; If the pendulum
          is rotated 360 degrees or in a continuous spinning manner, it
          will pump the maximum amount of water for any given P/V
          setting.</p>
        <p>There are four different P/V&nbsp;settings that can be
          selected depending on the desire of the operator.&nbsp;
          Changing from one setting to another is easy and takes only a
          few seconds.&nbsp; First, the pendulum must be
          stationary.&nbsp; Then, on top of the machine, above the
          Gravity Assisted Power label there is a device, which looks
          like a black box.&nbsp; Protruding from this device is a
          selector pin, which can be easily pulled out and removed and
          then inserted into another position.&nbsp; There are four
          positions to choose from and they are numbered one through
          four.</p>
        <p>The effect of moving the selector pin from one&nbsp;P/V
          position&nbsp;to another is similar to shifting gears in a
          car.&nbsp; Position one produces the highest pressure and
          lowest volume of water.&nbsp; Position four produces the
          highest volume of water at the lowest pressure.&nbsp;
          Positions two and three are incremental changes in pressure
          and volume.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
          </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A complete Water Treatment
            Facility<br>
          </span></p>
        The General Purpose Pumping Machine (our first commercial grade
        model) that is currently at work in Haiti is the GP 210
        model.&nbsp; Built into this machine is an Aquashield water
        filtration system that can produce over 1,000 gallons per hour
        of clean drinking water, which meets or exceeds the World Health
        Organization standards for drinking water.&nbsp; Virtually any
        type of contaminated source water can be filtered to these
        standards.&nbsp; The GP 210 is also equipped with an Aquathin
        Reverse Osmosis (R/O) system, which, during continuous operation
        can produce 400 to 500 gallons per day of&nbsp;a very
        high&nbsp;grade of&nbsp;pure water, which is more pure than
        regular drinking water.
        <p>The machine can be set to produce only R/O
          water,&nbsp;regular drinking water or both types of clean
          water simultaneously.&nbsp; If desired, the machine can also
          be set to bypass all filtration and simply pump source water
          for irrigation, sanitation, fire fighting or storage in a
          settling tank.</p>
        <p>Any of the four P/V&nbsp;positions can be used for the
          selector pin while pumping water for any of the conditions
          described above.&nbsp; A pressure gauge is provided on the
          outlet side of the pump and a pressure relief valve is
          provided on the R/O system.&nbsp; These do not need
          adjustment.&nbsp; By turning the R/O handle to the “on”
          position and swinging the pendulum, 60 to 70 psi will
          automatically be achieved.&nbsp; This is the recommended
          pressure for Reverse Osmosis and is pre-set at the
          factory.&nbsp; If the operator selects position one and
          operates the pendulum at a fairly low arc, the R/O system will
          produce very high grade water at full capacity.&nbsp; By
          pushing the pendulum at a higher arc, excess regular
          drinking&nbsp; water will also be automatically
          produced.&nbsp; Positions two, three or four will do the same
          thing, except they will produce more drinking water than
          position one.&nbsp; A small adult or a child can easily
          operate the pendulum in position one or two for an extended
          time, whereas positions three or four are a little more
          difficult to operate continuously and therefore are probably
          not well suited for a child to operate while producing R/O
          water.</p>
        <p>If the operator does not wish to produce R/O grade water, a
          child or small adult can easily operate the machine in any of
          the four P/V positions because filtered drinking water or
          irrigation grade (non-drinking) water do not require as much
          pressure as R/O grade water.</p>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Local manufacturing of new
          green technology helping to solve the global water crisis</span><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Cuyahoga Falls, OH (MMD Newswire) September 14, 2010 - Water,
      water everywhere and not a drop to drink. Nearly 1 billion people
      globally lack access to safe drinking water. Gravitational Energy
      Corporation (GEC) of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio is already tackling this
      water-crisis in the country of Haiti with their invention of a new
      green technology. Stunning in its simplicity, the Feltenberger
      Pendulum, a Gravity Assisted Power (GAP) machine, uses the force
      of gravity to help power various machinery. This versatile GAP
      pendulum can be applied to the generation of electricity, drilling
      of wells, desalinization/filtration of water and so much more.<br>
      <br>
      For its first application, Gravitational Energy Corporation is
      introducing a revolutionary easy-to-use, hand-operated water pump
      and filtration system that needs NO fuel or electricity, making it
      indispensible in the wake of natural disasters and struggling
      third world countries. In May of 2010, the first production model
      was sent to earthquake stricken Haiti. "We donated the pump with
      an Aquathin filtration unit to One-Life Missions Foundation." says
      Art Drentlau, Sr. Vice President. "We were deeply moved by the
      images on TV and knew that our product could help thousands of
      people in need of safe drinking water."<br>
      <br>
      Bob Thompson, president of the One-Life Missions Foundation says,
      "We use the pump for 3 hours a day, and this provides enough
      drinking water for approximately 4,000 people. We hope to further
      leverage the power of this system by partnering withour other NGO
      partners in Haiti to help thousands more."<br>
      <br>
      With a burgeoning world population, the demand for safe drinking
      water is already one of our most critical global environmental
      problems. "Water wise, the world is in a state of crisis. More
      people die and suffer from the lack of access to safe drinking
      water and to basic sanitation, than from war." Source; U.N.-Water
      and The United Nations Secretary-General's Advisory Board on Water
      and Sanitation.<br>
      <br>
      A public demonstration of the GAP Feltenberger Pendulum Pump will
      take place on Wednesday, September 15, 2010 from 1:00pm-5:00pm in
      the Shady Bend Pavilion located at Water Works Park in Cuyahoga
      Falls, Ohio, 2025 Munroe Falls Avenue, Cuyahoga Falls, OH 44221.
      GEC will demonstrate this new GAP technology by allowing onlookers
      to operate the pump and process water through their system
      straight from the Cuyahoga River, once famous for catching on fire
      because of its excessive pollution.<br>
      <br>
      "I worked out the concept for our GAP technology over 40 years ago
      and spent the last six years getting to the production stage. I'm
      excited to see our first application making a difference in the
      daily lives of so many people in Haiti." says Bruce Feltenberger,
      inventor/President/CEO of GEC. "We've also conducted a very
      successful demonstration to the U.S. military of our new
      technology. We expect to create many local jobs to keep up with
      the growing demand for our 'Made in USA' products."<br>
      <br>
      GEC is very pleased to also announce the selection of DriPowder,
      LLC as the exclusive representative of the GAP technology for all
      governmental applications, including the military. DriPowder is a
      Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business owned by Karl
      Monger, a retired US Army Major and former Army Ranger. During a
      recent demonstration of the Feltenberger Pendulum with water
      filtration system for representatives of the US military in Tampa,
      Florida, Monger said "a soldier cannot function long without
      water. One of the greatest logistical challenges is transporting
      large quantities of water as well as disposing of plastic bottles.
      The GAP technology resolves both of those problems, and ensures
      our warriors are drinking safe water - even if the enemy
      contaminates the water supply. Additionally the good-will
      resulting from providing these devices to a host nation is
      invaluable to building and maintaining local support."<br>
      <br>
      The optional water filtration system supplied with the pendulum
      pump is manufactured by Aquathin Corporation; a global leader in
      the water filtration industry for over 30 years. This unique
      filter system known as AquaShield contains a patented
      anti-microbial membrane that kills harmful bacteria and viruses in
      the water without the need of costly chemical dosing systems or UV
      radiation. "We're excited to be a strategic partner with GEC.",
      says Alfred Lipshultz, founder and President of Aquathin
      Corporation. "GEC has developed a breakthrough technology that can
      help millions of people in disaster relief, 3rd world nations and
      militaries for drinking and irrigation in areas without readily
      available electrical supply. The Feltenberger Pendulum Pump is the
      only hand-operated pump I know of that allows our water filtration
      systems to operate fully to the capacity they were designed for."<br>
      <br>
      The pendulum pump has 4 settings that adjust the volume and/or
      pressure of the water being pumped. "We can pump high volumes at
      low pressure, or lower volumes of water at high pressure." says
      Matthew Butrick, Chief Engineer GEC. "This higher pressure setting
      allows our pump to further purify water using a reverse osmosis
      filter system."<br>
      <br>
      The Feltenberger Pendulum Pump equipped with an Aquathin
      filtration system is truly a unique and powerful setup. Its small
      size allows the unit to be quickly transported from site to site,
      and its easy hand-powered operation completely eliminates the need
      for fuel or electricity. The durable, rugged construction makes
      the complete system very inexpensive to maintain.<br>

      Sept. 12--A couple of girls in a Haiti refugee camp bat the handle
      of a swinging pendulum back and forth, the way carefree kids might
      swing a jump rope on a lazy summer day.<br>
      <br>
      It's not obvious how their playful distraction is actually saving
      lives in the wake of the January earthquake that ravaged the
      country.<br>
      <br>
      But the movement of the pendulum is actually powering a pump that
      filters 1,000 gallons of water an hour.<br>
      <br>
      The moment is captured on a video on the Web site of Gravitational
      Energy Corp., a Cuyahoga Falls company that spent six years and
      $1.3 million inventing the technology.<br>
      <br>
      Riding the success of the equipment donated to One Life Missions
      in Haiti, the company is taking orders for the Feltenberger
      Pendulum Pump, named for its inventor and company president, Bruce
      Feltenberger.<br>
      <br>
      On Wednesday, the company will give a public demonstration of the
      hand-operated, gravity-assisted pump from 1 to 5 p.m. in the Shady
      Bend Pavilion at Water Works Park, 2025 Munroe Falls Ave.,
      Cuyahoga Falls.<br>
      <br>
      Feltenberger said he wanted to demonstrate his unit on the
      Cuyahoga River because of its reputation for having been so dirty
      that it once caught fire.<br>
      <br>
      "It's still pretty heavily contaminated," Feltenberger said.<br>
      <br>
      The pump is being marketed for disaster areas and Third World
      countries. Gravitational Energy made its first sale last month,
      when a man from the Netherlands raised money to buy a unit for a
      community in Pakistan.<br>
      <br>
      "Our idea about helping people is: It's a lot quicker to start
      pumping and filtering the water you have access to than it is to
      try to figure out where you can drill a hole" for a water well,
      Vice President Art Drentlau said.<br>
      <br>
      The company also recently demonstrated the pump to the military
      for potential use in combat zones or inhospitable geography.<br>
      <br>
      But turning dirty rivers, lakes and flooded streets into drinkable
      water is only the first application, Feltenberger said.<br>
      <br>
      Gravitational Energy has been experimenting with backpack-size
      pumps for mobile situations, hand-cranked pumps that would power
      electrical generators and room-size pumps that can generate
      commercial-grade electricity and power a desalination plant.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Powered by gravity</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Feltenberger said the seed for his idea was planted in 1965 as he
      watched a huge pendulum swinging at a planetarium in Pittsburgh.<br>
      <br>
      "I thought, 'You know, if that pendulum could be modified just a
      little, I'll bet it could do quite a bit of work,' " he said.<br>
      <br>
      He tinkered with the concept throughout his career as an engineer
      and journeyman machinist, but it wasn't until six years ago that
      he decided to devote his full attention to developing the idea.<br>
      <br>
      The timing was right, he said.<br>
      <br>
      "All of the changes that have occurred over the last many years,
      as far as demand for green energy, a growing desire to be kinder
      to the environment, wanting to reduce the carbon footprint -- put
      them all together and it just made me feel this was more and more
      important," he said.<br>
      <br>
      The project has been financed through private investments and help
      from people like Hans Leitner, who gave Feltenberger space to
      build his prototypes at his J&amp;J Precision Machine shop in
      Cuyahoga Falls.<br>
      <br>
      Units cost about $34,000 and take three to four weeks to make.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Made in the U.S.A.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Feltenberger and Drentlau explained why their pendulum is much
      easier and more efficient than other nonelectric methods for
      generating power.<br>
      <br>
      A typical hand-operated machine might involve a lever that must be
      pushed and pulled constantly, or a hand crank that needs to be
      wound in a circular motion.<br>
      <br>
      The rigid arm pendulum that Feltenberger designed can swing back
      and forth, taking far less human energy to keep it in motion.<br>
      <br>
      The more aggressive the operator, the more water the machine can
      pump, but it still works if someone simply bats it back and forth
      in an arc -- the way the Haitian girls did. The operator also can
      pause from time to time without stopping progress. Drentlau
      demonstrated by pushing the pendulum, then lifting his hand to
      show how momentum kept the arm going.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to cleaning drinking water, the system can be used
      without a filter for irrigation, sanitation, firefighting, or
      removing water from flooded areas or contaminated cisterns.<br>
      <br>
      Feltenberger said the entire unit will be made in the United
      States, including special valves that had to be designed and
      fabricated in Akron.<br>
      <br>
      "Everything here is made in the United States: the tires, the
      axles, the filtration system," Feltenberger said.<br>
      <br>
      "If we make a lot of these, we want to put people back to work
      here."<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A rigid arm
      pendulum is combined with a helical device attached to the
      pendulum horizontal axle to provide a double reciprocating action.
      While the pendulum reciprocates in rotary fashion about the axle,
      describing successive arcs of less than 360 degrees, the axle
      simultaneously produces a reciprocating action about its
      longitudinal centerline. A pumping action is thereby developed in
      line with the longitudinal centerline of the axle. This pumping
      (linear reciprocating) action can be utilized for a variety of
      requirements, including a hydraulic pump and a system to drive an
      electric generator.<br>
      <br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0002] 1. Field of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      [0003] The present invention relates generally to a energy
      generation device and, more particularly, to a device utilizing
      reciprocating rotational motion that can be transmitted to an
      oscillating linear motion that is more suitable to adapting for
      the transmission of energy.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0004] 2. Description of the
        Related Art</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0005] As is well known in the art, pendulums have long been known
      as providing an effective means for utilizing the momentum of a
      falling weight. So efficient is a pendulum at utilizing momentum
      that, once oscillating, it requires very little additional energy
      input to keep the pendulum in motion. This additional energy only
      needs to be equal to the energy losses experienced by the system
      due to various forms of friction.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Additionally and separately, electrical power generation
      systems utilize a wide array of technology that can capture
      rotating motions (from turbines, flywheels and the like) to
      generate electric power. Similarly, pumps can utilize either a
      rotating motion, or a reciprocating motion, to impart energy on a
      working fluid. In both cases, the ability to utilize the
      oscillating motion from a pendulum to drive such work output is
      not easily adapted. The back and forth oscillation of a pendulum
      results in direction changes sufficient to drive a clockwork, but
      the pulsating rotations of the axle are not well suited for
      driving a generator, powering a drill, driving a pump, or the
      like. Further, a search of the prior art did not disclose any
      patents that read directly on the claims of the instant invention.<br>
      [0007] Consequently, a need has been felt for providing an
      improved means of interfacing between conventional electrical or
      mechanical power generation processes and the pulsating movement
      of a pendulum axle, thereby enabling a pendulum to become an
      efficient prime mover requiring only intermittent impulses of
      energy input.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0008] It is therefore an object of the present invention to
      provide an improved power generation device.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It is a feature of the present invention to provide an
      improved power generation device utilizing reciprocating
      rotational motion to impart the working force.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] It is yet another feature of the present invention to
      provide an improved power generation device utilizing an
      oscillating pendulum to generate or transfer the driving force.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Briefly described according to one embodiment of the
      present invention, a rigid arm pendulum is combined with a helical
      axle to provide a double reciprocating action. While the pendulum
      reciprocates in rotary fashion about the horizontal axle,
      describing successively diminishing arcs of less than 360 degrees,
      the pendulum simultaneously causes the axle to reciprocate in a
      linear manner about its longitudinal centerline. Additionally, the
      pendulum can operate in this manner while maintaining arcs, which
      do not diminish, providing intermittent input energy impulses are
      introduced to the system and are equal in magnitude to the losses
      caused by all forms of friction including the workload. A pumping
      action is developed in line with the longitudinal centerline of
      the axle. This pumping (linear reciprocating) action can be
      utilized for a variety of requirements, including but not limited
      to a hydraulic pump, a linear electric generator and a linkage
      system connected to a flywheel, which can drive various forms of
      rotating machinery.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] An advantage of the present invention is that it provides
      an easily adapted means of powering conventional mechanical,
      hydraulic or electrical equipment with reciprocating rotary
      motion.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
        EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0018] The best mode for carrying out the invention is presented
      in terms of its preferred embodiment, herein depicted within the
      Figures.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Detailed Description of the
        Figures</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0019] In order to describe the complete relationship of the
      invention, it is essential that some description be given to the
      manner and practice of functional utility and description of the
      prototype utilizing the present teachings of a power generation
      device 100 utilizing reciprocating rotational motion and
      demonstrated shown by FIG. 1-4. FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 show a side view
      and front view, respectively, of the pendulum in a stationary
      position. Support frames 101, which are rigidly fastened to a base
      102, are attached to a plurality of side supports 103 to provide
      rigidity to the support frame 101. Plates 104 and 105 are secured
      to the top of the support frames 101. Bearing blocks 106 are
      fastened to the plates 104, 105. Ball bearings 107 are positioned
      in the bearing blocks 106 and the bearing blocks 106 are assembled
      to the support frame 101 such that the bearings 106 are parallel
      and in line with each other. An axle 108 is mounted through the
      bearings so that it is capable of rotating freely. A pendulum bar
      109 is rigidly fastened at a proximal end to the axle 108 and a
      weight 110 is fastened to a distal end of the pendulum bar 110,
      thereby comprising a rigid arm pendulum on a rotatable shaft or
      axle. A handle 111 is attached to one end of the axle 108 to
      provide a means for pushing or rotating the pendulum. A ball nut
      112 is fastened to the opposite end of the axle 108 and a ball
      screw 113 is installed into the ball nut such that one end of the
      ball screw can 113 travel freely inward and outward through the
      ball nut while the opposite end of the ball screw is fastened to a
      slidable block 114 portion of a rotation arrestor, as described in
      greater detail below.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In conjunction with FIG. 3, the rotation arrestor assembly
      is comprised of a slidable block 114, a fixed block 115, two rods
      116, which are securely fastened to the fixed block 115 and four
      linear bearings 117, which are securely fastened to the slidable
      block 114. The fixed block 115 is fastened to the plate 105 and
      one end of the slidable block 114 is fastened to a workstation
      such as a reciprocating pump 118. As the ball screw advances and
      retreats, the linear bearings 117 slide along the rods 116.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Operation of the Preferred
        Embodiment</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0021] FIG. 2 shows a front view depicting the pendulum in motion,
      and FIG. 3 shows an enlarged top view of the output end of the
      pendulum axle. In these views, it can readily be seen that as the
      axle 108 rotates, the ball nut 112 rotates, causing the ball screw
      113, which has its opposite end rigidly fastened to the slidable
      rotation arrestor block 114, to screw inward or outward from the
      axle depending on the direction of rotation. As the ball screw
      moves in a linear manner, traveling along its longitudinal
      centerline, it alternatingly pushes and pulls the slidable
      rotation arrestor block 114 causing oscillating linear action in
      accordance with the rotating direction of the pendulum. The
      slidable rotation arrestor block 114 has its opposite end fastened
      to a reciprocating pump 118 and in this manner the pendulum's
      reciprocating rotational movement is converted to a linear
      reciprocating motion, which is used to produce work.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] FIG. 4 shows another embodiment of FIG. 3 where the ball
      nut 112 is rigidly fastened to the slidable rotation arrestor
      block 114. In this embodiment, one end of the ball screw 113 is
      rigidly fastened to the axle 108. The ball screw rotates with the
      axle causing the ball nut and the slidable rotation arrestor block
      114 to be pulled or pushed in a linear oscillating manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In operation, the principles of the present invention
      succeeded in demonstrating that a rigid arm pendulum works like a
      lever arm set into motion. A large mechanical advantage exists
      near the axle longitudinal centerline. The ball screw and ball nut
      arrangement further demonstrated a mechanical advantage found in
      the inclined plane, which is essentially a circular wedge.
      Combining these two principles produced a potential force along
      the axial longitudinal centerline of several thousand pounds, even
      when using a weight at the end of the pendulum arm of only 72 Lbs.
      A further result of testing revealed that when a linear workload
      was introduced (such as a reciprocating pump) to the ball screw
      via the rotation arrestor, the increased friction caused by the
      workload was transmitted through the ball screw to the pendulum in
      a more efficient manner than when the same workload was introduced
      in a rotary manner such as using a pulley on the axle. This was
      confirmed by measuring the decrease in the size of the arc as the
      pendulum rotated due to linear loading versus radial loading.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] It was further demonstrated that a given rotational arc of
      the pendulum could be maintained with a small manual impulse input
      once at the end of each over and back cycle of the pendulum. This
      input was sufficient to overcome all forms of friction and thereby
      maintain operation of the pendulum while producing useful output
      work. Such a device can be used for a variety of pumping
      applications, especially in situations where a higher force or
      pressure is required than what is otherwise available from a hand
      operated pumping system. Additionally, the output reciprocating
      system could also supply power to a hydraulic pump/motor system
      attached to an electric generator. In this manner, a hand operated
      rotary reciprocating mechanical system could produce a significant
      amount of electric power.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Additionally, because of the reciprocating nature of a
      pendulum, it is easier to provide intermittent impulse pushes
      manually than to continuously turn a hand wheel or push and pull
      on a lever arm. In this manner, one or two people operating the
      machine do not become fatigued as quickly and yet they produce
      significant continuous output work.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] This described portion above represents the functional
      basis for the present invention, and allows the conversion of the
      reciprocating rotational motion of the pendulum assembly (or,
      alternately, an asymmetrical or unbalanced rotating cam or
      flywheel) into a simple reciprocating linear motion. Additionally,
      the momentum and power associated with the pendulum are
      concentrated and converted into a small reciprocating motion of
      much greater force concentration. The foregoing descriptions of
      specific embodiments of the present invention have been presented
      for purposes of illustration and description. They are not
      intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise
      forms disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations
      are possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiments were
      chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of
      the invention and its practical application, to thereby enable
      others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and
      various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to
      the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of
      the invention be defined by the Claims appended hereto and their
      equivalents. Therefore, the scope of the invention is to be
      limited only by the following claims.<br>
