      Instead of plugging in your iPod or cell phone to recharge at
      night – or even worse, adding one of those clunky, oversized third
      party batteries that add weight and change the form factor in an
      effort to give you a couple more hours of use – why not add the
      Monothermal to the equation and allow the waste heat created by
      elements of the device to be recaptured and channeled back into
      creating more energy, which can then be utilized by that device?
      What if the simple act of carrying a cell phone or iPod in your
      pocket caused its battery to charge, since even body heat will
      have a positive effect on the function of the Monothermal?<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, a review of the patent reveals a very simple device. "An
      inner and outer laminate contain a combination of two binder
      agents," says Guenther. "That's really all there is to it. It's a
      simple invention from top to bottom – the constituent elements,
      the process of combining them, and the flexibility that's achieved
      in applying them to nearly any form factor."<br>
      <br>
      "The Monothermal doesn't utilize a redox reaction (batteries) to
      create energy, and it's not dependent on the restrictions inherent
      in the thermoelectric effect." Todd Guenther, one of the
      principals behind the current effort to market and proselytize the
      invention, is effusive in his excitement for the potential of the
      Monothermal. "It's an incredibly simple construct. When you take a
      look at the other methods that have been developed to harness
      waste heat and convert that heat to energy, most of them are very,
      shall we say, eccentric in their methodology. Some might even call
      them 'Rube Goldberg-esque'," he says, referring to the American
      cartoonist and inventor who specialized in illustrating
      over-engineered contraptions that ended up performing very simple
      tasks in an overly complex fashion. "The simplicity in design and
      implementation of the Monothermal is the hallmark of nearly every
      invention and technological improvement developed by its inventor,
      Walter Lovell."<br>

      The Monothermal laminate creates electrical energy from ambient
      heat. Since everything emits some heat and there is really no such
      thing as "cold", the Monothermal . . . creates energy simply while
      existing in its environment.<br>
      <br>
      "The Monothermal doesn't utilize a redox reaction (batteries) to
      create energy, and it's not dependent on the restrictions inherent
      in the thermoelectric effect." Todd Guenther, one of the
      principals behind the current effort to market and proselytize the
      invention says "It's an incredibly simple construct. When you take
      a look at the other methods that have been developed to harness
      waste heat and convert that heat to energy, most of them are
      eccentric in their methodology."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The inventor says an early prototype produced in 1995 worked
      uninterrupted for more than a decade, powering LCD clocks and a
      tabletop fan in a room-temperature environment.<br>
      <br>
      A review of the patent reveals a very simple device. "An inner and
      outer laminate contain a combination of two binder agents," says
      Guenther. "That's really all there is to it. It's a simple
      invention from top to bottom - the constituent elements, the
      process of combining them, and the flexibility that's achieved in
      applying them to nearly any form factor".<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The inventor imagines Monothermal being used for everything from
      computer cases, television sets, and iPods, to refrigerators,
      automobile engine compartments, and rooftop applications. "Even
      submersion in thermal wells to provide energy to industry, or
      installing the Monothermal in place of - or in concert with -
      solar panels," said Guenther. "There's no end to the potential of
      finally capturing and utilizing the waste heat generated by so
      many of our current devices, appliances, and machines. It's nearly
      all wasted energy. We need to recapture it and put it to use, now
      more than ever."<br>

      ...Certainly, one of Walter’s most important inventions was his
      discovery of the “Monothermal” junction, which simply produced
      electricity when warm. Unlike all other thermodynamic systems that
      require some heat to move from a warm side to a cool side, like in
      the “Seebeck Effect,” the Lovell Monothermal device does NOT need
      a “cool side” to operate. All you have to do is warm it up, and
      electricity comes out! The prototype shown here operated a
      table-top fan continuously for over 10 years in a constant “room
      temperature” environment.<br>
      <br>
      The Lovell Monothermal device is the ultimate, solid-state,
      ambient energy converter. A block of these units, filling a volume
      of less than 4 cubic feet, and sitting at 80°F (27°C), could power
      your home without maintenance for 20 years. These devices are much
      easier to manufacture than “solar cells” and will be less
      expensive, when mass-produced. They also have the added advantage
      of producing electricity both day and night!...<br>

        <b> </b><b>DEVICE AND METHOD FOR GENERATING ELECTRICAL ENERGY</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      A device for generating electrical current in the presence of
      ambient heat includes an intermediate layer (1) having a
      predetermined electronegativity value interposed between a first
      outer layer (2) and a second outer layer (3), in which the first
      outer layer (2) has an electronegative value less than the
      intermediate layer (1), and the second outer layer (3) has an
      electronegative value less than the first outer layer (2). The
      intermediate layer (1) includes a first binder combination and a
      second binder combination. The first binder combination contains a
      polymeric binder and a first electronegative material. The second
      binder combination contains a polymeric binder and a second
      electronegative material. The first and second binder combinations
      have a predetermined electronegative value that is greater than
      said first and second outer layers. A method of making and a
      method of activating the device for the generation of electricity
      are also disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;The present invention relates to devices that generate
      electrical current and, in particular, to a composite structure
      and method of making and utilizing the composite structure to
      convert ambient heat to electrical current.<br>
      <br>
      Over the years, many attempts have been made to harness energy
      from our environment in order to generate electricity. As a
      result, numerous electrochemical and thermoelectrical devices have
      been developed to convert solar energy to electricity. For
      example, attempts to convert solar energy to electricity have
      spawned some major technologies such as photovoltaic conversion
      devices. The heat content of solar radiation emitting
      electromagnetic radiation and particles is used to provide heat
      for generating electricity.<br>
      <br>
      One attempt to achieve the conversion of solar energy to
      electricity is found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,421,909 issued to Ishikawa
      et al. which is directed to a photovoltaic device having a
      semiconductor layer, front and back electrodes, and a surface
      protection layer. The photovoltaic device of Ishikawa et al.
      converts electromagnetic radiation directly into electricity.
      Photovoltaic devices, however, require the use of semiconducting
      materials to absorb electromagnetic radiation. Semiconductor
      materials require a degree of care and technical expertise to
      produce and can be expensive.<br>
      <br>
      Another method of generating electricity is through the use of an
      electrochemical system, such as the electrode process which is the
      principle process in electrochemical batteries. Important aspects
      of the electrode process include oxidation and reduction occurring
      as a result of electron transfer in coupled chemical reactions.
      Coupled reactions are initiated by production or depletion of the
      primary products which are reactants at the electrode surface. The
      chemical reaction utilized to produce electrical energy requires
      supplying electrons to an electrode forming a negative terminal
      and removing the electrons from the positive terminal. In a lead
      storage battery, for example, electrons are supplied to a negative
      terminal by the oxidation of metallic lead. At the positive
      terminal, lead is reduced. The electrons flowing in an external
      circuit from the negative to the positive terminal constitute the
      desired electric current. However, electrochemical systems utilize
      a redox reaction which ultimately deteriorates the source of
      chemical components in the systems.<br>
      <br>
      Examples of efforts to generate electricity through the use of an
      electrochemical system such as electrode processes in batteries
      have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,837,920, 4,188,464,
      4,892,797, 5,279,910, and 5,419,977. More specifically, U.S. Pat.
      No. 3,837,920 to Liang et al. is directed to a battery containing
      a solid electrolyte, an alkali metal anode, and a heavy metal
      cathode. The battery of the Liang et al. '920 references utilizes
      a redox reaction.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,188,464 to Adams et al. is directed to a composite
      electrode in bipolar electrolytic cells. The electrode includes an
      intermediate graphite layer interposed between two polymeric
      layers. Each side of the polymeric layers is in contact with an
      anode layer and a cathode layer. The electrode, however, functions
      as a battery and involves electrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,892,797 to Ran et al. involves a bipolar electrode
      for electrochemical cells and process for manufacturing the same.
      The bipolar electrode contains an electrically conductive
      intermediate layer interposed between an electronegative layer and
      an electropositive layer. The intermediate layer is a plastic
      substrate which includes electrically conductive particles. The
      electronegative layer can be silver coated nickel particles or
      aluminum. The electropositive layer can be a metal such as silver,
      copper, nickel, and lead. The bipolar electrode of the Ran et al.
      '797 reference, however, functions in electrochemical cells
      requiring a redox reaction. U.S. Pat. No. 5,279,910 to Cysteic et
      al. is directed to an improved battery for reversible operation at
      ambient temperature. The battery includes a negative electrode, a
      composite positive electrode, an electrochemically active
      material, an electrolyte, and optionally an electron conductive
      material. The Cysteic et al. '977 battery requires a redox
      reaction.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,419,977 to Weiss et al. is directed to an
      electrochemical device for production of electrical energy. The
      electrochemical device involves operatively combined capacitors
      which can increase capacitance density and energy storage
      capability. The electrochemical device of the Weiss et al. '977
      reference requires a redox reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Another method for direct conversion of heat into electrical
      energy is via thermoelectrical devices based on the Seebeck
      effect, Peltier effect, and Thomson effect. The Seebeck effect
      concerns electromotive force (EMF) generated in a circuit composed
      of two different conductors whose junctions are maintained at two
      different temperatures (e.g., hot and cold junctions).<br>
      <br>
      Peltier effect generates temperature differences from electrical
      energy. Peltier effect refers to the reversible heat generated at
      the junction between two different conductors when current passes
      through the junction. One of the conductors is connected to a cold
      junction and the other conductor is connected to a hot junction.<br>
      <br>
      Thomson effect involves the reversible generation of heat in a
      single current-carrying conductor along which a temperature
      gradient is maintained. Thomson heat is proportional to the
      product of the current and the temperature gradient. Thomson heat
      is referred to as reversible in the sense that the conductor
      changes from a generator of Thomson heat to an absorber of Thomson
      heat when the direction of either the current of the temperature
      gradient is reversed.<br>
      <br>
      Some examples of thermoelectrical devices are thermocouples (e.g.,
      P-type thermoelectric conversion materials) and thermoelectric
      materials consisting of an oxide with perovskite structure.
      Thermoelectrical devices, however, are known to have disadvantages
      of relatively low efficiencies and high cost per unit of output.
      Examples of efforts to generate electricity via thermoelectrical
      devices are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,969,956 and 5,057,161.
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,969,956 to Kreider et al. is directed to a
      transparent thin film thermocouple of Kreider et al. includes a
      positive element of indium tin oxide and a negative element of
      indium oxide formed on a surface by reactive sputtering with the
      elements being electrically joined to form a hot junction for
      conversion of heat into electricity. The reactive sputtering is
      accomplished with a magnetron source in an argon and oxygen
      atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,057,161 to Komabayashi et al. is directed to a
      p-type iron silicide thermoelectric conversion material. The
      thermoelectric conversion material patent involves Seebeck effect
      which requires two different temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the technologies set forth above require conditions which,
      to a certain extent, constrain their use for a simple
      current-producing device which operates as a mere function of
      ambient temperature. It is therefore an object of the present
      invention to provide a composite structure and a method for
      generating electrical current which overcomes the disadvantages
      generally associated with the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention is a device for generating electrical
      current in the presence of ambient heat. The preferred structure
      of the device is a multilayer laminate, and the invention also
      includes methods of making and activating the device.<br>
      <br>
      The laminate in accordance with the present invention includes an
      intermediate layer having a predetermined electronegativity value
      interposed between a first outer layer and a second outer layer,
      in which the first outer layer has an electronegative value less
      than the intermediate layer, and the second outer layer has an
      electronegative value less than the first outer layer. Preferably,
      the intermediate layer is formed from a first and second binder
      combinations having an electronegative value from about 2.0 to
      about 4.0. Preferably, the first outer layer has an
      electronegative value from about 1.7 to about 1.9. Preferably, the
      second outer layer has an electronegative value from about 0.7 to
      about 1.6.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, the intermediate layer preferably is formed
      from a first binder combination and a second binder combination.
      The first binder combination contains a polymeric binder and a
      first electronegative material. The second binder combination
      contains a polymeric binder and a second electronegative material.
      Preferably, the first and second binder combinations of the
      intermediate layer have a predetermined electronegative value that
      is greater than either the first or the second outer layer. The
      choice of the first and second electronegative materials result in
      a layer having an average electronegativity value greater than the
      first and second outer layers.<br>
      <br>
      The polymeric binder is preferably polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl
      chloride, or polyvinylidene fluoride. More preferably, the
      polymeric binder is polyvinyl acetate.<br>
      <br>
      The first electronegative material of the intermediate layer is
      preferable As, B, Po, H, P, Te, At, Ir, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Ag,
      Au, Se, C, I, S, Br, Cl, N, O, F, or a mixture thereof. More
      preferably, the first electronegative material is phosphorous (P),
      and most preferably in the form of phosphorous red.<br>
      <br>
      The second electronegative material of the intermediate layer is
      preferable Cr, As, B, Po, H, P, Te, At, Ir, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru,
      Ag, Au, Se, C, I, S, Br, Cl, N, O, F, or a mixture thereof. More
      preferably, the second electronegative material is chromium (Cr),
      and most preferably in the form of an oxide, e.g., Cr2 O3.<br>
      <br>
      The first outer layer is preferably Cd, In, W, Co, Fe, Ge, Mo, Ni,
      Pb, Si, Sn, Ti, Bi, Cu, Hg, Re, Sb, or a mixture thereof. More
      preferably, the first outer layer is Cu.<br>
      <br>
      The second outer layer is preferable Cs, Fr, K, Ru, Ba, Na, Ra,
      Ca, Li, Sr, Ac, La, Mg, Y, Hf, Sc, Zr, Al, Be, Mn, Ta, Tc, Ti, Cr,
      Ga, Nb, V, Zn, or a mixture thereof. More preferably, the second
      outer layer is aluminum or aluminum magnesium.<br>
      <br>
      The difference in the electronegativity between the intermediate
      layer and the first outer layer is from about 0.1 to about 3.3,
      preferably, from about 0.9 to about 1.16, and more preferably,
      1.16.<br>
      <br>
      The difference in the electronegativity between the first outer
      layer and the second outer layer is from about 0.1 to about 1.2,
      preferably, from about 0.3 to about 0.7, and more preferably, 0.7.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of the present invention, a device, a method of making
      the device, and a method for generating electrical current in the
      presence of only ambient heat can be made. The device of the
      present invention can be simply and efficiently manufactured. The
      present invention does not require redox reaction of conventional
      batteries which result in deterioration of the source chemical
      components and corrosion of metal components.<br>
      <br>
      For a better understanding of the present invention, together with

      which is set forth in the appended claims.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention is a device for generating electrical
      current in the presence of ambient heat. The device is preferably
      a multilayer structure which includes the use of an intermediate
      layer interposed between a first outer layer and a second outer
      layer. The present invention also includes methods of making and
      utilizing the device for generating electrical current in the
      presence of ambient heat.<br>
      <br>
      The laminate in accordance with the present invention includes an
      intermediate layer having a predetermined electronegativity value
      interposed between a first outer layer and a second outer layer.
      The first outer layer has an electronegative value less than the
      intermediate layer, and in turn the second outer layer has an
      electronegative value less than the first outer layer.<br>
      <br>
      Electronegativity is a relative measure of the ability of an atom
      in a molecule to attract electrons to itself. A scale of
      electronegativity values has been established by assigning a value
      to one element and then comparing other values of
      electronegativity to the assigned value.<br>
      <br>
      The most widely used scale of electronegativity values was
      developed by Linus Pauling. (Leo J. Malone, Basic Concepts of
      Chemistry, 156-160 (2d ed. 1985). According to Linus Pauling,
      electronegativity is a periodic property that increases as one
      moves to the top and right of the Periodic Table. See FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      On Pauling's scale, a value of 4.0 has been assigned to the
      highest electronegative element, i.e., fluorine. Other
      electronegativity values are then established relative to the
      value assigned to fluorine. See FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate that the values of electronegativity of
      the representative elements tend to increase from left to right
      and from bottom to top of the Periodic Table. More specifically,
      electronegativity values tend to be low for the metallic elements
      in the lower left portion of the Periodic Table and are high for
      the nonmetals in the upper right portion of the Periodic Table. An
      exception to this trend is found in noble gases, which have
      electronegativity values approaching zero. Elements with low
      values of electronegativity have little attraction for electrons.
      They give up electrons easily.<br>
      <br>
      The laminate in accordance with the present invention includes an
      intermediate layer having a predetermined electronegativity value
      interposed between a first outer layer and a second outer layer,
      in which the first outer layer has an electronegative value less
      than the intermediate layer, and the second outer layer has an
      electronegative value less than the first outer layer. Preferably,
      the intermediate layer comprises a first and second combinations
      having an electronegative value from about 2.0 to about 4.0.
      Preferably, the first outer layer has an electronegative value
      from about 1.7 to about 1.9. Preferably, the second outer layer
      has an electronegative value from about 0.7 to about 1.6.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the
      intermediate layer is formed from a first binder combination and a
      second binder combination. The first binder combination includes a
      polymeric binder and a first electronegative material. The second
      binder combination includes a polymeric binder and a second
      electronegative material. The first and second binder of the
      intermediate layer combinations have a predetermined
      electronegative value that is greater than either the first or the
      second outer layer. The choice of the first and second
      electronegative materials result in an layer having an average
      electronegativity value greater than the first and second outer
      layers.<br>
      <br>
      The polymeric binder is preferably polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl
      chloride, or polyvinylidene fluoride. More preferably, the
      polymeric binder is polyvinyl acetate.<br>
      <br>
      The first electronegative material of the intermediate layer is
      preferably As, B, Po, H, P, Te, At, Ir, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Ag,
      Au, Se, C, I, S, Br, Cl, N, O, F, or a mixture thereof. More
      preferably, the first electronegative material is phosphorous (P),
      and most preferably in the form of phosphorous red.<br>
      <br>
      The second electronegative material of the intermediate layer is
      preferably Cr, As, B, Po, H, P, Te, At, Ir, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru,
      Ag, Au, Se, C, I, S, Br, Cl, N, O, F, or a mixture thereof. More
      preferably, the second electronegative material is chromium (Cr),
      and most preferably in the form of an oxide, e.g., Cr2 O3.<br>
      <br>
      In the present invention, the first and second electronegative
      materials are also heat sensitive materials. A heat sensitive
      material is a material which responds to a temperature above 32
      DEG F. by inducing electrons in a molecule to move. Preferably,
      the heat sensitive material responds to a temperature of 32 DEG F.
      to 350 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      The ratio of the polymeric binder to the first electronegative
      material of the first binder combination is from about 4:1 to 1:1,
      and preferably about 2:1.<br>
      <br>
      The ratio of the polymeric binder to the second electronegative
      material of the second binder combination is from about 4:1 to
      1:1, and preferably about 2:1.<br>
      <br>
      The first outer layer is preferably Cd, In, W, Co, Fe, Ge, Mo, Ni,
      Pb, Si, Sn, Ti, Bi, Cu, Hg, Re, Sb, or a mixture thereof. More
      preferably, the first outer layer is Cu.<br>
      <br>
      The second outer layer is preferably Cs, Fr, K, Ru, Ba, Na, Ra,
      Ca, Li, Sr, Ac, La, Mg, Y, Hf, Sc, Zr, Al, Be, Mn, Ta, Tc, Ti, Cr,
      Ga, Nb, V, Zn, or a mixture thereof. More preferably, the second
      outer layer is aluminum or aluminum magnesium.<br>
      <br>
      In the present invention, the greater the differential value of
      the electronegativity of the intermediate, first outer, and second
      outer layers in the laminate, the greater the electrical current
      output.<br>
      <br>
      The difference in the electronegativity between the intermediate
      layer and the first outer layer is from about 0.1 to about 3.3,
      preferably, from about 0.9 to about 1.16, and more preferably,
      1.16.<br>
      <br>
      The difference in the electronegativity between the first outer
      layer and the second outer layer is from about 0.4 to about 1.2,
      preferably, from about 0.3 to about 0.7, and more preferably, 0.7.<br>
      <br>
      The laminate according to the present invention consists of a
      three-layer structure wherein the intermediate layer is laminated
      between the first outer layer and the second outer layer.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the structure is prepared by (a) applying a first
      binder combination which contains a first electronegative material
      having a predetermined electronegativity value to a first outer
      layer, (b) applying a second binder combination which contains a
      second electronegative material having a predetermined
      electronegativity value to a second outer layer, and (c)
      compressing the first and second outer layers to form an
      intermediate layer from the first and second binder combinations.
      The first outer layer has an electronegativity value less than the
      first electronegative material of said first binder combination.
      The second outer layer has an electronegativity value less than
      the second electronegative material of the second binder
      combination. The second outer layer also has an electronegativity
      value less than the first electronegative material of the first
      outer layer. The intermediate layer has an electronegativity value
      greater than the first and second outer layers.<br>
      <br>
      The method of the present invention also includes a method for
      generating electrical current by exposing a laminate set forth
      above to heat, e.g., a temperature of at least about 32 DEG F. to
      250 DEG F. Unexpectedly, ambient heat is generally sufficient to
      generate electrical current.<br>
      <br>
      In the presence of heat, the electrons in the laminate of the
      present invention flow in a circuit from high electronegativity to
      low electronegativity. It is believed this flow creates a void in
      the charge balance and therefore attracts the electrons to
      continuously flow in response to the ambient temperature. The flow
      of electrons increases in proportion with the increase of heat.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 illustrates the three layers of the laminate of the present
      invention and the flow of electrons in the laminate of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      In the three layer embodiment depicted in FIG. 3, the laminate of
      the present invention is prepared by (a) applying a first binder
      combination of the intermediate layer 1 to the first outer layer
      2, (b) applying a second binder combination of the intermediate
      layer 4 to the second outer layer 3, and (c) pressing the first
      and second outer layers 2 and 3 together to form the intermediate
      layer.<br>
      <br>
      Examples have been set forth below for the purpose of illustration
      and to describe the best mode of the invention at the present
      time. The scope of the invention is not to be in any way limited
      by the Examples set forth herein.<br>
      <br>

      The following examples are presented to demonstrate the efficacy
      of the present invention by comparing the invention to a control
      sample in which the electronegativity values of the layers in the
      laminate are the same.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><br>
      Control Sample<br>
      <br>
      A three-layer laminate was prepared. A first outer layer of a 1.5
      square inch copper foil was coated with polyvinyl
      acetate/phosphorus red in a 2:1 ratio. Another outer layer of a
      1.5 square inch copper foil was coated with chromic

      aluminum foil to form an intermediate layer.<br>
      <br>
      The difference in the electronegativity between the intermediate

      intermediate layer and the copper layer was 0.52.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting three-layer laminate was placed under room
      temperature (70 DEG F.), 100 DEG F., and 212 DEG F. Voltage and
      amperage of the laminate were measured and the results are
      illustrated in Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Laminate of the Present Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      A three-layer laminate was prepared. A first outer layer of a 1.5
      square inch copper foil was coated with polyvinyl
      acetate/phosphorus red in a 2:1 ratio. Another outer layer of a
      1.5 square inch aluminum magnesium was coated with chromic
      oxide/polyvinyl acetate in a 1:2 ratio. The coated side of the
      copper foil was pressed together against the coated side of the
      aluminum magnesium foil to form an intermediate layer.<br>
      <br>

      the electronegativity of the copper outer layer and the aluminum
      magnesium layer was 0.55. The difference in the electronegativity
      between the intermediate layer and the copper layer was 0.52.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting three-layer laminate was placed under room

      The amount of electrical current of Examples 1, 2, and 3 were
      determined by measuring the voltage and the amperage of the
      electrical current.<br>
      <br>
      From Table 1 it is readily apparent that the amount of electrical
      current produced was proportional to the difference in the
      electronegativity values between the layers of the laminate of
      Examples 1, 2, and 3. Control Example 1 demonstrated that when
      there was no difference in the electronegativity values between
      the outer layers, no electrical current was produced. In Example
      2, where there was a difference in the electronegativity values of
      the three layers, an electrical current was produced. In Example
      3, where there was a greater difference in the electronegativity
      values of the three layers, in comparison to Example 2, a greater
      electrical current was produced. Thus, the above examples
      illustrate that the greater the difference in the
      electronegativity values between the layers, a greater electrical
      current can be produced. Moreover, as will be apparent to one
      skilled in the art, increased temperatures of ambient heat
      resulted in an increased production of electrical current.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, while there have been described what are presently believed
      to be the preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will
      appreciate that other and further changes and modifications can be
      made without departing from the true spirit of the invention, and
      it is intended to include all such changes and modifications
      within the scope of the claims which are appended hereto.<br>
