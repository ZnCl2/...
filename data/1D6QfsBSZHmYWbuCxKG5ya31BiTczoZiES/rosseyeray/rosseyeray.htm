            Patent Application for Human Eyebeam Detection System Now
            Available on U.S. Patent Office Web Page</font></b></center>
      <p><b>DALLAS, TX -</b> Noted psychiatrist and author Colin A.
        Ross, M.D., today announced his patent application for a system
        to detect the electromagnetic energy emitted by the human eye.
        Dr. Ross has been researching a new science and medicine focused
        on the human body's electromagnetic field, which will be
        detailed in an upcoming book, "Human Energy Fields." </p>
      <p>In his research, Dr. Ross has discovered proof that the eye
        emits electromagnetic energy that he calls an "eyebeam." He
        calls his invention an Electromagnetic Beam Detection System for
        which he has filed an application with the U.S. Patent and
        Trademark Office. </p>
      <p>"The experimental proof of the reality of the human eyebeam is
        crucial in developing the science of human energy fields," said
        Dr. Ross. "The existence of the human eyebeam has been dismissed
        by psychologists, physiologists, physicists and virtually all
        modern scientists. This represents a big step forward." </p>
      <p>Dr. Ross' patent application for the EBDS can be viewed

        Search Enter: 20090046246 </p>
      <p>Dr. Ross has also filed an international Patent Cooperation
        Treaty application. This is a step toward getting a patent in
        countries outside the United States. </p>
      <p>In a written opinion, the International Searching Authority
        concluded that all aspects of Dr. Ross' invention are novel, are
        inventive steps and have industrial applications: "The
        industrial applicability of claims 1-25 is self-evident in the
        sense of PCT Article 33(4) because the subject matter claimed
        can be made or used in industry." </p>
      <p>According to Dr. Ross' application, the electromagnetic beam
        detection system can be used as a switch and can turn on or off
        any electrical device. It functions like a clapper light, but
        uses the electromagnetic energy emitted through the eyes instead
        of the sound of a hand clapping. </p>
      <p>Dr. Ross has sent the link for the U.S. Patent Office
        application to James Randi <b>(<a href="http://www.randi.org">www.randi.org</a>)</b>
        and is waiting to hear from him about the status of his $1
        Million Paranormal Challenge, in which he claims that he can
        make a tone sound out of a computer using a beam of energy he
        sends out through his eyes. Dr. Ross' proposed Challenge

      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>The present invention provides for a Line
        of Sight (LOS) electromagnetic beam (EM) detection system
        configured with an enclosure, a detection device, a processing
        device, a storage device, and a communication device. The
        enclosure may or may not be electromagnetically shielded from
        the surrounding environment. The enclosure may contain one or
        more detection devices and one or more portals configured for a
        user to look through. The detection devices may be a
        non-contacting, active-dry electroencephalogram (EEG) electrode
        or a high input impedance EEG electrode. The processing device
        may be a specifically programmed general purpose computer. The
        communication device may be auditory and/or visual. The storage
        device may store signals from the detection device for later
        analysis and statistical manipulation. In some embodiments, the
        LOS detection system may be used as a switch responding to
        interaction with a LOS beam emanating from an ocular cavity. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>[0001]1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] The present invention relates to an electromagnetic
        detection system for the non-contacting detection of
        electromagnetic fields emanating from a living organism and,
        more particularly, to the detection of electromagnetic fields
        emanating from an ocular cavity. </p>
      <p><b>[0003]2. Description of the Related Art</b> </p>
      <p>[0004] All biological systems generate electromagnetic fields
        (EMF) and these fields interact with and are affected by the
        magnetic field surrounding the earth as well as other sources of
        EMF such as solar flares. The human body in particular generates
        a relatively complex electromagnetic field. Measuring, sensing,
        and detecting the electromagnetic field may provide important
        information for understanding the inner workings and the
        treatment of the human body. There currently exist known methods
        of measuring the electromagnetic field of a body. The
        electromagnetic field generated by the brain, for example, can
        be measured with a highly sensitive instrument such as a
        Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)
        magnetometer. However, since the magnetic field generated by the
        brain is on the order of roughly one billion times weaker than
        the main magnetic field of the earth, most SQUID magnetometers
        are typically housed in magnetically insulated rooms in order to
        eliminate the background noise that would otherwise overwhelm
        the signal from the brain. Such full-size rooms can cost
        approximately $250,000 to construct and a SQUID magnetometer
        capable of taking a full brain map costs about $2 million. </p>
      <p>[0005] A less costly way to measure the electrical field
        generated by the brain is through the use of a contacting
        electroencephalogram (EEG) system. A simple EEG software program
        and the necessary leads and electrodes can be purchased for
        about $1,200 and run on a laptop computer. A system such as this
        is commonly used during biofeedback treatment by psychologists.
        Biofeedback is the process of monitoring a physiological signal,
        and amplifying, conditioning, and displaying the signal to the
        monitored subject so that he or she can observe small changes in
        the signal. Gradually, through trial and error, the monitored
        subject may learn to affect certain biological or physiological
        processes by associating certain actions with the subsequent
        changes in the monitored signal. </p>
      <p>[0006] Additionally, in some situations the measurement of
        electric fields produced by the body may be useful in
        identifying certain medical conditions or in the development of
        medical treatments. For example, a typical application involves
        the measurement of the electrical field of the heart through the
        use of a contacting electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). The printout
        of the measurement may be used in making a number of different
        diagnoses, including the likelihood of a heart attack, and the
        identification of abnormal electrical conduction within the
        heart, among others. Another application involves the
        measurement of an electromagnetic beam emanating from the ocular
        region of a human head. This electromagnetic beam is essentially
        a line of sight (LOS) beam able to focus an electromagnetic
        field on whatever the person is looking at. However, traditional
        methods of attaching an electrode to contact the surface of the
        skin in order to measure the electromagnetic field are difficult
        due to the sensitive nature of the eyes. Therefore, there exists
        a need for a low cost, non-contacting measurement device
        configured to detect and respond to the LOS beam. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0007] The present invention provides a system for detecting an
        electromagnetic beam. The system may comprise an enclosure
        configured to facilitate visual access for an eye and containing
        a detecting device comprising at least one electrode. The system
        may further comprise a processing device configured to receive
        an output from the detecting device. Additionally, the system
        may comprise a communication device configured to provide
        feedback communication corresponding to the output from the
        detecting device. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0015] In the following discussion, numerous specific details
        are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present
        invention. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate
        that the present invention may be practiced without such
        specific details. In other instances, well-known elements have
        been illustrated in schematic or block diagram form in order not
        to obscure the present invention in unnecessary detail.
        Additionally, for the most part, details concerning network
        communications, electromagnetic signaling techniques, and the
        like, have been omitted inasmuch as such details are not
        considered necessary to obtain a complete understanding of the
        present invention, and are considered to be within the
        understanding of persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art.
      </p>
      <p>[0016] Turning now to FIG. 1, the reference numeral 100
        generally indicates an illustrative example of an embodiment of
        an electromagnetic line of sight (LOS) beam detection system 100
        configured according to at least some aspects of the current
        invention. The LOS beam detection system 100 may comprise an
        enclosure 1, detection device 3, processing device 4, and a
        feedback device 5. The components of the LOS beam detection
        system 100 will be described in more detail in the following. </p>
      <p>[0017] The enclosure 1 may completely surround a detection
        device 3 and may be electromagnetically (EM) shielded. An EM
        shielded enclosure 1 may facilitate the filtering out or
        elimination of background electromagnetic interference or noise
        typically present in the environment. The enclosure 1 may be
        configured in a variety of shapes and sizes, not limited to the
        illustrative example shown. In some embodiments, the enclosure 1
        may be in the form of a hand-held device approximately the size
        and shape of a pair of binoculars, among others. As shown in
        FIG. 1, a relatively simple enclosure approximately in the shape
        of a sealed cylinder, among others, may be used for the
        enclosure 1. </p>
      <p>[0018] An EM shielded enclosure 1 may comprise a central core
        structure 12 overlaid with an electromagnetic shielding material
        11 or in some cases, may be directly formed from the shielding
        material 11. The central core structure 12 may be formed from
        any of a wide variety of lightweight and/or low cost materials,
        such as polypropylene, aluminum, cardboard or other compressed
        fiber material, and wood, among others. Some examples of
        shielding material 11 include mu-metal, a nickel-iron alloy
        comprising approximately 75% nickel, 15% iron, plus copper and
        molybdenum, among others. Mu-metal has a very high magnetic
        permeability and may be very effective at screening static or
        low-frequency magnetic fields. Other materials that may exhibit
        similar properties include supermalloy, supermumetal, nilomag,
        sanbold, and Mo-permalloy, among others. The examples listed are
        not intended to form an exhaustive list but are instead intended
        to illustrate a representative selection from a wide variety of
        appropriate materials. </p>
      <p>[0019] The enclosure 1 may comprise one or more portals 2
        (i.e., openings) configured to provide visual access for a
        corresponding number of eyes. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1,
        a single portal 1 may be provided for a single eye of a
        monitored subject. In other embodiments, two portals may be
        provided for both eyes of a single monitored subject. With
        larger devices, 2 or more portals may be provided for two or
        more monitored subjects simultaneously undergoing monitoring.
        The portal 2 may be covered with a transparent member such as
        glass, plastic, acrylic, or other non-electromagnetic shielding
        material, among others, so as to completely enclose the interior
        of the enclosure 1. In some cases, the portal 2 may be open,
        eliminating any obstruction between the LOS beam and the
        detection device 3. The exterior surface surrounding the portal
        2 may be configured to comfortably accommodate the surrounding
        structure of an eye, including but not limited to, a resilient
        interface 13 (FIG. 2) such as a foam surround or camera type of
        rubber eyepiece for example, among others. The resilient
        interface 13 may also comprise EM shielding material to reduce
        or further inhibit the passage of electromagnetic background
        noise or interference into the interior chamber of the enclosure
        1. </p>
      <p>[0020] The detection device 3 may be a non-contacting,
        active-dry electroencephalogram (EEG) electrode configured to
        measure electrical signals from the brain. Conventional EEG
        electrodes may have input impedances up to an order of about
        10.sup.6.OMEGA. to 10.sup.7.OMEGA.. A detection device 3
        comprising conventional EEG electrodes may require EM shielding
        surrounding the enclosure 1 to reduce interference from
        surrounding electromagnetic and other noise. The length of the
        enclosure 1 may be designed to correspond with the ability of
        the EEG electrode to remotely sense the LOS beam. The
        non-contacting, active-dry EEG electrode may comprise tin, gold,
        silver, or other appropriate materials, in addition to
        combinations of these materials, configured as discs. </p>
      <p>[0021] Alternatively, the detection device 3 may be a high (or
        ultra-high) impedance EEG electrode. A high impedance EEG
        electrode may have an input impedance from about 10.sup.7.OMEGA.
        up to approximately 10.sup.15.OMEGA.. The noise floors of high
        impedance EEG electrodes may be on the order of approximately 70
        .eta.V Hz.sup.-1/2 at 1 Hz. Due at least in part to the low
        noise levels achievable with high impedance EEG electrodes, a
        LOS beam detection system 100 may require only modest, if any at
        all, electromagnetic shielding for the enclosure 1, even at the
        highest levels of sensitivity, when the detection device 3
        comprises one or more high impedance EEG electrodes. An
        optimization between the cost of the high impedance EEG
        electrodes and the cost of the electromagnetic shielding may
        drive the overall configuration of the LOS beam detection system
        100. As with the other EEG electrodes comprising the detection
        device 3, the length of the enclosure 1 may be designed to
        correspond with the ability of the high impedance EEG electrode
        (or other embodiment of the detection device 3) to remotely
        sense the LOS beam. </p>
      <p>[0022] The detection device 3 may be coupled with a processing
        device 4. The processing device 4 may comprise a specifically
        programmed general purpose micro-processor, a purpose built
        device with application specific instruction code, or a
        combination of various components working together as a system,
        among other embodiments. For example, a commercially available
        multi-channel, multi-modality encoder may be connected through a
        USB port to a general purpose computer running appropriate
        software. The computer may receive the signal and amplify or
        otherwise convert the signal into a communicative feedback. The
        communicative feedback may comprise a visual display such as
        illuminating various amounts and/or colors of lights, graphs,
        and shapes, among others. Alternatively, or in addition to the
        visual display, the communicative feedback may comprise an audio
        component, such as various frequencies of tone, various
        frequencies or intervals of tonal bursts (e.g., such as in a
        traditional Geiger counter, etc.), and/or synthesized speech
        reacting to the detected LOS beam, among others. The
        communicative feedback may be via the processing device 4 (e.g.,
        through the display or speakers typically integrated with a
        general processing computer), or via external devices (such as a
        stand alone communication device 5) driven by or coupled to the
        processing device 4. In all communications between various
        components, the connections may either be hardwired, wireless
        (e.g., Bluetooth.RTM., Wi-Fi.TM.), or a combination of various
        transmission methods and systems, among others. </p>
      <p>[0023] A communication device 5 may be coupled to the
        processing device 4. The communication device 5 is shown as a
        speaker only for the purposes of illustration. Many forms and
        methods of communicating the strength of the feedback signal
        from the detection device 3 may be used in place of the speaker
        shown as a communication device 5. One or more speakers or a
        more ergonomic form of speaker such as headphones, ear plugs,
        etc., may be used as an embodiment of the communication device
        5. The communication method described in this illustrative
        embodiment may involve some form of auditory communication so
        that a monitored subject may not have to avert their eyes from
        the detection device 3 in order to receive the communicative
        feedback. </p>
      <p>[0024] Turning now to FIG. 2, a method for using the LOS beam
        detection system 100 may be as follows. A LOS beam detection
        system 100 may be configured as described above, comprising an
        enclosure 1, a detection device 3, a processing device 4, and a
        communication device 5. In certain illustrative embodiments, the
        interior of the enclosure 1 may contain an illuminating device 7
        configured to facilitate the visual detection of detection
        device 3 during use of the LOS beam detection system 100.
        Alternatively, or in addition to the illuminating device 7, at
        least a portion of the enclosure 1 may comprise a transparent or
        semi-transparent section enabling visual communication with the
        detection device 3 contained within the enclosure 1. </p>
      <p>[0025] The subject may place their eye proximate to the portal
        2 such that there may be a substantially direct line of sight
        communication between the detection device 3 and their eye
        (shown by a broken line). For example, the subject may place at
        least a portion of the area surrounding their eye directly
        against the resilient interface 13. The processing device 4 may
        process the signal from the detection device 3 and may provide a
        processed signal to the communication device 5. The subject may
        then alter physiological and/or mental aspects of their body and
        concentration in an attempt to manipulate the signal to a
        maximum level. Such alterations may include increasing or
        decreasing focus on the detection device 3, varying
        concentration efforts and levels, and relaxing or tensing the
        musculature surrounding the eye, among other techniques. </p>
      <p>[0026] Another form of use may involve the monitored subject
        alternating between directly looking at the detection device 3
        and not looking at the detection device 3. Not looking at the
        detection device 3 may involve altering the line of sight to one
        side or another of the detection device 3 and/or closing the eye
        proximate to the portal. In some cases, both looking to one side
        and closing the eye may be used. The subject may try to alter
        the communicative feedback from the communication device 5
        through a range of on (e.g., some auditory feedback) when
        looking at the detection device 3, to off when not looking at
        the detection device 3. The LOS beam detection system 100 may
        also be used as a passive monitoring system for acquiring data
        regarding the electromagnetic waves traveling through an ocular
        region of the head. </p>
      <p><b>ANOTHER EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>[0027] Referring now to FIG. 3, the reference numeral 300
        generally indicates another illustrative embodiment of the LOS
        beam detection system 300 configured according to at least some
        aspects of the present invention. In this figure, similar
        components may be given the same reference numbers and a
        detailed description of these components may not be repeated.
        The LOS beam detection system 300 may comprise an enclosure 30,
        a first and second portal 2A and 2B, a first and second
        detection device 3A and 3B, a reflector member 34, a processing
        device 4, and a communication device 5 shown a speaker 5A,
        illuminated bar graph 5B, and a meter 5C. The various components
        of the LOS beam detection system 300 will be described in
        greater detail below. </p>
      <p>[0028] The enclosure 30 of the LOS beam detection system 300
        may be configured to accommodate a first and second portal 2A
        and 2B, for each eye of a single monitored subject for example.
        In some applications, two monitored subjects may each use one of
        the first and second portals 2A and 2B. However, although two
        portals 2A and 2B are shown in this illustrative embodiment, the
        current invention may not be limited to this configuration. One
        portal or three or more portals may be used with the enclosure
        30. As with the previously described portal 2, the first and
        second portals 2A and 2B may be configured to comfortably
        accommodate two eyes of a single subject. In some embodiments,
        the first and second portals 2A and 2B may be adjustable (e.g.,
        towards and away from one another, an adjustment system is not
        shown in this figure) in order to adapt the LOS beam detection
        system 300 to a wide variety of ages and body types of
        individual subjects. </p>
      <p>[0029] As seen in FIG. 3, the enclosure 30 may also be
        configured to accommodate two detection devices, such as a first
        detection device 3A and a second detection device 3B. In this
        illustrative embodiment, the first detection device 3A may be
        along a line of sight for the first and second portals 2A and
        2B. However, the second detection device 3B may be obstructed
        from a direct line of sight via the first and second portals 2A
        and 2B. The obstruction for the second detection device 3B may
        be due to a configuration of the enclosure 30 (e.g., locating
        the second detection device 3B within a bottomed cylindrical
        cavity or around a bend in a wall for example, among others), or
        the obstruction may be due to secondary feature such as an
        internal wall 32 or some other form of electromagnetic shielding
        for example. As shown, the second detection device 3B may be at
        an angle to the first detection device 3A. </p>
      <p>[0030] In order to facilitate a line of sight communication
        between the first and second portals 2A and 2B and the second
        detection device 3B, the enclosure 30 may contain a reflective
        member 34 positioned at an angle to the portals and the second
        detection device 3B. The reflective member 34 may comprise a
        optical and/or electromagnetic reflective material, among
        others, enabling the portals 2A and 2B to have a visual and/or
        electromagnetic beam direct line of sight communication with the
        second detection device 3B. For example, some polished metals
        may provide both forms of reflection for the reflective member
        34. In some embodiments, a secondary internal wall 36 or more
        may be provided within the enclosure 30 in order to prevent
        cross contamination of the first and second detection devices 3A
        and 3B (i.e., to ensure primary detection by the first detection
        device 3A substantially when looking at the first detection
        device 3A, and primary detection by the second detection device
        3B substantially when looking at the second detection device
        3B). </p>
      <p>[0031] As with the previous enclosure 1, the enclosure 30 of
        the LOS beam detection system 300 may be electromagnetically
        shielded depending at least in part upon the amount of
        surrounding environmental electrical noise and/or the input
        impedance level of the electrodes comprising the first and
        second detection devices 3A and 3B. The other details and
        materials appropriate for the enclosure 1 may be applied for the
        enclosure 30. </p>
      <p>[0032] The first and second detection devices 3A and 3B may be
        communicatively coupled with a processing device 4 that is in
        turn communicatively coupled with one or more communication
        devices 5. As shown in this illustrative embodiment, examples of
        the communication devices 5 may include one or more speakers 5A,
        one or more illuminated bar graphs 5B, and one or more meters
        5C, among others. The bar graphs 5B and the meters 5C may be
        stand alone components coupled to the processing device 4, or
        they may be virtual components visually displayed on a monitor.
        There may be a single communicative device 5 for each of the
        detection devices 3A and 3B (e.g., using separate frequency
        tones with a variable volume level for indicating the strength
        and identity of a signal from the detection devices 3A and 3B).
        However, a separate set of communication devices 5 may be
        provided for each of the detection devices 3A and 3B. In this
        case, each of the detection devices 3A and 3B may be
        individually monitored by a subject and/or a technician. </p>
      <p>[0033] The LOS beam detection system 300 may be used to detect
        the strength and application of a reflected LOS beam. A subject
        may initially focus on the first detection device 3A and then
        alternate by focusing on the second detection device 3B via the
        reflective member 34. By receiving the communication feedback
        from the communication devices 5, a monitored subject may
        identify which detection device is receiving the LOS beam and
        attempt to alter the strength of the LOS beam. After a number of
        monitoring sessions with the first detection device 3A are
        recorded, such as in an electronic file or database of the
        processing device 4, the subject may perform and record a number
        of monitoring sessions with the second detection device 3B.
        Subsequently, statistical analysis may indicate the relative
        strength of a reflected LOS beam as compared to a direct LOS
        beam, among others. </p>
      <p><b>ANOTHER EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>[0034] Turning now to FIG. 4, the reference numeral 400
        generally indicates another illustrative embodiment of the LOS
        beam detection system 400 configured according to at least some
        aspects of the present invention. In this figure, similar
        components may be given the same reference numbers and a
        detailed description of these components may not be repeated.
        The LOS beam detection system 400 may comprise an enclosure 40,
        a first and second portal 2A and 2B, a plurality of detection
        devices 43, a processing device 4, a communication device 5, and
        a storage device 6. The various components of the LOS beam
        detection system 400 will be described in greater detail below.
      </p>
      <p>[0035] In this illustrative embodiment of the present
        invention, a plurality of detection devices 43 is contained
        within an enclosure 40. The plurality of detection devices 43
        may preferably be located substantially equidistantly from the
        first and second portals 2A and 2B, for example, such as along a
        substantially constant radius from a center point between the
        first and second portals 2A and 2B (as shown by the radius R).
        The plurality of detection devices 43 are shown along a single
        row for the purposes of illustration only. The arrangement of
        the plurality of detection devices 43 may be regular or
        irregular, in one, two, or three dimensions. </p>
      <p>[0036] The plurality of detection devices may be coupled to a
        processing device 4 integrated with a communication device 5,
        for example. The communicative feedback for the plurality of
        detection devices 43 may comprise a one or two dimensional image
        composed of variable colors of light showing the intensity of an
        individual signal at a location on a monitor corresponding to
        the location within the enclosure 40 of the particular detection
        device of the plurality of detection devices 43. Video
        communication may be the preferred way to communicate the
        plurality of signal streams to the subject and/or an
        operator/technician. However, auditory communication may still
        provide information including the average intensity of the LOS
        beam (e.g., a volume level corresponding to the highest signal
        strength) or the focus of the LOS beam (e.g., a variable
        frequency corresponding to a ratio of the average number of
        detection devices indicating the presence of a signal versus the
        total number of the plurality of detection devices).
        Alternatively, the communicative feedback of the plurality of
        detection devices 43 may track the LOS beam as a subject looks
        over the plurality of detection devices 43. For example, the
        communicative signal may track as the subject looks from side to
        side within the enclosure 40 or as the subject attempts to vary
        the focus of the LOS beam. </p>
      <p>[0037] The processing device 4 may be coupled to an internal
        and/or external storage device 6, such as an electromagnetic,
        optical, flash, or virtual storage device (i.e., storage across
        various sites on the Internet), among others. The signals from
        the plurality of detection devices 43 may be stored for later
        retrieval and statistical processing and analysis, as well as
        assisting medical professionals in the monitoring and diagnosis
        of various illnesses and treatments. </p>
      <p><b>ANOTHER EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>[0038] Referring now to FIGS. 5A and 5B, the reference numeral
        500 generally indicates another illustrative embodiment of the
        LOS beam detection system 500 configured according to at least
        some aspects of the present invention. In this figure, similar
        components may be given the same reference numbers and a
        detailed description of these components may not be repeated.
        The LOS beam detection system 500 may comprise an enclosure 50
        comprising first and second enclosures 50A and 50B (only 50A can
        be seen in FIG. 5A), an attachment member 52, detection devices
        3 comprising first and second detection devices 3A and 3B (only
        3A can be seen in FIG. 5A), a processing device 4, a
        communicative device 5, and a storage device 6. The various
        components of the LOS beam detection system 500 will be
        described in greater detail below. </p>
      <p>[0039] The LOS beam detection system 500 shown in the figures
        may be substantially configured in the form of a pair of glasses
        or goggles. Since both sides of a pair of glasses are
        substantially symmetrical, only one side needs to be described
        in detail. The first enclosure 50A may fit around an eye in a
        manner similar to the way one side of a pair of waterproof
        goggles fits around an eye (e.g., forming a sealed environment
        within the goggles). There may not be a dedicated portal in this
        configuration because the first enclosure 50A may be open on one
        side. The eye and surrounding tissue may form the final wall of
        the first enclosure 50A. As with the previous illustrative
        embodiments, the first enclosure 50A may be electromagnetically
        shielded to prevent electrical noise and interference from
        disrupting or altering the detection signal from the first
        detection device 3A. In some embodiments, the first enclosure
        50A may be transparent to allow the subject to visibly interact
        with their surroundings during the monitoring processes. In this
        case, a first detection device 3A with a high input impedance
        may be used. </p>
      <p>[0040] The first detection device 3A may be located at any
        location on or within the first enclosure 50A. Preferably, the
        first detection device 3A may be located directly in the line of
        sight of a subject when the subject is looking straight ahead
        (e.g., indicated by the solid lines in FIG. 5A). However, in
        some embodiments the first detection device 3A may be located to
        one side or another of the first enclosure 50A (e.g., a position
        not normally in the line of sight, indicated by the broken lines
        in FIG. 5A). The LOS beam detection system 500 may function in
        this configuration as a switch, in which the subject may signal
        a change in state by looking off to the side, directly at the
        first detection device 3A. Whereas, during normal interaction,
        the subject may be able to substantially look around without
        triggering the first detection device 3A. </p>
      <p>[0041] The first detection device 3A may be coupled to a
        processing device 4. The processing device may be internally or
        externally integrated with a communication device 5 and/or a
        storage device 6. Communicative feedback interaction and data
        processing and storage may be the same or similar to the
        previously discussed embodiments. The LOS beam detection system
        500 may offer an advantage in that the detection devices 3 may
        be placed relatively close to the surface of the ocular area,
        potentially increasing the strength of the LOS beam received by
        each of the detection devices 3. In addition, the LOS beam
        detection system 500 may be worn relatively unobtrusively and
        conveniently, thereby permitting the monitoring and/or signaling
        via the detection devices 3 in a wide variety of environments
        and situations. </p>
      <p>[0042] Having thus described the present invention by reference
        to certain of its preferred embodiments, it is noted that the
        embodiments disclosed are illustrative rather than limiting in
        nature and that a wide range of variations, modifications,
        changes, and substitutions are contemplated in the foregoing
        disclosure. In some instances, some features of the present
        invention may be employed without a corresponding use of the
        other features. Many such variations and modifications may be
        considered desirable by those skilled in the art based upon a
        review of the foregoing description of preferred embodiments.
        Accordingly, it is appropriate that the appended claims be
        construed broadly and in a manner consistent with the scope of
        the invention. </p>
