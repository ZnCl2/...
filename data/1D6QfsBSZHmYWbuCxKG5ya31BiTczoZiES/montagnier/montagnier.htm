      <br>
      A Nobel Prize winning biologist has ignited controversy after
      publishing details of an experiment in which a fragment of DNA
      appeared to 'teleport' or imprint itself between test tubes.<br>
      <br>
      According to a team headed by Luc Montagnier, previously known for
      his work on HIV and AIDS, two test tubes, one of which contained a
      tiny piece of bacterial DNA, the other pure water, were surrounded
      by a weak electromagnetic field of 7Hz.<br>
      <br>
      Eighteen hours later, after DNA amplification using a polymerase
      chain reaction, as if by magic the DNA was detectable in the test
      tube containing pure water.<br>
      <br>
      Oddly, the original DNA sample had to be diluted many times over
      for the experiment to work, which might explain why the phenomenon
      has not been detected before, assuming that this is what has
      happened.<br>
      <br>
      The phenomenon might be very loosely described as 'teleportation'
      except that the bases project or imprint themselves across space
      rather than simply moving from one place to another.<br>
      <br>
      To be on the safe side, Montagnier then compared the results with
      controls in which the time limit was lowered, no electromagnetic
      field was present or was present but at lower frequencies, and in
      which both tubes contained pure water. On every one of these, he
      drew a blank.<br>
      <br>
      The quantum effect - the imprinting of the DNA on the water - is
      not in itself the most contentious element of the experiment, so
      much as the relatively long timescales over which it appears to
      manifest itself. Quantum phenomena are assumed to show their faces
      in imperceptible fractions of a second and not seconds minutes and
      hours, and usually at very low temperatures approaching absolute
      zero.<br>
      <br>
      Revealing a process through which biology might display the
      underlying 'quantumness' of nature at room temperature would be
      startling.<br>
      <br>
      Montagnier's experiment will have to be repeated by others to have
      any hope of being taken seriously. So far, some scientists have
      been publically incredulous.<br>
      <br>
      "It is hard to understand how the information can be stored within
      water over a timescale longer than picoseconds," said the Ruhr
      University in Bochum's Klaus Gerwert, quoted by New Scientist
      magazine, which broke the story (requires registration).<br>
      <br>
      What does all of this mean? It could be that the propagation of
      life is able to make use of the quantum nature of reality to
      project itself in subtle ways, as has been hinted at in previous
      experiments. Alternatively, it could be that life itself is a
      complex projection of these quantum phenomena and utterly depends
      on them in ways not yet understood because they are incredibly
      hard to detect.<br>
      <br>
      Speculatively, (and Montagnier doesn't directly suggest anything
      so unsubstantiated), it could also be the little-understood
      quantum properties of the water molecule and not just its more
      obvious chemical bonding properties that gives it such a central
      role in the bio-engineering of life-forms. Water might be a good
      medium in which DNA can copy itself using processes that hint at
      quantum entanglement and 'teleportation' (our term).<br>
      <br>
      Montagnier's paper goes on to discuss the phenomenon he claims to
      have uncovered using 'quantum field theory' within the context of
      his personal interest, disease propagation.<br>

      </b><br>
      A general method for identifying both known and unknown DNA
      sequences at the origin of EMS, including DNA sequences in the
      plasma of patients suffering of chronic diseases such as
      Alzheimer, Parkinson, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis,
      and other similar diseases, disorders and conditions. The
      invention is based on the discovery that: (1) The nanostructures
      induced by DNA sequences in water or other dipole solutions can
      faithfully reflect the information contained in these sequences at
      dilutions which do not contain anymore of that DNA, as evidenced
      by the fact that it can be retranscribed into the same DNA
      sequence by the polymerases and reagents used in classical
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR); (2) this information can be
      transmitted at a distance in water or other dipole solutions by
      EMS emitted by the nanostructures; and (3) EMS signatures of
      nanostructures containing this information can be detected,
      stored, transmitted, transduced and imprinted in water or other
      dipole solutions.<br>
      <br>

      <b>[0006] 2. Description of the Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      [0007] The inventors have previously described a method for
      selectively detecting DNA sequences of pathogenic microorganisms
      by their emission of low frequency electromagnetic waves (EMS) in
      water dilutions. U.S. application Ser. No. 12/560,772, filed Sep.
      16, 2009, entitled "System and Method for the Analysis of DNA
      sequences in Biological Fluids" discloses a method for detecting
      electromagnetic waves derived from bacterial DNA, comprising
      extracting and purifying nucleic acids from a sample; diluting the
      extracted purified nucleic acids in an aqueous solvent; measuring
      a low frequency electromagnetic emission over time from the
      diluted extracted purified nucleic acids in an aqueous solvent;
      performing a signal analysis of the low frequency electromagnetic
      emission over time; and producing an output, based on the signal
      analysis, in dependence on the DNA in the sample. The products and
      procedures as well as other subject matter disclosed in this
      patent application are expressly incorporated by reference.<br>

      [0008] Methods for detecting some low electromagnetic frequency
      electromagnetic signals in diluted filtrates of the culture medium
      of certain bacteria and viruses, as well as in diluted plasma of
      patients infected by the same agents are disclosed by U.S.

      [0023] In some instances, it was demonstrated that the EMS could
      originate from specific genes or even from some fragmented DNA
      sequences. This was discovered to be the case for the adhesin gene
      of Mycoplasma pirum (U.S. Ser. No. 12/097,204, filed Dec. 14,
      2006) and of the LTR (Long terminal repeat), nef and pol genes of

      12, 2009 &amp; U.S. Ser. No. 12/797,826, filed Jun. 10, 2010).
      However, for many microbial agents or diseases of unknown origin
      or etiology this identification was not possible. Consequently,
      the inventor developed new methods, disclosed herein for detecting
      and identifying biological molecules, specifically DNA or other

      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0024] There are several nonlimiting aspects to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] (1) A method for producing a solution, such an aqueous
      solution like water that contains nanostructures that characterize
      a molecule like DNA. This method involves dilution, usually serial
      dilution, of a sample containing DNA and agitation of the sample
      between dilutions to produce the water nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] (2) Measuring EMS characteristic of a molecule like DNA or
      of its nanostructure in an originating sample and transducing this
      signal into a second receiving sample, usually water that does not
      emit the EMS signal. This is performed without contacting the
      originating sample and the receiving sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] (3) Electronic transmission of a detected or recorded EMS
      signal to a remove location and optionally imprinting it on a
      naïve sample and/or recovering DNA or other replicating molecule
      from the imprinted naïve sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] (4) Detecting DNA or DNA like molecules in a sample
      suspected of containing a particular agent, like HIV or Borellia.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] (5) Identifying DNA or similar molecules present in an
      unknown sample, such as from a sample from a subject having a
      disease of unknown etiology.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] (6) Devices that detect, induce, transduce or transmit EMS
      signals.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0037] Definitions:<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Nucleic acid: Includes single stranded, double stranded
      DNA, and RNA as well as modified polynucleotide sequences.
      Biological samples containing DNA associated with a disease or
      disorder are generally isolated or recovered in double stranded
      form.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Self-replicating molecule: A molecule, such as DNA, that
      under appropriate conditions, can reproduce the information
      content of its primary, second, tertiary or quaternary structure.
      For example, a DNA molecule can replicate itself in the presence
      of the appropriate enzymes, primers and nucleotides.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] DNA Amplification: Methods for amplifying nucleic acids are
      known. Conventional methods including polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) are known and are also incorporated by reference to Current
      Protocols in Molecular Biology (updated Apr. 5, 2010), Print ISSN:
      1934-3639; Online ISSN: 1934-3647.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Nanostructures: These structures of water are induced by
      biological molecules like nucleic acids such as single stranded or
      double stranded DNA. While not being bound to any particular
      theory, according to the physical theory of diphasic water,
      filtration and mechanical agitation (succussion) are believed to
      induce in water a low energy potential favoring the formation of
      quantum coherent domains. These domains will become replicas of a
      DNA molecule and vibrate by resonance when properly diluted and
      excited; see Del Guidice, et al., Water as a Free Electric Dipole
      Laser, Phys. Rev. Lett. 61, 1085-1088 (1988). Hydrogen bonding
      networks in liquid water, such as those described by Cowan, et
      al., Nature 434 (7030): 199-202 (2005) have not been associated
      with nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Serial Dilutions: Serial dilution is a well-known technique
      and involves the stepwise dilution of a substance, such as DNA, in
      a solvent, such as water, saline solution, aqueous buffer, or an
      aqueous alcohol solution. Generally, serial dilutions as performed
      herein are stepwise dilutions by a factor of 10, or dilution of 1
      part of a more concentrated solution in 9 parts of a solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] EMS: Electromagnetic signal. EMS in the context of the
      methods herein generally involves those having frequencies ranging
      from 0 Hz to 20,000 Hz as well as all intermediate subranges and
      values. Components of the ambient electromagnetic field include
      Schumann resonances which represent a set of spectrum peaks in the
      extremely low frequency (ELF) portion of the Earth's
      electromagnetic field spectrum. Schumann resonances are global
      electromagnetic resonances excited by lightning discharges in the
      cavity formed by the Earth's surface and the ionosphere and are
      the principal background in the electromagnetic spectrum between 3
      and 69 Hz. A representative Schumann resonance peak occurs in the
      Earth's electromagnetic spectrum and an ELF of about 7.83 Hz. By
      comparison, 60 Hz cycling of electricity is used in North America
      and 50 Hz elsewhere in the world.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] EMS detection. Any suitable means for interrogating a
      sample and measuring its EMS may be employed. Exemplary systems,
      methods, and apparatuses for this purpose are disclosed by
      Butters, et al., WO 03/083439 A2, and are incorporated by
      reference to this document. Generally, these procedures will
      involve placing a sample into a container having electromagnetic
      and magnetic shielding, a source of Gaussian noise for injection
      in to the sample, a detector for detecting an electromagnetic
      time-domain signal composed of sample source radiation
      superimposed on the injected Gaussian noise, and a storage device
      for storing the time-domain signal and a time-domain signal
      separately detected from the same of a similar sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] EMS Signature: The EMS characteristic of a particular
      biological molecule or a time domain signal associated with a
      material of interest. EMS signatures for various biological
      molecules are disclosed by U.S. Ser. No. 12/797,826, filed Jun.
      10, 2010. Such EMS signatures as well as methods for producing
      samples suitable for EMS detection and methods for detecting an
      EMS signature are incorporated by reference to this patent
      application.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] An EMS Signature of a particular molecule can be
      represented by a characteristic electromagnetic time domain
      signal. An EMS Signature may be recorded and replayed, undergo
      signal transformation or processing, or be transmitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Excitation Frequency: A frequency used to excite a sample
      in which an EMS signature has been detected and induce an EMS
      signature in a sample previously devoid of the EMS signature,
      e.g., pure water. These frequencies include those of 7 Hz or
      above, e.g., 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 30, 40, 45, 50,
      55, 60, 65, 70 or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Originating Sample: A biological sample that contains an
      EMS signature, such as one characteristic of one or more
      biomolecules. An example would be a sample containing an EMS
      signature characteristic of DNA derived from human
      immunodeficiency virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Receiving or Signalized Sample: A sample, such as water or
      another aqueous buffer or dipole that has acquired or been
      imprinted with a nanostructure corresponding to a biological
      molecule, such as DNA. Methods for producing signalized water by
      serial dilution and agitation in water or in an aqueous solvent
      are disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Pathogenic Disease: Disease caused by or associated with a
      pathogen, such as a pathogenic parasite, yeast or fungus,
      bacterium, virus or infectious protein, such as a prion. Examples
      include parasitic diseases such as malaria or trypanosomiasis,
      fungal diseases, such as infections caused by or associated with
      Aspergillus, Candida, Histoplasma, Pneumocystis, Cryptococcus,
      Stachybotrys (black mold), bacterial infections such as Lyme
      Disease, sexually transmitted bacterial infections, tuberculosis,
      viral infections, including HIV infection, herpes virus infection,
      or hepatitis, and prion associated diseases such as
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and so-called Mad Cow disease.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Autoimmune Disease, Degenerative Disease, Disorders or
      Conditions: These diseases, disorders or conditions may or may not
      have been previously associated with a particular biological
      molecule, such as a particular DNA molecule or its corresponding
      water nanostructure. Examples include allergic conditions,
      multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, disorders associated
      with transplantation or replacement of body parts, Alzheimer's
      disease, Parkinson's disease and other diseases or disorders of
      unknown or incomplete etiology, such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,
      Gulf War Syndrome, or with exposure to particular biological,
      chemical or physical agents or with the sequela of such exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Representative embodiments of the invention are described
      below.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] (i) Originating and Signalized Samples.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Test samples used to produce an EMS will contain DNA or
      other replicating biological molecules that can form
      nanostructures or can be naïve samples signalized by EMS
      transduction to emit EMS or contain nanostructures representative
      of the DNA or other molecule. Representative test samples include
      blood, plasma, serum, CSF, joint fluid, saliva, mucous, semen,
      vaginal fluid, sweat, urine, and feces. Tissue samples and samples
      from other sources, including laboratory or hospital sources,
      foods, drinks and potable water may be used. These may be
      diagnostic samples, such as those obtained from a subject known to
      have or suspected of having a particular conditions, disorder or
      disease like AIDS or Lyme disease. Alternatively, they may be
      obtained from subjects having or suspected of having a condition,
      disorder or disease of unknown etiology, such as a parasitic or
      fungal disease or disorder, bacterial disease or disorder viral
      disease or disorder, an autoimmune disease, disorder or condition,
      diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease or Parkinson's Disease.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] To produce a sample that emits detectable EMS, a test
      sample undergoes dilution, usually serial dilution, and agitation
      preferably between each serial dilution. A test sample is usually
      diluted by a factor of 10&lt;3&gt;, 10&lt;4&gt;, 10&lt;5&gt;,
      10&lt;6&gt;, 10&lt;7&gt;, 10&lt;8&gt;, 10&lt;9 &gt;10&lt;10&gt;,
      10&lt;11&gt;, 10&lt;12&gt;, 10&lt;13 &gt;or more. Though any
      intervening factor of dilution or other degrees of dilution that
      produce detectable EMS may also be used. The beginning
      concentration of a nucleic acid in a sample prior to dilution
      generally ranges from 1 ng/ml to 4 ng/ml.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Solutions for dilution and agitation as well as for
      containing an originating or receiving sample are preferably
      water, but other aqueous or dipolar solutions may be employed so
      long as they can provide nanostructures representative of DNA or
      other replicating molecules or induce detectable EMS when used.
      Examples of solutions include water, or other aqueous solutions,
      such as normal saline, phosphate buffered saline, physiologically
      acceptable aqueous solutions, buffered aqueous solutions, or
      alcohol and water mixtures, including 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and
      70% or more of ethanol or other alcohol solutions or other
      solvents selected on a basis of their relevant properties
      depending on the molecule to be tested, may be employed in the
      methods described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In some applications, control samples are required. The
      type of control sample may be selected by one of skill in the art
      depending on the particular application but in general will not
      emit the EMS signature of the molecule of interest or contain
      nanostructures corresponding to it. Often, such controls will
      constitute pure, unsignalized water, distilled water or pyrolyzed
      water or other solutions known to be nucleic acid free.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Signalized samples or solutions producing an EMS signature
      should not be boiled, heated or frozen for long periods of time so
      as to preserve the EMS signatures or nanostructures they contain.
      Preferably, these samples or solutions should be stored above
      freezing and less than 40[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Various forms and time periods for agitation are
      contemplated and are incorporated by reference to the documents
      mentioned above. Vortexing for a period of 15 seconds between
      serial dilutions is one representative method for producing a
      sample emitting detectable EMS.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] (ii) EMS Transduction. The invention also relates to a
      method for producing an EMS signature in an aqueous buffer
      comprising placing an originating (EMS+) sample in an aqueous
      buffer and a receiving sample not having the EMS signature next to
      each other inside of an electromagnetically shielded container,
      applying an electromagnetic field for a time and under conditions
      sufficient to transfer the EMS signature from the originating
      sample to the receiving sample. The electromagnetic field is
      generally applied by a coil, such as a copper coil, located inside
      of an electromagnetically shielded container. Coils made of other
      electrically conducting metals or alloys may be employed or other
      devices that produce similar electromagnetic flux. The
      electromagnetic field can be applied to the sample for a time
      period ranging sufficient to produce an EMS signature, for
      example, from 12 to 24 hrs although other suitable time periods
      may be selected based on the nature of the sample, the sample
      dilution and the physical characteristics of the apparatus.
      Exposure time is chosen based on the amount of time required for
      transfer to occur. Some representative times include &gt;0, 1, 2,
      3, 4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-18, 18-24 and 24-48 hrs or longer. Signalized
      samples produced by this method as well as nucleic acids like DNA
      amplified from a signalized sample are also contemplated.
      Alternatively, an EMS signature may be imprinted in water or
      another aqueous buffer by contacting the one or more receiving
      samples with a recorded or transmitted and optionally amplified
      EMS signature previously obtained from an originating sample in an
      aqueous buffer having an EMS signature, for a time and under
      conditions sufficient to imprint the recorded or transmitted EMS
      signature of the originating sample onto the one or more receiving
      samples. Imprinting may be performed using means for applying an
      electromagnetic field, for example using a device, such as a
      copper coil or solenoid coil, optionally located inside of an
      electromagnetically shielded container. The electromagnetic field
      is applied to the sample for a time period sufficient to produce
      an EMS signature in the sample, for example for a period of 1 to
      24 hrs. Other suitable time periods may be selected based on the
      nature of the sample, the sample dilution and the physical
      characteristics of the device or other means for applying the
      electromagnetic field. Signalized samples produced by this method
      as well as nucleic acids like DNA amplified from a signalized
      sample are also contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] (iii) EMS Recording/Transmission. EMS signals once measured
      may be recorded on a tangible medium, such as a computer hard
      drive, a flash drive, DVD, or CD or other known media. They may be
      transmitted electronically, for example, over the internet, or by
      any other means that preserves the signal integrity. Recorded or
      received signals can be amplified and used to transduce EMS into a
      naïve solution as described above. This aspect of the invention
      can involve the recording, transducing, storing, and/or
      transmission of an EMS signature of a nucleic acid, such as that
      produced after serial dilution of a signalized sample. An EMS
      signature may be recorded by a suitable electronic device, such as
      a recorder, computer or computer network. The recorded EMS
      signature may undergo signal processing or signal transformation
      for example into a digital or analog signal, be transmitted by a
      communications device, such as via radio, telephone, modem, or
      Internet transmission to a receiver, such as a receiving computer,
      anywhere in the world.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] A stored or transmitted EMS signature is then reconstituted
      and/or amplified and contacted with a receiving sample to imprint
      it with the EMS signature and produce nanostructures in the water
      or dipole solution of the receiving sample. Such a signal may be
      amplified prior to or after transmission, for example, using a
      commercial amplifier (e.g., Conrad). The electrical output from
      the amplifier containing the EMS signature is then applied to an
      electrically conducting coil (e.g., of copper wire) as described
      herein in which a plastic tube of pure non-signalized water or
      other dipole solution has been inserted for a time sufficient for
      imprinting of the EMS signature, generally for a period of at
      least one hour.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The production of EMS is then verified in water dilutions
      of the signalized water or dipole solution. The positive dilutions
      can be used for retrieving the DNA by PCR as described above. The
      DNA is then amplified by cloning and its sequence determined to be
      98-100% identical to the initial DNA. This development will be
      useful for remote diagnosis or use in other telemedicine
      procedures or protocols.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The inventors previously discovered that an electromagnetic
      signal of low frequency (EMS) induced in a water dilution by the
      DNA of some kinds of bacteria and viruses can be transmitted at a
      distance into a naive or unsignalized water, aqueous medium or
      other dipole solution. It has also been discovered that such an
      EMS corresponding to a particular biomolecule like DNA (i.e., an
      EMS signature of a particular molecule), can be recorded. This
      involves recording EMS from DNA fragments obtained by PCR
      (polymerase chain reaction) with sequence specific primers in an
      electromagnetic coil. The resulting amplified current is connected
      to a computer and stored as a file, such as an analog or digital
      file (e.g., a digital sound file). The recorded EMS can then
      undergo signal processing, for example a digital sound file can be
      processed using computer software for storage, transmission, or
      use.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] DNA may be reconstituted from its EMS signature. For
      example, the recorded or remotely transmitted EMS signature of a
      DNA molecule is input into a soundcard and the output from the
      soundcard is linked to an amplifier. Amplifier output is connected
      to a transducer solenoid into which an unsignalized water sample
      is placed. After a certain time, depending on the type of EMS
      signature, its intensity and the exposure time, the unsignalized
      water becomes signalized. In other words, the unsignalized water
      has memorized the EMS signature of the originating DNA molecule.
      By use of PCR the originating DNA molecule may be retrieved from
      the water signalized with its EMS signature. Verification of
      retrieval of the originating DNA sequence from the signalized
      water or verification of the fidelity of its reproduction can be
      verified by DNA sequencing.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Alternatively, prior to retrieval and synthesis of the DNA
      molecule by PCR, the signalization of the receiving sample with a
      DNA EMS signature may be determined by detecting the EMS emissions
      of the signalized sample using dilutions of the signalized water
      as previously described, e.g., by the device used to record the
      originating DNA sample's EMS signature in the first place. Only
      EMS positive dilutions will yield the DNA sequence. The procedure
      allows the transmission of DNA EMS signatures of medical interest
      as well as the remote retrieval of the corresponding originating
      DNA. Such transmission may be made by a medium of choice, for
      example, a digital signal may be transmitted over the internet or
      by sending USB keys (e.g., flashdrives) to remote laboratories or
      medical units.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] (iv) Detection of a Known Nucleic Acid Sequence. Specific
      molecules known or suspected to be contained in a test sample may
      be screened using the methods described above. A test sample is
      diluted and agitated to produce an EMS+ sample and a nucleic acid
      amplification using specific known primers for the nucleic acid
      sequence of interest is performed. The test sample may be a sample
      produced by dilution and agitation or may be produced by
      tranduction of EMS into a naïve sample. An EMS+ test sample is
      incubated with primers for a specific nucleic acid sequence and
      the nucleic acid product by PCR amplification, usually DNA, is
      recovered. The recovered amplification products may be assayed
      indicate the presence of the particular nucleic acid in the test
      sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] (v) Identification of an Unknown Nucleic Acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Another embodiment of the invention involves detecting a
      nucleic acid or nanostructures associated with an unknown nucleic
      acid in a test sample comprising amplifying a nucleic acid in a
      test sample using random nucleotide sequence or polynucleotides or
      primers; diluting and agitating during dilution the amplified
      nucleic acids in an aqueous solvent; measuring over time a low
      frequency electromagnetic emission from the diluted amplified
      nucleic acids; and optionally (i) identifying an EMS signature for
      amplified nucleic acid or its associated nanostructures by
      comparing the EMS of the test sample to the EMS of a control
      sample, and optionally (ii) comparing the results to relevant
      standard EMS signature(s). This method may further comprise
      performing a signal analysis of the low frequency electromagnetic
      emission over time, and/or producing an output, based on the
      signal analysis. This method may detect a biological molecule,
      such as a nucleic acid like DNA in a test sample and/or may detect
      a nanostructure derived from or associated with a nucleic acid
      such as DNA in the test sample. A suitable dilution of the test
      sample is selected for use within this method, for example, the
      test sample can be diluted by a factor of at least 10&lt;4&gt;,
      10&lt;5&gt;, 10&lt;6&gt;, 10&lt;7&gt;, 10&lt;8&gt;, or
      10&lt;9&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The test sample will usually be obtained from subject
      suffering from or at risk of developing a particular disease,
      disorder or condition. For example, the test sample can be
      obtained from a subject having or suspected of having a parasitic
      or fungal disease or disorder, a subject having or suspected of
      having a bacterial disease or disorder, a subject having or
      suspected of having viral disease or disorder, from a subject
      having or suspected of having had an autoimmune disorder, a
      subject having or suspected of having Alzheimer's Disease or
      Parkinson's Disease or any other neurological disease, a subject
      having or suspected to have a genetic disease or a gene
      alteration, or a subject having a disease, disorder or condition
      of unknown or incomplete etiology in comparison with a noninfected
      subject. For instance, an EMS signature of an HIV gene sequence,
      such as that of nef or pol, may be detected in a sample in
      comparison to a sample not containing the HIV gene sequence.
      Verification of the presence of a gene sequence in a sample may be
      made by PCR.<br>

      [0071] (vi) Devices. Various devices for use in conjunction with
      the different aspects of the invention are also disclosed. These
      include:<br>
      <br>
      [0072] A device for producing an EMS signature in an aqueous
      buffer comprising at least two containers, at least one for an EMS
      originating sample and at least one for an EMS receiving sample,
      an electrically conducting coil that can emit a variable frequency
      ranging from 1 to 20,000 Hz, optionally connected to an external
      generator of alternating current having a variable frequency from
      1 to 20,000 Hz, means for electromagnetic shielding the at least
      two containers and the electrically conducting coil.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] A device or other means for transmitting at a distance EMS
      emitted by a biological sample or by nanostructures contained in a
      sample is also contemplated. Such a device will contain at least
      two containers, at least one to contain a sample determined to
      produce EMS characteristic of a DNA or a similar molecule in a
      first tube (originating sample), and another tube (receiving
      sample) to receive emitted EMS and contain signalized water
      produced. The device will contain an electrically conducting coil
      linked to an external generator of alternating current having a
      variable frequency from 1 to 20,000 Hz. The device will have
      shielding means, such as mu metal &gt;=1 mm in thickness, capable
      of isolating external ambient electromagnetic signals or noise,
      enclosing a space into which will accommodate the coil and the
      containers. Any suitable material may be used to make the coil and
      the elements and design of the coil are selected based on the size
      of the samples, shielding, and other elements of the apparatus.
      One example of a coil is a copper coil with the following
      characteristics: bobbin with internal diameter 50 mm, length 80
      mm, R=3.6 ohms, 3 layers of 112 turns of copper wire, field on the
      axis to the centre 44 Oe/A, and on the edge 25 Oe/A. An example of
      shielding is a cylinder of [mu] metal having a minimal thickness
      of 1 mm, closed at both ends in a manner that completely isolates
      the enclosed containers and coil from the external ambient
      electromagnetic noise.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The following Examples describe particular embodiments of
      the invention, but the invention is not limited to what is
      described in these Examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Production of Samples Containing an EMS Signature
        Characteristic of HIV DNA</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0075] Step A:<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Synthesis of DNA by PCR<br>
      <br>
      [0077] A particular DNA sequence is first synthesized by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a DNA template, for example, a
      region of the LTR sequence present in the viral DNA extracted from
      the plasma of a HIV infected patient or obtained from a purified
      infectious DNA clone of HIV1 Lai, is amplified by PCR and nested
      PCR with respectively LTR-derived outer and inner primers.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Those were chosen to pick up some conserved regions of the
      LTR, given to several subtypes of HIV1. This amplified DNA was
      sequenced and found 100% identical to the known sequence of the
      prototype strain of HIV1 subtype B, HIV1 LAI (3). The resulting
      amplicon was determined to be 488 bp long and the nested-PCR
      amplicon to be 104 bp long.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Filtration and Dilution: A sample of each amplicon is
      prepared at a concentration of 2 ng/ml in a final volume of 1 ml
      of pure water that had been previously filtered through a sterile
      450 nM Millipore (Millex) filter and then to a 20 nM filter
      (Whatman, Anotop) to eliminate any contamination by viruses or
      bacteria. All manipulations are done under sterile atmosphere in a
      biological safety cabinet.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The DNA solution is diluted one in 100 (10&lt;-2&gt;) in 2
      ml of water and filtered through a 450 nM Millex filter
      (Millipore) and filtered again through an Anotop filter of
      porosity size 20 nM (Whatman).<br>
      <br>
      [0081] The resulting DNA filtrate (there is practically no DNA
      loss through filtration, as the DNA molecules do not bind to the
      filters), is then diluted serially 1 in 10 (0.1 ml in 0.9 ml of
      water in an Eppendorf sterile tube of 2 ml from 10&lt;-2 &gt;to
      10&lt;-15&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] A strong vortex agitation was performed at each dilution
      step for 15 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Each dilution in its stoppered plastic tube was placed on a
      coil under the ambient electromagnetic background at room
      temperature for 6 seconds; the resulting electric current is
      amplified 500 times and analyzed in a Sony laptop computer with
      specific software as previously described. The EMS positive
      vibrating dilutions (usually between 10&lt;-4 &gt;to 10&lt;-8&gt;)
      were detected not only by new peaks of frequency, but also
      quantitatively by the difference in amplitude and intensity of the
      signals measured in the software, as compared to the same
      parameters given by the background noise.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Table 1 shows the role of excitation frequency in inducing
      EMS from DNA into water. A fragment of LTR DNA (Tar region, 104
      base pairs) was amplified by PCR with specific primers from the
      entire genomic HIV1 LAI DNA cloned in a plasmid (pLAI2). The
      fragment was purified by electrophoresis on an agarose gel; the
      DNA band was then cut and extracted with a Qiagen kit. Time of
      exposure DNA tube and water tube to the exciting frequency was 18
      hrs.<br>

      [0085] Step B:<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Producing a Signalized Sample from the Originating Sample<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Tube 1 containing one of the dilutions found positive for
      EMS in step A (10&lt;-6&gt;) was placed in the vicinity of an
      identical tube 2 that had been previously filled with 1 ml of pure
      water under a separate safety cabinet different from the one
      utilized in step A for the DNA manipulation. Both tubes were
      placed inside a copper coil with the following characteristics:
      bobin with internal diameter 50 mm, length 80 mm, R=3.6 ohms, 3
      layers of 112 turns of copper wire, field on the axis to the
      centre 44 Oe/A, and on the edge 25 Oe/A, linked to an external
      generator of alternate electric current of variable frequency from
      1 to 20,000 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The tubes and the coil were enclosed in a cylinder of thick
      (1 mm) [mu]metal closed at both ends in order to isolate the
      system from the external ambient electromagnetic noise. A current
      intensity of 100 mA was applied to the coil, so that no
      significant heat was generated inside the cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The tubes were kept 18 Hrs at room temperature in an
      oscillating magnetic field strength of 25 Oe/A generated by the
      coil system. Afterwards, the signalized water of tube 2 is
      filtered on 450 nM and 20 nM filters and diluted from 10&lt;-2
      &gt;to 10&lt;-15&gt;. As a control, the tube 1 was also filtered
      and diluted in the same way. EMS analysis revealed positive
      dilutions for EMS, starting at 10&lt;-2 &gt;which is explained if
      one takes into account that the emitter tube 1 was already at the
      10&lt;-6 &gt;dilution (FIG. 1). As shown in Table 1 a minimal
      frequency of 7 Hz was found necessary and sufficient to induce the
      EMS in the naïve, unsignalized water filled tube 2. However, the
      intensity of the EMS signals was sometimes reduced by comparison
      to those found in tube 1. To determine conditions suitable for EMS
      transduction, the inventors also varied different parameters of
      the process. It was determined that the following conditions
      suppressed EMS emission from naïve tube 2 (receiving sample or
      sample to be signalized).<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Time of exposure of the two tubes less than 16-18 hrs
      (Table 2).<br>
      <br>
      [0091] No coil.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Generator of magnetic field turned off.<br>

      [0093] Frequency of excitation&lt;6 Hz.<br>

      [0094] No use of DNA in tube 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Tube 2 frozen at -80[deg.] C. overnight and defrosted
      before recording the EMS.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Tube 2 heated at 95[deg.] C. for 60 minutes after the
      overnight exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Based on the results in Table 1 and on testing of the
      process conditions and parameters it was concluded that excitation
      of tube 1 by a magnetic field of low frequency and of very low
      intensity has allowed the water nanostructures generated by the
      DNA fragment contained in this tube to be transmitted via waves to
      tube 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Step C:<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Reconstitution by PCR of the LTR DNA from the
      Nanostructures in the Receiving or Signalized Sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] A sample volume (5 [mu]l) of tube 2-signalized water was
      added to 45 [mu]l of an amplification mixture in a propylene 200
      [mu]l PCR tube (Eppendorf).<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The amplification mixture was composed of (buffer
      composition) 0.2 mM dNTP's, 10 [mu]M of each specific HIV-1 LTR
      primer containing the ingredients for synthesizing DNA, either
      from a positive dilution for EMS or in a lesser dilution, starting
      with 10&lt;-2 &gt;down to 10&lt;-10&gt;: and using 1 unit of Taq
      DNA polymerase.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] Once the first cDNA strand is synthesized, cycling of
      denaturation, annealing and polymerization steps are performed as
      usually used for the PCR amplification.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] The reaction (35 cycles, T[deg.] annealing 56[deg.] C.)
      yielded a DNA band of the size (in electrophoresis migration in
      agarose 1.5%) of the expected 104 bp sequence. This amplicon was
      then cloned in a bacterial plasmid (Topo Cloning, Invitrogen)
      which was used to transform bacterial competent cells. Plasmid
      clones were purified from isolated bacterial transformants and
      screened for the presence of the 104 bp insert by EcoRI digestion.
      Positive plasmid clones are then sequenced and the sequence of the
      insert shown to be 98% to 100% identical (difference of 2
      nucleotides) to the original DNA of tube 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] The first step of DNA synthesis using the nanostructures as
      templates can also be achieved by a reverse transcriptase (RT) and
      other more classical DNA polymerase, at lower temperature
      (42[deg.] C. for example for the reverse transcription step). HIV1
      LTR DNA D6 (EMS positive) dilution was used as emitter using
      excitation frequency of 7 Hz during 18 hours in the apparatus
      described in FIG. 1, and placed close to the water receiver Tube
      2. Like the latter, it was then diluted at 10&lt;-2&gt;,
      refiltered by 450 nM and 20 nM filters and diluted to
      10&lt;-15&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] Each dilution was then amplified by PCR for 35 cycles. Note
      the DNA bands detected at dilutions D2, (FD2), D3, D4, and D5. It
      has to be noted that the synthesis of the DNA LTR band is obtained
      in high water dilutions (up to 10&lt;-9&gt;) of the tube 2
      containing the signalized water, indicating the transmission of
      the DNA information from tube to tube, in the presence of the
      ambient electromagnetic background. The same phenomenon was also
      observed in high dilutions of tube 1, indicating the synthesis of
      DNA at dilutions containing no DNA molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] This PCR technology can be applied to the detection of
      nanostructures in body fluid (plasma, urine) apparently devoid of
      the microorganisms from which they originate. In all cases, it is
      necessary to use mechanical agitation (vortex) at each water
      dilution in addition to the ambient or controlled electromagnetic
      background.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] Table 2 shows the role of time of exposure to the 7 Hz
      frequency on EMS transmission from DNA to water. These results
      used the DNA LTR preparation as used for procedures reported in
      Table 1.<br>

      after an exposure time of 8 or 16 hrs when the originating sample
      exhibited positive EMS at dilutions of D4 to D8 (10&lt;-4 &gt;to
      10&lt;-8&gt;). No EMS was detected in water exposed for less than
      8 hrs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Identification of Unknown DNA Using Random Primers<br>
      <br>
      [0109] Another aspect of the invention is directed to a general
      procedure for the identification of any unknown DNA sequence (or
      polynucleotide sequence) capable of producing EMS in biological
      fluids. The principle is shown by FIG. 3. The transmission of EMS
      in water allows the selective transmission of only the DNA
      sequences that were emitting the EMS under the induction
      conditions. The PCR method uses a combination of random and Tag
      primers. The random primer associated with the Tag has the
      following formula 5'-GGACTGACGAATTCCAGTGACTNNNNNNNN (SEQ ID NO: 1)
      in which are made all possible combinations of 8 nucleotides for
      the 4 possible bases (65,536). A detailed procedure is described
      below.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] 1) DNA is purified from EDTA-collected human plasma
      extracted by the kit, QiaAMP, (Qiagen).<br>
      <br>
      [0111] 2) The purified DNA samples are filtered through 0.45 and
      0.1 [mu]m filters and then diluted to FD2-FD15 for analysis of
      EMS. FD2 refers to a filtered dilution of 1:100 or 10&lt;-2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] 3) The filtered and diluted samples are used to signalize
      water (molecular biology grade, 5Prime, 20 nm-filtered) with a
      dilution EMS+ of a patient DNA sample under an oscillating
      magnetic field of 7 Hz, 4V (coil in mu-metal) for 18 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] 4) Each EMS+ sample used is filtered, vortexed and diluted
      (FD2-FD5) the signalized water sample and proceed to EMS analysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] 5) The samples of signalized water (EMS+), starting with
      FD2 are used as template for PCR amplification using random and
      Tag primers, following the protocol described below:<br>
      <br>
      [0115] A 49 [mu]l PCR amplification mix containing 1* Advanced Taq
      buffer with Mg&lt;2+&gt; (available from 5Prime Co.), 200 [mu]M
      dNTPs, 20 nM of designed random primer Tag8N (SEQ ID NO: 1):<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      &nbsp; (SEQ ID NO: 2)<br>
      &nbsp; (5'-GGACTGACGAATTCCAGTGACTNNNNNNNN)<br>
      <br>
      [0116] 20 [mu]l of vortexed FD2 signalized water template, and 1
      unit of Taq DNA polymerase (available from 5Prime Co.) is
      incubated stepwise at 8[deg.] C., 15[deg.] C., 20[deg.] C.,
      25[deg.] C., 30[deg.] C., 36[deg.] C., 42[deg.] C., and 46[deg.]
      C. for 2 min at each temperature to allow annealing of the random
      portion of the primer. An elongation step at 68[deg.] C. for 2-15
      min was performed to allow synthesis of DNA, followed by a
      denaturation step at 95[deg.] C. for 3 min. One [mu]l of the
      designed primer Tag-ONLY (5'-GGACTGACGAATTCCAGTGACT) (SEQ ID NO:
      3) is added to the mixture at a final concentration of 200 nM. The
      resulting sample is subjected to 40 cycles of amplification
      (95[deg.] C./30 s, 59[deg.] C./30 s, and 70[deg.] C./2 min),
      followed by an incubation at 70[deg.] C. for 10 min. PCR-amplified
      samples are subjected to electrophoresis in 1.3% agarose gel and
      stained with ethidium bromide to allow visualization of amplified
      DNA bands under UV light.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] 6) If needed (if faint or no DNA bands a-re detected),
      sample can be reamplified by PCR using only the primer Tag-ONLY,
      following the reamplification protocol described below:<br>
      <br>
      [0118] A 50 [mu]l PCR amplification mix containing 1* Hot Start
      Taq buffer with Mg&lt;2+&gt; (available from 5Prime Co.), 200
      [mu]M dNTPs, 200 nM of designed primer Tag-ONLY
      (5'-GGACTGACGAATTCCAGTGACT) (SEQ ID NO: 3), 1-10 [mu]l of
      PCR-amplified sample as template, and 1 unit of Hot Taq DNA
      polymerase (available from 5Prime Co.) is denatured at 95[deg.] C.
      for 3 min and subjected to 25-40 cycles of amplification (95[deg.]
      C./30 s, 59[deg.] C./30 s, and 70[deg.] C./2 min), followed by an
      incubation at 70[deg.] C. for 10 min.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] 7) Isolation, purification and cloning of amplicons in
      pCR2.1-TOPO (InVitrogen) vector, followed by transformation of
      competent Escherichia coli cells, and screening for positive
      clones.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] 8) DNA sequencing of amplicons using M13 universal primers
      (Eurofins MWG GmbH, Germany) and BLAST of the resulting sequences.<br>

      [0121] Application to a patient suffering from chronic Lyme
      disease:<br>
      <br>
      [0122] A D9 (10&lt;-9&gt;) dilution of DNA extracted from the
      plasma of a patient suffering from chronic Lyme disease was
      transduced into water at an excitation frequency of 7 Hz for 18
      hrs. PCR was performed on the water sample after transduction with
      Tag8N primers followed by a second PCR with Tag primers only. The
      PCR DNA products were resolved on agarose gels by electrophoresis
      and are shown in FIG. 4. As shown at the left, results obtained
      when the tube of D9 DNA and the naive tube of water are placed
      side-by-side. At right, results obtained when the two tubes were
      placed at a distance of 4 cm from each other.<br>

      Recording and Transduction of EMS Signatures of HIV and Borrelia
      Burgdorferi<br>
      <br>
      [0129] EMS signatures of HIV DNA and Borrelia DNA sequences are
      recorded and transduced as described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] Step 1: Preparation of DNAs<br>
      <br>
      [0131] 1. A fragment of HIV DNA taken from its long terminal
      repeat (LTR) sequence present in the viral DNA extracted from the
      plasma of a HIV-infected patient or obtained from a purified
      infectious DNA clone of HIV1 Lai, is amplified by PCR (487 base
      pairs) and nested PCR (104 base pairs) using specific primers: TR
      InS 5'-GCCTGTACTGGGTCTCT (SEQ ID NO: 4) and LTR InAS
      5'-AAGCACTCAAGGCAAGCTTTA (SEQ ID NO: 5). A longer variant (300 bp)
      is obtained using the following primer: 5'-TGTTAGAGTGGAGGTTTGACA
      (SEQ ID NO: 6) in conjunction with the above primer InAS.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] 2. A DNA sequence from Borrelia Burgdorferi, the agent of
      Lyme disease, is amplified by PCR (907 base pairs) and nested PCR
      (499 base pairs) with respectively Borrelia 16S outer and inner
      primers. Inner BORR16S inS 5'-CAATCYGGACTGAGACCTGC (SEQ ID NO: 7)
      and BORR16S inAS 5'-ACGCTGTAAACGATGCACAC (SEQ ID NO: 8). A shorter
      variant of 395 bp is obtained by using the following primer:
      5'-GACGTCATCCTCACCTTCCT (SEQ ID NO: 9) in conjunction with the
      above primer inAS.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] Step 2: Signal Recording<br>
      <br>
      [0134] The resulting amplicons 104 bp and 300 bp for LTR and 499
      bp and 395 bp for Borrelia were prepared at a concentration of 2
      ng/ml in a final volume of 1 ml of DNAse/RNAse-free distilled
      water. The samples were read on an electromagnetic coil, connected
      to a Sound Blaster card (Creative Labs) itself connected to a
      microcomputer, (preferably Sony VGN-CS31) preferentially powered
      by its 12 volt battery. Each emission is recorded for 6 seconds,
      amplified 500 times and the digital file is saved, for example
      under the form of a sound file with the .wav format. This file can
      later undergo digital processing, by a specific software, Matlab
      (Mathworks), as for example digital amplification for calibrating
      the signal level, filtering for eliminating unwanted frequencies,
      or be analyzed by transformation into its spectrum by a discrete
      Fourier transform, preferably by the algorithm of FFT "Fast
      Fourier Transform".<br>
      <br>
      [0135] Step 3: Signal Transduction in Water:<br>
      <br>
      [0136] For transduction, the digital signal was converted by the
      digital/analog converter of the sound card into an analog signal.
      The output of the sound card of the microcomputer was linked to
      the input of a commercial amplifier (Kool Sound SX-250,
      www._conrad.com) having the following characteristics: passband
      from 10 Hz to 20 kHz, gain 1 to 20, input sensitivity 250 mV,
      output power RMS 140 W under 8 ohms.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] The output of the amplifier was connected to a transducer
      solenoid which has the following characteristics: the bobbin has a
      length of 120 mm, an internal diameter of 25 mm, an external
      diameter of 28 mm, with 3 layers of 631 spirals of copper wire of
      0.5 mm diameter and a resistance of 8 ohms, field on the axis to
      the centre 44 Oe/A, and on the edge 25 Oe/A. A measurement of 4.4
      milliTesla (mT) was obtained when current, voltage and resistance
      were respectively, 100 mA, 4V and 8 ohms.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] 50 ml of DNAse/RNAse-free distilled water (5-Prime Ref
      2500010) are filtered first through a sterile 450 nM filter
      (Millex, Millipore, Cat N[deg.] SLHV033RS) and then to a 20 nM
      filter (Whatman, Anotop 25, Cat N[deg.] 6809-2002). For
      transduction, 1 ml of this filtered water in a Eppendorf sterile
      tube of 1.5 ml was placed at the center of the solenoid, itself
      installed at room temperature on an isolated (non metal) working
      bench. Alternatively, a sterile tube of 15 ml (Falcon-Becton
      Dickinson), filled with the filtered water can be used instead of
      the 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] The modulated electric current produced by the amplifier
      was applied to the transducer coil for 1 hr at the tension of 4
      Volts. A current intensity of 100 mA was applied to the coil, so
      that no significant heat was generated inside the cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] Step 4: Reconstitution by PCR of the DNA from the
      Signalized Water.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] The water which has received the recorded specific signal
      is called "signalized water". The signalized water (kept in the
      same tube) was first agitated by strong vortex for 15 seconds at
      room temperature and then diluted 1/100 in non signalized
      DNAse/RNAse-free distilled water (30 [mu]l/3 ml). 1 ml was kept
      for control (NF, nonfiltered), the 2 mls remaining of signalized
      water were filtered through a sterile 450 nM filter and then
      through a 100 nM (Millex, Millipore, Cat N[deg.] SLVV033RS) for
      Borrelia DNA or 20 nM filter (Whatman, notop25) for HIV DNA. The
      filtrate was then diluted serially 1 in 10 (0.1 ml in 0.9 ml of
      DNAse/RNAse-free distilled water) in a Eppendorf sterile tube of
      1.5 ml from 10&lt;-2 &gt;to 10&lt;-15 &gt;(D2 to D15). A strong
      vortex agitation was performed at each dilution step for 15
      seconds. 5 [mu]l of each dilution is added to 45 [mu]l of the mix.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] 1. Preparation of the mix for HIV LTR: The PCR mixture (50
      [mu]l) contained 37.4 [mu]l of DNAse/RNAse-Free distilled water, 5
      [mu]l of 10* Taq PCR buffer, 0.4 [mu]l of 25 mM dNTPs, 1 [mu]l of
      50 [mu]M each appropriate primer Inner [LTR InS
      (5'-GCCTGTACTGGGTCTCT) (SEQ ID NO: 10) and LTR InAS
      (5'-AAGCACTCAAGGCAAGCTTTA) (SEQ ID NO: 11)], 0.2 [mu]l of 5
      U/[mu]l Taq DNA Polymerase and 5 [mu]l of each dilution. The PCR
      was performed with the mastercycler ep (Eppendorf). The PCR
      mixtures were pre-heated at 68[deg.] C. for 3 min (elongation
      step), followed by 40 PCR cycles of amplification (95[deg.] C. for
      30 s; 56[deg.] C. for 30 s; 70[deg.] C. for 30 sec). A final
      extension step was performed at 70[deg.] C. for 10 min.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] 2. Preparation of the mix for Borrelia: The PCR mixture (50
      [mu]l) contained 37.4 [mu]l of DNAse/RNAse-Free distilled water, 5
      [mu]l of 10* Taq PCR buffer, 0.4 [mu]l of 25 mM dNTPs, 1 [mu]l of
      50 [mu]M each appropriate primer Inner [BORR16S inS
      (5'-CAATCYGGACTGAGACCTGC) (SEQ ID NO: 7) and BORR16S inAS
      (5'-ACGCTGTAAACGATGCACAC) (SEQ ID NO: 8)], 0.2 [mu]l of 5 U/[mu]l
      Taq DNA polymerase and 5 [mu]l of each dilution. The PCR was
      performed with the mastercycler ep (Eppendorf). The PCR mixtures
      were pre-heated at 68[deg.] C. for 3 min (elongation step),
      followed by 40 PCR cycles of amplification (95[deg.] C. for 30 s;
      61[deg.] C. for 30 s; 70[deg.] C. for 1 min). A final extension
      step was performed at 70[deg.] C. for 10 min.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] Electrophoresis of the PCR products in 1.5% agarose gel: A
      band of 104 bp for HIV LTR and a band of 499 bp Borrelia DNA
      should be detected at several dilutions.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] 3. Sequencing: The DNA bands are cut and DNA is extracted
      using a Qiagen kit which also describes classical conditions for
      cloning in E. coli. The amplified specific DNA is then sequenced
      to show its identity to the original DNA.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span><br>
      <br>
      [0001] This invention has for object to reveal latent infections
      in humans and animals, by showing inhibition, through the
      examinee, of electromagnetic signals generated by a microorganism.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] From the works by Dr. Jacques BENVENISTE and from patent
      application WO 00/17637, it has been known how to record and
      digitalize, after analog-to-digital conversion using a computer
      sound board, an electrical signal characteristic of a molecule
      possessing a biological activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Also known in prior art (WO 09417406) is a process and a
      device used to transmit biological activity from a first matter,
      so-called carrier, to a second matter, so-called target, the
      latter exempted of any traces from said carrier and physically
      separate from it, and the target not presenting initially the
      aforementioned biological activity. The method consists in (i)
      exposing the matter carrying the biological activity of interest
      to an electrical or electromagnetic signal sensor, (ii) amplifying
      said electromagnetic or electrical signals characteristic of the
      emitted biological activity feature, then (iii) exposing the
      target matter to an emitter of electrical or electromagnetic
      signals, said emitter being connected to aforesaid sensor through
      a transmission and amplification circuit, in order to transmit the
      signal characteristic of biological activity to said target.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In a previous French patent application 05/12686 filed on
      Dec. 14, 2005, not yet issued to this day, the inventor of this
      invention was describing a process for characterizing biochemical
      elements presenting a biological activity, microorganisms in this
      case, by analyzing low frequency electromagnetic signals, said
      process bringing improvements to prior art techniques. Said
      process also relates to biological analysis consisting in
      recording the electromagnetic or electrical "signatures"
      corresponding to known biochemical elements, and to compare such
      pre-recorded "signatures" to that of a biochemical element to be
      characterized. Said process implicates filtration and dilution
      steps in order to eliminate microorganisms and cells present
      within the original sample, the highest dilutions generating the
      most electrical or electromagnetic signals whereas the least
      diluted samples don't provide, most of the time, any electrical or
      electromagnetic signals. The inventor also showed that
      microorganisms of different nature, such as bacteria and viruses,
      produce "nanostructures" that persist in aqueous solutions, and
      that these very "nanostructures" are emitting electromagnetic
      signals. Said "nanostructures" behaves like polymers of a size
      less than 0.02 [mu]m for viruses, and less than 0.1/[mu]m for
      classic size bacteria, and present a density ranging from 1.12 and
      1.30 g/ml.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The process described in this application is based on the
      astonishing observation that in absence of physical contact, the
      mere vicinity of a closed tube containing a sample of a bacterial
      or viral filtrate, little diluted and negative with regard to
      electrical or electromagnetic emitting signals, inhibits the
      signals produced by a more diluted sample of the same filtrate,
      initially positive with regard to electrical or electromagnetic
      signal emission. In this application, such inhibition will be
      indistinctly called "inhibitory effect" or "negativing effect". In
      the same way, in this application, to "inhibit" and "negativate"
      will be used indistinctly and have a similar meaning. This
      observation led the inventor to search for the same inhibitory
      phenomenon from an infected human being. It has been observed, in
      a patient suffering from an auto-immune microvascularitis of
      infectious origin, that the diluted samples of his plasma had an
      inhibitory effect on dilute filtrates of E. coli emitting
      electromagnetic signals (hereafter EMS), suggesting that the
      patient was suffering from a chronic infection by this or a
      related germ. It was also shown that the patient suffering from
      microvascularitis, as mentioned in the previous example, himself
      inhibits the EMS emitted by his filtered and diluted plasma, and
      also inhibits the EMS emitted by a filtered and diluted sample of
      E. coli culture present in a closed tube. In this case, a 5
      minutes contact of a positive dilution in the patient's hand, or
      10 minutes at a distance of up to 50 cm, are sufficient to observe
      said inhibitory effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Said inhibitory power thus involves both the emitting
      structures from one own plasma, and those of a specific bacterial
      germ, which could thus be used as a universal identification
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The invention may therefore enable to determine a bacterial
      or viral origin in illnesses where such germs have not been
      identified.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] A first object of the invention concerns a method for
      preparing reagents to be used in a test for detecting a
      microorganism and notably an infection in humans or animals.
      According to its most general acception, the method includes the
      following steps:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] a) Centrifuging a biological or artificial liquid medium
      containing a selected specific microorganism;<br>
      <br>
      b) Filtrating the supernatant obtained at step (a);<br>
      <br>
      c) Preparing a series of diluted samples corresponding to
      increasing dilutions of the filtrate obtained in step (b), down to
      a filtrate dilution factor of at least 10&lt;-15&gt;;<br>
      <br>
      d) Submitting the diluted samples obtained in step (c) to an
      electrical, magnetic and/or electromagnetic exciting field;<br>
      <br>
      e) Analyzing the electrical signals detected using a solenoid and
      recording digitally aforesaid electrical signal, after
      analog/digital conversion of aforesaid signal;<br>
      <br>
      f) Selecting diluted samples from which the characteristic
      electrical signals were obtained in (e), by characteristic signals
      one means signals whose amplitude is at least 1.5 times greater
      than background noise emitted by water, and/or presenting a
      frequency displacement towards higher values;<br>
      <br>
      g) Introducing the diluted samples selected in step (f) in
      protective enclosures, which protect said dilutions from very low
      frequency external electromagnetic fields;<br>
      <br>
      h) Distributing one of aforesaid diluted samples from step (g),
      volume by volume, in two tubes, T1 and T2, with T1 remaining in a
      protective enclosure protecting said diluted samples from external
      electromagnetic field interferences, said tube T1 acting as a
      reference solution, while tube T2, also placed in a protective
      enclosure, is subsequently being subjected to the presence or
      contact of a sample suspected of containing said selected specific
      microorganism.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] By "a sample to be tested for presence or absence of
      aforesaid selected specific microorganism" one means: (i) a human
      or animal individual suspected to be infected by aforesaid
      selected specific microorganism, or (ii) a biological specimen or
      a biological or artificial fluid suspected of containing said
      selected specific microorganism, or (iii) a food component, a
      cosmetic, or a pharmaceutical composition susceptible to contain
      said selected specific microorganism.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] By biological fluids, one means any human or animal fluid,
      e.g. blood, urine, various secretions. By artificial fluid, one
      means any reconstituted fluid for growing microorganisms, e.g.
      various culture media for bacteria, yeasts, and molds, and culture
      media for cells infected by a virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Another object of the invention concerns a system for
      detecting a microorganism within a sample. This system includes:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] a) A tube T1 containing a reference sample emitting
      characteristic electrical signals, by characteristic signals one
      means signals whose amplitude is at least 1.5 times greater than
      background noise emitted by water, and/or presenting a frequency
      displacement towards higher values;<br>
      <br>
      b) A tube T2 containing a sample emitting characteristic
      electromagnetic signal, said sample being identical to that
      contained in tube T1;<br>
      <br>
      c) A protective enclosure for protecting tubes T1 and T2 against
      very low frequency external electromagnetic fields;<br>
      <br>
      d) A tube T3 containing a control solution not presenting
      electromagnetic signal emission;<br>
      <br>
      e) An equipment for receiving electromagnetic signals.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] During detection, tube T2 will be subjected to the presence
      or contact of sample X to be tested for presence or absence of a
      selected specific microorganism.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Another object of the invention concerns a method for
      detecting a microorganism within a sample, characterized in that
      said method consists of the following steps:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] a) A sample X, for which the presence of a suspected
      microorganism, e.g. E. coli, is to be established, is exposed to a
      sample as obtained after step (f) of the process according to one
      of claims 1 to 3, said sample obtained after step (f) being a
      dilution of a culture or biological medium filtrate containing
      said microorganism suspected to be present in sample X;<br>
      <br>
      b) Comparing the electromagnetic signal emitted by sample X
      exposed to said sample obtained after step (f), obtained in step
      (a), with the electromagnetic signal emitted by an aliquot of the
      same sample obtained after step (f) and not submitted to sample X.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] By "a sample X", one means (i) a human individual or animal
      suspected of being infected by aforesaid selected specific
      microorganism, or (ii) a biological specimen, or a biological or
      artificial fluid, suspected to contain said selected specific
      microorganism, or (iii) a food component, cosmetic, or
      pharmaceutical composition susceptible to contain said selected
      specific microorganism.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The methods according to the invention enable (i) to
      prepare reagents intended for a test to detect microorganisms
      implicated in chronic illnesses, and/or intended to detect
      systemic latent infections under circumstances where a quick and
      non invasive response is required, as it is in the case of e.g.
      avian flu virus detection, (ii) the identification of an infection

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A Lightly Dilute Bacterial
        Culture, not Emitting Electromagnetic Signals, "Negates" the
        Electromagnetic Signals Emitted by a Strong Dilution from the
        Same Culture</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1) Sample Preparation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0019] An Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria culture in LB (Luria
      broth) medium is centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 minutes in order
      to eliminate the cells. The bacterial supernatant is then filtered
      on a 0.45 [mu]m porosity PEVD Millipore filter, and the filtrate
      is then again filtered on a 0.1 [mu]m porosity Millipore filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] From the resulting E. coli culture filtrate, which is
      completely sterile, one prepares a series of samples by diluting
      the filtrate from 10 to 10 into water down to 10&lt;-15 &gt;for
      injectable preparation. The successive dilutions are strongly
      agitated with a vortex for 15 seconds between each dilution.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The diluted samples are distributed in 1.5 ml Eppendorf
      conic plastic tubes. The fluid volume is in general of 1
      milliliter.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0000] 2) Selection of Diluted
        Samples Generating Electromagnetic signals.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0022] Each dilute sample is tested for emission of low frequency
      electromagnetic signals.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The procedure for detecting EMS includes a step aimed at
      transforming the electromagnetic field from various diluted
      samples into one signal, namely an electrical signal, using a
      solenoid for capturing said electromagnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The transformation of the electromagnetic field coming from
      the diluted sample analyzed into an electrical signal is done as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] (i) Submitting the dilute sample being checked to an
      electrical, magnetic and/or electromagnetic exciting field;<br>
      <br>
      (ii) Analyzing the electrical signals detected using a solenoid
      and digitally recording aforesaid electrical signal after
      analog/digital conversion of said signal;<br>
      <br>
      (iii) Selecting the diluted samples generating characteristic
      electrical signals, by 'characteristic' one means signals whose
      amplitude is at least 1.5 times greater than background noise
      signals emitted by water and/or presenting a frequency
      displacement towards higher values, and placing them in Mumétal(R)
      protective enclosures for protecting said diluted samples against
      external electromagnetic field interferences.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Signal detection is carried out using the equipment
      schematically represented in FIG. 1. The equipment consists of a
      solenoid reading cell (1) sensitive from 0 to 20000 hertz, placed
      on a table made of insulating material. Said solenoid used in step
      (ii) includes a winding comprising a soft iron core. Said winding
      has an impedance of 300 ohms, an inside diameter of 6 mm, an
      outside diameter of 16 mm, and a length of 6 mm. The magnetic soft
      iron core is placed in contact with the external walls of the tube
      containing the dilution to be analyzed.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The diluted samples to be read are distributed in 1.5 ml
      Eppendorf (trade mark) conic plastic tubes (2). The fluid volume
      is in general of 1 milliliter.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Characteristic electrical signal acquisition is performed
      for a preset duration, i.e. ranging from 1 to 60s. In this
      example, each sample is read twice successively for 6 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The electrical signals delivered by the solenoid are
      amplified and converted into analog-digital signals using a signal
      acquisition board (sound card) (4) including a computer-built-in
      analog-to-digital converter (3). Said analog-to-digital converter
      has twice the sampling rate of the maximal frequency that one
      wants to digitalize, e.g. 44 kHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The digital file corresponding to said converted electrical
      signal is saved on a mass storage, e.g. as a WAV format audio
      file.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] For processing the characteristic electrical signal, one
      uses e.g. Matlabs and SigViews (trademarks) software. The recorded
      digital file may possibly undergo digital processing, i.e. digital
      amplification for calibrating the signal level, filtering for
      eliminating undesired frequencies, calculating spectral power
      distribution (SPD), then such spectral power is truncated, e.g.
      only keeping frequency bands from 140 Hz to 20 kHz (Matlab), or is
      transformed in frequency components by Fourier transform
      (SigView).<br>
      <br>
      3) Evaluating the Inhibitory Activity of a Non-Emitting Low
      Dilution on the Emission of Electromagnetic Signals Generated by
      an Active Dilution.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The diluted samples presenting characteristic electrical
      signals are samples diluted to 10&lt;-8&gt;, 10&lt;-9&gt;,
      10&lt;-10&gt;. The 10&lt;-2 &gt;to 10&lt;-6 &gt;dilutions are
      negative (FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      [0032] A closed tube containing a 10&lt;-3 &gt;dilution aliquot of
      E. coli is placed side by side with a closed tube containing a
      10&lt;-8 &gt;diluted sample aliquot of E. coli, in an enclosure
      surrounded by a Mumétal(R) magnetic shield, and left 24 hours at
      room temperature. In parallel, a control series is realized. This
      control series consists of one tube containing a 10&lt;-3
      &gt;diluted sample aliquot of E. coli, and of another containing a
      10&lt;-8 &gt;diluted sample aliquot of E. coli that is processed
      in the same way, but in separate Mumétal(R) enclosures distant
      from one another. The placement in a Mumétal(R) enclosure
      eliminates very low active frequencies (5 to 100 Hertz) but not
      higher frequencies that could come from ambient electromagnetic
      noise.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] After 24 hours, the tubes containing the diluted samples
      are again analyzed as describes above, revealing that the tube
      containing a 10&lt;-8 &gt;diluted sample aliquot and coupled to
      the tube containing a 10&lt;-3 &gt;diluted sample aliquot, no
      longer emits any electromagnetic signals, or much weaker ones. On
      the other hand, the control series tubes remained identical; the
      tube containing a 10&lt;-8 &gt;diluted sample aliquot protected
      from contact with the tube containing a 10&lt;-3 &gt;diluted
      sample aliquot remained positive for electromagnetic signal
      emission.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] An important particularity of the invention is that the
      observed negating effect is specific, i.e. the lightly diluted,
      non-emitting sample and the greatly diluted electromagnetic
      signal-emitting sample must come from the same microorganism
      species.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Thus, the diluted E. coli-emitting samples are only
      "negated" by a weakly diluted non-emitting E. coli sample, but not
      by a lightly diluted non-emitting Streptococcus or Staphylococcus
      sample. Similarly, a diluted emitting Staphylococcus sample is
      only "negated" by a lightly diluted non-emitting sample of
      Staphylococcus and not by a lightly diluted non-emitting sample of
      Streptococcus or E. coli.<br>

        Artificial Fluid Samples Containing Microorganisms.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0036] A blood sample, collected with anticoagulant, preferably
      heparin, from a patient suffering from a neurological pathology
      consecutive to a bacterial infection, and an Escherichia coli (E.
      coli) bacteria K1 culture in suspension in LB (Luria broth) medium
      are centrifuged in order to eliminate the cells. The bacterial
      supernatant and/or the plasma collected are then diluted to
      10&lt;-2 &gt;in RPMI medium. The solutions are filtered on
      0.45[mu] Millipore PEVD filter, then the filtrate is again
      filtered on 0.02 [mu]m Whatman or 0.1 [mu]m Millipore filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] From the plasma filtrates of infected individual and from
      the E. coli K1 culture, one prepares a series of diluted samples
      corresponding to increasing dilution levels, up to 10&lt;-15&gt;,
      in 10 to 10 dilutions in water for injectable preparation under
      laminar flow hood. The successive dilutions are strongly agitated
      with a vortex for 15 seconds between each dilution.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The diluted samples are then distributed in 1.5 ml conic
      Eppendorf plastic tubes. The fluid volume is in general of 1
      milliliter.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2) Selection of Diluted Samples
        Generating Electromagnetic Signals.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0039] The selection of the diluted samples emitting
      characteristic signals, signals whose amplitude is at least 1.5
      times greater than the background noise signals and/or are of a
      frequency higher than background noise, is realized identically to
      what is described above in example 1, chapter 2. The method
      described as well as the material are identical to what is
      described above. Thus, the method includes a step for transforming
      the electromagnetic field from different dilutions into a signal,
      namely an electrical signal, by means of a solenoid capturing said
      electromagnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The transformation of the electromagnetic field from the
      analyzed dilution into an electrical signal is done by:<br>
      <br>
      (i) Submitting the diluted sample being checked to an electrical,
      magnetic and/or electromagnetic exciting field;<br>
      <br>
      (ii) Analyzing the electrical signals detected using a solenoid,
      and digitally recording said electrical signal after
      analog/digital conversion of aforesaid signal;<br>
      <br>
      (iii) Selecting the diluted samples presenting characteristic
      electrical signals, by 'characteristic' one means signals whose
      amplitude is at least 1.5 times greater than background noise
      signals emitted by water, and/or presenting a frequency
      displacement towards higher values, and placing them in protective
      enclosures for protecting said diluted samples against external
      electromagnetic field interferences.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">3) Evaluating an Infected
        Individual's Inhibitory Activity on the Electromagnetic Signal
        Emission Generated by a Microorganism.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0044] The diluted samples selected at the previous step (item
      (iii)), from the plasma filtrate of the infected individual, from
      E. coli culture filtrate, i.e. the dilutions of filtered sample
      presenting a characteristic electrical signal, are distributed in
      Eppendorfs plastic tubes, at a rate of 1 ml per tube, and stored
      at +4[deg.] C. The diluted EMS emitting samples distributed in
      aliquots are protected from external influences by being placed in
      an enclosure protected from electromagnetic fields. Preferably,
      the enclosure is surrounded with a magnetic shield made of
      Mumétal(R), isolating the enclosure from very low frequency
      parasitic fields coming from the surroundings.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] One of the diluted EMS emitting samples from the plasma
      filtrate of the infected individual, from E. coli culture
      filtrate, is distributed volume to volume in two tubes, T1 and T2,
      with T1 remaining in a protective enclosure protecting said
      diluted samples from external electromagnetic field interferences,
      that tube will act as reference solution; tube T2 will be
      subsequently subjected to the patient and is also placed in a
      protective enclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Said protective enclosure being preferably surrounded with
      a Mumétal(R) shield.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIG. 2</span> represents
      schematically the steps to take when searching for the inhibitory
      effect. The search of the inhibitory effect is realized as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="fig2.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      a) Tube T1, containing the reference solution, remains in an
      enclosure (3) surrounded by a Mumétal(R) magnetic shield, said
      tube T1 is thus protected from potential changes of the individual
      to be examined (4), whereas tube T2 is submitted to the influence
      of the infected individual to be examined (4) whose plasma present
      in tubes T1 and T2 comes from, said individual holds T2 in his/her
      hand (5) for a set period of time, e.g. 5 minutes;<br>
      <br>
      b) Tube T2 is placed in an electromagnetic signal reception
      equipment, preferably a reading solenoid cell as described
      previously in chapter 2 of this example;<br>
      <br>
      c) Electrical signals are then amplified, processed, converted
      into analog-digital signals as previously described in chapter 2;<br>
      <br>
      d) Said analog-digital signals are possibly decomposed in
      harmonics by Fourrier transform.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The signals corresponding to tube T1 and those
      corresponding to tube T2, as well as the signals corresponding to
      water containing tube T3 (background noises) are compared.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The following figures represent the results obtained in the
      case where the active dilution comes from the examined infected
      individual plasma:<br>

      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="fig8.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      [0060] The analysis by 3 dimensions histogram, respectively for
      background noise (FIG. 3) and for the signal obtained with tube T1
      present and containing the EMS emitting reference solution (FIG.
      4), shows a displacement towards higher frequencies. On the other
      hand, when analyzing tube T2 containing the solution submitted to
      the influence of the individual to be examined (FIG. 5), no
      displacement toward higher frequencies is noted; the 3D histogram
      representing the signals of tube T2 is analogous to that obtained
      for background noise.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Fourier analysis of the positive frequencies generated by
      tube 1 (FIG. 7) revealed peaks at various frequencies. By
      decreasing order of signal intensity, the following frequencies
      presented signals: 1000, 2000, 3000, 4100, 5100 and 5500. On the
      other hand, Fourier analysis of tube T2 reveals results analogous
      to those obtained by background noise analysis: no significant
      peak was observed for background noise or for tube T2.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In conclusion, these analyses enable to deduct that the
      individual examined has a capacity for inhibiting electromagnetic
      signals emitted by a dilution of his/her own plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Analogous results were obtained with the reference
      solution, derived from K1 E. coli.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Therefore, this inhibitory capacity concerns not only
      his/her own plasma but also E. coli emitting structures,
      suggesting that the individual is infected by an agent producing
      nanostructures close to those of E. coli.<br>
