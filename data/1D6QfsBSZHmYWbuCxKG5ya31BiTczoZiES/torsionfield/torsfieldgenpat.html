      operating element with the body cavity structure, equipped with
      the modulators.<br>
      [0003]<br>
      <br>
      This hub allows you to create wave radiation, but the means for
      focusing the generated radiation are missing.<br>
      [0004]<br>
      <br>
      The invention allows to form wave radiation, followed by focusing
      it flow in a particular area, which increases its effectiveness.<br>
      [0005]<br>
      <br>
      This is achieved in that the hub of the field that contains the
      operating element with the body in the form of a cavity structure,
      equipped with modulators, abdominal structure is in the form of a
      dodecahedron, combined with the pyramid.<br>
      [0006]<br>
      <br>
      Concentrator characterized in that the modulator is made of a
      ferromagnetic material.<br>
      [0007]<br>
      <br>
      Concentrator characterized in that the modulator is provided with
      a drive.<br>
      [0008]<br>
      <br>
      Concentrator characterized in that the drive is installed outside
      the housing and is connected to the modulator torsion shaft.<br>
      [0009]<br>
      <br>

      annular electromagnetic field generator.<br>
      [0010]<br>
      <br>
      Concentrator characterized in that the static modulator is
      designed as a vacuum areas such as light bulbs.<br>
      [0011]<br>

      with the possibility of its active element, such as an IR emitter.<br>
      [0012]<br>
      <br>

      cross shape, for example of silver.<br>
      [0013]<br>
      <br>
      Concentrator characterized in that the working body member is made
      of a dielectric material, such as dry cedar, wherein at least one

      modulators placed inside the shield made of, for example, in the
      form of ovoids.<br>
      [0015]<br>
      <br>
      The curved surface of the cavity structure provides the imposition
      of de Broglie waves inherent in the surface of any body (see. Eg,
      GI Shipov "Theory of physical vacuum", M., NT-Center, 1993) and
      forms a standing wave maxima of the increased total energy .<br>
      <br>
      In this case the abdominal shape in the form of a source
      dodecahedrons wave radiation, and ferromagnetic provide magnetic
      modulators "pumping" and forming a directional flow of energy
      (see., E.g., H.Alven "Space plasma", M., 1983).<br>
      [0016]<br>
      <br>
      By combining cavity structures with different types of modulators
      (ferromagnetic, minerals, vacuum areas cruciform shape, biological
      objects, IR emitters, laser, microwave radiators, a gas burner,
      etc.) Hub provides cumulative effect of the above fields and
      sources Radiation treatment to the object.<br>
      <br>
      Impact focuses pyramid and performed during the activation, or
      disintegration, which is determined by the direction of rotation
      of the field in the concentrator (respectively "right" and "left"
      rotation).<br>
      [0017]<br>
      <br>
      The screen in the form of ovoid is a carrier of energy and battery
      with a pronounced maximum field strength in the narrow part of the
      ovoid (see., Eg, TE Gonikman "philosophy stone", "Santana", Minsk,
      1997).<br>
      [0018]<br>
      <br>
      Performing the working body member cedar (i.e. energetically
      active material) from the perforated surface at least one of the
      faces of cavity structure coupled with its mirrored surface
      opposite face provides additional modulation field at the output
      of the concentrator.<br>
      [0019]<br>
      <br>
      Placing all elements of the hub inside the screen provides
      Ecodefence the surrounding area from the effects of radiation, as
      well as improving the efficiency of the hub by reducing external
      losses.<br>
      <br>
      Removal of the drive dynamic modulator of the body with the use of
      a torsion shaft to drive the modulator to eliminate the creation
      of internal interference.<br>

      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      [0001]<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to the problem of obtaining new sources of
      energy and can be used in medicine, agriculture,
      telecommunications, bioinformatics, and so on. D.<br>
      [0002]<br>
      <br>
      One class of natural sources of torsion fields along with
      electromagnetic fields is a wide range of shapes, formed by
      various substances [1].<br>
      According to the model of the physical vacuum Akimov AE, Tarasenko
      V. Ya can assume that the response to the topological disturbance
      of the physical vacuum is a redistribution of the torsional
      potential in the vicinity of the body, which compensates for this
      disturbance.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, in a neighborhood of the body of the linear
      distortion of the spatial structure of the physical vacuum is
      offset by redistribution said torsion potentials, so that with
      respect to the outer space of the neighborhood is an internal body
      samokompensirovannoy area [2].<br>
      [0003]<br>
      <br>
      Known chronal (torsion) generator formed by a wooden frame in the
      form of 16-sided regular polygon of about 3 m with four
      electrodes, to which a DC voltage from 60 kV to 300 kV. [3]<br>
      This device reduces its mass due to repulsion from the ground, it
      chronal (torsion) field accelerates the chemical reaction, reduces
      fuel consumption in an internal combustion engine almost twice
      that increases the growth rate of plants and their size by 2 - 10
      times, and generates a lot of other interesting effects [3 ].<br>
      [0004]<br>
      <br>
      It is known that the radiation power of torsion associated with
      the size of the form.<br>
      <br>
      At larger sizes and shapes concentrates more power radiation [1].<br>
      <br>
      For example, the power chronal radiation in a giant pyramid of
      Cheops is much more than its models, smaller properties are used
      for the storage of perishable products, maintaining the sharpness
      of razors and razor blades. [4]<br>
      [0005]<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of the invention - increase the capacity of the
      torsion radiation.<br>
      [0006]<br>
      <br>
      The goal is achieved as follows.<br>
      [0007]<br>
      <br>
      A set of emitters of electromagnetic waves of the same frequency
      with a narrow radiation pattern is placed in all the tops of the
      geometrical shape, which is the source of torsion (chronal)
      radiation.<br>
      Emitters with a narrow beam pattern are arranged so that at any
      given time point identical phases of electromagnetic waves from
      them is a vertex of the original shape - the radiation source.<br>
      [0008]<br>
      <br>
      As an example, consider the torsional oscillator formed 5th
      directional source of electromagnetic waves with a narrow
      radiation pattern arranged at the vertices of a regular pyramid
      whose base is a square with the following relations (see. Figure).<br>
      [0009]<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      In the drawings: U1, U2, U3, U4, U5 - directed emitters; A, B, C,
      D, E - the vertex of the pyramid, which are emitters; A ', B', C
      ', D', E '- points of different phases of the EM wave through time
      t.<br>
      [0010]<br>
      <br>
      h = 0,63a, l = 0,95a (1), where h - height; l - lateral edge; a -
      at the bottom side of a square pyramid.<br>
      <br>
      Let aimed radiators are excited in phase and oriented in space in
      such a way that the transmission point of the same phase of the
      electromagnetic waves on the directions of the maximum
      transmission power of the emitters at each time form a pyramid,
      which is valid for the edges of (1).<br>
      <br>
      Chance pulse mode torsion generator when directed emitters
      simultaneously emit pulses of electromagnetic field.<br>
      [0011]<br>
      <br>
      The effectiveness of the proposed solution can be explained as
      follows.<br>
      <br>
      In the propagation of electromagnetic waves from emitters in the
      medium with speed V the geometric dimensions of the pyramid will
      be increasing all the time and thus will increase the power of
      torsion radiation while increasing the space in which to
      accumulate torsion (chronal) energy.<br>
      [0012]<br>
      <br>
      Application of the torsion oscillator depends on the information
      that will be incorporated into the torsion radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Possible application areas: communications, agriculture, various
      processes, medicine.<br>

      The Newtonian mechanics to define the nature of the particles of
      the substance was dominated by the classical science, the nature
      of the substance as quantum mechanics and relativity theory
      established before and after the 1900 found that particles as well
      as waves also can understand.<br>
      <br>
      For example, it was understandable that could not touch the energy
      E = mc2 energy is converted into substances that can be touched by
      the expression of.<br>
      <br>
      The position x and momentum p of the particle by the Heisenberg
      uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, the base will have a
      value that is not confirmed at the same time subject to
      restrictions from one another by both the uncertainty (?x?p=h / 2p
      (h is Planck constant)) This material and non-material particle
      wave was able to separate targets that can not be called new
      thinking as understanding.<br>
      From this space is made of material with a non-material, material
      it can be accepted as a fact is apparent that the energy can be
      converted to the non-substance.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, Russia 1990 seconds scientist Dr. GIShipov (1998 US
      Electric Association (American Biographic Institute) selected 500
      of the most influential leaders in the crazy in the 20th century
      by a) find that the energy handaraneun response to any particular
      geometric shape, The energy field was the force of the third
      non-gravity or an electromagnetic force, that was named LA
      tosyeonjang (torsion field) or space energy (sapce energy).<br>
      <br>
      Tosyeonjang (space energy), all materials as well as the rotating
      electric or magnetic, and the resonance effect of the means of
      mutual influence, or light that results in rotation of the
      biomolecule.<br>
      <br>
      This space is very weak energy but which is filled in the space,
      measuring the electromagnetic field existing in a very weak
      because it is not measured.<br>
      <br>
      However, its presence has been confirmed by the space and the
      electromagnetic field energy in the material leaving traces
      (interference).<br>
      <br>
      This space energy is applied to medicine, new treatments and new
      discipline called quantum medicine is the emergence, in developed
      countries such as the United States or France, is the situation in
      the energy space and the tremendous support research in order to
      study the effect in vivo .<br>

      energy translating, research and development is to be used for the
      real spatial energy (tosyeonjang) caused by the specific geometry
      of the situation is going on in full in many countries.<br>

      energy eungpok eungpok emission device as shown in the graph
      below, the size of the tumor was confirmed that very small
      compared to the control group.<br>
      <br>
      As identified in the above chart, standing, in the case of the
      spatial energy drink to be treated rats (Life energy), as compared
      to normal drinking water in rats (control) was the size of the
      tumor to determine the smaller, from which space can be energy
      treatment you can see that the in vivo anti-cancer activity of
      rats.<br>
      <br>
      That is, it is possible to confirm the presence of the spatial
      energy from the graph.<br>

      This clinical trial is cheongnoe clinic located in Daechi-dong,
      Gangnam-gu, Seoul 507 Street mall third floor, plus a win by
      experiments conducted in early 2005 in the (President ryujaegyu),
      reflect the space to be treated, spatial processing can be
      ingested when infants atopic patients Young, a test to verify
      whether the clinical impact on infant atopic patients.<br>
      <br>
      In this clinical trial use bottled water which is present in the D
      area of ??energy radiating from the eungpok radiometric survey 10
      days (hereinafter, the space energy processing Sura should) the
      admission was 0-4 years old for the purpose of treating atopic
      dermatitis in young cheongnoe clinic, infant eczema 40 people were
      taken to the patient (male 15, female 25).<br>
      <br>
      In this clinical trial, the space zero energy treatment, when the
      infant atopic patients taking hayeoteul, was set up five
      hypothesis that there is a difference before taking a space energy
      processing by measuring the number of atopic index (SCORAD) before
      and after taking a dose It confirmed the clinical effect.<br>
      <br>
      Here, atopic index (SCORAD), but the significance and the result
      is checked at the same time to get a full body photo and itching
      skin conditions and skin part, the subject is young, it is
      difficult to check the body and itchy skin conditions in infants
      relations.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the main symptoms of atopic five kinds of symptoms
      (erythema symptoms (Erythema), papules symptoms (Edema /
      Papulation), gangrene symptoms (Oozing), abrasions symptoms
      (Excoriation), lichen symptoms (Lichenification)) were classified
      by the scoring.<br>
      <br>
      Energy treatment may take place prior to the symptoms of atopic
      patients Table 1 and shown in Fig.<br>

      1 The contents of the] is represented by a graph as shown in Fig.<br>
      <br>
      Young the space energy can be processed, when the infant atopic
      patients taking hayeoteul space will be different before and
      treated the same as taking five kinds of hypothesis to. (A) 10
      days Hypothesis 1 space energy processing water 200 ~ 300cc one
      months Young taking into three days, erythema (Erythema) symptoms
      of infant atopic patients will have a space energy processing
      water before taking the difference. (b) Hypothesis 2 days 10 days
      1 space energy processing water 200 ~ 300cc three one months will
      be taking you into the spirit, papules (Edma / Papulation)
      symptoms of infant atopic patients before taking the space energy
      processing water is a difference. (c) 3 Hypothesis 3 times a day
      for 10 days into the space energy processing water 200 ~ 300cc one
      months taking spirit, gangrene (Oozing) symptoms of infant atopic
      patients will have a space energy processing water before taking
      the difference. (d) H4 10 days processing space 200 to zero taking
      into energy water three times a day for one months 300cc ,
      abrasion (Excoriation) symptoms of infant atopic patients will
      have a space energy processing water before taking the difference.
      (e) Hypothesis 5 was 10 days processing space 200 to the 300cc 1
      energy water three times a day, taking one months into the spirit,
      infant eczema lichen (Lichenification) symptoms will have a space
      energy processing water before taking the difference.<br>
      <br>
      The results of this clinical trial Table 2 are expressed.<br>
      <br>
      [Table 2] after taking the space energy treatment&nbsp; Erythema
      Edema/Papulation Oozing Excoriation Lichenification Severe (III)

      <br>
      Results for H1 spirit, erythema (Erythema) symptoms of infant
      atopic patients were not significantly different energy space, the
      number one days of treatment 10 days after the treatment by taking
      200 ~ 300cc before taking into three times.<br>
      <br>
      That is, as shown in Fig. 14, Erythema symptoms after the
      treatment by taking a spatial energy treatment is seen that the
      patients belonged to the moderate and severe to mild or move the
      plurality of 0 (no symptoms), that is a symptom improvement can
      be. (b) the results for Hypothesis 2 Spirit, the infant atopic
      patients with papules (Edema / Papulation) significant space,
      energy treatment symptoms a day for 10 days after treatment by
      taking 200 ~ 300cc before taking into three There was a
      difference.<br>
      <br>
      That is 15, the area to be treated by taking the energy treatment
      after Edema / Papulation symptoms, it can be seen that a large
      number of patients go to 0 (no symptoms), that the symptoms are
      improved. (C) English results for Hypothesis 3, gangrene (Oozing)
      symptoms of infant atopic patients there was a significant
      difference for the daily 200 ~ 300cc space energy can be processed
      10 days after treatment before taking divided doses three times.<br>
      <br>
      That is, as shown in Fig. 16, Oozing symptoms after the treatment
      by taking a spatial energy to be treated, it can be seen that a
      large number of patients go to 0 (no symptoms), that the symptoms
      are improved. (D) Hypothesis Results for the fourth spirit,
      abrasions (Excoriation) symptoms of infant atopic patients did not
      differ significantly the number of space energy processing one
      days to 10 days after treatment by taking 200 ~ 300cc before
      taking into three times.<br>
      <br>
      That is, as shown in 17, taking as most of the subject is a
      pre-treatment did not severe symptoms Excoriation before, it was
      difficult to find a significant result compared to the latter.<br>
      <br>
      But it is skin condition after taking Space fringed energy process
      can take more than slick was found on the relevant. (E) results
      for the H5 Spirit of infant atopic patients with lichen
      (Lichenification) symptoms can space energy processing 10 days one
      days after treatment by taking 200 ~ 300cc before taking into
      three There were no significant differences.<br>
      <br>
      Since the duration of the most Lichenification symptoms appear
      much longer to increase adult manseongjung, 18, the four short
      duration of less than three zero, infants were no more
      Lichenification ought baseline symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      As in the above results are confirmed, the symptoms of erythema
      (Erythema (hypothesis 1)), papules symptoms (Edema / Papulation
      (hypothesis 2)), gangrene symptoms (Oozing (Hypothesis 3)),
      abrasions symptoms (Excoriation (H4)) is The improvement was
      confirmed.<br>
      <br>
      Although, for the lichen symptoms (Lichenification (H5)), but the
      difference is not, and can confirm the presence of energy in
      accordance with a result of assumption space 1, 2, 3, 4.<br>
      <br>
      Space radiation energy emitted by the device of the present
      eungpok activates the vital energy, as identified in the
      above-mentioned cancer cell growth tests or clinical trials.<br>
      <br>
      However, space energy exerts a variety of effects in a variety of
      fields as described below.<br>
      <br>
      When the energy emanating from the area emitting device eungpok
      investigate the plant, causes the growth promotion of the plant, a
      chemical reaction such corruption has been found that the effect
      of inhibiting and up.<br>
      <br>
      The space according to the present invention results from the
      energy-functional it can be seen that there is a non-ionizing
      effect of inhibiting the ionic polarization.<br>
      <br>
      This phenomenon is occurring in the body as a man, he would
      immediately foregoing.<br>
      <br>
      Also, when the area of ??energy irradiated three weeks at room
      temperature 20 ? about the milk, the milk is not connected to
      corruption, Catering possible and was transformed into the lactic
      acid bacteria contained in yogurt is utilized also as a health
      food.<br>
      <br>
      Also, when the area was irradiated energy in two months,
      strawberries dry dehydrated state is corrupt or not rancidity was
      changed to Korikori, such as raisins, which is not at all to
      health when humans consume.<br>
      <br>
      This will begin to deteriorate for more than three days leave to
      present a way to keep long-term processed food spoilage when
      compared to that elapses after a few days if kept in a normal
      environment strawberries.<br>
      <br>
      Also, when the area of energy irradiated apples in the
      refrigerator for more than two years, due to the evaporation of
      the skin it became part of the jjogeul jjogeul as well, the meat
      and the meat inside is not the first time the balance in the
      freshness of the apple surface.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the present invention is applied to a case of the human body
      surrounded by water was found to sikindaneun to preserve or

      A generator of the combined magnetic field comprises the
      therapeutic chamber with the electric coils of the rotational
      electromagnetic field with independent power supply. The coils are
      coaxial. In every two adjacent coils, the rotational magnetic
      fields of the opposite directions are generated simultaneously
      (clockwise in one coil and counterclockwise in another one). In a
      gap between the adjacent end-faces of two adjacent coils, the
      additional scalar magnetic field is generated being directed in
      parallel to the rotation axis of the magnetic field.<br>

        <b>Method for Generating Tidal Energy Utilizing the Scalar
          Gravitational Potential of Celestial Bodies</b><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Inventor: CUMMING DUNCAN G [US] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Tidal energy generator uses the scalar gravitational potential to
      utilize energy from celestial bodies. Kinetic energy is extracted
      from the celestial objects by means of a system including a
      rotatable arm, a mass fluctuation producing system arranged on the
      arm and including dielectric material whose mass fluctuates when
      subjected to a changing electromagnetic field in view of the
      scalar gravitational potential of the celestial objects, a
      rotation system that rotates the arm at a variable speed to cause
      rotation of the mass fluctuation producing system thereon, and a
      control system that controls the mass fluctuation producing system
      and rotation system in order to accelerate the dielectric material
      when it has a relatively light mass and decelerate the dielectric
      material when it has a relatively heavy mass. Excess energy
      arising from an energy differential between the acceleration and
      deceleration of the dielectric material is directed to a load.<br>
