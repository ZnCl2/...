      <b><b><b> </b> </b></b><i>The vehicle combines the best of a
        helicopter and fixed wing aircraft, say researchers. It stands
        1.5 metres high and has a wingspan of 2.4 metres (Image:
        University of Sydney)</i><br>
      <br>
      A new unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that takes off vertically like
      a helicopter and then flips over to fly forward like a
      conventional plane is being developed by Australian researchers.<br>
      <br>
      The T-Wing could provide cheaper and more efficient surveillance
      and reconnaissance, says Dr Hugh Stone of the University of Sydney
      whose team has been carrying out test flights.<br>
      <br>
      "It can take off and land like a helicopter," says Stone, an
      aeronautical engineer who began the research as a PhD project. "It
      doesn't need a runway."<br>
      <br>
      While helicopters can take off and land vertically and can hover,
      they are not as efficient at forward flight as conventional
      aircraft, which means they don't tend to fly as fast or as far.<br>
      <br>
      This is why 'convertiplanes' were developed, aerial vehicles that
      convert from helicopter to plane mode.<br>
      <br>
      Other UAV convertiplanes use helicopter type propeller blades and
      more complex and expensive technology to control the movement of
      the vehicle, says Stone.<br>
      <br>
      But the T-Wing uses fixed propellers, like a standard aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      Moving flaps that sit in the airstream behind the propellers are
      responsible for changing the direction of the aircraft and allow
      it to hover.<br>
      <br>
      These flaps are controlled by an onboard computer system that
      detects and changes the plane's location and orientation.<br>
      <br>
      "We can basically tell it a set of points in space and we upload
      those to the vehicle and then it will fly through those points,"
      says Stone. "It doesn't need any intervention from us."<b><b><br>
          <br>
          <b>Unstable</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
        </b></b>Like other similar vehicles the T-Wing is quite unstable
      and the flaps have to move 50 times a second to keep the vehicle
      hovering.<br>
      <br>
      While it is not possible to fly the aircraft by radio control from
      the ground, it is possible to communicate with the onboard
      computer system in an emergency.<br>
      <br>
      "We can intervene if something starts to go wrong," says Stone.<br>
      <br>
      So far the team has successfully tested a prototype that is 1.5
      metres high with a 2.4-metre wingspan and weighs 30 kilograms.<br>
      <br>
      In the tests, the aircraft flew autonomously, except while landing
      when it had some assistance from radio control on the ground. The
      team plan to do further testing in December.<b><b><br>
          <br>
          <b>Surveillance</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
        </b></b>Stone says UAVs are generally equipped with cameras and
      used for surveillance and reconnaissance.<br>
      <br>
      The research has been funded by the Australian Research Council,
      the University of Sydney and a US$30,000 grant (A$39,000) from the
      US Air Force.<br>
      <br>
      Stone says his team is working with Australian technology company
      Sonacom to develop a commercial version of the aircraft for
      surveillance applications.<br>

            <br>
          </b></b></b>In what feels like a homage to the 1950s UFO era,
      researchers in the University's School of Aerospace, Mechanical
      and Mechatronic Engineering have developed an aircraft that takes
      off vertically before flying off horizontally.<br>
      <br>
      With a wing span of 2.4 metres, a height of 1.6 metres, and
      weighing 30 kilograms, the "T-Wing" unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
      blends properties of a helicopter with those of a conventional
      aircraft.<br>
      ufo-aircraft<br>
      <br>
      "Anything that takes off vertically and lands vertically has more
      operational flexibility because no runway is required. It takes
      off using propellers, but because it flies like a conventional
      aircraft - wing-born - it is faster, has more range, and more
      endurance than a helicopter," explains project-leader Hugh Stone.<br>
      <br>
      While normal aircraft use runway speed to create wind over their
      wings to provide lift, the lift for take-off of the T-Wing is
      provided by propeller thrust. As the propellers spin, they blow
      air over the control surfaces of the wings - 'the propeller wash'
      - which in turn allows the vehicle to control itself during
      vertical flight.<br>
      <br>
      The T-Wing, or "Adriano" as the researchers have named it,
      operates autonomously, communicating with the ground via a
      console. Operators program points in space - 'way points' - which
      are uploaded to the vehicle, directing it where to fly.<br>
      <br>
      There is a big interest world-wide in unmanned aerial vehicles,
      according to Dr Stone. He and his team have been working closely
      with Sonacom, a company hoping to use the technology to deposit
      sonar buoys in the ocean.<br>
      <br>
      "Because UAVs are not reliant on human pilots - people who need to
      eat and sleep - they can stay up longer. Also, no lives are lost
      if it crashes," he says.<br>
      <br>
      However, unlike many other UAVs, Dr Stone's aircraft has a
      vertical take-off capability. "It can be placed on the back of a
      truck and can take off in a clearing almost anywhere," he
      explains.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers in the United States and Korea have also developed
      "convertiplane" UAVs with vertical take-off, however according to
      Dr Stone, these are extremely mechanically complex and therefore
      very expensive.<br>
      <br>
      "Our design blends the operational flexibility of a helicopter
      with the forward flight of a conventional aircraft, and it does so
      more simply than other vehicles," he says. <br>

            <br>
          </b></b></b>Welcome to the T-Wing vehicle home page. The
      T-Wing is a tail-sitter technology demonstrator UAV that is being
      jointly developed by the University of Sydney and an Australian
      company, Sonacom Pty Ltd. The T-Wing vehicle concept grew out of
      vehicle optimization studies conducted at the University during
      1995-1999 by Dr Hugh Stone, for his PhD dissertation. Although in
      some respects similar to the Boeing Heliwing vehicle of the early
      1990's it is fundamentally different in a number of respects. Some
      of the differences are:<br>
      <br>
      * The use of control surfaces submerged in the slipstream of the
      vehicle's twin propellers to provide control during vertical
      flight (similar to the tail-sitter vehicles of the 1950's) as
      opposed to the use of standard helicopter cyclic control;<br>
      <br>
      * The use of a canard to balance the aft wing and allow greater
      freedom in CG positioning; and<br>
      <br>
      * A different fin and landing gear arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      The T-Wing has a wing-span of ~2.1m and a MTOW of ~30 Kg. It is
      powered by twin 78cc 3W 2-stroke engines that turn 23 inch
      diameter propellers. The vehicle is controlled by an onboard
      PC-104 computer stack that drives all the servos and accepts
      inputs from the GPS and IMU sensors. The vehicle communicates with
      the ground via Radio Modem Serial Data link. So far the T-Wing has
      been flown in hover mode both manually (very briefly!) and under
      automatic control using Command Augmentation System (CAS)
      controllers. For hover mode, these map pilot stick inputs to
      velocity commands:<br>
      <br>
      * elevator and rudder stick inputs become translational velocity
      commands;<br>
      <br>
      * aileron stick input is treated as a (vertical attitude)
      roll-rate command; and throttle stick input maps to a vertical
      velocity command.<br>
      <br>
      Tethered hover testing has commenced on the second airframe and on
      Monday 6th August 2002, the T-Wing flew with autonomous guidance
      in all axes except the vertical. Vertical position was controlled
      via a vertical velocity controller commanded by a remote pilot.
      Pilot input for vertical position control is necessitated by
      vertical height limitations of the tether system and the
      imprecision of DGPS altitude measurements. Once tether testing is
      complete, all pilot input will be removed. Once this is done, all
      axes will be connected to an onboard guidance loop which generates
      appropriate velocity commands for the controllers to navigate
      between a set of waypoints.<br>
      <br>
      Tethered Hover testing resumed on 1st March 2005, with a total of
      4 tethered flights exploring different vertical flight control
      modes and testing the integration of a new more accurate GPS
      receiver, pressure sensor and upgraded flight and ground-station
      software. Besides the standard vertical velocity mode tested
      previously, the vehicle was also tested with vertical angle-based
      controllers as well as rate-based controllers.<br>
      <br>
      As of November 2005 we have installed a new avionics system which
      gives ~ 20 times increase in accuracy for the vehicle position,
      velocity and angle states. This has allowed us to conduct fully
      autonomous vertical flight testing with the tether test-rig. We
      have also been able to successfully fly the vehicle in 10-15 knot
      winds in both autonomous and vertical velocity guidance modes.<br>
      <br>
      From May 2006 we replaced the 3W-78CC engines with Desert Aircraft
      100CC engines to counter weight growth with heavier avionics and
      deterioration (with age) in the 78CC engine performance.<br>
      <br>
      Between 1st and 30th August/2006 we have performed three
      transition flights, each involving at least one set of transitions
      between vertical and horizontal flight.<br>

            </b><b>Free Flight with Transitions: 30/August/2006</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
          </b></b></b>... Free flight performed with both transitions on
      30/August 2006. The vehicle performed the first transition fully
      autonomously and navigated to the first horizontal waypoint and
      turned on to the second fully autonomously but was then put in a
      semi-autonomous mode due to excessive altitude loss in the turn
      (due to a small problem in the flight controller – since fixed).
      With the pilot supplying high-level guidance commands for the
      vehicle’s low-level controllers, the vehicle was transitioned back
      to vertical flight and recovered safely. In the video the
      following aspects are seen:<br>
      <br>
      Vehicle climbs up to a waypoint at 100 ft; It then continues
      climbing to a further waypoint at 300 ft; It then transitions
      fully autonomously away from the wind in the correct attitude.
      During the transition it loses approximately 3 metres in altitude;
      It then navigates to the first horizontal waypoint and turns
      towards the second autonomously; During the turn the vehicle loses
      significant altitude due to a small control system error
      (excessively tight saturation limits on some integral states in
      the pitch-rate controller); The pilot takes over high-level
      guidance and brings the vehicle back towards the runway (supplying
      pitch angle, and bank-angle commands); The ground-pilot commands
      the vehicle to perform a horizontal to vertical transition which
      it does in about 50m of altitude. The video is also cut to shorten
      the time of the descent portion of the flight (about 2 minutes in
      the actual flight) The vehicle lands in a vertical attitude.<br>
      <b><b><b><b><br>
              <b>Free Flight with Transitions: 1/August/2006</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
            </b></b></b></b>...Free flight performed with both
      transitions on 1/August/2006. The vehicle was accidentally put
      into a fully manual mode [due to bad ground-station ergonomics]
      during the flight and lost control, but was recovered in a
      semi-manual mode and landed without a scratch. The video has been
      edited to delete the unintended control departure region. In the
      video the following things are seen:<br>
      <br>
      Vehicle climbs up to a waypoint at 100 ft; It then continues
      climbing to a further waypoint at 300 ft; It then transitions into
      the wind on its back and rolls right way up while in autonomous
      mode; At this stage the manual switch was inadvertently hit and
      the vehicle departed controlled flight; The video resumes with the
      vehicle recovered in a semi-manual mode; The ground-pilot commands
      the vehicle to perform a horizontal to vertical transition which
      it does in about 50m of altitude. The video is also cut to shorten
      the time of the descent portion of the video (about 2 minutes in
      the actual flight) The vehicle then lands in a vertical attitude.<br>

      vehicle used an MPC algorithm looking ~2.5 seconds into the future
      to determine the optimal control to apply at any given point in
      time. The particular manifestation of the MPC algorithm used here
      has been developed by Peter Anderson as part of his PhD studies
      and runs on the 400MHz Celeron flight computer. For some of the
      predictive flights the vehicle was flown with an ultrasonic
      wind-sensor to capture the relative wind-information.<br>

              <b>Fully Autonomous Tethered Testing with New Avionics:
                November 2005</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
            </b></b></b></b>... Vehicle performing a fully autonomous
      flight from takeoff through to landing. During this flight the
      vehicle passes through a total of 26 way-points before landing
      autonomously. The waypoints consist of&nbsp; the following
      maneuvers: Climb 10 ft and hover... Move in a Cross-Pattern (“+”)
      with 8 ft legs in North, then South, then East and then West
      directions with belly facing North. This demonstrates vertical
      translations in directions aligned with major vehicle axes...
      Reorient belly 45 degrees to point North-East... Repeat
      Cross-Pattern with 8 ft legs in North, South, East and West
      directions to demonstrate vertical translations at oblique angles
      to the normal vehicle axis system... Reorient Belly pointing North
      ... Perform clock-wise hesitation vertical role, stopping at each
      major compass point (NESW). ... Perform similar anti-clockwise
      hesitation vertical role... Climb to 12 ft altitude ... Descend to
      4 ft ... Land.<br>
