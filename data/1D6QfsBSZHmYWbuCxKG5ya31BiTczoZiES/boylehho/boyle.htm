      <br>
      We are in the process of changing the entire electrical power
      supply in the Marshall Islands to hydrogen generated electricity
      produced from water drawn from the Pacific Ocean!<br>
      <br>
      We will soon begin converting other electrical power plants
      throughout Asia and the South Seas, including S. Korea, Japan and
      the Philippians and could certainly do as much in the United
      States; whew, no more fracking the earth for natural gas, oil
      spills, coal mine and nuclear disasters, no more dependence upon
      foreign oil and<br>
      <br>
      <b>NO MORE POLLUTION!</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We also have applications for steel mills and other smelters as
      well as the capability to convert any coal, oil, diesel, natural
      gas and even nuclear fired power plants to hydrogen produced from
      any source of water including ordinary salt water from the sea.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen is available in virtually unlimited quantity in that the
      oceans and all the waters of the planet are 2/3s hydrogen! (H2O)<br>
      <br>
      Wouldn’t it be great if the United States caught up with the
      Marshall Islands and other 3rd World countries?!<br>

          operation of Arnie Boyle's patented Hydrogen Generator. This
          device greatly increases fuel economy in combustion engines by
          cracking water into pure hydrogen and oxygen and injecting
          these into the air intake stream where it combines with the
          fuel/air mixture prior to combustion. It works with all types
          of engines, whether carbureted or fuel injected and provides

      Global Energy International, LLC (GEI) has developed a hydrogen /
      oxygen fuel supplement device that offers a dramatic reduction in
      greenhouse gases and increased fuel efficiency in any internal
      combustion engine. Our product will prove to be an early mover in
      the alternative fuel market. An abundance of scientific data
      indicates that supplementing an internal combustion engine with
      these gases reduces harmful emissions, improves fuel efficiency,
      and extends engine life. As fuel prices continue to rise, global
      warming, and the environment continue to receive mass media
      attention, a stronghold on the market is within reach with our
      product.<br>
      <br>
      GEI is currently a California limited liability corporation based
      in Orange County, CA owned by its principal founder and private
      investors. The company has exclusivity to license the ME product
      line from Mesa Energy LLC.<br>
      <br>
      The company was founded in 2005 by Arnie Boyle.<br>
      <br>
      For the past three years GEI has been very successful in obtaining
      desirable test results with the ME-1 hydrogen unit. Mesa Energy
      has applied for U.S Patent Application No. 11/571,785, and
      International. Patent Application Pub. WO.2007/133174 for the
      hydrogen generator ME-1,among other pending patents and
      trademarks. Management believes that the executive order from the
      California Air Resource Board (CARB) for the off-road application
      will be established in the second week of October of 2008. The
      ME-2 product line is being developed for the on-road applications
      and is well received at an early stage, as our business grows we
      will take on personnel to accomplish desired sales, and to
      facilitate the production.<br>
      <br>
      Prospective consumers are very interested in cutting into the
      bottom line of fuel cost, and of course meeting the regulations
      set forth by the EPA, and the KYOTO Protocol Act. There is a
      necessity for our product within our shipping ports, agriculture
      farmlands, and the semi-tractor trailer companies delivering over
      70 percent of the national freight tonnage. The market segments
      are clearly defined and all are subject to a high growth trend.<br>
      <br>
      GEI has a management team with direct knowledge of the overall

      complete the testing, verification and licensing process of the
      on-road applications. Mass product development, management
      salaries, and expansion to a larger facility, are among the
      majority of start up costs. GEI’s strategy could be to negotiate a
      percentage for the illiquid assets within three years, or have
      them stay on for a longer term with equity control and share in
      liquid profits. When the company converts to a corporation, the
      company’s balance sheets will reflect all prior membership
      interest to common stock.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0001] 1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to hydrogen generators for
      improving the efficiency of hydrocarbon fuel combustion. More
      specifically, the invention relates to hydrogen generators used
      with internal combustion engines to reduce harmful emissions from
      the internal combustion engines.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0003] 2. Description of Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] An internal combustion engine produces power by burning a
      fuel within the combustion chambers of the engine. The fuel is
      mixed with air (which contains about twenty percent oxygen) and
      fed into the combustion chambers. The burning produces explosion
      and gases that move one or more pistons or rotors. The moving
      pistons or rotors are connected to an output shaft. Internal
      combustion engines are used to power automobiles, trucks, boats,
      tools, generators, and many other devices. The three main types of
      internal combustion engines are the conventional piston engine,
      the rotary engine, and the diesel engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Most internal combustion engines burn a fuel that is
      refined from petroleum. These fuels include gasoline, diesel fuel,
      and aviation fuel. Petroleum is a non-renewable resource. Most
      countries have to import petroleum and/or its refined products to
      meet their needs. The costs and the political consequences are
      enormous. Many steps have been taken to improve the efficiency of
      internal combustion engines and to supplement hydrocarbon fuels
      with renewable fuels such as ethanol and vegetable oils. However,
      the cost of hydrocarbon fuels continues to rise and the dependence
      on imported petroleum continues to increase for most
      industrialized countries.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Petroleum-based fuels contain a variety of hydrocarbons
      that, when burned in an engine, produce water and carbon dioxide
      and lesser amounts of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons.
      The hydrocarbon fuels generally contain small quantities of
      nitrogen and sulfur compounds which result in the formation of
      nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. Carbon monoxide, unburned
      hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides are all harmful
      to the environment. A variety of steps have been taken to reduce
      the air pollution caused by emissions from internal combustion
      engines. Clean-air legislation is one such step. However, when
      engine emissions fail to meet an environmental standard, the
      consequences can be economically troublesome to a business,
      especially those that rely on large-scale engine operations.
      Management may have no alternative but to shut down essential
      plant equipment until it can be repaired or replaced.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Accordingly, there has been a great incentive to reduce
      harmful emissions from internal combustion engines and to
      supplement the hydrocarbon fuels that are burned in them. It is
      widely believed that the fuel of the future is hydrogen. Hydrogen
      burns cleanly and produces water as a by-product. Hydrogen can be
      produced by electrolysis of water. Water is, of course, an
      abundant resource. However, modifications to the internal
      combustion engine must be made to burn solely hydrogen and an
      entire manufacturing and distributing network for hydrogen must be
      created. Many experts believe it will be many decades before
      hydrogen replaces petroleum-derived hydrocarbon fuels.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In the meantime, it is known that hydrogen produced by the
      electrolysis of water can be used to supplement hydrocarbon fuels
      in existing internal combustion engines. From the standpoint of
      thermodynamics, the energy required to generate hydrogen and
      oxygen from water by electrolysis is greater than the energy
      produced when the hydrogen and oxygen burn to regenerate water.
      However, it has been discovered that adding supplemental hydrogen
      and oxygen to an internal combustion engine enables the engine to
      burn the hydrocarbon fuel more efficiently, resulting in a net
      increase in efficiency and a reduction in emissions.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,271,793 issued to Valdespino
      on Jun. 9, 1981 (incorporated herein by reference) discloses a
      hydrogen generator for an internal combustion engine. The
      generator comprises an electrolytic reactor that creates hydrogen
      and oxygen from water. The hydrogen and oxygen are fed to the
      intake of the engine. Another example, is U.S. Pat. No. 5,231,954
      issued to Stowe on Aug. 3, 1993 (incorporated herein by
      reference), which also discloses a hydrogen generator for an
      internal combustion engine. The electrolytic reactor contains a
      pop-off lid to reduce the danger of explosions and the hydrogen
      and oxygen are fed into the positive crankcase ventilation system
      rather than directly into the intake manifold. A third example is
      U.S. Pat. No. 6,817,320 issued to Balan et al. on Nov. 16, 2004
      (incorporated herein by reference). Balan et al. discloses a
      plurality of electrolysis cells for providing hydrogen to an
      internal combustion engine, and a control system for cell
      operation and safety assurance.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The electrolytic hydrogen generators of Valdespino, Stowe,
      and Balan et al., as well as many other such generators that have
      been discussed or built, suffer from a variety of problems that
      have prevented them from achieving widespread use. One problem is
      the risk of explosion inherent in any system that accumulates a
      volume of pressurized hydrogen gas. Another problem is controlling
      the generator of hydrogen gas in response to engine demand.
      Another problem is maintaining electrolyte level and temperature
      within desired limits during long term engine operation. Another
      problem is developing a cost-effective system with uncomplicated
      controls. Accordingly, a demand still exists for a safe and
      practical electrolytic hydrogen generator for an internal
      combustion engine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0011] The present invention provides a safe and practical
      hydrogen generator for supplementing hydrocarbon fuel burned in a
      combustion chamber. The invention improves combustion efficiency
      and reduces harmful emissions by generating hydrogen according to
      combustion demand.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In one embodiment, a hydrogen generator according to the
      present invention comprises a reactor having a sealed cathode
      chamber partially filled with an electrolyte solution, and an
      anode partially immersed in the solution and electrically isolated
      from the cathode chamber. The system includes a reservoir and
      level sensor form maintaining a desired level of reactor solution.
      An electric power source is configured to energize the reactor
      across its anode and cathode terminals to liberate hydrogen and
      oxygen gas from the solution by electrolysis. The power source may
      comprise an independent power supply or an engine electrical
      system. A cooling system, such as a heat sink, transfers heat from
      the reactor to counteract electrolyte heating and allows the
      reactor to operate at higher amperage. In the reactor, the gases
      rise to an air space above solution level and from there are drawn
      or pumped through conduit to combine in the combustion chamber
      with hydrocarbon fuel and air. The generator may include a
      plurality of electrolytic reactors maintained in electrolyte
      communication.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In one aspect of the invention, the components of the
      hydrogen generator are mounted on a portable skid to facilitate
      connection as an auxiliary system to stationary engines such as
      those used to power gantry cranes, mining drills, diesel
      generators, and other large horsepower industrial machines and
      equipment. In another aspect of the invention, the components of
      the hydrogen generator are permanently installed as an auxiliary
      system for an internal combustion engine mounted on a stationary
      apparatus or on a vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In another aspect of the invention, the electric power
      source is configured to energize a single reactor or any
      combination of reactors to effect production of hydrogen and
      oxygen responsive to engine demand. An engine demand signal
      derived from an RPM sensor or throttle position sensor causes the
      source to energize one or more reactors commensurate with the
      demand. In this aspect the source may be configured with a
      programmable logic controller and power relays to switch reactors
      between energized and non-energized states. In another aspect, the
      logic controller is programmed to shift reactor duty cycles with
      each engine start, such that reactor service times are
      substantially equalized over time. Shifting duty cycles in this
      manner advantageously maximizes system service time before
      maintenance. The logic controller may also be programmed to
      energize initially a plurality of reactors for boosting hydrogen
      and oxygen supplementation during cold-start conditions, and to
      de-energize one or more reactors when the engine achieves steady
      state operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In another embodiment, the invention provides a level
      control subsystem comprising a sensor for sensing electrolyte
      solution level in one of the reactors. Responsive to sensing a low
      level of solution in one reactor, the subsystem actuates a pump to
      draw solution from the reservoir for refilling the reactor.
      Responsive to sensing a high level of solution, the subsystem
      actuates a drain valve located between one of the reactors and the
      reservoir. Thus configured, the reservoir may receive excess
      solution from reactors in case of overflow, and also provide a
      source of make-up solution to rectify low electrolyte levels.
      Maintaining the reactors in electrolyte communication according to
      the invention advantageously allows the entire system to operate
      with level sensing and reservoir connections limited to a single
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In another embodiment of the invention, the electrolyte
      solution comprises about two to four percent dissolved
      electrolyte, about ten to twenty percent alcohol, and a balance of
      deionized water. In one aspect, the electrolyte comprises sodium
      hydroxide and the alcohol comprises methanol. The methanol
      advantageously lowers the freezing point of the solution, and
      reacts in water with free sodium ions to produce hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The present invention provides an environmental advantage
      by reducing harmful emissions from the exhaust of internal
      combustion engines. Experimental tests on engines equipped with a
      prototype of the invention show a significant reduction in
      pollutants such as carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon, and
      nitrous oxide. The invention also provides a means for cleaning
      engine internals, by removing or reducing carbon build-up.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Another notable advantage of the invention is that it
      minimizes the risk of explosion. It does this by limiting hydrogen
      and oxygen production according to engine demand, and also by
      preventing these gases from accumulating under pressure. Another
      advantage is the extended service life realized by shifting
      reactor duty cycles. Another advantage is the simplicity of the
      design. Thus, hydrogen generation according to this invention is
      practical, safe, and requires little maintenance.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0031] FIG. 1 illustrates a system 100 according to the
      present invention. In this embodiment, the system comprises an
      electrolytic reactor 11, a refillable reservoir 12, a pump 13, a
      heat exchanger 14, and conduit 15 connecting the foregoing
      components as shown. System 100 produces hydrogen and oxygen by
      electrolysis of water within reactor 11. The hydrogen and oxygen
      are produced to supplement hydrocarbon fuel burned in a combustion
      chamber, such as a wood or oil burning stove, a coal furnace, or
      cylinders of an internal combustion engine. Electrical power for
      energizing reactor 11 may originate from an independent source, or
      it may be derived from the electrical system of an engine. To
      simplify the disclosure, no combustion chambers or engines are
      shown in any of the figures.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Refillable reservoir 12 is configured to hold up to about
      two gallons of ionized water, although this volume may vary
      according to the particular application. Reservoir 12 may be
      constructed of a lightweight material such as plastic, but any
      other non-reactive material such as stainless steel is also
      suitable. Reservoir 12 holds an electrolyte solution 16 that
      contains a sufficient concentration of ions to conduct electricity
      and to carry out electrolysis in electrolytic reactor 11. The
      electrolyte in solution 16 may comprise any acid, base or salt
      that disassociates in water into cations and anions, provided that
      the disassociated cation has less standard electrode potential
      than a hydrogen ion to ensure production of hydrogen gas during
      electrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In one embodiment, electrolyte solution 16 comprises salt
      water. The salt water may be formulated, or it may be taken
      directly from a large body of naturally occurring salt water. In
      the latter case, an ocean or saltwater lake may function as
      reservoir 16. This configuration may be applied in gasoline or
      diesel engines located on offshore platforms or on boats or other
      seagoing vessels.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In another embodiment, solution 16 comprises an electrolyte
      such as lye dissolved in pure (deionized) water. Sodium hydroxide
      or potassium hydroxide may be used as the electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Reservoir 12 is further configured with a port 17 for
      adding additional solution, and an outlet 18 that communicates,
      directly or indirectly, with electrolytic reactor 11. In one
      embodiment, outlet 18 connects via conduit 15 directly to reactor
      11. In another embodiment, outlet 18 connects via conduit 15
      indirectly to reactor 11 through pump 13 and heat exchanger 14.
      Either way, reservoir 12 is maintained in electrolyte
      communication with reactor 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Electrolytic reactor 11 comprises a cathode 19 and an anode
      20. Cathode 19 is a sealed chamber adapted to hold a smaller
      quantity of solution 16 relative to the volume of reservoir 12. In
      one embodiment, the volume of the chamber of cathode 19 is about
      one quarter gallon. During system operation, the amount of
      solution 16 contained in reactor 11 fills about 50 to 75 percent
      of the chamber such that an air space 24 exists above the level of
      solution for receiving gaseous reaction products. The chamber is
      made of an electrically conductive material, preferably stainless
      steel, chosen for its corrosion-resistant properties. A
      sufficiently heavy gauge of stainless steel is used so that the
      chamber can withstand any explosion that might occur. Anode 20
      comprises an electrically conductive rod or tube disposed within
      the chamber and electrically isolated from the chamber by means of
      a dielectric plug 25. In one embodiment, plug 25 comprises a
      synthetic rubber plug with a porcelain insert. Plug 25 insulates
      anode 20 from cathode 19 and also provides an environmental seal
      to prevent leakage. Anode 20 may be made from a graphite,
      aluminum, or copper rod enclosed in a stainless steel tube, or it
      may be a solid steel electrode. In a preferred embodiment, cathode
      19 and anode 20 are made from 316L stainless steel. Alternatively,
      both cathode 19 and anode 20 may be made of nickel-plated steel.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Reactor 11 contains an inlet 21 and outlet 22 that
      communicate with reservoir 12. Inlet 21 and outlet 22 allow
      solution 16 to be circulated through reactor 11 in a cooling loop
      to counteract the effects of electrical heating. Heated fluid is
      drawn from reactor 11 through outlet 22 to the inlet of pump 13.
      The fluid is then pumped through heat exchanger 14 where it is
      cooled before returning to reactor 11 via inlet 21. Various
      sections of conduit 15 provide flow paths to complete the cooling
      loop. Conduit 15 may consist of any material suitable for the
      purpose, such as [3/8] inch braided hose or stainless steel
      tubing.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Heat exchanger 14 is preferably a finned water-to-air heat
      exchanger similar to a conventional radiator. Heat exchanger 14
      may include a fan to increase the air flow across the fins. Heat
      generated within reactor 11 by electrolysis can cause solution 16
      to expand and boil. As the solution heats excessively, it begins
      to lose its ability to conduct electric current, thereby limiting
      the production of hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis. Thus, heat
      exchanger 14 enables higher electrical currents to be used which,
      in turn, create greater quantities of hydrogen and oxygen. In one
      embodiment, system 100 is configured to operate for extended
      periods at 60 to 80 amperes.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In another embodiment, heat exchanger 14 is eliminated from
      the flow path, and reactor cooling is accomplished by using a heat
      sink. The heat sink is positioned in direct thermal contact with
      the reactor, and is configured to maximize heat transfer from
      cathode chamber 19. The heat sink may be made from any metal
      suitable for the purpose, such as copper or aluminum, and may be
      configured with fins or other protrusions to increase surface area
      exposure to ambient air.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Reactor 11 preferably contains a level control mechanism
      for maintaining the level of solution 16 in reactor 12 at a
      desired level. In one embodiment, the level control mechanism
      includes a water level detector 23 (such as a float switch)
      located within the reactor, and a solenoid valve (not shown)
      located at reservoir outlet 18. Level detector 23 is configured to
      close an electrical contact upon detecting a low level of solution
      16. Closure of the electrical contact energizes the solenoid
      valve, allowing pump 13 to draw additional solution 16 into the
      circuit, thereby increasing the solution in reactor 11. When
      solution 16 achieves a desired level, detector 23 opens the
      electrical contact, de-energizing the solenoid valve to isolate
      reservoir 12 and maintain the desired level. Many other level
      control methods may be used without departing from the spirit of
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The level control system will allow the level of solution
      16 to fluctuate between high and low setpoints. In one embodiment,
      the low setpoint corresponds to about 50% of chamber capacity, and
      the high setpoint corresponds to about 75% of chamber capacity.
      Thus, the volume of air space 24 within chamber 19 fluctuates with
      changes in the solution level while maintaining adequate space for
      the accumulation of hydrogen gas, oxygen gas, and water vapors. A
      gas outlet 26 of cathode chamber 19 connects to an appropriate
      location of the engine intake system 44 to direct the gas products
      to the cylinders of the engine. For example, the hydrogen and
      oxygen gases can be directed to the intake manifold, to the turbo
      charger (if the engine contains one), or to a line that
      communicates with the intake manifold.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Electrical power may be provided to the reactor from the
      electrical system of the engine (not shown). However, external
      power may also be used. In one embodiment, the terminals of the
      engine battery are connected across cathode 19 and anode 20. A
      starting circuit may be added with appropriate interlocks to
      ensure that reactor 11 operates only when the engine is running.
      For example, interlocks (not shown) may be linked to the ignition
      switch and to an engine output to prevent energization of reactor
      11 unless the ignition switch is on and the engine is running. A
      suitable engine output indicative of a running engine is oil
      pressure, which may be detected by means of an oil sending unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Before operation of the system can begin, reservoir 12 is
      completely filled with electrolyte solution 16 and reactor 11 is
      filled to a desired level between high and low setpoints. Then,
      the engine is turned on and the ignition switch is placed in the
      on position. The oil pressure sending unit closes a relay contact
      to connect the positive terminal of the engine battery to anode
      20. Another relay set starts pump 13 and a fan (if any) in heat
      exchanger 14 to cool and circulate solution 16 through reactor 11.
      The electric potential between the cathode and the anode causes
      electrons to flow through the electrolyte solution. As the
      electrons flow, electrolysis occurs and water molecules
      disassociate according to the well-known equation:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      2H2O(aq)-&gt;2H2(g)+O2(g)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] with hydrogen gas collecting at the walls of the cathode
      and oxygen gas collecting along the surface of the anode. The
      hydrogen and oxygen gases form bubbles that rise through the
      surface of solution 16 to accumulate in air space 24. These gases
      are drawn through outlet 26 by vacuum pressure to the intake
      system of the engine. There, the hydrogen and oxygen are combined
      with a mixture of hydrocarbon fuel and air, and burn during the
      combustion cycle in the engine cylinders. The hydrogen and the
      oxygen improve the speed of combustion and/or combustion
      efficiency in the engine. As a result, the emissions of carbon
      monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur
      oxides are reduced. Another result is the mileage of the vehicle
      (the energy produced per unit of hydrocarbon fuel) increases. This
      is achieved while minimizing the risk of accidental explosion
      because the gaseous reaction products are not allowed to
      accumulate under pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In certain applications, an engine may present a positive
      pressure to reactor outlet 26. This may occur, for example, in
      engines equipped with turbo chargers. In that case, a positive
      displacement pump (not shown) such as a diaphragm pump may be
      installed between outlet 26 and the engine intake manifold to
      force reaction products into the engine cylinders.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In a single reactor, the rate of hydrogen and oxygen
      production may be increased by increasing the electrolyzing
      current. In practice, this current will be limited by a variety of
      factors, including the concentration of ions in solution, the
      output rating of the power supply, electrical cable gauge, and the
      ability of the cooling system or heat sink to prevent the solution
      from boiling within the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In one embodiment of the invention, an alcohol such as
      methanol or ethanol is added to the electrolyte solution to
      enhance hydrogen production. For example, methanol or ethanol can
      be added to a solution of lye or sodium hydroxide dissolved in
      deionized water. During electrolysis, methanol reacts with water
      to liberate hydrogen according to the following equation:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      CH3OH+H2O-&gt;CO2+3H2(g)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] In a preferred embodiment, a system according to the
      invention is operated using a solution 16 comprising about 2 to 4
      percent sodium hydroxide, about 10 to 20 percent alcohol, and a
      balance of deionized water.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] FIG. 2 illustrates an alternate embodiment of a system 200
      according to the invention. The principles of reactor operation
      are the same as described in the previous embodiment. However,
      system 200 demonstrates that alternative configurations of
      mechanical components are possible without departing from the
      scope of the invention. System 200 includes a reactor 11
      comprising cathode chamber 19 and an anode 20 maintained in
      electrolyte communication with circulating pump 13 and heat
      exchanger 14 through conduits 15. In this embodiment, reservoir 12
      is located at a higher elevation than reactor 11. A gas line 30
      connects air space 24 of reactor 11 to an air space 31 maintained
      within reservoir 12 above the level of solution 16. A refill pump
      27 is provided to supply make-up solution to reactor 11 from
      reservoir 12 through refill line 32, which is configured to draw
      solution from the bottom portion of reservoir 12. Reservoir 12
      also includes an outlet 26 which passes gaseous reaction product
      to the engine intake system. System 200 is further configured with
      a level controller comprising a level switch 23 and vertical tube
      28.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] System 200 also depicts a finned anode 20. In a finned
      anode, a portion of the anode rod includes fins that extend
      radially outward from the axis of the rod to increase the surface
      area of the anode that is exposed to solution 16. One advantage of
      this variation is that it provides a means for adjusting the
      resistivity of the reactor. Fins may be added or subtracted, or
      the diameter of the fins may be selected to achieve higher or
      lower currents or current densities.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] FIG. 3 shows the level controller in greater detail. In
      this embodiment the controller is located external to reactor 11
      in a lower temperature area that facilitates electrical
      connections and calibration. Tube 28 is connected to cathode
      chamber 19 such that hydrostatic pressure causes an amount of
      solution 16 to rise within tube 28 to a level analogous to the
      level of solution 16 within cathode chamber 19. A plastic float 33
      connected to a threaded shaft 34 is suspended from the top of tube
      28, as shown. A contact nut 35 is fixed or welded to shaft 34.
      Level switch 23 is positioned such that vertical movement of nut
      35 in response to action of float 33 will open a contact on switch
      23 when the level of solution 16 within tube 28 reaches a high
      setpoint. Opening the contact de-energizes refill pump 27 to shut
      off the flow of make-up solution to reactor 11. Those skilled in
      the relevant art will recognize that other configurations of a
      level control circuit are possible. For example, switch 23 may be
      configured as a magnetic reed switch with multiple contacts
      corresponding to high and low setpoints for turning pump 27 off or
      on, thereby maintaining reactor solution level within desired
      limits.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Referring again to FIG. 2, system 200 provides a further
      advantage by locating reservoir 12 in an elevated location
      relative to reactor 11. The top portion of reservoir 12 may be
      configured in the shape of a cone, as shown, to form a first water
      trap. This configuration causes some amount of water vapor rising
      from reactor 11 to condense and collect on the inner walls of the
      cone, and eventually return by gravity to the body of solution 16
      maintained within the reservoir. An optional second water trap 29
      may be provided to capture any water vapor that passes through
      outlet 26 toward the engine intake.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In an embodiment of the invention that uses seawater as the
      electrolyte solution, the body of seawater serves as a reservoir
      for the hydrogen generator. Seawater may be received into the
      reactor vessel through an inlet 21 having an open end immersed in
      the sea, and discharged from the reactor back into the sea through
      an outlet 22. The reactor includes a cathodic vessel configured to
      maintain a minimum level of seawater to allow an anode to remain
      at least partially submerged in the seawater during electrolysis.
      As in previous embodiments, when a power source energizes the
      reactor, gaseous products accumulate in an air space above the
      water level, to be drawn from the reactor through conduit to an
      intake manifold.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In this embodiment, a pump 13 can be used to circulate the
      seawater through the reactor. Or, in a hydrogen generator
      installed on a boat, seawater can be directed through the inlet by
      force of the boat in motion on the water without the need of a
      pump. Furthermore, because the saltwater circulation loop is open
      to the sea, cooling system components such as the fan and heat
      exchanger may be also eliminated from the system. In one aspect,
      the generator provides fuel supplements to an engine that provides
      the motive force for circulating seawater through the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In another embodiment using seawater as electrolyte, the
      system may include a means for adding alcohol into the cathode
      chamber to mix with seawater. The alcohol may be stored in a tank
      or reservoir, and transferred at a controlled rate into the
      chamber through conduit connections. A flow control valve, such as
      a globe valve, may be placed in the flow path to regulate the
      transfer rate of alcohol. The flow control valve may be configured
      to regulate flow in response to engine demand. For example, the
      position of the globe valve may be function of engine rpm or
      throttle position.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] FIG. 4 shows a working prototype of the present invention,
      which comprises a preferred configuration of multiple reactors
      maintained in electrolyte communication. In this embodiment,
      cathode chambers of two reactors 11A and 11B are linked by an
      inverted T-shaped conduit 15. Horizontal legs of conduit 15
      connect to either chamber at a position below a desired level of
      electrolyte solution. Electrolyte solution circulates out of the
      chambers through the vertical leg of conduit 15, through a heat
      exchanger 14, and back to the chambers through conduit 60. A
      second T-shaped conduit 61 directs solution from conduit 60 into
      the chambers through the base of each reactor, as shown. A
      reservoir 12 is configured to supply make-up solution to the
      reactors through conduit 62. Conduit 62 connects through isolation
      valve 63 to conduit 60. Outlet ports 26 extend from the top of
      each reactor 11A and 11B and are linked by T-shaped connector 36.
      From there, hydrogen and oxygen products are directed to the
      engine intake system through conduit 37. Each cathode chamber is
      electrically grounded, and positive DC voltage is applied to each
      anode terminal 20. A pump (not shown) circulates the solution. In
      operation, the dual-reactor prototype typically draws between 60
      and 80 amps.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Experimental tests were run using the prototype generator
      of FIG. 4. In the tests, the electrolyte solution consisted of
      about 3% sodium hydroxide and about 10% methanol in deionized
      water. Emission levels were measured on three separate diesel
      engines. These particular engines were in service as prime movers
      on gantry cranes.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] First, emission levels were measured on a two-cycle engine
      running without the prototype installed. The two-cycle engine had
      been in service for some time. Second, emissions levels were
      measured on a new four-cycle engine without the prototype
      installed, using the same test equipment and fuel as in the first
      test. The new four-cycle engine was equipped with factory
      installed twin catalytic converters. Third, emission levels were
      measured on another two-cycle engine of similar design as the
      engine used in the first test. The third engine had also seen
      significant service, and was tested under the same conditions as
      in the first two tests, but with the prototype installed. With the
      engine running, electrical current in the generator set was
      maintained between 60 and 80 amps. The following table shows the
      test results:<br>

      NOx:&nbsp; 490&nbsp; 84&nbsp; 55<br>
      <br>
      [0057] A comparison of the tabulated results reveals that levels
      of harmful emissions were significantly lowest with the prototype
      generator installed. In particular, nitrous oxide emissions from
      the two-cycle engines dropped from 490 ppm to 55 ppm. In many
      jurisdictions, a reading of 490 ppm NOx would clearly fail an
      emissions test, while a reading of 84 ppm NOx would clearly pass.
      Note also that the used engine equipped with the prototype
      generator outperformed the new four-cycle engine in all
      categories.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In another experiment, opacity tests were performed on a
      four-cycle, six-cylinder diesel engine equipped with twin
      catalytic converters. This engine was also in service on a gantry
      crane. The first test was run without the prototype installed.
      Opacity levels were measures from cold start over the first hour
      of running time. Opacity is the degree, expressed in a percentage,
      to which emissions reduce the transmission of light and obscure
      the view of the background. In the second test, the prototype
      hydrogen generator was installed on the same engine and opacity
      was again measured from cold start over the first hour of running
      time. In the third test with the prototype still installed, the
      same engine was allowed to continue running for three days, and
      opacity measurements were taken over the final hour of running
      time. The results of these three tests are tabulated below:<br>

      These results indicate that the prototype hydrogen generator
      significantly reduced overall emissions from the diesel engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Many advantages arise from configuring multiple reactors in
      electrolyte communication. First, the size of each reactor is
      restricted to limit the volume of volatile gases that can
      accumulate within reactor air space. This minimizes the risk of
      explosion, and also minimizes the reactor vessel thickness
      required to ensure explosion-proof properties of the reactor
      vessel. Second, by combining multiple relatively small reactors,
      the size of the system may be scaled to meet the demands of any
      size engine without the need to customize reactor components.
      Manufacturing costs are minimized because standardized components
      reduce overall tooling requirements. A further advantage of
      multiple smaller-sized reactors is that high current densities can
      be achieved in each reactor while maintaining electrolyzing
      currents at manageable levels. Another advantage is the ability to
      vary system output according to changing engine demand by
      selectively energizing and de-energizing one or more of the
      reactors in response to engine demand. By maintaining the reactors
      in electrolyte communication, only a single reactor is required
      for monitoring electrolyte levels in order to maintain solution
      levels in all reactors. In another embodiment where the heat
      exchanger comprises a passive heat sink (i.e. a radiator without
      fan or cooling pump), multiple reactors advantageously expose
      greater total surface area for better heat transfer.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] FIG. 5 illustrates another embodiment of a system according
      to the invention comprising dual reactors enclosed within an
      insulated housing 38. Housing 38 is preferably manufactured from a
      thermoplastic such as cross-linked polyethylene. Housing 38
      encloses a first reactor within a first portion 39, and a second
      reactor within a second portion 40, as shown. A bottom portion 41
      encloses conduit for maintaining the reactors in electrolyte
      communication and for refilling the reactors, and electrical cable
      and other components required for operating the reactors. The
      cable and conduit connect to sources outside enclosure 38 through
      various ports (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0061] A connecting portion 42 encloses reactor outlet conduits to
      a common port 37 configured for connection to an engine intake
      system. Port 37 may also connect to the outlet port of a similar
      set of dual reactors in a three-way connection that combines the
      output of four reactors for delivery to the engine. An unlimited
      number of reactor sets can be combined in similar fashion.
      Connecting portion 42 may also be configured as shown to form a
      convenient handle for carrying the system by hand. This
      facilitates set-up in remote locations, such as mining operations,
      where engine access may be difficult, and where multiple reactor
      sets are required to meet engine demand. Enclosure 38 has a depth
      of about 6 inches, a width of about 2 to 3 feet, and a height of
      about 1.5 to 2.5 feet. The thickness of enclosure 38 is about 1/16
      to [1/8] inches.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] FIGS. 6 through 9 illustrate a control system according to
      the invention for energizing one or more reactors according to
      engine demand. As shown in FIG. 6, a system of four reactors 11A,
      11B, 11C and 11D are configured to deliver hydrogen and oxygen
      product to a single engine intake manifold 44. Reactors 11A, 11B,
      11C and 11D are all maintained in electrolyte communication
      through conduits 15 that connect below the electrolyte solution
      level in each reactor. The conduits combine to connect to a
      reservoir 12 through solenoid valve 18. Reactor 11A is configured
      with a level sensor 23. In response to sensor 23 sensing a low
      level condition, a pump 13 pumps electrolyte solution from
      reservoir 12 into reactors 11A, 11B, 11C and 11D through a single
      inlet provided in reactor 11A. Because the reactors are maintained
      in electrolyte communication, hydrostatic pressure acts to
      equalize the solution levels in all four reactors. In response to
      sensor 23 sensing a high level condition, solenoid valve 18 opens
      to drain electrolyte from the reactors into reservoir 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The cathode chamber of each reactor 11A, 11B, 11C and 11D
      is electrically grounded, or electrically connected to the
      negative terminal of an electrical DC power source 48. Each
      reactor 11A, 11B, 11C and 11D is configured with an anode 20A,
      20B, 20C and 20D, respectively, as in previously described
      embodiments. Each anode is connected to the positive terminal of
      power source 48 through a relay contact 46A, 46B, 46C, or 46D, as
      shown. The electrical circuit for the relay contacts is shown in
      FIG. 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In one embodiment shown in FIG. 8, the control system
      comprises a programmable logic controller 49 coupled to, or having
      an integral memory 50. In this embodiment, the control system
      components are considered an integral part of the electrical power
      source that supplies power to the reactors. These components may
      be physically located within the vehicle that house the engine, or
      they may be located within a control module external to the
      vehicle, for example, within a module mounted on a portable skid
      that includes the reactor and its components.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Controller 49 may be any microprocessor known in the art
      and suitable for accepting digital input signals and outputting
      digital control signals in response to the input signals according
      to one or more control algorithms maintained in memory 50. In the
      present example, controller 49 is coupled to relays 51A, 51B, 51C
      and 51D, each operatively connected to actuate (or close) its
      corresponding contact 46A, 46B, 46C or 46D in response to
      receiving an actuation signal from controller 49.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] A schematic for a relay 51 is shown in FIG. 9. An actuation
      signal presented across input terminals 54 closes contact 46.
      Contact 46 is electrically isolated from the actuating circuit. In
      the schematic, terminals 54 may be the terminals of a magnetic
      coil, or they may be the input gate of a transistor. Thus, relay
      51 may comprise a magnetic relay, a solid state relay, or any
      suitable equivalent.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] One example of a starting sequence for the system will now
      be described. Initially, the engine is off, contacts 46A, 46B, 46C
      and 46D are open, and none of the reactors are energized. When the
      engine ignition switch is turned on, an ignition sensor 52 sends a
      signal, such as a logical one, to controller 49 indicating that
      the ignition switch is on. Controller 49 inputs this signal and
      awaits a second input signal indicating that the engine is
      running. The second signal may be derived from a number of engine
      sensors, such as an oil pressure sensor or an RPM sensor 53. When
      the engine achieves a desired RPM, sensor 53 sends an
      engine-running signal to controller 49. Upon receipt of the second
      (engine-running) signal, controller 49 executes a starting
      algorithm stored in memory 50, which directs controller 49 to
      actuate one or more relays 51A, 51B, 51C and 51D. As each relay
      closes, its corresponding reactor is energized to produce hydrogen
      and oxygen gas by electrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The number of reactors energized by controller 49 may vary
      according to the RPM value, or according to a particular
      algorithm. For example, during an engine cold-start condition,
      engine pollutants can be particularly high because the cold
      temperature inhibits combustion of hydrocarbons. To address this
      condition, a starting algorithm can be programmed to initially
      energize a plurality of reactors in order to produce an abundance
      of hydrogen and oxygen to assist with combustion. After the engine
      warms up to a steady-state condition, the algorithm may cause one
      or more of the reactors to de-energize, as necessary. An engine
      steady-state indicator 55 may be provided for this purpose, i.e.
      to transmit a steady-state status indication to controller 49.
      Various parameters may be monitored to provide a source for the
      steady-state indication. For example, engine running time, engine
      oil pressure, engine oil temperature, engine coolant temperature,
      reactor solution temperature, or engine exhaust chemistry may be
      used to provide this indication.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In another embodiment, an algorithm may be provided to
      allow the controller to energize one or more of the reactors in
      response to engine demand. Engine demand may be represented by a
      signal such as engine RPM, and transmitted to controller 49 by RPM
      sensor 53. For example, a single reactor may be energized for a
      low range of RPM (0 to 1000), a second reactor may be energized
      for a higher ranger of RPM (1000 to 1500), a third reactor may be
      energized for the next range (1500 to 2000), and so on. Reactors
      may then be de-energized as RPM decreases. In another aspect,
      engine demand may be represented by a signal transmitted from a
      throttle position sensor.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In another embodiment, controller 49 and/or memory 50 may
      be configured with one or more counters that keep track of the
      service time for each reactor to enable the controller to shift
      reactor duty cycles. For example, a count maintained in a counter
      may represent the total time (in minutes or hours) that a reactor
      has been energized. Algorithms may then instruct controller 49 to
      energize reactors according to a priority such that reactor
      service times are equalized over time. If, at a particular engine
      start, reactor 11D has the lowest count among all reactors in a
      system, it is assigned a highest priority to ensure that it sees
      additional service time even when fewer than all reactors need to
      be energized to satisfy engine demand. In that instance, reactors
      with the highest counts (and lower priorities) may remain
      temporarily de-energized. At a subsequent engine start, if the
      service time of reactor 11D has since exceeded the service time of
      another reactor, controller 49 may shift the duty from reactor 11D
      to a reactor with higher priority.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In another embodiment, the electrical power source and its
      associated control system may be configured to energize initially
      a first set of one or more reactors when the engine starts, and
      upon a subsequent start, to energize initially a second set of one
      or more reactors. The second set of reactors may have some
      reactors in common with the first set of reactors, provided that
      there is at least one reactor in the second set that is absent
      from the first set. This provides another means for the control
      system to shift duty cycles among the reactors, since at least one
      reactor will remain idle. Over time, each reactor will see a
      substantially equal amount of service time. This advantageously
      maximizes the service time of the system between maintenance
      intervals.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In another embodiment of the invention, the outlet conduit
      of each reactor 11A, 11B, 11C and 11D may be configured with an
      isolation valve 56A, 56B, 56C or 56D, respectively. These may be
      manual valves, or they may be valves that can be closed
      automatically by the control system. In cases where engine demand
      requires one or more reactors to remain idle, it may be
      advantageous to isolate the air space of the idle reactors to
      reduce the load on the vacuum drawn by the intake manifold. Each
      solenoid valve may be energized and de-energized by a controller
      49 and relay 51 in the same manner that the reactors are energized
      and de-energized. This provision for isolating a reactor also
      allows an inoperable, redundant reactor to be temporarily valved
      out of service.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In accordance with the foregoing disclosure, methods of the
      present invention will now be described. FIG. 10 illustrates one
      embodiment of a method 1000 for generating hydrogen and oxygen by
      electrolysis of water according to engine demand. The method
      begins at step 1002, which comprises maintaining a plurality of
      electrolytic reactors in electrolyte communication. Electrolytic
      communication is achieved by connecting each reactor chamber to at
      least one other reactor chamber from among the plurality of
      reactors, such that all connections are made to allow electrolyte
      solution to flow from one reactor to another. The next step is
      step 1004, which comprises providing a reservoir in electrolyte
      communication with at least one of the reactors.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Next, step 1006 comprises sensing the level of electrolyte
      solution in the reactors. Provided that the reactors are
      maintained in electrolyte communication, it is only necessary to
      sense the solution level in any one of the reactors, as its level
      will be substantially equal to the level in all others. The next
      step is step 1008. This step comprises controlling the solution
      level in the reactors responsive to the level sensed in the
      previous step. As discussed in previous embodiments, a control
      circuit comprising the sensor, the reservoir, one or more pumps,
      one or more valves, and a power source may be used to effect this
      step. Next, in step 1010, one or more of the reactors are
      electrically energized responsive to engine demand. Energization
      of the reactors begins the electrolysis process that produces
      hydrogen and oxygen gas. To counteract the resulting temperature
      rise within the reactors, step 1012 is performed. Step 1012
      comprises cooling the reactors during energization, which may be
      accomplished by circulating the electrolyte solution though a heat
      exchanger, or by providing a passive heat sink for transferring
      heat from the reactor vessels. The final step is step 1014,
      wherein hydrogen and oxygen reaction products are directed from
      the reactors to the intake system of the internal combustion
      engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Another method according to the invention is illustrated in
      FIG. 11. This method begins at step 1102. Steps 1102 and 1104 are
      identical to steps 1002 and 1004 of the previous embodiment. In
      the next step 1106, an electrolyte solution is circulated through
      the reactors. This particular solution consists of 2 to 4% sodium
      hydroxide, 10 to 20% alcohol, and a balance of deionized water. In
      one example, the alcohol is methanol. In step 1108 a reactor
      solution level is sensed, and in step 1110 reactor solution levels
      are controlled responsive to the sensed level. The next step is
      1112, wherein, responsive to engine demand, one or more of the
      reactors are energized with an energizing current of between about
      60 and about 80 amps. In the final step 1114, the gaseous hydrogen
      and oxygen reaction products are directed from the reactors to the
      engine intake system.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The invention has been presented in an illustrative style.
      The terminology employed throughout should be read in an exemplary
      rather than a limiting manner. While various exemplary embodiments
      have been shown and described, it should be apparent to one of
      ordinary skill in the art that there are many more embodiments
      that are within the scope of the subject invention. Accordingly,
      the invention is not to be restricted, except in light of the
      appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
