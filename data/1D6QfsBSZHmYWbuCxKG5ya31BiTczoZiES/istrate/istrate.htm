      </b><b>Excerpt : Email from L. C.</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Ioan Istrate</b> is a well-known Romanian scientist and
      chemical engineer who made several inventions in the field of
      pharmacology. He is an old man of 85 and he also is one of my
      neighbors. <br>
      <br>
      Since 2000 he used the "Celulact H" (the drug from the patent)
      against cirrhosis and cancer, with excellent effects on patients.
      He saved a lot of people from a certain death, people who were in
      critical condition, with cancer in terminal phase.<br>
      <br>
      His drug is a processing of the natural soap made from sheep
      tallow, through which the C14 - C18 monocarboxylic acids are
      separated from the other components of tallow, thus obtained pure
      monocarboxylic acids which are administered to the patient.<br>

      Mr. Ioan Istrate is a man so modest, that seems a guest in his own
      house. Age has given an aura of wisdom that it's hard to not put
      in it. Many of you have already seen on some TV channels,
      presenting their invention: H Celulact natural product that is
      able to stop the cancer and heal other very serious diseases.
      Despite the fame created overnight public attention bothers Mr.
      Istrate. When I phoned to propose this interview he hardly agreed
      to meet. "No words matter, but actions" - said. "And then, when I
      have time I see my own business, if I still hold interviews and
      filming?" Seeing me interested primarily works exactly the
      concrete results of treatment that you apply under promise not to
      keep too much of the work, Mr. Istrate gave me half an hour of his
      time...<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Ioan Istrate is a chemical engineer, specializing in the
      production of medicines and profession who practiced law stepped
      entire life, following his passion for chemistry, passion gained
      in years of high school.<br>
      <br>
      "I wanted to know the secrets behind the chemical formulas, so I
      can explain the great miracle that happens every moment in nature
      and within the human being.'s Fascinating to discover the universe
      of water drops ... Who knows chemistry better understand life, and
      maintenance phenomena. "<br>
      <br>
      Graduated from the Faculty of Industrial Chemistry in Bucharest,
      Department Summaries fine, medicines and dyes, it proved to be one
      of the best students of his generation, became the teacher's
      favorite CD Nenitescu and E. Cioranescu, brand names in Romanian
      higher education.<br>
      <br>
      Later, as a specialist in medicine, he was, in turn, leading
      positions in the pharmaceutical industry: the technical chief of
      the Central Industrial Medicines, chief of the technical-economic
      indices and technical documentation Scientific Research Institute
      of Chemical-Pharmaceutical Bucharest chief of CTC the enterprise
      of Medicine Bucharest etc.O idea came from heaven<br>
      <br>
      - Sir John Istrate, which is the story Celulact preparation H? How
      did you discover?<br>
      <br>
      - I possess some psychic powers. I wrote a book on the vision that
      I have: "Romania and world time - past, present and future." In
      April 24, 1971 I received some messages about the future of
      humanity. Among them, some about cancer and what to do about a
      cancer patient to survive. Two events, occurring in the family,
      led me to my direct attention to a possible cure for cancer. My
      father was ill with cancer and died due to this disease in 1981
      Much later I learned the formula structure of the active substance
      in the product that I made. As a specialist, I looked to see where
      I can take this substance. It took me several years of research,
      but I finally found it. In 1995, my sister was diagnosed with
      cancer, underwent surgery Coltea Hospital and doctors gave
      opportunities for more than two or three months of life. We did
      have a treat. Unfortunately, the year he died of a heart attack.
      Applying family therapy and acquaintances, I began to record all
      the results and excited curative effect, I made ??the
      documentation for registration with OSIM.<br>
      <br>
      Celulact H is made from animal and plant extracts in the form of
      gelatin capsules, which is very easy to manage. It is non-toxic.
      In fighting cancer, give better results than classical oncological
      treatment. Think about how bad produce body irradiation: in
      addition to the diseased cells are destroyed and healthy cells
      irradiated area. For chemotherapy, not to mention? You know, of
      course, many side effects so this treatment ...<br>
      <br>
      - Keep your preparation secret jealously However, we have to
      explain in a simple way how he acts on cancer cells?<br>
      <br>
      - Product name - Celulact H - says practically and how the body
      works at the cellular level: cells activated by hydrogen radicals.
      In the cell, specifically in the nucleus, there are - let's call
      it - a kind of "mayonnaise" which at one time cut. Well, then all
      biochemical reactions go crazy: the cells grow chaotically detach
      and spread throughout the body and is transported bloodstream. As
      housewives recover mayonnaise "cut" the same acts and Celulact H,
      which restores cellular structure affected, bringing it to normal,
      functional. Component substances released by biochemical processes
      of hydrogen radicals, which regenerate diseased cells, and on the
      death of the body to eliminate them in the form of phlegm in lung
      cancer and the bleeding in uterine cancer, rectal, stomach and
      Ent.<br>
      <br>
      - Your product, Celulact H, has proven effective only in cancer?<br>
      <br>
      - The best results are undoubtedly in the prevention and treatment
      of diseases and cancer cell (lung cancer, renal cancer, prostate
      cancer, breast cancer, multiple myeloma), but the experience time
      and recommend other illnesses: leukemia, cirrhosis, multiple
      sclerosis, osteoporosis, Parkinson's, diabetes, chronic hepatitis,
      gastric ulcer and duodenal cystic mastoze psoriasis all types of
      anemia, bronchitis, asthma, seizures (epilepsy). It also promotes
      growth in children and rejuvenates aging cells.<br>
      <br>
      - Speaking strictly of cancer, what types and stages of evolution
      have noticed the best results?<br>
      <br>
      - Healing and improvements following treatment with Celulact H
      were observed, in order to cancer the following locations: liver,
      stomach, lung, pancreas, breast, etc., the most difficult to treat
      (the longest duration of treatment ) is bone cancer. Pity the sick
      resort to remedies and natural treatments only when doctors and
      conventional medicine no longer given a chance. Usually, my wine
      in bulk, cancer patients in stage III or IV, the already very weak
      body, discharged to die at home. But they can be helped.<br>
      <br>
      - How long is the treatment?<br>
      <br>
      - Treatment is long lasting. It is essential that patients to feed
      very well. It is the strength of the success of this treatment. We
      observed cell Biostimulator effect on the body and I can tell and
      ill treatment stages: in the first month the disease progresses,
      but increasingly slower. In the second month explodes disease, the
      patient giving different symptoms: pain, nausea, etc. From the
      third month, any type of cancer is stopped evolving, following
      that of the time to be absorbed tumor and metastases and to stop
      the evolution and then disappear. Tangible results are seen at the
      earliest after three, five or nine months of treatment, depending
      on the location of the cancer, the organs affected and the
      patient's age. It is important to mention that tumors larger than
      five centimeters does not resorb. Leukemia treated in two or three
      years, and ulcers in three to six months.<br>
      <br>
      - Treatment can be done in parallel to allopathic medicine?<br>
      <br>
      - Celulact H can be associated with any allopathic medicine
      recommended by your doctor. In cancer, however, not recommend
      treatment with chemotherapy and irradiation or because in some
      cases cancel has occurred.<br>
      <br>
      - During treatment, you should follow a certain diet?<br>
      <br>
      - Patients should be well fed, but avoid pork and mutton, animal
      fats in general and consume 2-3 liters of fluid daily to remove
      toxins. Patients with breast cysts or breast cancer will be
      eliminated from the diet milk. During treatment will consume as
      much tea marigold, rosehip and sea buckthorn yellow.<br>
      - Is there any contraindication for administration of your
      preparation?<br>
      <br>
      - Absolutely no one. The treatment can be followed by anyone, even
      by children, the incidence of leukemia that has become alarming.<br>
      <br>
      - What documents must provide patient care?<br>
      <br>
      - Patients must have on their sheet out of the hospital, said the
      doctor diagnosis, disease-specific laboratory tests, x-rays,
      tomography, scintigraphy, mammography or other documents that
      attest to the degree of evolution of bolii.Cazuri<br>

      - D.N. (34 years) - Bucharest: "Following a biopsy, I was
      diagnosed with epidermoid carcinoma spino-cellular stage IIB and
      have been proposed for a surgery that I had the courage to do it.
      Istrate I learned from Mr. a friend and I started taking Celulact
      H in February this year result will honestly say, is amazing.
      recently I made ??a NMR analysis, which did not detect even a hint
      of carcinoma. continue to undergo treatment and I i feel good.

      was found a malignant lung tumor. I started Mr. Ioan Istrate
      treatment after doctors told me they do not have what I do and I
      still have three months to live., three months, you hear? But I
      started treatment in September 1999! Now I feel much better.

      did not work. Then I started treatment Mr. Istrate, without have
      high hopes ... however, ultrasound result we did on July 25
      reveals that all bodies are perfect, there was no lymphadenopathy,
      the tumor is well localized and delimited . the doctor I consulted
      advised me to do further treatment because my illness - that is
      evolutionary - remained in the same stage ".Florentin Popa<br>

      </b><b>Preparation :</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In a 6-liter stainless steel vessel, equipped with a stirrer and
      reflux condenser, place 2 liter of water; while stirring add 0.2
      kg caustic soda. The solution is heated to boiling. Gradually add
      1.1 kg animal fat. After completion of the saponification
      reaction, add sodium chloride 0.080 kg, the heating is stopped.<br>
      <br>
      The reaction takes about 3 hr, rising to the surface of the liquid
      soap and glycerin in alkaline waters.<br>
      <br>
      Over soap left in the beaker, add 2 liters of water in which is
      dissolved 110 gram citric acid solution; reduce the pH down to
      5.5. The operation takes about 1.5 hour, and C14-C18 acids were
      separated from the solution.<br>
      <br>
      The acid obtained is washed with hot water to remove all the
      sodium chloride; if the resulting acids were dark, dry in vacuum
      at 15 to 17 mm Hg, or boiling acids dehydrate, the operation takes
      about 3-4 hr.<br>
      <br>
      Characterization of the product: mixture of C4-C18 monocarboxylic
      acids, is a solid, yellow-colored, light brown, with a melting
      point of 70 -73 C and a boiling point ranging between 124 and 134
      C, but the boiling point may increase depending on the ratio of
      the component acids. The acids are soluble in alkaline solutions
      and ether, benzene, halogen, absolute ethanol; are resistant to
      oxidation; density is around 0.840.<br>
