            to Gather Drinking Water</b></big><br>

      Around the world, 768 million people don’t have access to safe
      water, and every day 1,400 children under the age of five die from
      water-based diseases. Designer Arturo <br>
      <br>
      Vittori believes the solution to this catastrophe lies not in high
      technology, but in sculptures that look like giant-sized objects
      from the pages of a Pier 1 catalog.<br>
      <br>
      His stunning water towers stand nearly 30 feet tall and can
      collect over 25 gallons of potable water per day by harvesting
      atmospheric water vapor. Called WarkaWater towers, each pillar is
      comprised of two sections: a semi-rigid exoskeleton built by tying
      stalks of juncus or bamboo together and an internal plastic mesh,
      reminiscent of the bags oranges come in. The nylon and
      polypropylene fibers act as a scaffold for condensation, and as
      the droplets of dew form, they follow the mesh into a basin at the
      base of the structure.<br>
      <br>
      “WarkaWater is designed to provide clean water as well as ensure
      long-term environmental, financial and social sustainability,”
      says designer Arturo Vittori. <br>
      <br>
      Vittori decided to devote his attention to this problem after
      visiting northeastern Ethiopia and seeing the plight of remote
      villagers first hand. “There, people live in a beautiful natural
      environment but often without running water, electricity, a toilet
      or a shower,” he says. To survive, women and their children walk
      for miles to worm-filled ponds contaminated with human waste,
      collect water in trashed plastic containers or dried gourds, and
      carry the heavy containers on treacherous roads back to their
      homes. This process takes hours and endangers the children by
      exposing them to dangerous illnesses and taking them away from
      school, ensuring that a cycle of poverty repeats.<br>
      <br>
      Exposure to this horrific scene motivated Vittori to take action.
      “WarkaWater is designed to provide clean water as well as ensure
      long-term environmental, financial and social sustainability,” he
      says. “Once locals have the necessary know how, they will be able
      to teach others villages and communities to build the WarkaWater
      towers.” Each tower costs approximately $550 and can be built in
      under a week with a four-person team and locally available
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      A more obvious solution to a water shortage would be digging a
      well, but drilling 1,500 feet into Ethiopia’s rocky plateaus is
      expensive. Even when a well is dug, maintaining pumps and ensuring
      a reliable electrical connection makes the proposition unlikely.<br>
      <br>
      Though the structure is made from organic material, Vittori
      designed it using traditional CAD tools.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of looking to Western technology for a solution, Vittori
      was inspired by the Warka tree, a giant, gravity-defying domed
      tree native to Ethiopia that sprouts figs and is used as a
      community gathering space. “To make people independent, especially
      in such a rural context it’s synonymous of a sustainable project
      and guaranties the longevity,” says Vittori. “Using natural fibers
      helps the tower to be integrated with the landscape both visually
      with the natural context as well as with local traditional
      techniques.”<br>
      <br>
      The design has been two years in the making and though the final
      product is handcrafted, Vittori has used the same parametric
      modeling skills honed working on aircraft interiors and solar
      powered cars to create a solution that is safe and stunning. The
      88-pound sculpture is 26-feet wide at its broadest point but
      swoops dramatically to just a few feet across at its smallest
      point. Vittori and his team have tested the design in multiple
      locations and worked in improvements that increase the frame’s
      stability while simultaneously making it easy for villagers to
      clean the internal mesh.<br>
      <br>
      Vittori hopes to have two WarkaTowers erected in Ethiopia by 2015
      and is looking for financial rainmakers who’d like to seed these
      tree-inspired structures across the&nbsp; country.<br>

      'WarkaWater'&nbsp; is a project conceived for the mountainous
      regions in Ethiopia, where women and children walk several hours
      to collect water. To ease this dramatic condition, the studio
      ‘Architecture and Vision’ is developing the project ‘WarkaWater’
      which is harvesting potable water from the air and honors the
      disappearing Ethiopian warka trees. The 9 m tall bamboo framework
      has a special fabric hanging inside capable to collect potable
      water from the air by condensation. The lightweight structure is
      designed with parametric computing, but can be built with local
      skills and materials by the village inhabitants.<br>
      <br>
      Background: Insufficient access to water for people in Ethiopia<br>
