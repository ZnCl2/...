    <blockquote>When we first got the call from an excited colleague
      that he'd just seen the most amazing invention -- a magnetic motor
      that consumed almost no electricity -- we were so skeptical that
      we declined an invitation to go see it. If the technology was so
      good, we thought, how come they didn't have any customers yet?
      <p>We forgot about the invitation and the company until several
        months later, when our friend called again. </p>
      <p>"OK," he said. "They've just sold 40,000 units to a major
        convenience store chain. Now will you see it?" </p>
      <p>In Japan, no one pays for 40,000 convenience store cooling fans
        without being reasonably sure that they are going to work. </p>
      <p><b>The Maestro ~</b> </p>
      <p>The streets of east Shinjuku are littered with the tailings of
        the many small factories and workshops still located there --
        hardly one's image of the headquarters of a world-class
        technology company. But this is where we are first greeted
        outside Kohei Minato's workshop by Nobue Minato, the wife of the
        inventor and co-director of the family firm. </p>
      <p>The workshop itself is like a Hollywood set of an inventor's
        garage. Electrical machines, wires, measuring instruments and
        batteries are strewn everywhere. Along the diagram-covered walls
        are drill presses, racks of spare coils, Perspex plating and
        other paraphernalia. And seated in the back, head bowed in
        thought, is the 58-year-old techno maestro himself. </p>
      <p>Minato is no newcomer to the limelight. In fact, he has been an
        entertainer for most of his life, making music and producing his
        daughter's singing career in the US. He posseses an oversized
        presence, with a booming voice and a long ponytail. In short,
        you can easily imagine him onstage or in a convertible cruising
        down the coast of California -- not hunched over a mass of wires
        and coils in Tokyo's cramped backstreets. </p>
      <p>Joining us are a middle-aged banker and his entourage from
        Osaka and accounting and finance consultant Yukio Funai. The
        banker is doing a quick review for an investment, while the rest
        of us just want to see if Minato's magnetic motors really work.
        A prototype car air conditioner cooler sitting on a bench looks
        like it would fit into a Toyota Corolla and quickly catches our
        attention.</p>

    <blockquote><b>Seeing is Believing ~</b>
      <p>Nobue then takes us through the functions and operations of
        each of the machines, starting off with a simple explanation of
        the laws of magnetism and repulsion. She demonstrates the
        "Minato Wheel" by kicking a magnet-lined rotor into action with
        a magnetic wand. </p>
      <p>Looking carefully at the rotor, we see that it has over 16
        magnets embedded on a slant --&nbsp; apparently to make Minato's
        machines work, the positioning and angle of the magnets is
        critical. After she kicks the wheel into life, it keeps
        spinning, proving at least that the design doesn't suffer from
        magnetic lockup. </p>
      <p>She then moves us to the next device, a weighty machine
        connected to a tiny battery. Apparently the load on the machine
        is a 35kg rotor, which could easily be used in a washing
        machine. After she flicks the switch, the huge rotor spins at
        over 1,500 rpms effortlessly and silently. Meters show the power
        in and power out. Suddenly, a power source of 16 watt or so is
        driving a device that should be drawing at least 200 to 300
        watts. </p>
      <p>Nobue explains to us that this and all the other devices only
        use electrical power for the two electromagnetic stators at
        either side of each rotor, which are used to kick the rotor past
        its lockup point then on to the next arc of magnets. Apparently
        the angle and spacing of the magnets is such that once the rotor
        is moving, repulsion between the stators and the rotor poles
        keeps the rotor moving smoothly in a counterclockwise direction.
        Either way, it's impressive. </p>
      <p>Next we move to a unit with its motor connected to a generator.
        What we see is striking. The meters showed an input to the
        stator electromagnets of approximately 1.8 volts and 150mA
        input, and from the generator, 9.144 volts and 192mA output. 1.8
        x 0.15 x 2 = 540mW input and 9.144 x 0.192 = 1.755W out. </p>
      <p>But according to the laws of physics, you can't get more out of
        a device than you put into it. We mention this to Kohei Minato
        while looking under the workbench to make sure there aren't any
        hidden wires. </p>
      <p>Minato assures us that he hasn't transcended the laws of
        physics. The force supplying the unexplained extra power out is
        generated by the magnetic strength of the permanent magnets
        embedded in the rotor. "I'm simply harnessing one of the four
        fundamental forces of nature," he says. </p>
      <p>Although we learned in school that magnets were always bipolar
        and so magnetically induced motion would always end in a locked
        state of equilibrium, Minato explains that he has fine-tuned the
        positioning of the magnets and the timing of pulses to the
        stators to the point where the repulsion between the rotor and
        the stator (the fixed outer magnetic ring) is transitory. This
        creates further motion -- rather than a lockup. (See the sidebar
        on page 41 for a full explanation).</p>

    <blockquote><b>Real Products ~</b>
      <p>Nobue Minato leads us to the two devices that might convince a
        potential investor that this is all for real. </p>
      <p>First, she shows us the cooling fan prototype that is being
        manufactured for a convenience store chain's 14,000 outlets (3
        fans per outlet). The unit looks almost identical to a
        Mitsubishi-manufactured fan unit next to it, which is the unit
        currently in wide use. In a test, the airflow from both units is
        about the same. </p>
      <p>The other unit is the car air conditioning prototype that
        caught our eye as we came in. It's a prototype for Nippon Denso,
        Japan's largest manufacturer of car air conditioners. The unit
        is remarkably compact and has the same contours and size as a
        conventional unit. Minato's manufacturing skills are clearly
        improving.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>The Banker and his Investment ~</b>
      <p>Minato has good reason to complain about Japan's social and
        cultural uniformity. For years, people thought of him as an
        oddball for playing the piano for a living, and bankers and
        investors have avoided him because of his habit of claiming that
        he'd discovered a breakthrough technology all by himself --
        without any formal training. </p>
      <p>However, the Osaka banker stands up after the lecture and
        announces that before he goes, he will commit \100 million to
        the investment pool. </p>
      <p>Minato turns to us and smiles. We brought him good luck, and
        this was his third investor in as many weeks to confirm an
        interest. </p>
      <p><b>Bringing the Tech to the Table ~</b> </p>
      <p>With the audience gone, we ask Minato what he plans to do to
        commercialize the technology. His game plan is simple and clear,
        he says. He wants to retain control, and he wants to
        commercialize the technology in Japan first -- where he feels he
        can ensure that things get done right. Why doesn't he go
        directly to the US or China? His experiences in both countries,
        he suggests, have been less than successful. "The first stage is
        critical in terms of creating good products and refining the
        technology. I don't want to be busy with legal challenges and IP
        theft while doing that." </p>
      <p>Still, the export and licensing of the technology are on his
        agenda, and Minato is talking to a variety of potential partners
        in other countries. </p>
      <p>Whereas another inventor might be tempted to outsource
        everything to a larger corporation, part of what drives Minato
        is his vision of social justice and responsibility. The 40,000
        motors for the convenience store chain are being produced by a
        group of small manufacturers in Ohta-ku and Bunkyo-ku, in the
        inner north of Tokyo -- which is becoming a regional rust belt.
        Minato is seized with the vision of reinvigorating these small
        workshops that until the 80s were the bedrock of Japan's
        manufacturing and economic miracle. Their level of expertise
        will ensure that the quality of the motors will be as good as
        those from any major company.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>International Prep ~</b>
      <p>Despite his plan to do things domestically first, Minato is
        well prepared for the international markets. He is armed with
        both six years of living and doing business in Los Angeles in
        the early 90s -- and with patent protection for over 48
        countries. His is hardly a provincial perspective. </p>
      <p>His US experience came after playing the piano for a living for
        15 years. He began tinkering with his invention in the mid-70s.
        The idea for his magnetic motor design came from a burst of
        inspiration while playing the piano. </p>
      <p>But Minato decided to drop everything in 1990 to help his
        daughter Hiroko, who at the age of 20 decided that she wanted to
        be a rhythm and blues star in the US. Minato is a strong
        believer in family: If Hiroko was going to find fame and fortune
        in the US, Dad had better be there to help manage her. He
        suceeded in helping Hiroko to achieve a UK dance chart number
        one hit in 1995. </p>
      <p>In 1996 Minato returned to Japan and his magnetic motor
        project. The following year he displayed his prototypes to
        national power companies, government officials and others at a
        five-day conference in Mexico City. Interest was palpable, and
        Minato realized that his invention might meet a global need for
        energy-saving devices. </p>
      <p>Subsequent previews and speeches in Korea and Singapore further
        consolidated his commitment to bringing the invention to
        fruition, and he was able to bring in several early-stage
        investors. </p>
      <p>During the late 90s, Minato continued to refine his prototypes.
        He also stayed in constant contact with his lawyer, registering
        patents in major countries around the world. Through his
        experiences in the US he realized that legal protection was
        critical, even if it meant delaying release of the technology by
        a couple of years. </p>
      <p>Ironically, by the time he'd won patents in 47 countries, the
        Japanese patent office turned him down on the grounds that "[the
        invention] couldn' t possibly work" and that somehow he was
        fabricating the claims. </p>
      <p>But a few months later they were forced to recant their
        decision after the US patent office recognized his invention and
        gave him the first of two patents. As Minato notes: "How typical
        of Japan's small-minded bureaucrats that they needed the
        leadership of the US to accept that my invention was genuine." </p>
      <p>By 2001, the Minatos had refined their motors and met enough
        potential investors to enter into a major international
        relationship, initially with a Saudi company, to be followed
        thereafter by companies in the US and elsewhere. </p>
      <p>However, fate dealt the investors and Minato's business a
        serious blow when the World Trade Center was attacked in New
        York. The Saudis retreated, and Minato's plans fell back to
        square one. </p>
      <p>Now Minato is once again ready to move. With the first order in
        the works and more orders pending successful prototypes, he has
        decided that investors don't have to be primary partners. He is
        actively accepting inquiries from corporate investors who can
        bring strategic advantages and corporate credibility with them.
        His company, Japan Magnetic Fan, will make a series of
        investment tie-up announcements in the first and second quarters
        of 2004.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Implications ~</b>
      <p>Minato's motors consume just 20 percent or less of the power of
        conventional motors with the same torque and horse power. They
        run cool to the touch and produce almost no acoustic or
        electrical noise. They are significantly safer and cheaper (in
        terms of power consumed), and they are sounder environmentally.
      </p>
      <p>The implications are enormous. In the US alone, almost 55
        percent of the nation's electricity is consumed by electric
        motors. While most factory operators buy the cheapest motors
        possible, they are steadily being educated by bodies like NEMA
        (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) that the costs
        of running a motor over a typical 20-year lifespan comprise a
        purchase price of just 3 percent of the total, and electricity
        costs of 97 percent. It is not unusual for a $2,000 motor to
        consume $80,000 of electricity (at a price of .06 cents per
        kilowatt hour). </p>
      <p>Since 1992, when efficiency legislation was put into place at
        the US federal level, motor efficiency has been a high priority
        -- and motors saving 20 percent or so on electrical bills are
        considered highly efficient. Minato is about to introduce a
        motor which saves 80 percent, putting it into an entirely new
        class: The $80,000 running cost will drop to just $16,000. This
        is a significant savings when multiplied by the millions of
        motors used throughout the USA and Japan -- and eventually,
        throughout the world.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>The Devices ~</b>
      <p>Minato's invention and its ability to use remarkably less power
        and run without heat or noise make it perfect for home
        appliances, personal computers, cellphones (a miniature
        generator is in the works) and other consumer products. </p>
      <p>The magnetic motor will be cheaper than a standard motor to
        make, as the rotor and stator assemblies can be set into plastic
        housings, due to the fact that the system creates very little
        heat. Further, with the motor's energy efficiency, it will be
        well suited for any application where a motor has limited energy
        to drive it. While development is still focused on replacing
        existing devices, Minato says that his motor has sufficient
        torque to power a vehicle. </p>
      <p>With the help of magnetic propulsion, it is feasible to attach
        a generator to the motor and produce more electric power than
        was put into the device. Minato says that average efficiency on
        his motors is about 330 percent. </p>
      <p>Mention of Over Unity devices in many scientific circles will
        draw icy skepticism. But if you can accept the idea that
        Minato's device is able to create motion and torque through its
        unique, sustainable permanent magnet propulsion system, then it
        makes sense that he is able to get more out of the unit than he
        puts in in terms of elctrical power. Indeed, if the device can
        produce a surplus of power for longer periods, every household
        in the land will want one. </p>
      <p>"I am not in this for the money," Minato says. "I have done
        well in my musical career, but I want to make a contribution to
        society -- helping the backstreet manufacturers here in Japan
        and elsewhere. I want to reverse the trends caused by major
        multinationals. There is a place for corporations. But as the
        oil industry has taught us, energy is one area where a
        breakthrough invention like this cannot be trusted to large
        companies." </p>
      <p>Minato was once close to making a deal with Enron. But today,
        he is firmly on a mission to support the small and the
        independent -- and to go worldwide with them and his amazing
        machine. "Our plan is to rally smaller companies and pool their
        talent, and to one day produce the technology across a wide
        range of fields." </p>

        connected so as to be rotatable in opposite directions in a
        cooperating manner. A number of permanent magnets are arranged
        on a circumferential portion of the first rotor at regular
        intervals, and just as many permanent magnets are arranged on a
        circumferential portion of the second rotor at regular
        intervals. Each permanent magnet has one magnetic polarity
        located radially outward from the rotors, and has the other
        magnetic polarity located radially inward toward the rotors. The
        polarity of each permanent magnet, which is located radially
        outward from the rotors, is identical. When the first and second
        rotors are rotated in a cooperating manner, the phase of
        rotation of the permanent magnets of one rotor is slightly
        advanced from that of the permanent magnets of the other rotor.
        One of the permanent magnets of one rotor is replaced with the
        electromagnet. The radially outward polarity of the
        electromagnet can be changed by reversing the direction in which
        a current is supplied to the electromagnet. </p>

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a magnetic rotation apparatus
        in which a pair of rotors are rotated by utilizing a magnetic
        force. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND ART</b> </p>
      <p>An electromotor is well known as a rotation apparatus utilizing
        a magnetic force. For example, an AC electromotor comprises a
        rotor having a coil, a stator surrounding the rotor, and a
        plurality of electromagnets, disposed on the stator, for
        generating a rotating magnetic field. An electric power must be
        constantly supplied to the electromagnets in order to generate
        the rotating magnetic field and keep the rotor rotating, i.e.,
        an external energy, or electric energy, is indispensable for the
        rotation of the rotor. </p>
      <p>Under the circumstances, a magnetic rotation apparatus, which
        employs permanent magnets in lieu of electromagnets and can
        rotate a rotor only by a magnetic force of the permanent
        magnets, is highly desirable. </p>
      <p>The present application proposes a magnetic rotation apparatus
        which comprises a pair of rotors rotatable in opposite
        directions in a cooperating manner, and a plurality of permanent
        magnets stationarily arranged at regular intervals on the
        peripheral portion of each rotor. One end portion of each
        permanent magnet of both rotors, which has the same polarity, is
        located radially outward of the rotors. When the two rotors are
        rotated in a cooperating fashion, a permanent magnet on one
        rotor and a corresponding permanent magnet on the other, which
        form a pair, approach and move away from each other
        periodically. In this case, the phase of rotation of the magnet
        on one rotor advances a little from that of the corresponding
        magnet on the other rotor. When the paired permanent magnets
        approach each other, magnetic repulsion causes one rotor to
        rotate. The rotation of one rotor is transmitted to the other
        rotor to rotate the same. In this manner, other pairs of magnets
        on both rotors sequentially approach each other, and magnetic
        repulsion occurs incessantly. As a result, the rotors continue
        to rotate. </p>
      <p>In the above apparatus, in order to stop the rotation of the
        rotors, a brake device is required. If an ordinary brake device
        is mounted on the magnetic rotation apparatus, the entire
        structure of the apparatus becomes complex, and a driving source
        for the brake device must be provided separately. </p>
      <p>The present invention has been developed in consideration of
        the above circumstances, and its object is to provide a magnetic
        rotation apparatus including a brake device for suitably
        stopping the rotation of rotors. </p>
      <p><b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The magnetic rotation apparatus of the present invention is
        provided with magnetic force conversion means which is
        substituted for at least one pair of permanent magnets of the
        paired rotors. In a normal state, the magnetic force conversion
        means causes a magnetic repulsion, as in the other pairs of
        permanent magnets. When it is intended for the rotors to stop,
        the magnetic force conversion means causes a magnetic attraction
        force. Since a magnetic attraction force can be produced between
        the rotors at any time, the magnetic attraction force serves to
        stop the rotors. The brake device constituted by the magnetic
        force conversion means differs from an ordinary brake device
        which forcibly stops a pair or rotors by using a frictional
        force. In the brake device of this invention, by converting a
        magnetic repulsion force to a magnetic attraction force, the
        rotors can be braked in the state that the movement of the
        rotors is reduced. Thus, the rotors can be stopped effectively.

      <p><b>BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 shows a magnetic rotation apparatus embodying the
        present invention. The magnetic rotation apparatus has frame 1.
        Frame 1 is provided with a pair of rotation shafts 2 which
        extend vertically and in parallel to each other. Shafts 2 are
        located at a predetermined distance from each other. Upper and
        lower ends of each shaft 2 are rotationally supported on frame 1
        via bearing 3. </p>
      <p>First rotor 4a is mounted on one of rotation shafts 2, second
        rotor 4b is mounted on the other rotation shaft 2. First and
        second rotors 4a and 4b are arranged on the same level. Rotors
        4a and 4b have similar structures. For example, each rotor 4a
        (4b) comprises two ring-shaped plates 5 which are spaced apart
        from each other in the axial direction of the rotation shaft 2.
      </p>
      <p>Gears 6a and 6b made of synthetic resin are, as cooperating
        means, attached to lower surfaces of first and second rotors 4a
        and 4b. The diameters of gears 6a and 6b are identical but
        larger than those of rotors 4a and 4b. Gears 6a and 6b mesh with
        each other. First and second rotors 4a and 4b are thus rotatable
        in opposite directions in a cooperating manner. In FIG. 1,
        reference numeral 7 indicates support arms for supporting first
        and second rotors 4a and 4b. </p>
      <p>For example, 16 magnets are arranged at regular intervals on a
        peripheral portion of first rotor 4a. These magnets are secured
        between two ring-shaped plates 5. In this embodiment, among the
        16 magnets, one is electromagnet 9a (see FIG. 2), and the others
        are permanent magnets 8a. FIG. 2 shows only some of permanent
        magnets 8a. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 3, permanent magnet 8a comprises case 10, and
        a plurality of rod-like ferromagnetic members 11 housed in case
        10. Ferromagnetic member 11 is, for example, a ferrite magnet.
        Ferromagnetic members 11 of each permanent magnet 8a are
        arranged such that ferromagnetic members 11 have the same
        polarity at one end. In first rotor 4a, for example, an
        N-polarity end portion of each permanent magnet 8a faces
        radially outward, and an S-polarity end portion of magnet 8a
        faces radially inward. As shown in FIG. 2, when each permanent
        magnet 8a is located between two shafts 2, angle C formed by
        longitudinal axis A of magnet 8a and imaginary line B connecting
        two shafts 2 is, for example, set to 30.degree. C. On the other
        hand, electromagnet 9a is, as shown in FIG. 4, constituted by
        U-shaped iron core 12, and coil 13 wound around core 12.
        Electromagnet 9a is arranged such that both N- and S-polarity
        end portions face radially outward of first rotor 4a, and the
        above-mentioned angle C is formed, similarly to the case of
        permanent magnet 8a. </p>
      <p>The same number of permanent magnets (8b,9b) as the total
        number of all permanent magnets and electromagnet (8a,9a) of
        first rotor 4a are secured on a peripheral portion of second
        rotor 4b at regular intervals. In FIG. 2, when first and second
        rotors 4a and 4b are rotated in opposite directions, each
        permanent magnet of second rotor 4b periodically moves toward
        and away from the corresponding one of the magnets (8a,9a) of
        first rotor 4a. </p>
      <p>The permanent magnets (8b,9b) of second rotor 4b will now be
        described in greater detail. Permanent magnets 8b of second
        rotor 4b, which periodically move toward and away from permanent
        magnets 8a of first rotor 4a in accordance with the rotation of
        rotors 4a and 4b, have a structure similar to that of permanent
        magnets 8a of first rotor 4a. The polarity of that end portion
        of each permanent magnet 8b which is located radially outward
        from second rotor 4b, is identical with that of the end portion
        of each permanent magnet 8a of first rotor 4a. That is, the
        radially outward portion of each permanent magnet 8b has an
        N-polarity. </p>
      <p>Permanent magnet 9b of second rotor 4b, which periodically
        moves toward and away from electromagnet 9a of first rotor 4a,
        has a structure shown in FIG. 4. Permanent magnet 9b has a
        structure similar to that of permanent magnets 8a. Both
        polarities of electromagnet 9a face radially outward from first
        rotor 4a. Permanent magnet 9b has two different polarities which
        face radially outward from second rotor 4b and correspond to
        both polarities of electromagnet 9a. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 2, when each permanent magnet 8b,9b is located
        between two rotation shafts 2, angle E formed by longitudinal
        axis D of the magnet (8b,9b) and imaginary line B connecting two
        shafts 2 is, for example, set to 56.degree. C. In addition, when
        rotors 4a and 4b are rotated in opposite directions, as shown by
        arrows, the magnets (8a,9a) of first rotor 4a move a little
        ahead of the corresponding permanent magnets (8b,9b) of second
        rotor 4b, in a region in which both magnets (8a,9a; 8b,9b)
        approach one another. In other words, the phase of rotation of
        the magnets (8a,9a) of first rotor 4a advances by a
        predetermined angle in relation to the permanent magnets (8b,9b)
        of second rotor 4b. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 4, electromagnet 9a of first rotor 4a is
        electrically connected to drive circuit 14. Drive circuit 14
        includes a power source for supplying an electric current to
        coil 13 of electromagnet 9a. While rotors 4a and 4b rotate,
        drive circuit turns on electromagnet 9a upon receiving a signal
        from first sensor 15 only when electromagnet 9a and permanent
        magnet 9b are in a first region in which they periodically
        approach each other. First sensor 15 is an optical sensor
        comprising a light-emitting element and a light-receiving
        element. As shown in FIG. 1, first sensor 15 is attached to a
        portion of frame 1 above first rotor 4a. First sensor 15 emits
        light in a downward direction. The light is reflected by
        reflection plate 16 projecting radially inward from the inner
        edge of first rotor 4a. First sensor 15 receives the reflected
        light, and feeds a signal to drive circuit 14. Thus, drive
        circuit 14 turns on electromagnet 9a. </p>
      <p>The circumferential length of reflection plate 16 is equal to
        that of the above-mentioned first region. When magnets 9a and 9b
        enter the first region, first sensor 15 is turned on, and when
        they leave the first region, first sensor 15 is turned off. When
        drive circuit 14 receives a signal from first sensor 15, it
        excites electromagnet 9a such that both polarities of
        electromagnet 9a correspond to those of permanent magnet 9b of
        second rotor 4b. </p>
      <p>Drive circuit 14 is electrically connected to switching circuit
        17. When brake switch 18 is operated, switching circuit 17
        reverses the direction in which an electric current is supplied
        to electromagnet 9a. When the current supplying direction of
        drive circuit 14 is reversed, drive circuit 14 excites
        electromagnet 9a only in a time period in which drive circuit 14
        receives a signal from second sensor 19. Second sensor 19 has a
        structure similar to that of first sensor 15, and is attached to
        frame 1 so as to be located closer to the center of rotor 4a
        than first sensor 15. Reflection plate 20, which corresponds to
        the position of second sensor 19, is formed integral to an inner
        edge portion of reflection plate 16. As shown in FIG. 2,
        compared to reflection plate 16, reflection plate 20 extends in
        rotational direction of first rotor 4a, indicated by the arrow.
      </p>
      <p>The operation of the above-described magnetic rotation
        apparatus will now be explained with reference to FIG. 5. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 5, rotation shaft 2 of first rotor 4a is denoted by 01,
        and rotation shaft 2 of second rotor 4b is denoted by 02. Only
        the radially outward polarity, that is, N-polarity, of the
        magnets of rotors 4a and 4b is shown, for the sake of
        convenience. Although electromagnet 9a and permanent magnet 9b
        have both polarities located radially outward, only the
        N-polarity thereof is shown. </p>
      <p>When first and second rotors 4a and 4b are put in a position
        shown in FIG. 5, magnetic pole Nb1 of one permanent magnet of
        second rotor 4b is located in a line connecting shafts 01 and
        02. In this case, polarity Na1 of first rotor 4a, which is
        paired with polarity Nb1, is a little advanced from polarity Nb1
        in the rotational direction of first rotor 4a. For example, as
        shown in FIG. 5, magnetic pole Na1 is advanced from polarity Nb1
        by an angle of X.degree.. Polarities Na1 and Nb1 exert repulsion
        force F1 upon each other along line L. Supposing that an angle,
        formed by line M, which is drawn from shaft 01 perpendicularly
        to line L, and the line connecting shafts 01 and 02 is
        represented by Y, and that the length of line K is represented
        by R, torques Ta1 and Tb1 caused by repulsion force F1 to rotate
        first and second rotors 4a and 4b can be given by: </p>
      <p>Ta1=F1.multidot.R.multidot.cos (Y-X) </p>
      <p>Tb1=F1.multidot.R.multidot.cos Y </p>
      <p>Since cos (Y-X)&gt;cos Y, Ta1&gt;Tb1. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 5, since magnetic pole Na1 is advanced from
        magnetic pole Nb1 by angle X.degree., first rotor 4a receives a
        greater torque than second rotor 4b. Thus, first rotor 4a
        forwardly rotates in the direction of the arrow in FIG. 5. </p>
      <p>Mention is now made of paired magnets of rotors 4a and 4b in
        the vicinity of magnetic poles Na1 and Nb1. Magnetic poles Nan
        and Nan-1 of first rotor 4a are advanced ahead of magnetic pole
        Nal in the rotational direction. Magnetic poles Nan and Nan-1
        receive a torque produced by a repulsion force acting between
        magnetic poles Nan and Nan-1 and corresponding magnetic poles
        Nbn and Nbn-1. In FIG. 5, magnetic poles Nan and Nan-1 receive a
        smaller torque, as they rotate farther from the location of
        magnetic pole Na1. It is well known that a torque of first rotor
        4a, which is caused by a repulsion force acting on magnetic
        poles Nan and Nan-1, is decreased in inverse proportion to the
        square of the distance between paired magnetic poles Na and Nb.
      </p>
      <p>Magnetic poles Na2 and Na3, behind magnetic pole Na1, receive a
        torque which tends to rotate rotor 4a in the reverse direction.
        This torque is considered to be counterbalanced with the torque
        acting on magnetic poles Nan and Nan-1. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 5, attention should be paid to the region of magnetic
        poles Na1 and Na2. As first rotor 4a forwardly rotates, the
        direction in which a torque applies to magnetic pole Na2, is
        changed from the reverse direction to the forward direction,
        before magnetic pole Na2 reaches the position of magnetic pole
        Na1. The torque for forwardly rotating rotor 4a is larger than
        that for reversely rotating rotor 4a. Therefore, first rotor 4a
        is easily rotated in the direction shown in FIG. 2. </p>
      <p>Second rotor 4b is considered to receive a torque in a
        direction reverse to the direction shown in FIG. 2, as seen from
        the description of first rotor 4a. It is obvious that second
        rotor 4b receives a maximum torque at the position of magnetic
        pole Nb1. As seen from the above formula, torque Tb1 applied to
        second rotor 4b in a direction reverse to that denoted by the
        arrow is smaller than torque Ta1 applied to first rotor 4a in
        the forward direction. The rotation of first rotor 4a is
        transmitted to second rotor 4b through gears 6a and 6b. By
        determining the relationship between the strengths of torques
        Ta1 and Tb1, second rotor 4b is thus rotated in a direction
        reverse to the rotational direction of first rotor 4a, against
        the torque applied to second rotor in the direction. As a
        result, first and second rotors 4a and 4b are kept rotating,
        since a torque for rotating rotors 4a and 4b in a cooperating
        manner is produced each time magnetic poles Na of first rotor 4a
        pass across the line connecting shafts 01 and 02. </p>
      <p>In a diagram shown in the right part of FIG. 5, a solid line
        indicates a torque applied to first rotor 4a, and a broken line
        indicates a torque applied to second rotor 4b. The ordinate
        indicates a distance between each magnetic pole and the line
        connecting shafts 01 and 02 of rotors 4a and 4b. The first
        region in which electromagnet 9a of first rotor 4a is turned on
        is set in a range of Z during which a torque is applied to first
        rotor 4a in the forward direction. </p>
      <p>In order to stop the cooperative rotation of rotors 4a and 4b,
        brake switch is turned on to operate switching circuit 17. Thus,
        the direction in which drive circuit 14 supplies a current to
        electromagnet 9a is reversed. The polarities of electromagnet 9a
        are reversed. The torque applied to electromagnet 9a in the
        forward direction is stopped. When electromagnet 9a approaches
        permanent magnet 9b, a magnetic attract:on force is produced. As
        a result, the rotation of rotors 4a and 4b is effectively slowed
        down and stopped. Since the second region, in which
        electromagnet 9a is excited, is larger than the first region, a
        large braking force can be obtained from a magnetic attraction
        force. </p>
      <p>In the above embodiment, since electromagnet 9a is excited only
        in a specific region, a large electric power is not required. In
        addition, since electromagnet 9a rotates and brakes rotors 4a
        and 4b, a braking mechanism for a magnetic rotation apparatus
        can be obtained without having to make the entire structure of
        the apparatus complex. </p>
      <p>The present invention is not restricted to the above
        embodiment. With the exception of the paired electromagnet and
        permanent magnet, all permanent magnets of the rotors are
        arranged such that their end portions of the same polarity face
        radially outward from the rotors. However, it is possible that
        the polarities of the radially outward end portions of the
        permanent magnets are alternately changed. Namely, it should
        suffice if the polarities of the radially outward end portions
        of the first rotor are identical to those of the corresponding
        radially outward end portions of the second rotor. The magnets
        may have different magnetic forces. Furthermore, an electric
        power for exciting the electromagnet can be derived from the
        rotation of the rotors or from the revolving magnetic field of
        the permanent magnet. </p>
      <p>Angles C and E are not restricted to 30.degree. and 56.degree..
        They may be freely determined in consideration of the strength
        of the magnetic force of the permanent magnet, a minimum
        distance between adjacent magnets, angle x, and the like. The
        number of magnets of the rotor is also freely chosen. </p>
      <p><b>Industrial Applicability ~</b> </p>
      <p>As described above, the magnetic rotation apparatus of the
        present invention can be used as a driving source in place of an
        electric motor, and as an electric generator.</p>

        rotatable rotating shaft, a plurality of permanent magnets are
        disposed along the direction of rotation such that the same
        magnetic pole type thereof face outward. In the same way,
        balancers are disposed on the rotor for balancing the rotation
        of this rotor. Each of the permanent magnets is obliquely
        arranged with respect to the radial direction line of the rotor.
        At the outer periphery of the rotor, an electromagnet is
        disposed facing this rotor, with this electromagnet
        intermittently energized based on the rotation of the rotor.
        According to the magnetic rotating apparatus of the present
        invention, rotational energy can be efficiently obtained from
        permanent magnets. This is made possible by minimizing as much
        as possible current supplied to the electromagnets, so that only
        a required amount of electrical energy is supplied to the
        electromagnets. </p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a magnetic rotating apparatus,
        and more particularly, to a magnetic rotating apparatus which
        utilizes repulsive forces produced between a permanent magnet
        and an electromagnet. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>In a conventional electric motor, an armature as a rotor
        consists of turns of wires, and electric field as a stator
        consists of a permanent magnet. In such the conventional
        electric motor, however, current must be usually supplied to
        windings of the armature which is rotated. When the current is
        supplied, heat is generated, which gives rise to the problem
        that not much driving force is efficiently generated. This, in
        turn, gives wise to the problem that the magnetic forces cannot
        be efficiently obtained from the permanent magnet. </p>
      <p>In addition, in the conventional electric motor, since the
        armature is so constructed as consisting of the windings, the
        moment of inertia cannot be made very high, so that enough
        torque cannot be obtained. </p>
      <p>To overcome the above-described problems of such the
        conventional electric motor, the inventor proposed, in Japanese
        Patent Publication No. 61868/1993 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,751,486) a
        magnetic rotating apparatus in which a plurality of the
        permanent magnets are disposed along the two rotors,
        respectively, at a predetermined angle, and in which an
        electromagnet is disposed at one of the rotors. </p>
      <p>In a generally constructed conventional electric motor, there
        is a limit as to how much the efficiency of energy conversion
        can be increased. In addition, the torque of the electric motor
        cannot be made high enough. For the above reasons, hitherto,
        various improvements have been made on existing electric motors,
        without any success in producing an electric motor so
        constructed has providing satisfactory characteristics. </p>
      <p>In the magnetic rotating apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent
        Publication No. 6868/1993 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,751,486) a pair of
        rotors is rotated. Therefore, it is necessary for each of the
        rotors to have high precision, and in addition, measures must be
        taken for easier rotation control. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In view of the above-described problems, the object of the
        present invention is to provide a magnetic rotating apparatus in
        which rotational energy can be efficiently obtained from the
        permanent magnet with a minimum amount of electrical energy, and

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>The magnetic field developed by an electromagnet means and that
        of a permanent magnet means of a rotor repel each other. In
        addition, the magnetic field of the permanent magnet means is
        flattened by the magnetic fields of other nearby permanent
        magnets and electromagnet means. Therefore, a torque is produced
        therebetween to efficiently rotate the rotor. Since the rotor
        has a high inertial force, when the rotor starts rotating, its
        speed increases by the inertial force and the turning force. </p>
      <p>A magnetic rotating apparatus related to one embodiment of the
        present invention will be described with reference to the
        following drawings. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 1 and 2 are schematic diagrams of a magnetic rotating
        apparatus related to one embodiment of the present invention. In
        the specification, the term "magnetic rotating apparatus" will
        include an electric motor, and from its general meaning of
        obtaining turning force from the magnetic forces of permanent
        magnets, it will refer to a rotating apparatus utilizing the
        magnetic forces. As shown in FIG. 1, in the magnetic rotating
        apparatus related to one embodiment of the present invention, a
        rotating shaft 4 is rotatably fixed to a frame 2 with bearings
        5. To the rotating shaft 4, there are fixed a first magnet rotor
        6 and a second magnet rotor 8, both of which produce turning
        forces and a rotated body 10, which has mounted therealong a
        plurality of rod-shaped magnets 9 for obtaining the turning
        forces as energy. They are fixed in such a manner as to be
        rotatable with the rotating shaft 4. At the first and second
        magnet rotors 6 and 8, there are provided, as will be described
        later in detail with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, a first
        electromagnet 12 and a second electromagnet 14 respectively are
        energized in synchronism with rotations of the first and second
        magnet rotors 6 and 8, both of which face each other and are
        each disposed in a magnetic gap. The first and second
        electromagnets 12 and 14 are respectively mounted to a yoke 16,
        which forms a magnetic path. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 3, the first and second magnet rotors 6 and 8
        each have disposed on its disk-shaped surface a plurality of
        tabular magnets 22A through 22H for developing a magnetic field
        for generating the turning forces and balancers 20A through 20H,
        made of non-magnetic substances, for balancing the magnet rotors
        6 and 8. In the embodiments, the first and second magnet rotors
        6 and 8 each have disposed along the disk-shaped surface 24 at
        equal intervals the eight tabular magnets 22A through 22H along
        half of the outer peripheral area and +the eight balancers 20A
        through 20H along the other half of the outer peripheral area. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 3, each of the tabular magnets 22A through 22H
        are disposed so that its longitudinal axis 1 makes an angle D
        with respect to a radial axis line 11 of the disk-shaped surface
        24. In the embodiment, an angle of 30 degrees and 56 degrees
        have been confirmed for the angle D. An appropriate angle,
        however, can be set depending on the radius of the disk-shaped
        surface 24 and the number of tabular magnets 22A through 22H to
        be disposed on the disk-shaped surface 24. As illustrated in
        FIG. 2, from the viewpoint of effective use of the magnetic
        field, it is preferable that the tabular magnets 22A through 22H
        on the first magnet rotor 6 are positioned so that their N-poles
        point outward, while the tabular magnets 22A through 22H on the
        second magnet rotor 8 are positioned so that their S-poles point
        outward. </p>
      <p>Exterior to the first and second magnet rotors 6 and 8, the
        first and second electromagnets 12 and 14 are disposed facing
        the first and second magnet rotors 6 and 8 respectively in the
        magnetic gap. When the first and second electromagnets 12 and 14
        are energized, they develop a magnetic field identical in
        polarity to the their respective tabular magnets 22A through 22H
        so that they repel one anther. In other words, as shown in FIG.
        2, since the tabular magnets 22A through 22H on the first magnet
        rotor 6 have their N-poles facing outwards, the first
        electromagnet 12 is energized so that the side facing the first
        magnet rotor 6 develops an N-polarity. In a similar way, since
        the tabular magnets 22A through 22H on the second magnet rotor 8
        have their S-poles facing outwards, the second electromagnet 14
        is energized so that the side facing the tabular magnets 22A
        through 22H develops a S-polarity. The first and second
        electromagnets 12 and 14, which are magnetically connected by
        the yoke 16, are magnetized so that the sides facing their
        respective magnet rotors 6 and 8 are opposite in polarity with
        respect to each other. This means that the magnetic fields of
        the electromagnets 12 and 14 can be used efficiently. </p>
      <p>A detector 30, such as microswitch, is provided to either one
        of the first magnet rotor 6 or second magnet rotor 8 to detect
        the rotating position of the magnet rotors 6 and 8. That is, as
        shown in FIG. 3, in a rotational direction 32 of the tabular
        magnets 22A through 22H, the first and the second magnet rotors
        6 and 8 are respectively energized when the leading tabular 22A
        has passed. In other words, in the rotational direction 32, the
        electromagnet 12 or 14 is energized when starting point So,
        located between the leading tabular magnet 22A and the following
        tabular magnet 22B coincides with the center point Ro of either
        the electromagnet 12 or 14. In addition, as illustrated in FIG.
        3, in the rotational direction 32 of the tabular magnets 22A
        through 22H, the first and the second magnet rotors 6 and 8 are
        de-energized when the last tabular magnet 22A has passed. In the
        embodiment, an end point Eo is set symmetrical to the starting
        point So on the rotating disk-shaped surface 24. When the end
        point Eo coincides with the center point Ro of either the
        electromagnet 12 or 14, the electromagnet 12 or 14 is
        de-energized, respectively. As will be described later, with the
        center point Ro of the electromagnet 12 or 14 arbitrarily set
        between the starting point So and the end point Eo, the magnet
        rotors 6 and 8 start to rotate when the electromagnets 12 and 14
        and their tabular magnets 22A through 22H face one another. When
        a microswitch is used as the detector 30 for detecting the
        rotating position, the contact point of the microswitch is
        allowed to slide along the surface of the rotating disk-shaped
        surface 24. A step is provided for the starting point So and the
        end point Eo so that the contact of the microswitch closes
        between the starting point So and the end point Eo. The area
        along the periphery therebetween protrudes beyond the other
        peripheral areas of the rotating disk-shaped surface 24. It is
        apparent that a photo sensor or the like may be used instead of
        the microswitch as the detector 30 for detecting the rotating
        position. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 4, the windings of the electromagnets 12 and
        14 are connected to a DC power source 42 through a movable
        contact of a relay 40, which is connected in series with the
        windings. A series circuit containing the relay 40 (solenoid)
        and the detector 30 or microswitch is connected to the DC power
        source 42. In addition, from the viewpoint of energy
        conservation, a charger 44 such as a solar cell is connected to
        the DC power source 42. It is preferable that the DC power
        source 42 is constantly chargeable using solar energy or the
        like. </p>
      <p>In the magnetic rotating apparatus illustrated in FIGS. 1 and
        2, a magnetic field distribution shown in FIG. 5 is formed
        between the tabular magnets 22A through 22H, disposed on each of
        the magnet rotors 6 and 8, and the electromagnets 12 and 14
        which face them, respectively. When the electromagnet 12 or 14
        is energized, a magnetic field of a tabular magnet of the
        tabular magnets 22A through 22H, adjacent to the electromagnet
        12 or 14, is distorted in the longitudinal direction in
        correspondence with the rotational direction. This results in
        the generation of a repulsive force therebetween. As is apparent
        from the distortion of the magnetic field, the repulsive force
        has a larger component in the longitudinal or perpendicular
        direction, and produces a torque, as shown by an arrow 32.
        Similarly, a magnetic field of a tabular magnet of the tabular
        magnets 22A through 22H, which next enters the magnetic field of
        the electromagnet 12 or 14, is distorted. Since it moves toward
        an opposite pole of the preceding tabular magnet of the tabular
        magnets 22A through 22H, its magnetic field is distorted to a
        larger extent, and thereby flattened. This means that the
        repulsive force produced between the tabular magnets of the
        tabular magnets 22A through 22H, which have already entered the
        magnetic field of the electromagnets 12 or 14, is larger than
        the repulsive force developed between the next-entering tabular
        magnets of the tabular magnets 22A through 22H and the
        electromagnets 12 or 14. Accordingly, a turning force, shown by
        the arrow 32, acts upon the rotating disk-shaped surface 24. The
        rotating disk-shaped surface 24, having been imparted thereto
        turning force, continues to rotate due to inertial forces, even
        when it has been de-energized after the end point Eo has
        coincided with the center point Ro of the electromagnet 12 or
        14. The larger the inertial force, the smoother the rotation. </p>
      <p>At the initial stage of the rotation, an angular moment, as
        that shown in FIG. 6, is imparted to the rotating disk-shaped
        surface 24. That is, at the start of the rotation, as shown in
        FIG. 6, when the pole M of a tabular magnet is slightly
        displaced in the rotational direction from the pole M' of an
        electromagnet, a repulsive force operates between both of the
        poles M and M' of the tabular magnet at the rotating side and
        the electromagnet at the stationary side, respectively.
        Therefore, from the relationship illustrated in FIG. 6, an
        angular torque T is generated based on the formula: T=F. a.cos
        (.alpha.-.beta.), where in a is a constant. The angular torque
        starts the rotation of the rotating disk-shaped surface 24.
        After the rotating disk-shaped surface 24 has started rotating,
        its rotating speed gradually increases due to an inertial moment
        thereof, which allows a large turning driving force to be
        produced. After a stable rotation of the rotating disk-shaped
        surface 24 has been produced, when a necessary electromotive
        force can be developed in an electromagnetic coil (not
        illustrated) by externally bringing it near a rotated body 10 to
        be rotated along with the rotating disk-shaped surface 24. This
        electric power can be used for other applications. This rotating
        principle is based on the rotating principle of the magnetic
        rotating apparatus already disclosed in Japanese Patent
        Publication No. 61868/1993 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,751,486) by the
        inventor. That is, even if an electromagnet, provided for one of
        the rotors of the magnetic rotating apparatus disclosed in the
        same Patent Application, is fixed, it is rotated in accordance
        with the rotating principle disclosed therein. For details,
        refer to the above Japanese Patent Publication No. 61868/1993
        (U.S. Pat. No. 4,751,486). </p>
      <p>The number of tabular magnets 22A through 22H is not limited to
        "8" as shown in FIGS. 1 and 3. Any number of magnets may be
        used. In the above-described embodiment, although the tabular
        magnets 22A through 22H are disposed along half of the
        peripheral area of the disk-shaped surface 24, and the balancers
        20A through 20H are disposed along the other half of the
        peripheral area, the tabular magnets may further be disposed
        along other areas of the disk-shaped surface 24. It is
        preferable that balancers, in addition to magnets, are provided
        along a portion of the peripheral area on the disk-shaped
        surface. The counter weights, which do not need to be formed
        into separate blocks, may be formed into one sheet of plate
        which extends on the outer peripheral area of the disk-shaped
        surface. In addition, in the above-described embodiments, while
        the construction is such as to allow the electromagnets to be
        energized for a predetermined period of time for every rotation
        of the rotating disk-shaped surface, the circuit may be so
        constructed as to allow, upon increased number of rotations,
        energization of the electromagnets for every rotation of the
        rotating disk-shaped surface, starting from its second rotation
        onwards. Further, in the above-described embodiment, a tabular
        magnet has been used for the permanent magnet, but other types
        of permanent magnets may also be used. In effect, any type of
        magnet may be used as the permanent magnet means as long as a
        plurality of magnetic poles of one type is disposed along the
        outer surface of the inner periphery and a plurality of magnetic
        poles of the other type are disposed along the inner peripheral
        surface of the disk-shaped surface, so that a pair of
        corresponding magnetic poles of one and the other polarities is
        obliquely arranged, with respect to the radial line 11, as shown
        in FIG. 3. </p>
      <p>Although the tabular magnets 22A through 22H are mounted on the
        magnet rotors 6 and 8 in the above embodiment, they may be
        electromagnets. In this case, the electromagnets 12 and 14 may
        be the alternative of electromagnets or permanent magnets. </p>
      <p>According to the magnetic rotating apparatus of the present
        invention, rotational energy can be efficiently obtained from
        permanent magnets. This is made possible by minimizing as much
        as possible current supplied to the electromagnets, so that only
        a required amount of electrical energy is supplied to the
        electromagnets. </p>
      <p>It should be understood that many modifications and adaptations
        of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the
        art and it is intended to encompass such obvious modifications
        and changes in the scope of the claims appended hereto.</p>

      <p>I must apologize for not having all the details of this
        interesting device but will update the file when I get more info
        from the source. In email communications with John Schnurer, I
        happened to mention it and he's been on me since then to send
        him a diagram, yet I felt like it would simply be confusing
        because its operation is not clear or readily apparent from the
        information I had.The information that I have comes directly
        from long time friend Henry Curtis of Colorado. We both attended
        the 1997 ISNE conference in Denver and Henry was telling about
        this interesting machine he had seen while on a trip to the
        Phillipines. He said there was a free energy conference held
        there and he noticed a spinning bicycle wheel that was attached
        to a stand that sat on a table.The wheel was running when he
        first saw it, yet there did not appear to be any driving force
        such as a motor, belts, gears, etc..Henry said he watched it for
        quite awhile and it never stopped running. On expressing
        curiosity about the wheel, he was invited to stop it and start
        it up without any outside assistance.Henry reports the wheel was
        brought to a complete stop, then he gave it a spin with his hand
        and it began moving on its own. I am uncertain if it followed
        the tendency of other such devices to establish its own speed.
        Some devices like this can be spun up to high speed from an
        outside source, then will slow to a speed which is determined by
        the geometry and strength of the repelling or attracting forces
        that operate it.Henry swears it was the neatest thing he'd ever
        seen and drew a crude diagram of the arrangement on my notepad.
        Unfortunately, we were a bit rushed and I did not achieve a
        complete understanding of how it operated. That is why I did not
        want to blow smoke about it until more detail had been received,
        god knows, we don't need any more of that.However, perhaps
        someone can figure it out from the limited information I do
        have. The following drawing shows the wheel arrangement, one
        half was weighted, the other half had slanted magnets. I do not
        know whether they are all repelling, attracting or a mix of
        these forces. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="curtis.jpg" border="1" height="310" width="450"></p>
      </center>
      <p>As you can imagine, the weight of the magnets must equal the
        weight of the other half of the wheel to balance out. Apparently
        the force of the magnetic repulsion or attaction provides the
        actual imbalance.Henry also said there was a patent on this
        device that is dated January 14, 1997. The inventor is a
        Japanese man named Minatu. The spelling of this name is
        uncertain. I did a search on the IBM server but found nothing
        even remote. Henry specifically said this was a United States
        patent. So, here it is. Perhaps Henry can come up with some more
        detail which can be used to update this file in future. Good
        luck.... </p>

      <p><b>KeelyNet: Update and Corrections from Henry Curtis (Wed, 19
          Nov 1997) ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>From:</i> Henry Curtis&nbsp; ~ <i>To:</i> Jerry Decker </p>
      <p><i>Subject:</i> Bicycle wheel correction and update Jerry,
        Again we see that communication is difficult and memories are
        fallable. Obviously I am remiss in not having sent this to you
        months ago as I intended to, but as a sage of old observed "The
        spirit is willing, but the flesh is slow." During the first
        weekend of May, 1997, a group in Soeul, Korea headed up by Mr.
        Chi San Park, held The First International New Energy Conference
        in Seoul, Korea. I attended this conference and gave a talk on
        various approcahes to free energy. It was at this conference in
        Seoul, Korea that I saw the bicycle wheel and had the
        opportunity to work with it unattended by anyone else.The
        inventor is Kohei Minato, a Japanese rock musician, who reports
        that he has spent a million dollars out of his own pocket
        developing magnetic motors, because the world needs a better
        source of energy. He has several patents in various countries.
        His latest patent that I am aware of is United States Patent #
        5,594,289. His development efforts have gone in the general
        direction of the Adams motor which the above patent is similar
        to. He had a working prototype of this design at the conference
        and reported that it used 150 watts power input and produced 450
        watts output on a sustained basis. About a year ago CNN (in the
        US) had a 10 minute segment about him and his motors. In this
        video he is shown demonstrating two of his magnetic motors. I
        have a copy of this film clip that he gave to me. I will make a
        copy and send it to you. Unfortunately, the editors were not
        attuned to technical details and the pictures of the running
        machines show little useful detail. The Phillipine connection
        that you mention is completely erroneous. It was in Korea. The
        drawing on the web site is essentially correct with the
        following exceptions. The counter weight is a single curved
        piece of aluminum covering 180 degrees. Each of the several
        individual magnets on the other half of the wheel are slightly
        asymmetric, crescent shaped and nested. They are magnetised end
        to end with the N poles out. The motor is actuated by moving the
        N pole of a large permanet magnet (the drive magnet) toward the
        wheel. As this magnet is moved toward the wheel, the wheel
        starts to spin. As the magnet is moved closer to the wheel it
        spins faster. The acceleration of the wheel is rapid. So rapid
        in fact, as to be startling. To put it another way I was very
        impressed. The motor works. And it works very well. In the film
        clip a slight pumping action of Minato's hand holding the magnet
        is apparent. When I braced my hand so that there was no pumping
        action, the motor still ran. In fact it seemed to run better.
        Pumping action by the hand held magnet is not the power that
        drives the motor. When the drive magnet is moved away from the
        wheel it coasts rather quickly to a stop and comes to rest in a
        manner typical of any spinning bicycle wheel. Again when the
        wheel is at rest and a large magnet is moved up to the wheel it
        starts to spin. At no time is it necessary to touch the wheel to
        get it to rotate. Simply bring the N pole of a large magnet
        several inches from the wheel. The particular orientation of the
        wheel when it is at rest seems to have no effect on how well it
        starts to turn. Irrespective of how the wheel and the magnets on
        it are sitting; move the drive magnet near, it starts to spin.
        Move the magnet closer it spins faster. Move the magnet further
        away it slows up. The wheel was mounted on a stand made of
        aluminum angle pieces bolted together similar to the diagram in
        the above mentioned patent. The axle of the wheel was mounted
        parellel to the surface of the planet. I have attached a rough
        diagram of the wheel. Apparently the geometry of the magnets on
        the wheel is very important and subtle. I have built several
        small models none of which have shown the free energy effects of
        Minato's machine. The conference in Seoul was attended by
        several hundred people, most appeared to be under 40 and evenly
        divided between men and women. Presenters were from Korea, US,
        Japan, and China. Simultaneous translation was provided for all
        talks in the 3 day conference. Jerry, I hope this information is
        useful. I may be contacted by e-mail at
        mailto:hcurtis@mindspring.com or by phone at 303.344.1458. </p>

      <p><b>KeelyNet: Email from Gene Mallove at <i>Infinite Energy ~</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>I spoke to Bob Vermillion of Tri-Cosmos Development (Los
        Angeles, CA 310-284-3250 or fax 310-284-3260) today, just before
        he left for the three-day demonstrations of the Minato magnetic
        motor being held in Mexico City, Mexico on July 8, 9, 10th.Three
        (3) Minato Motors (MM), covered by US Patents # 5,594,289 (Jan
        14, 1997) and # 4,751,486 (June 14, 1988), have been brought
        over from Japan. One was allegedly tested last evening by Grupo
        Bufete Industrial (supposedly one of the largest power
        generation construction companies in Mexico and South America).
        The company engineers were said (by Vermillion) to have measured
        an output /input ratio of 4.3 / 1. The printed literature, which
        I received in a Fedex packet from Vermillion states that the
        device can put out 500 watts (maximum) with an input of 34
        watts.For those of you who wonder why the device is not
        self-sustaining -- oral info from Vermillion is that Minato
        *will* in the course of one of the demonstrations *remove the
        battery power supply* and let the device self-run -- presumably
        with a load. The press release makes no bones about the
        physics-busting character of the MM: "As rotations per minute
        (rpm's) increase, the electromagnetic consumption of the stator
        decreases. This phenomenon is in direct conflict with accepted
        laws of physics and is achieved through the repelling magnetic
        fields. It operates without heat, noise, or pollution of any
        kind. It can be produced in size from ultra-small to very
        large." It is said in the press release that applications from
        cell phones to laptop computers are under development.
        Vermillion told me of other parties who were planning to attend
        the demonstrations, which will be conducted both in public
        displays and with private party measurements. These include:
        ENRON, Bechtel, Tejas (a division of Shell Oil Corporation),
        Fluor Daniels, Kellogg Corp. .He told me that Hal Fox of New
        Energy News and the Fusion Information Center will be there (I
        confirmed with Hal that he will be there and will give us a full
        report.) I considered going myself (I was invited), but I trust
        Hal Fox to provide a full report -- he should be back this
        weekend. Mr. Kohei Minato will be there -- he has already
        arrived, I understand. He hand carried one of the motors that
        was already tested yesterday. The wealthy Japanese individual
        who owns Tri-Cosmos Dev. Co. is Mr. Charly Fujiki. Attendance is
        by invitation only, but let me here provide the Grupo Bufete
        numbers: (723-45-78 and Fax 723-47-18 in Mexico City). The
        exhibition will be in the Grupo Bufete Industrial building.The
        invitation says: "Mr. Minato, the inventor, will be present to
        explain and demonstrate his remarkable breakthrough in
        technology to government and business leaders in Mexico. He will
        also discuss the possible use (and) application for various
        other industries, including a giant generator project, based on
        the principal mechanism being displayed."Daily demonstrations
        are from 10:30 am to Noon, 4:30 to 5:30 pm and 6 to 7:30 pm. A
        block diagram of the motor indicates that it is about 500 kg. An
        arrow indicates that its 500 watt output goes to a load --
        schematically indicated as an array of light bulbs. The unit is
        within a cube 1.2 meters on edge.The diagram shows a solar
        panel(!!) providing input to the battery that powers the device
        - I supposes for completeness, but that is obviously silly in
        view of the claim. Vermillion assured me that this solar panel
        was not an essential part of the system. One of the two color
        brochures in the package shows the Minato motor with its
        charactersitic coils that have their pole faces toward the
        perimeters of permanent magnet containing wheels that are
        stacked on an axle. If you look at the thing quickly, you'd
        think you were looking at a steam turbine. The 1997 patent
        #5,594,289 states in its abstract: "On a rotor which is fixed to
        a rotatable rotating shaft, a plurality of permanent magnets are
        disposed along the direction of rotation such that the same
        magnetic pole type therof face outward. In the same way,
        balancers are disposed on the rotor for balancing rotation of
        this rotor. Each of the permanent magnets is obliquely arranged
        with respect to the radial direction line of the rotor. At the
        outer periphery of the rotor, an electromagnet is disposed
        facing this rotor, with this electromagnet intermittently
        energized based on the rotation of the rotor.According to the
        magnetic rotating apparatus of the present invention, rotational
        energy can be efficiently obtained from permanent magnets. This
        is made possible by minimizing as much as possible current
        supplied to the electromagnets, so that only a required amount
        of electrical energy is supplied to the electromagnets." It will
        be interesting, indeed, to learn what comes out of this.Perhaps
        the famous white rabbit disappearing down a hole, or maybe the
        birth of a revolution? We shall see. </p>

        the photos. I should explain that our group is not in any way
        conected with Mr. Minato himself. The group STAG is run by
        foreign scientists who are living in Japan with the aim of
        distrubuting information between themselves, improving links
        between Japan and the UK (and elsewhere) and of course to have
        the odd beer or two. We hold meetings every couple of months and
        invite speakers to speak on interesting or topical subjects. Mr.
        Minato was one of the speakers who gave a presentation at one of
        our meetings. Hence the pictures. I also heard about the Korean
        conference, and saw a significant report written about it in the
        conference proceedings (albeit in Korean!). I think it would be
        really good if other people did produce similar devices. I will
        pass your comments on to Mr. Minato. He did have a Web page, (in
        Japanese) with information on it, but I haven't been able to
        connect to it recently. Thanks again for your mail. Regards, <br>

      <p><i>Subject:</i> Minato's PPM Update Vortexians: Here is an
        update on Kohei Minato's over-unity permanent magnet inventions.
        Minato is currently having manufactured, over in Japan, a large
        unit, (4) connected 10 foot long units, that can power 30 homes.
        It is estimated to be finished by February. CNN is scheduled to
        report on it when ready. Minato also has a home powering unit.
        Both size units are based on his USA Patent 5,594,289 that uses
        a battery to start and stop the unit. The USA sales
        representative is Bob Vermillion and his e-mail address is:
        polenetic@aol.com </p>
      <p>No web site yet but Bob Vermillion's office is in Century City,
        California and he said he can answer your technical, marketing,
        and manufacturing questions. He just came back from visiting
        Minato's lab in Japan and was impressed seeing the units working
        versus seeing the photo's. A power demonstration unit to is
        expected to arrive from Japan in January. There currently is no
        USA manufacturing being done and licenses are available
        worldwide. I mentioned to Bob that there is also a large
        interest for a permanent magnet rotor/stator unit that is
        self-rotating and self-starting, like Minato's bicycle wheel
        design. I also mentioned that a table top version of this, for
        the student or as an "executive toy," would sell quite well. He
        didn't know this. If any of you do e-mail to Bob for info,
        mention to him about the need for a table top version of the
        bicycle wheel and where you got his address! </p>

      <p>Here is an 3/4/98 update on Kohei Minato's over-unity permanent
        magnet inventions from his USA sales representative's Bob
        Vermillion and John Kenworthy. Mr. Minato demonstrated at the
        Japanese "Energy Expo '98" his large unit, (4) connected 10 foot
        long units that can power 30 homes, and several smaller table
        top units. CNN, NHK and other TV networks took video's of his
        devices, and of the whole Expo, but he did not know when it was
        re-broadcasted. Minato's staff had their own video on for the
        four day event and Bob is making copies of a typical single day
        video coverage. There were not any instruments connected to the
        large unit to measure energy input to output but his table top
        unit was connected and it showed 48 Watts input to 550 Watts
        output. Minato's demonstration attracted a lot of public
        attention by the large daily crowds and also from a number of
        interested Japanese corporations. Bob said he received all of
        your e-mail's and took them back with him to Japan and gave a
        copy to Mr. Minato and his staff to show the interest here in
        the USA and the world. He has not replied to all of your
        e-mail's due to there is nothing to report about just yet and he
        will answer all of your e-mail's when he has at least a
        demonstration unit to show. They are still waiting for a table
        top power demonstration unit for their Los Angeles office but
        the Japanese engineer's want to perfect it first. Bob is looking
        forward to receiving a magnetic "bicycle wheel" unit in April
        and interested parties can then schedule an appointment to see
        the wheel spinning by itself without any energy input! :-) </p>

      <p>[If the following Press Release is reporting factual
        information that can be verified, then this may be the first
        commercial over-unity rotating, magnetic new-energy device. The
        first western hemisphere demonstration will be given in Mexico
        City in early July, 1998. </p>
      <p>Inventor Kohei Minato, the Thomas Edison of the new millennium,
        has acquired more than 50 patents and intellectual property
        rights from all over the world for the energy creating "Magnetic
        Rotating Apparatus." Mr. Minato's generating device utilizes the
        magnetic force of repulsion to create and emerge clean safe
        energy. </p>
      <p>The "Magnetic Rotating Apparatus" employs a number of
        stationary neodymium magnets arranged at regular intervals on
        the peripheral portion of a rotor. The polarity of each magnet,
        which is located radially outward from the rotor, is identical.
        The machine is started with an electromagnetic stator. When
        activated, the magnetic fields repel creating rotation of the
        rotor. As the rotations per minute (rpm's) increase, the
        electrical consumption to the electromagnetic stator decreases.
        This phenomenon is in direct conflict with accepted laws of
        physics and is achieved through the repelling magnetic fields.
        It operates without heat, noise or pollution of any kind. It can
        be produced in size from ultra small to very large. </p>
      <p>One of the prototypes available for viewing operates with an
        input of 34 watts of electricity and outputs a maximum of 500
        watts. "Magnetic Rotating Apparatus" applications currently
        under development include usage from cell phones and laptop
        computers to automobiles and giant power stations. </p>
