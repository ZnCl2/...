          is a back EMF permanent electromagnetic motor generator and
          method using a regauging process for capturing available
          electromagnetic energy in the system. The device is comprised
          of a rotor with magnets of the same polarity; a timing wheel
          in apposition to a magnetic Hall Effect pickup switch
          semiconductor; and a stator comprised of two bars connected by
          a permanent magnet with magnetized pole pieces at one end of
          each bar. There are input and output coils created by wrapping
          each bar with a conducting material such as copper wire.
          Energy from the output coils is transferred to a recovery
          rectifier or diode. The magnets of the rotor, which is located
          on a shaft along with the timing wheel, are in apposition to
          the magnetized pole pieces of the two bars. The invention
          works through a process of regauging, that is, the flux fields
          created by the coils is collapsed because of a reversal of the
          magnetic field in the magnetized pole pieces thus allowing the
          capture of available back EMP energy. Additional available
          energy may be captured and used to re-energize the battery,
          and/or sent in another direction to be used as work. As an
          alternative, the available back EMF energy may be dissipated
          into the system. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Description</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The invention relates generally to
          the capturing of electromagnetic energy using a method and
          device to create back EMF (electromagnetic force) and
          re-phasing of the back EMF to recycle and capture the
          available back EMF energy. Back EMF is also referred to as
          regauging and may be defined as energy created by the magnetic
          field from coils, and only by coils, and not by magnets. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>2. Background Information and
            Related Art</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Operation of a normal magnetic
          motor has the rotor pole attracting the stator pole, resulting
          in the generation of power from the magnets to the rotor and
          flywheel. During this phase, energy flows from the magnetics
          to the rotor/flywheel and is stored in the increased rotation.
          A rotor pole leaving a stator pole and creating a condition of
          drag-back results in power having to be put back into the
          magnetic section by the rotor and flywheel to forcibly
          overcome the drag-back. In a perfect, friction-free motor, the
          net force field is therefore referred to as most conservative.
          In other words, a most conservative EMF motor has maximum
          efficiency. Without extra energy continually fed to the motor,
          no net work can be done by the magnetic field, since half the
          time the magnetic field adds energy to the load (the rotor and
          flywheel) and the other half of the time it subtracts energy
          back from the load (the rotor and flywheel). Therefore the
          total net energy output is zero in any such rotary process
          without additional energy input. To use a present day magnetic
          motor, continuous energy must be input into the motor to
          overcome drag-back and to power the motor and its load. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Present EMF motors and generators
          all use such conservative fields and therefore, have internal
          losses. Hence, it is necessary to continually input all of the
          energy that the motor outputs to the load, plus more energy to
          cover losses inside the motor itself. EMF motors are rated for
          efficiency and performance by how much energy input into the
          motor actually results in output energy to the load. Normally,
          the Coefficient of Performance (COP) rating is used as a
          measure of efficiency. The COP is the actual output energy
          going into the load and powering it, divided by the energy
          that must be input into the device with its load. COP is the
          power out into the load, divided by the power input into the
          motor/load combination. If there were zero internal losses in
          a motor, that "perfect" motor would have a coefficient of
          performance (COP) equal to 1.0. That is, all energy input into
          the motor would be output by the motor directly into the load,
          and none of the input energy would be lost or dissipated in
          the motor itself. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In magnetic motor generators
          presently in use, however, due to friction and design flaws,
          there are always internal losses and inefficiencies. Some of
          the energy input into the motor is dissipated in these
          internal losses. As a consequence, the energy that gets to the
          load is always less than the input energy. So a standard motor
          operates with a COP of less than 1.0 which is expressed as
          COP&lt;1.0. An inefficient motor may have a COP=0.4 or 0.45,
          while a specially designed, highly efficient motor may have a
          COP=0.85. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The conservative field inside of a
          motor itself can be divided into two phases. Producing a
          conservative field involves net symmetry between the "power
          out" phase from the magnetics to the rotor/flywheel and the
          "power back in" phase from the rotor/flywheel back to the
          magnetics. That is, the two flows of energy (one from the
          magnetics into the rotor and flywheel, and one from the rotor
          and flywheel back to the magnetics) are identical in magnitude
          but opposite in direction. Each phase alone is said to be
          "asymmetrical"; that is, it either has: 1) a net energy flow
          out to the rotor/flywheel; or 2) a net energy flow back into
          the magnetics from the rotor/flywheel. In simplified terms, it
          is referred to as "power out" and "power back in" phases with
          respect to the motor magnetics. Hence, the two asymmetrical
          phases are: 1) the power-out phase; and 2) the "power back in"
          phase, with reference to the magnetics. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">For the power-out phase, energy is
          derived from the EMF existing between the stator pole and
          incoming rotor pole in an attraction mode. In this phase, the
          rotary motion (angular momentum and kinetic energy) of the
          rotor and flywheel is increased. In short, power is added to
          the rotor/flywheel (and thus to the load) from the fields
          between stator pole and rotor pole (the electromagnetic
          aspects of the system). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">For the "power back in" phase,
          energy must be fed back into the magnetics from the rotor and
          flywheel (and the load) to overcome the drag-back forces
          existing between stator pole and outgoing rotor pole. In this
          phase, energy is returned back to the internal magnetic system
          from the rotary motion of the rotor and flywheel (the angular
          momentum, which is the rotational energy.times.time). As is
          well known in physics, a rotor/flywheel's angular momentum
          provides a convenient way to store energy with the spinning
          rotor/flywheel mass acting as an energy reservoir. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">All present day conventional
          magnetic motors use various methods for overcoming and
          partially reversing back EMF. Back EMF is the return pulse
          from the coil out of phase and is also referred to as
          regauging. The back EMF is shorted out and the rotor is
          attracted back in, therefore eliminating back drag. This can
          be accomplished by pouring in more energy, which overpowers
          the back EMF, thereby producing a forward EMP in that region.
          The energy required for this method must be furnished by the
          operator. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The motor of the present invention
          uses only a small amount of energy to "trigger" a much larger
          input of available energy by supplying back EMF, thus
          increasing the potential energy of the system. It then
          utilizes this excess potential energy to reduce or reverse
          back EMF, thereby increasing the efficiency of the motor and,
          therefore, the COP. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">If the energy in phase 1 (the
          power-out phase) is increased by additional available energy
          in the electromagnetics themselves, then the energy in phase 1
          can be made greater than the energy in phase 2 (the
          power-back-in phase) without the operator furnishing the
          energy utilized. This produces a non-conservative net field.
          Net power can then be taken from the rotating stator and
          flywheel, because the available energy added into the stator
          and flywheel by the additional effects, is transformed by the
          rotor/flywheel into excess angular momentum and stored as
          such. Angular momentum is conserved at all times; but now some
          of the angular momentum added to the flywheel is evoked by
          additional effects in the electromagnetics rather than being
          furnished by the operator. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Electrodynamicists assume that the
          potential available energy of any system can be changed at
          will and without cost. This is back EMF and is well-known in
          physics. It is also routinely employed by electrodynamicists
          in the theoretical aspects. But to simplify the mathematics,
          electrodynamicists will create a back EMF twice
          simultaneously, each back EMF carefully selected just so that
          the two available forces that are produced are equal and
          opposite and cancel each other "symmetrically". This is
          referred to as "symmetrical back EMF". A symmetrical back EMF
          system cannot produce a COP&gt;1.0. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">On the other hand, the motor of the
          present invention deliberately creates a back EMF itself and
          its potential energy only once at a time, thereby retaining
          each extra force for a period of time and applying it to
          increase the angular momentum and kinetic energy of the rotor
          and flywheel. Specifically, this back EMF energy with its net
          force is deliberately applied in the motor of the present
          invention to overcome and even reverse the conventional
          drag-back (the back EMF). Hence less energy must be taken from
          the rotor and flywheel to overcome the reduced back EMF, and
          in the ideal case none is required since the back EMF has been
          overpowered and converted to forward EMF by the back EMF
          energy and force. In the motor of the present invention, the
          conventional back-drag section of the magnetics becomes a
          forward-EMF section and now adds energy to the rotor/flywheel
          instead of subtracting it. The important feature is that the
          operator only pays for the small amount of energy necessary to
          trigger the back EMF, and does not have to furnish the much
          larger back EMF energy itself. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">When the desired energy in phase 1
          (the power out phase) is thus made greater than the undesired
          "drag-back" energy in phase 2, then part of the output power
          normally dragged back from the rotor and flywheel by the
          fields in phase 2 is not required. Hence, additional power
          compared to the system (without the special back EMF
          mechanisms) is available from the rotor/flywheel. The rotor
          maintains additional angular momentum and kinetic energy,
          compared to a system which does not produce back EMF itself.
          Consequently, the excess angular momentum retained by the
          rotor and flywheel can be utilized as additional shaft power
          to power an external load connected to the shaft. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A standard magnetic motor operates
          as the result of the motor being furnished with external
          energy input into the system by the operator to reduce phase 2
          (power back into the magnetics from the rotor/flywheel) by any
          of several methods and mechanisms. The primary purpose of this
          external energy input into the system is to overcome the back
          EMF and also provide for the inevitable energy losses in the
          system. There is no input of energy separate from the operator
          input. Therefore, the COP of any standard magnetic motor is
          COP less than 1.0. The efficiency of a standard magnetic motor
          varies from less than 50% to a maximum of about 85%, and so
          has a COP&lt;1.0. When nothing is done in the motor that will
          produce a reduction of the back EMF without the operator
          inputing all the energy for it, then for even a frictionless,
          ideal permanent magnet motor, the COP can never exceed 1.0. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Until the introduction of the motor
          of the present invention, it has been standard universal
          practice that the operator must furnish all energy used to
          reduce the back EMF, provide for the internal losses, and
          power the load. It is therefore a common belief by the
          scientific community that an ideal (loss-less) permanent
          magnet motor cannot exceed COP=1.0. And that is true, so long
          as the operator himself must furnish all the energy. Further,
          since real permanent magnetic motors have real internal
          losses, some of the input energy is always lost in the motor
          itself, and that lost energy is not available for powering the
          rotor/flywheel and load. Hence a real permanent magnetic motor
          of the conventional kind will always have a COP&lt;1.0. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The common assumption that the COP
          of a motor is limited to less than 1.0 is not necessarily
          true, and that COP&gt;1.0 is permitted without violating the
          laws of nature, laws of physics, or laws of thermodynamics.
          However, it can immediately be seen that any permanent magnet
          motor exhibiting a COP&gt;1.0 must have some available energy
          input returning in the form of back EMF. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A problem relates to how back EMF
          energy can be obtained from a circuit's external environment
          for the specific task of reducing the back-drag EMF without
          the operator having to supply any input of that excess energy.
          In short, the ultimate challenge is to find a way to cause the
          system to: 1) become an open dissipative system, that is, a
          system receiving available excess energy from its environment,
          in other words, from an external source; and 2) use that
          available excess energy to reduce the drag-back EMF between
          stator and rotor poles as the rotor pole is leaving the stator
          pole. If this objective can be accomplished, the system will
          be removed from thermodynamic equilibrium. Instead, it will be
          converted to a system out-of-thermodynamic equilibrium. Such a
          system is not required to obey classical equilibrium
          thermodynamics. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Instead, an out-of-equilibrium
          thermodynamic system must obey the thermodynamics of open
          systems far from the established and well-known parameters of
          thermodynamic equilibrium. As is well known in the physics of
          thermodynamics, such open systems can permissibly: 1)
          self-order; 2) self-oscillate; 3) output more back EMF energy
          than energy input by the operator (the available excess back
          EMF energy is received from an external source and some energy
          is input by the operator as well); 4) power itself as well as
          its loads and losses simultaneously (in that case, all the
          energy is received from the available external source and
          there is no input energy from the operator); and 5) exhibit
          negentropy, that is, produce an increase of energy that is
          available in the system, and that is independent of the energy
          put into the system by the operator. As a definition, entropy
          roughly corresponds to the energy of a system that has become
          unavailable for use. Negentropy corresponds to additional
          energy of a system that has become available for use. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the back EMF permanent magnet
          electromagnetic motor generator of the present invention,
          several known processes and methods are utilized which allow
          the invention to operate periodically as an open dissipative
          system (receiving available excess energy from back EMF) far
          from thermodynamic equilibrium, whereby it produces and
          receives its excess energy from a known external source. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A method is utilized to temporarily
          produce a much larger source of available external energy
          around an energized coil. Then the unique design features of
          this new motor provides a method and mechanism that can
          immediately produce a second increase in that energy,
          concurrently as the energy flow is reversed. Therefore, the
          motor is capable of producing two asymmetrical back EMFs, one
          after the other, of the energy within a single coil, which
          dramatically increases the energy available and causes that
          available excess energy to then enter the circuit impulsively,
          being collected and utilized. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The present motor utilizes this
          available excess back EMF energy to overcome and even reverse
          the back-drag EMF between stator pole and rotor pole, while
          furnishing only a small trigger pulse of energy necessary to
          control and activate the direction of the back EMF energy
          flow. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">By using a number of such dual
          asymmetrical self back EMFs for every revolution of the rotor,
          the rotor and flywheel collectively focus all the excess
          impulsive inputs into increased angular momentum (expressed as
          energy.times.time), shaft torque, and shaft power. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Further, some of the excess energy
          deliberately generated in the coil by the utilization of the
          dual process manifests in the form of excess electrical energy
          in the circuit and is utilized to power electrical loads,
          e.g., a lamp, fan, motor, or other electrical devices. The
          remainder of the excess energy generated in the coil can be
          used to power the rotor and flywheel, with the rotor/flywheel
          also furnishing shaft horsepower for powering mechanical
          loads. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This new and unique motor utilizes
          a means to furnish the relatively small amount of energy to
          initiate the impulsive asymmetrical self back EMF actions.
          Then part of the available excess electrical power drawn off
          from the back EMFs is utilized to recharge the battery with
          dramatically increased over voltage pulses. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The unique design features of this
          motor utilize both north and south magnetic poles of each
          rotor and stator magnet. Therefore, the number of impulsive
          self back EMFs in a single rotation of the rotor is doubled.
          Advanced designs increase the number of self back EMFs in a
          single rotor rotation with the result that there is an
          increase in the number of impulses per rotation which increase
          the power output of this new motor. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The sharp voltage pulse produced in
          the coil of this new motor by the rapidly collapsing field in
          the back EMF coil is connected to a battery in charge mode and
          to an external electrical load. The net result is that the
          coil asymmetrically creates back EMF itself in a manner adding
          available energy and impulse to the circuit. The excess
          available energy collected in the coil is used to reverse the
          back-EMF phase of the stator-rotor fields to a forward EMF
          condition, impulsively adding acceleration and angular
          momentum to the rotor and flywheel. At the same time, a part
          of the excess energy collected in the coil is used to power
          electrical loads such as charging a battery and operating a
          lamp or such other device. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It is well known in the art that
          changing the voltage alone creates a back EMF and requires no
          work. This is because to change the potential energy does not
          require changing the form of that potential energy, but only
          its magnitude. Work is rigorously the changing of the form of
          energy. Therefore, as long as the form of the potential energy
          is not changed, the magnitude can be changed without having to
          perform work in the process. The motor of the present
          invention takes advantage of this permissible operation to
          create back EMF asymmetrically, and thereby change its own
          usable available potential energy. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In an electric power system, the
          potential (voltage) is changed by inputing energy to do work
          on the internal charges of the generator or battery. This
          potential energy is expended within the generator (or battery)
          to force the internal charges apart, forming a source dipole.
          Then the external closed circuit system connected to that
          source dipole ineptly pumps the spent electrons in the ground
          line back through the back EMP of the source dipole, thereby
          scattering the charges and killing the dipole. This shuts off
          the energy flow from the source dipole to the external
          circuit. As a consequence of that conventional method, it is a
          requirement to input and replace additional energy to again
          restore the dipole. The circuits currently utilized in most
          electrical generators have been designed to keep on destroying
          the energy flow by continually scattering all of the dipole
          charges and terminating the dipole. Therefore, it is necessary
          to keep on inputing energy to the generator to keep restoring
          its source dipole. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">An investigation of particle
          physics is required to see what furnishes the energy to the
          external circuit. Since neither a battery nor a generator
          furnishes energy to the external circuit, but only furnishes
          energy to form the source dipole, a better understanding of
          the electric power principle is required to fully understand
          how this new motor functions. A typical battery uses its
          stored chemical energy to form the source dipole. A generator
          utilizes its input shaft energy to rotate, forming an internal
          magnetic field in which the positive charges are forced to
          move in one direction and the negative charges in the reverse
          direction, thereby forming the source dipole. In other words,
          the energy input into the generator does nothing except form
          the source dipole. None of the input energy goes to the
          external circuit. If increased current is drawn into the
          external load, there also is increased spent electron flow
          being rammed back through the source dipole, destroying it
          faster. Therefore, dipole-restoring-energy has to be inputed
          faster. The chemical energy of the battery also is expended
          only to separate its internal charges and form its source
          dipole. Again, if increased current and power is drawn into
          the external load, there is increased spent electron flow
          being rammed back through the source dipole, destroying it
          faster. This results in a depletion of the battery's stored
          energy faster, by forcing it to have to keep restoring the
          dipole faster. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Once the generator or battery
          source dipole is formed (the dipole is attached also to the
          external circuit), it is well known in particle physics that
          the dipole (as is any charge) is a broken symmetry in the
          vacuum energy flux. By definition, this means that the source
          dipole extracts and orders part of that energy received from
          its vacuum interaction, and pours that energy out as the
          energy flowing through all space surrounding the external
          conductors in the attached circuit. Most of this enormous
          energy flow surging through space surrounding the external
          circuit does not strike the circuit at all, and does not get
          intercepted or utilized. Neither is it diverged into the
          circuit to power the electrons, but passes on out into space
          and is just "wasted". Only a small "sheath" of the energy flow
          along the surface of the conductors strikes the surface
          charges in those conductors and is thereby diverged into the
          circuit to power the electrons. Standard texts show the huge
          available but wasted energy flow component, but only calculate
          the small portion of the energy flow that strikes the circuit,
          is caught by it, and is utilized to power it. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In a typical circuit, the huge
          available but "wasted" component of the energy flow is about
          10.sup.13 times as large as is the small component intercepted
          by the surface charges and diverged into the circuit to power
          it. Hence, around every circuit and circuit element such as a
          coil, there exists a huge non-intercepted, non-diverged energy
          flow that is far greater than the small energy flow being
          diverted and used by the circuit or element. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Thus there exists an enormous
          untapped energy flow immediately surrounding every EMF power
          circuit, from which available excess energy can be intercepted
          and collected by the circuit, if respective non-linear actions
          are initiated that sharply affect and increase the reaction
          cross section of the circuit (i.e., its ability to intercept
          this available but usually wasted energy flow). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The method in which the motor of
          the present invention alters the reaction cross section of the
          coils in the circuit, is by a novel use, which momentarily
          changes the reaction cross section of the coil in which it is
          invoked. Thus, by this new motor using only a small amount of
          current in the form of a triggering pulse, it is able to evoke
          and control the immediate change of the coil's reaction cross
          section to this normally wasted energy flow component. As a
          result, the motor captures and directs some of this usually
          wasted environmental energy, collecting the available excess
          energy in the coil and then releasing it for use in the motor.
          By timing and switching, the innovative gate design in this
          new motor directs the available excess energy so that it
          overcomes and reverses the return EMF of the rotor-stator pole
          combination during what would normally be the back EMF and
          demonstrates the creation of the second back EMF of the
          system. Now instead of an "equal retardation" force being
          produced in the back EMF region, a forward EMF is produced
          that is additive to the rotor/flywheel energy and not
          subtractive. In short, it further accelerates the
          rotor/flywheel. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This results in a non-conservative
          magnetic field along the rotor's path. The line integral of
          the field around that path (i.e., the net work on the
          rotor/flywheel to increase its energy and angular momentum) is
          not zero but a significant amount. Hence, the creation of an
          asymmetrical back EMF impulse magnetic motor: 1) takes its
          available excess energy from a known external source, the huge
          usually non-intercepted portion of the energy flow around the
          coil; 2) further increases the source dipolarity by this back
          EMF energy; and 3) produces available excess energy flow
          directly from the source dipole's increased broken symmetry in
          its fierce energy exchange with the local vacuum. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">No laws of physics or
          thermodynamics are violated in the method and device of the
          present invention, and conservation of energy rigorously
          applies at all times. Nonetheless, by operating as an open
          dissipative system not in thermodynamic equilibrium with the
          active vacuum, the system can permissibly receive available
          excess energy from a known environmental source and output
          more energy to a load than must be input by the operator
          alone. As an open system not in thermodynamic equilibrium,
          this new and unique motor can tap in on back EMF to energize
          itself, loads and losses simultaneously, fully complying with
          known laws of physics and thermodynamics. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A search of prior art failed to
          reveal any devices that recycle available energy from back EMF
          of a permanent electromagnetic motor generator as described in
          the present invention. However, the following prior art

        <p style="text-align: left;">The device and method of the
          present invention is a new permanent electromagnetic motor
          generator that recycles back EMF energy (regauging) thus
          allowing the motor to produce an energy level of COP=0.98,
          more or less, depending upon configuration, circuitry,
          switching elements and the number and size of stators, rotors
          and coils that comprise the motor. The rotor is fixed between
          two pole pieces of the stator. The motor generator is
          initially energized from a small starter battery means,
          analogous to a spark plug, that sends a small amount of energy
          to the motor, thus stimulating a rotating motion from the
          rotor. As the rotor rotates, energy is captured from the
          surrounding electromagnetic field containing an asymmetrical
          pulse wave of back EMF. The energy produced and captured can
          be directed in one of several directions, including returning
          energy to the initial starter battery, rotating a shaft for
          work and/or sending a current to energize a fan, light bulb or
          other such device. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
            INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The present invention is a device
          and method for creating a back EMF permanent electromagnetic
          motor generator. As described in the Background Information,
          this new motor generator conforms to all applicable
          electrodynamic laws of physics and is in harmony with the law
          of the conservation of energy, the laws of electromagnetism
          and other related natural laws. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The back EMF permanent
          electromagnetic motor generator is comprised of combination of
          electrical, material and magnetic elements to capture
          available electromagnetic energy (back EMF) in a recovery
          rectifier or single diode from output coils. The capturing of
          back EMF energy is also known as regauging in the art. As an
          arbitrary starting point in describing this invention, an
          input battery, as a means of energy, sends power through a
          power on-off switch and then to a means for timing such as a
          magnetic timing switch (Hall Effect magnetic pickup switch, a
          semiconductor) which interfaces with or is in apposition to a
          magnet on a timing wheel. The timing wheel may contain any
          number of magnets of one or more, with the South polarity
          facing outward and in apposition with the Hall Effect pickup
          switch. The timing wheel is mounted at the end of a shaft that
          also runs through the center midline of a rotor containing any
          number of magnets of two or more. The rotor magnets are
          arranged in a manner wherein they have the same polarity and
          are equidistant from each other. The shaft has the timing
          wheel mounted at one end, the rotor, and then a means for
          work, such as a power take off at the opposite end. However,
          there are other embodiments in which the position of the
          rotor, timing wheel and power take-off have other
          arrangements. The rotor is stabilized to a platform or housing
          means and is fixed in a stationary position within a stator. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The stator is comprised of a
          permanent magnet connected to a means for conducting
          electromagnetic energy such as two parallel bars, each bar
          having a magnetized pole piece at one end of each bar. The
          conduction material of the bar may be ferrous, powdered iron,
          silicon steel, stainless magnetic steel, laminations of
          conductive material or any other magnetic conductive material.
          Each bar is wrapped in a conducting means to form an input
          coil. The means for conducting may be copper, aluminum or any
          other conductive material suitable for making a coil. The
          primary or input coil is connected to the switching circuit. A
          second conductive wrapping on top of the input coil becomes a
          secondary or output coil. The secondary or output coil is
          connected to the recovery circuit. The rotor is symmetrically
          located between the pole pieces of the bars of the stator and
          contains a series of magnets all having the same polarity,
          North or South, with each magnet in the rotor being in
          apposition to the pole piece as the rotor is in rotation
          around the shaft. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">When the rotor is energized from
          the battery of the switching circuit, there is an initial
          magnetic field that is instantly overcome as the magnetized
          pole pieces are in apposition with the rotor magnets. As the
          rotor begins to move, increasing electromagnetic energy is
          produced as a result of flux gaiting from the apposed magnets
          of the rotor and pole pieces. The coils surrounding the bars
          "buck" the permanent magnet connecting the bars. This is known
          in the art as the "buck boosting" principle. When the
          permanent magnet is bucked by the coils, it reverses the
          polarity of the pole pieces which are apposed to the rotor
          magnets causing the rotor to increase its rotation or spin.
          The energy available from the fields that are collapsing in
          the primary and secondary coils, which creates the back EMF
          within the system, is now in non-equilibrium. Through
          circuitry and a switching means, energy can be put back into
          the system. Available energy captured from the back EMF, may
          be applied in different directions, including re-energizing
          the input battery, storage in a capacitor, conversion by a
          recovery rectifier to be stored in the input battery, a
          capacitor or a secondary or recovery battery. Recovery
          rectifiers convert AC to DC. Available energy may be used to
          energize an electric bulb, fan or any other uses. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The shaft in the midline of the
          rotor can transfer energy in the form of work through a power
          take-off. The power take-off may be connected to any number of
          secondary shafts, wheels, gears and belts to increase or
          reduce torque. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This is a description of the basic
          invention, however, there are an innumerable number of
          combinations and embodiments of stators, rotors, Hall Effect
          magnetic pickup switches, coils, recovery rectifiers and
          electronic connecting modes that may be combined on a single
          shaft or several shafts connected in various combinations and
          sequences, and of various sizes. There may be any number of
          stators to one rotor, however, there can be only one rotor if
          there is a single stator. The number of Hall Effect pickup
          switches may vary, for example, in the case of multiple
          stators of high resistant coils, the coils may be parallel to
          form a low resistant coil so that one Hall Effect pickup with
          one circuit may fire all of the stators at the same time. The
          number of magnets in both the timing wheel and the rotor may
          also vary in number as well as the size and strength of the
          magnets in gauss units. All types of magnets may be used. The
          number of winds on both the input and output coils on each
          conducting bar may also vary in number and in conductive
          material. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The motor generator, as shown in
          FIG. 1, a top perspective view of a single stator, single
          rotor back EMF motor and is comprised of a means of providing
          energy, such as input battery 10 connected to power switch 11
          (shown in FIG. 2) and Hall Effect magnetic pickup switch 13.
          Magnetic pickup 13 interfaces with timing wheel 12 to form a
          timing switch. Timing wheel 12 is comprised of four magnets 14
          with the South pole of each said magnet facing outward to
          magnetic pickup 13. Timing wheel 12 is fixed at one end of
          shaft 15. Located on shaft 15 is rotor 16. Rotor 16 can be of
          any size, said rotor containing four rotor magnets 17. Said
          rotor magnets 17 are arranged in a manner so all have the same
          polarity. Opposite timing wheel 12 on shaft 15 is a means for
          work, such as a power take-off 18. Rotor 16 is mounted in a
          fixed position with rotor magnets 17 in apposition with
          magnetized pole pieces 19a and 19b. Each pole piece 19a and
          19b is connected to iron bars 20a and 20b. Iron bars 20a and
          20b are connected by a permanent magnet 21. A means for
          conduction is wrapped around iron bars 20a and 20b to form
          input coils 22a and 22b. Superimposed upon input coils 22a and
          22b are output coils 23a and 23b. Output coils 23a and 23b are
          connected to full wave bridge first recovery rectifier 24a.
          First rectifier 24a is connected to battery 10. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 1a is a perspective side view
          of the back EMF Motor Generator timing wheel 12 with Hall
          Effect magnetic pickup switch 13 in apposition individually to
          each of four magnets 14 as said timing wheel 12 rotates. Said
          magnets 14 have the South polarity facing outward with an
          equidistant separation of 90.degree.. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 1b is a perspective side view
          of rotor 16 with four rotor magnets 17 with 900 equidistant
          separation and having the same polarity. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of
          the motor generator circuitry showing input coil connections
          from input battery 10 through power switch 11, transistors
          30a,b, resistors 31a-d, through power supply lead 32 (VCC+)
          and to magnetic pickup 13. Magnetic pickup 13 is in apposition
          with timing wheel magnets 14 located on timing wheel 12. Off
          of magnetic pickup 13 is collector lead 33 and ground lead 34.
          When current is reversed, it flows through resistor 31e and
          transistor 30c to input battery 10. Input coils 22a,b send
          power to full wave bridge first recovery rectifier 24a which
          then sends power through switch recovery 27 back into the
          system, and/or to input battery 10. Output coils 23a and 23b
          send power through single diode second recovery rectifier 24b
          to recovery battery 25. In this particular embodiment, the
          value and type number of the components are as follows: Hall
          Effect magnetic pickup switch 13 is a No. 3020; transistor 30a
          is a No. 2N-2955; transistor 30b is a No. MPS-8599; and
          transistor 30c is a No. 2N-3055; resistors 31a and b are 470
          ohms resistors; resistor 31b is a 2.2 K ohms resistor;
          resistor 31c is a 220 ohms resistor; resistor 31d is a 1 K
          ohms resistor; and recovery rectifier 24a is a 10 Amp, 400
          volts bridge rectifier. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 3 is a box diagram showing the
          flow of voltage from input battery A, through recovery circuit
          B, switching circuit C and motor coils D. Motor coils D send
          available back EMF energy through recovery circuit B, and from
          B to recovery battery E and input battery A. Available back
          EMF energy can also flow from switching circuit C to recovery
          circuit B. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In multiple stator/rotor systems,
          each individual stator may be energized one at a time or all
          of the stators may be energized simultaneously. Any number of
          stators and rotors may be incorporated into the design of such
          multiple stator/rotor motor generator combinations. However,
          while there may be several stators per rotor, there can only
          be one rotor for a single stator. The number of stators and
          rotors that would comprise a particular motor generator is
          dependent upon the amount of power required in the form of
          watts. The desired size and horse power of the motor
          determines whether the stators will be in parallel or fired
          sequentially by the magnetic Hall Effect pickup switch or
          switches. The number of magnets incorporated into a particular
          rotor is dependent upon the size of the rotor and power
          required of the motor generator. In a multiple stator/rotor
          motor generator, the timing wheel may have one or more
          magnets, but must have one magnet Hall Effect pickup switch
          for each stator if the stators are not arranged in parallel.
          The back EMF energy is made available through the reversing of
          the polarity of the magnetized pole pieces thus collapsing the
          field around the coils and reversing the flow of energy to the
          recovery diodes, which is capturing the back EMF. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Individual motors may be connected
          in sequence with each motor having various combinations of
          stators and rotors or in parallel. Each rotor may have any
          number of rotor magnets ranging from a minimum of 2 to maximum
          of 60. The number of stators for an individual motor may range
          from 1 to 60 with the number of conducting bars ranging from 2
          to 120. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">What distinguishes this motor
          generator from all others in the art is the presence of a
          permanent magnet connecting the two conducting bars which
          transfer magnetic energy through the pole pieces to the rotor,
          thereby attracting the rotor between the pole pieces. With the
          rotor attracted in between the two pole pieces, the coils
          switch the polarity of the magnetic field of the pole pieces
          so that the rotor is repelled out. Therefore there is no
          current and voltage being used to attract the rotor. The only
          current being used is the repulsion of the rotor between the
          two conductive bar pole pieces thereby requiring only a small
          amount of current to repel the rotor. This is known as a
          regauging system and allows the capturing of available back
          EMF energy for use. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Finally, although the invention has
          been described with reference of particular means, materials
          and embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is
          not limited to the particulars disclosed and extends to all
          equivalents within the scope of the claims. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The invention relates generally to
          the capturing of available electromagnetic energy using a
          device and method for creating an electromagnetic force
          (hereinafter, EMF) and then using the available stored energy
          for recycling into the system as stored energy. The method of
          creating back EMF is the result of coupling/uncoupling a
          voltage source to and from a coil. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Operation of present day normal
          magnetic motors has the rotor pole attracting the stator pole,
          resulting in the generation of mechanical power from the
          magnets to the rotor and flywheel. During this phase, energy
          flows from the magnetics to the rotor/flywheel and is stored
          as kinetic energy in the increased rotation. A rotor pole
          leaving a stator pole and creating a condition of "drag"
          results in power having to be put back into the magnetic
          section by the rotor and flywheel to forcibly overcome the
          drag. In a perfect, friction-free motor, the net force field
          is therefore referred to as "most conservative". A most
          conservative EMF motor has maximum efficiency. Without extra
          energy continually fed to the motor, no net work can be done
          by the magnetic field, since half the time the magnetic field
          adds energy to the load (the rotor and flywheel) and the other
          half of the time it subtracts energy back from the load (the
          rotor and flywheel). Therefore, the total net energy output is
          zero in any such rotary process without additional energy
          input. To use a present day magnetic motor, continuous energy
          must be input into the motor to overcome drag and to power the
          motor and its load. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Motors and generators presently in
          use, all use such conservative fields and therefore, have
          internal losses. Hence, it is necessary to continually input
          all of the energy that the motor outputs to the load, plus
          more energy to cover losses inside the motor itself. EMF
          motors are rated for efficiency and performance by how much
          energy "input" into the motor actually results in "output"
          energy to the load. Normally, the Coefficient of Performance
          (hereinafter, COP) rating is used as a measure of efficiency.
          The COP is the actual output energy going into the load and
          powering it, divided by the energy that must be input into the
          device with its motor/load combination. If there were zero
          internal losses in a motor, that "perfect" motor would have a
          COP equal to 1.0. That is, all energy input into the motor
          would be output by the motor directly into the load, and none
          of the input energy would be lost or dissipated in the motor
          itself. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In magnetic motor generators
          presently in use, however, due to friction and design flaws,
          there are always internal losses and inefficiencies. Some of
          the energy input into the motor is dissipated in these
          internal losses. As a consequence, the energy that gets to the
          load is always less than the input energy. So a standard motor
          operates with a COP of less than 1.0, which is expressed as
          COP&lt;1.0. An inefficient motor may have a COP=0.4 or 0.45,
          while a specially designed, highly efficient motor may have a
          COP=0.85. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The conservative field inside of a
          motor itself is divided into two phases. Producing a
          conservative field involves net symmetry between the "power
          out" phase from the magnetics to the rotor/flywheel and the
          "power back in" phase from the rotor/flywheel back to the
          magnetics. That is, the two flows of energy (one from the
          magnetics into the rotor and flywheel, and one from the rotor
          and flywheel back to the magnetics) are identical in magnitude
          but opposite in direction. Each phase alone is said to be
          "asymmetrical", that is, it either has: 1) a net energy flow
          out to the rotor/flywheel; or 2) a net energy flow back into
          the magnetics from the rotor/flywheel. In simplified terms, it
          is referred to as "power out" and "power back in" phases with
          respect to the motor magnetics. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">For the power-out phase, energy is
          derived from the EMF existing between the stator pole and
          incoming rotor pole in an attraction mode. In this phase, the
          rotary motion (angular momentum and kinetic energy) of the
          rotor and flywheel is increased. In short, power is added to
          the rotor/flywheel (and thus to the load) from the fields
          between stator pole and rotor pole (the electromagnetic
          aspects of the system). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">For the "power back in" phase,
          energy must be fed back into the magnetics from the rotor and
          flywheel (and the load) to overcome the drag forces existing
          between stator pole and outgoing rotor pole. In this phase,
          energy is returned back to the internal magnetic system from
          the rotary motion of the rotor and flywheel (the angular
          momentum, which is the rotational energy.times.time). As is
          well known in physics, a rotor/flywheel's angular momentum
          provides a convenient way to store energy with the spinning
          rotor/flywheel mass acting as an energy reservoir. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Most present day conventional
          magnetic motors use various methods for overcoming and
          partially reversing back EMF. Back EMF may be defined as the
          return pulse from the coil out of phase and is the result of
          regauging, which is the process of reversing the magnetics
          polarity, that is, form North to South, etc. The back EMF is
          shorted out and the rotor is attracted back in, therefore
          eliminating drag. This can be accomplished by pouring in more
          energy, which overpowers the back EMF, thereby producing a
          forward EMF in that region. The energy required for this
          method is furnished by the operator. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It is well known in the art that
          changing the voltage alone creates a back EMF and requires no
          work. This is because to change the potential energy does not
          require changing the form of that potential energy, but only
          its magnitude. Work is the changing of the form of energy.
          Therefore, as long as the form of the potential energy is not
          changed, the magnitude can be changed without having to
          perform work in the process. The motor of the present
          invention takes advantage of this permissible operation to
          create back EMF asymmetrically, and thereby change its own
          usable available potential energy. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In an electric power system, the
          potential (voltage) is changed by inputting energy to do work
          on the internal charges of the generator or battery. This
          potential energy is expended within the generator (or battery)
          to force the internal charges apart, forming a source dipole.
          Then the external closed circuit system connected to that
          source dipole ineptly pumps the spent electrons in the ground
          line back through the back EMF of the source dipole, thereby
          scattering the charges and killing the dipole. This shuts off
          the energy flow from the source dipole to the external
          circuit. As a consequence of this conventional method, it is a
          requirement to input and replace additional energy to again
          restore the dipole. The circuits currently utilized in most
          electrical generators have been designed to keep on destroying
          the energy flow by continually scattering all of the dipole
          charges and terminating the dipole. Therefore, it is necessary
          to keep on inputting energy to the generator to keep restoring
          its source dipole. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A search of prior art failed to
          reveal any monopole motor devices and methods that recycle
          available energy from back EMF to charge a battery or provide
          electrical energy for other uses as described in the present
          invention. However, the following prior art patents were
          reviewed: </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">U.S. Pat. No. 4,055,789 to Lasater,
          Battery Operated Motor with Back EMF Charging. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">An aspect of the device and method
          of the present invention is a new monopole electromagnetic
          motor that captures back EMF energy. The captured back EMF
          energy maybe used to charge or store electrical energy in a
          recovery battery. The amount of energy recoverable, as
          expressed in watts, is dependent upon the configuration,
          circuitry, switching elements and the number and size of
          stators, rotors, magnets and coils that comprise the motor. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The motor uses a small amount of
          energy from a primary battery to "trigger" a larger input of
          available energy by supplying back EMF, thus increasing the
          potential energy of the system. The system then utilizes this
          available potential energy to reduce or reverse the back EMF,
          thereby increasing the efficiency of the motor and, therefore,
          the COP. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">If the energy in phase 1 (the
          power-out phase) is increased by additional available energy
          in the electromagnetics themselves, then the energy in phase 1
          can be made greater than the energy in phase 2 (the
          power-back-in phase) without the operator furnishing the
          energy utilized. This produces a non-conservative net field.
          Net power can then be taken from the rotating stator and
          flywheel, because the available energy added into the stator
          and flywheel by the additional effects is transformed by the
          rotor/flywheel into excess angular momentum and stored as
          such. Angular momentum is conserved at all times; but now some
          of the angular momentum added to the flywheel is evoked by
          additional effects in the electromagnetics rather than being
          furnished by the operator. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">That is, the motor deliberately
          creates a back EMF itself and its potential energy once at a
          time, thereby retaining each extra force for a period of time
          and applying it to increase the angular momentum and kinetic
          energy of the rotor and flywheel. Specifically, this back EMF
          energy with its net force is deliberately applied in the motor
          of the present invention to overcome and even reverse the
          conventional drag-back (the back EMF). Hence less energy must
          be taken from the rotor and flywheel to overcome the reduced
          back EMF, and in the ideal case none is required since the
          back EMF has been overpowered and converted to forward EMF by
          the back EMF energy and force. In the motor, the conventional
          drag section of the magnetics becomes a forward-EMF section
          and now adds energy to the rotor/flywheel instead of
          subtracting it. The important feature is that the operator
          only pays for the small amount of energy necessary to trigger
          the back EMF from the primary battery, and does not have to
          furnish the much larger back EMF energy itself. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">When the desired energy in phase 1
          (the power out phase) is thus made greater than the undesired
          drag energy in phase 2, then part of the output power normally
          dragged from the rotor and flywheel by the fields in phase 2
          is not required. Hence, additional power compared to the
          system (without the special back EMF mechanisms) is available
          from the rotor/flywheel. The rotor maintains additional
          angular momentum and kinetic energy, compared to a system,
          which does not produce back EMF itself. Consequently, the
          excess angular momentum retained by the rotor and flywheel can
          be utilized as additional shaft power to power an external
          load connected to the shaft. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the motor, several known
          processes and methods are utilized which allow the motor to
          operate periodically as an open dissipative system (receiving
          available excess energy from back EMF) far from thermodynamic
          equilibrium, whereby. it produces and receives its excess
          energy from a known external source. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A method is utilized to temporarily
          produce a much larger source of available external energy
          around an energized coil. Design features of this new motor
          provide a device and method that can immediately produce a
          second increase in that energy concurrently as the energy flow
          is reversed. Therefore, the motor is capable of producing two
          asymmetrical back EMFs, one after the other, of the energy
          within a single coil, which dramatically increases the energy
          available and causes that available excess energy to then
          enter the circuit impulsively, being collected and utilized. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The motor utilizes this available
          excess back EMF energy to overcome and even reverse the drag
          EMF between stator pole and rotor pole, while furnishing only
          a small trigger pulse of energy from a primary battery
          necessary to control and activate the direction of the back
          EMF energy flow. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">By using a number of such dual
          asymmetrical self back EMFs for every revolution of the rotor,
          the rotor and flywheel collectively focus all the excess
          impulsive inputs into increased angular momentum (expressed as
          energy.times.time), shaft torque, and shaft power. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Further, some of the excess energy
          deliberately generated in the coil by the utilization of the
          dual process manifests in the form of excess electrical energy
          in the circuit and can be utilized to charge a recovery
          battery(s). The excess energy can also be used to power
          electrical loads or to power the rotor and flywheel, with the
          rotor/flywheel also furnishing shaft horsepower for powering
          mechanical loads. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The motor utilizes a means to
          furnish the relatively small amount of energy from a primary
          battery to initiate the impulsive asymmetrical self back EMF
          actions. Then part of the available excess electrical power
          drawn off from back EMF created energy is utilized to charge a
          recovery battery with dramatically increased over-voltage
          pulses. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Design features of this monopole
          motor utilize one magnetic pole of each rotor and stator
          magnet. The number of impulsive self-back EMF in a single
          rotation of the rotor is doubled. Advanced designs can
          increase the number of self-back EMFs in a single rotor
          rotation with the result that there is an increase in the
          number of impulses per rotation, which increase the power
          output of this new motor. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The sharp voltage spike produced in
          the coil of this monopole motor by the rapidly collapsing
          field in the back EMF coil is connected to a recovery
          battery(s) in charge mode and to an external electrical load.
          The net result is that the coil asymmetrically creates back
          EMF itself in a manner adding available energy and impulse to
          the circuit. The available energy collected in the coil is
          used to reverse the back-EMF phase of the stator-rotor fields
          to a forward EMF condition, impulsively adding acceleration
          and angular momentum to the rotor and flywheel. The available
          back EMF energy collected in the coil is used to charge a
          battery. Loads can then be drawn off the battery. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A device and method in which the
          monopole motor alters the reaction cross section of the coils
          in the circuit, which momentarily changes the reaction cross
          section of the coil in which it is invoked. Thus, by this new
          motor using only a small amount of current in the form of a
          triggering pulse, it is able to evoke and control the
          immediate change of the coil's reaction cross section to this
          normally wasted energy-flow component. As a result, the motor
          captures and directs some of this usually wasted available
          environmental energy, collecting the available excess energy
          in the coil and then releasing it for use in the motor. By
          timing and switching, the innovative gate design in this new
          motor directs the available excess energy so that it overcomes
          and reverses the return EMF of the rotor-stator pole
          combination during what would normally be the back EMF and
          demonstrates the creation of the second back EMF of the
          system. Now instead of an "equal retardation" force being
          produced in the back EMF region, a forward EMF is produced
          that is additive to the rotor/flywheel energy and not
          subtractive. In short, it further accelerates the
          rotor/flywheel. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This results in a non-conservative
          magnetic field along the rotor's path. The line integral of
          the field around that path (i.e., the net work on the
          rotor/flywheel to increase its energy and angular momentum) is
          not zero but a significant amount. Hence, the creation of an
          asymmetrical back EMF impulse magnetic motor: 1) takes its
          available excess energy from a known external source, the huge
          usually non-intercepted portion of the energy flow around the
          coil; 2) further increases the source dipolarity by this back
          EMF energy; and 3) produces available excess energy flow
          directly from the source dipole's increased broken symmetry in
          its fierce energy exchange with the local vacuum. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">By operating as an open dissipative
          system not in thermodynamic equilibrium with the active
          vacuum, the system can permissibly receive available energy
          from a known environmental source and then output this energy
          to a load. As an open dissipative system not in thermodynamic
          equilibrium, this new and unique monopole motor can tap in on
          back EMF to energize itself, loads and losses simultaneously,
          fully complying with known laws of physics and thermodynamics.

            INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">An embodiment of the present
          invention is a device and method for a monopole back EMF
          electromagnetic motor. As described in the Summary of the
          Invention, this monopole motor conforms to all applicable
          electrodynamic laws of physics and is in harmony with the law
          of the conservation of energy, the laws of electromagnetism
          and other related natural laws of physics. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The monopole back EMF
          electromagnetic motor comprises a combination of elements and
          circuitry to capture available energy (back EMF) in a recovery
          element, such as a capacitor, from output coils. The available
          stored energy in the recovery element is used to charge a
          recovery battery. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">As a starting point and an
          arbitrary method in describing this device, the flow of
          electrical energy and mechanical forces will be tracked from
          the energy's inception at the primary battery to its final
          storage in the recovery battery. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 1 is a perspective side view
          of the monopole motor according to an embodiment of the
          invention. As shown in FIG. 1, electrical energy from primary
          battery 11 periodically flows through power switch 12 and on
          to and through power-coil wiring 13a. In one embodiment, power
          switch 12 is merely an On-Off mechanical switch and is not
          electronic. However, the switch 12 may be a solid-state
          switching circuit, a magnetic Reed switch, a commutator, an
          optical switch, a Hall switch, or any other conventional
          transistorized or mechanical switch. Coil 13 is comprised of
          three windings: power-coil winding 13a, trigger-coil winding
          13b, and recovery-coil winding 13c. However, the number of
          windings can be more or fewer than three, depending upon the
          size of the coil 13, size of the motor and the amount of
          available energy to be captured, stored and used, as measured
          in watts. Electrical energy then periodically flows from
          power-coil winding 13a and through transistor 14. Trigger
          energy also periodically flows through variable potentiometer
          15 and resistor 16. Clamping diode 17 clamps the reverse
          base-emitter voltage of transistor switch 14 at a safe
          reverse-bias level that does not damage the transistor 14.
          Energy flows to stator 18a and pole piece 18b, an extension of
          stator 18a. Pole piece 18b is electrically magnetized only
          when transistor switch 14 is on and maintains the same
          polarity as the rotor poles 19--here North pole--when
          electrically magnetized. The North rotor poles 19a, 19b and
          19c, which are attached to rotor 20, come in momentary
          apposition with pole piece 18b creating a momentary monopole
          interface. The poles 19a,b,c, which are actually permanent
          magnets with their North poles facing outward from the rotor
          20, maintain the same polarity when in momentary apposition
          with pole piece 18b. Rotor 20 is attached to rotor shaft 21,
          which has drive pulley 22. Attached to rotor shaft 21 are
          rotor-shaft bearing blocks 31a and 31b, as seen in FIG. 2. As
          rotor 20 begins to rotate, the poles 19a,b,c respectively
          comes in apposition with magnetized pole piece 18b in a
          momentary monopole interface with energy flowing through diode
          bridge rectifier 23 and capacitor 24. The number of capacitors
          may be of a wide range, depending upon the amount of energy to
          be temporarily stored before being expelled or flash charged
          into recovery battery 29. Timing belt 25 connects drive pulley
          22 on timing shaft 21 to timing wheel 26. Attached to timing
          wheel 26 is contact rotor 27, a copper insulated switch that
          upon rotation, comes in contact with brushes on mechanical
          switch 28. The means for counting the number of rotor
          revolutions may be a timing gear or a timing belt. Finally,
          the available energy derived from the back EMF that is stored
          in capacitor 24 is then discharged and stored in recovery
          battery 29. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 2 is a mechanical perspective
          top view of the monopole motor of the instant invention
          without electrical circuitry. Stator 18a consists of coil 13,
          which is comprised of three separate coil windings: power-coil
          winding 13a, trigger-coil winding 13b and recovery-coil
          winding 13c. Pole piece 18b is at the end of stator 18a. As
          rotor 20, which is attached to rotor shaft 21, rotates, each
          pole 19 respectively comes in a momentary monopole interface
          with pole piece 18b. The polarity of pole piece 18b is
          constant when electrically magnetized. Rotor shaft 21 has
          rotor shaft bearing blocks 31a,b attached to it for
          stabilization of rotor shaft 21. Attached to rotor shaft 21 is
          drive pulley 22 with timing belt 25 engaged onto it. Another
          means for timing may be a timing gear. Timing belt 25 engages
          timing wheel 26 at its other end. Timing wheel 26 is attached
          to timing shaft 30. Shaft 30 is stabilized with timing shaft
          bearing blocks 32a,b. At one end of timing shaft 30 is contact
          rotor 27 with brush 28a, which, upon rotation of timing shaft
          26, comes into momentary contact with brushes 28b,c. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 3 is a block diagram detailing
          the circuitry of the monopole motor. Block 40 represents
          primary battery 11 with energy flowing to coil block 41, which
          represents coil windings 13a,b,c. From coil block 41 energy
          flows into three directions: to trigger-circuit block 42,
          transistor-circuit block 43, and rectifier-circuit block 44.
          Energy flows from rectifier-block 44 to storage-capacitor
          block 45 with energy flowing from block 45 to both
          recovery-battery block 46 and rotor-switch block 47. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Referring to FIG. 1, the operation
          of the motor is described according to an embodiment of the
          invention. For purpose of explanation, assume that the rotor
          20 is initially not moving, and one of the poles 19 is in the
          three o'clock position. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">First, one closes the switch 12.
          But because the transistor 14 is off, no current flows through
          the winding 13a. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Next, one starts the motor by
          rotating the rotor 20, for example in a clockwise rotation.
          One may rotate the rotor by hand, or with a conventional
          motor-starting device or circuit (not shown). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">As the rotor 20 rotates, the pole
          19 rotates from the three o'clock position toward the pole
          piece 18b and generates a magnetic flux in the windings
          13a-13c. More specifically, the stator 18a and the pole piece
          18b include a ferromagnetic material such as iron. Therefore,
          as the pole 19 rotates nearer to the pole piece 18b, it
          magnetizes the pole piece 18b to a polarity--here South--that
          is opposite to the polarity of the pole 19--here North. This
          magnetization of the pole piece 18b generates a magnetic flux
          in the windings 13a-13c. Furthermore, this magnetization also
          causes a magnetic attraction between the pole 19 and the pole
          piece 18b. This attraction pulls the pole 19 toward the pole
          piece 18b, and thus reinforces the rotation of the rotor 20. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The magnetic flux in the windings
          13a-13c generates respective voltages across the windings.
          More specifically, as the pole 19 rotates toward the pole
          piece 18b, the magnetization of the stator 18a and the pole
          piece 18b, and thus the flux in the windings 13a-13c,
          increase. This increasing flux generates respective voltages
          across the windings 13a-13c such that the dotted (top) end of
          each winding is more positive than the opposite end. These
          voltages are proportional to the rate at which the flux is
          increasing, and thus are proportional to the velocity of the
          pole 19. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">At some point, the voltage across
          the winding 13b becomes high enough to turn on the transistor
          14c. This turn-on, i.e., trigger, voltage depends on the
          combined serial resistance of the potentiometer 15 and the
          resistor 16. The higher this combined resistance, the higher
          the trigger voltage, and vice-versa. Therefore, one can set
          the level of the trigger voltage by adjusting the
          potentiometer 15. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In addition, depending on the level
          of voltage across the capacitor 24, the voltage across the
          winding 13c may be high enough to cause an energy recovery
          current to flow through the winding 13c, the rectifier 23, and
          the capacitor 24. Thus, when the recovery current flows, the
          winding 13c is converting magnetic energy from the rotating
          pole 19 into electrical energy, which is stored in the
          capacitor 24. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Once turned on, the transistor 14
          generates an opposing magnetic flux in the windings 13a-13c.
          More specifically, the transistor 14 draws a current from the
          battery 11, through the switch 12 and the winding 13b. This
          current increases and generates an increasing magnetic flux
          that opposes the flux generated by the rotating pole 19. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">When the opposing magnetic flux
          exceeds the flux generated by the rotating pole 19, the
          opposing flux reinforces the rotation of the rotor 20.
          Specifically, when the opposing flux --- which is generated by
          the increasing current through the winding 13a--exceeds the
          flux generated by the pole 19, the magnetization of the pole
          piece 18 inverts to North pole. Therefore, the
          reverse-magnetic pole piece 18 repels the pole 19, and thus
          imparts a rotating force to the rotor 20. The pole piece 18
          rotates the rotor 20 with maximum efficiency if the pole-piece
          magnetization inverts to North when the center of the pole 19
          is aligned with the center of the pole piece. One typically
          adjusts the potentiometer 15 to set the trigger voltage of the
          transistor 14 at a level that attains or approximates this
          maximum efficiency. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The transistor 14 then turns off
          before the opposing flux can work against the rotation of the
          rotor 20. Specifically, if the pole piece 18 remains
          magnetized to North pole, it will repel the next pole 19 in a
          direction--counterclockwise in this example--opposite to the
          rotational direction of the rotor 20. Therefore, the motor
          turns the transistor 14, and thus demagnetizes the pole piece
          18, before this undesirable repulsion occurs. More
          specifically, when the opposing flux exceeds the flux
          generated by the pole 19, the voltage across the winding 13b
          reverses polarity such that the dotted end is less positive
          than the opposite end. The voltage across the winding 13b
          decreases as the opposing flux increases. At some point, the
          voltage at the base of the transistor decreases to a level
          that turns off the transistor 14. This turn-off point depends
          on the combined resistance of the potentiometer 15 and
          resistor 16 and the capacitance (not shown) at the transistor
          base. Therefore, one can adjust the potentiometer 15 or use
          other conventional techniques to adjust the timing of this
          turn-off point. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The rectifier 23 and capacitor 24
          recapture the energy that is released by the magnetic field
          --- and that would otherwise be lost--when the transistor 14
          turns off. Specifically, turning off the transistor 14
          abruptly cuts off the current that flows through the winding
          13a. This generates voltage spikes across the windings 13a-13c
          where the dotted ends are less positive than the respective
          opposite ends. These voltage spikes represent the energy
          released as the current-induced magnetization of the stator
          18a and the pole piece 18b collapses, and may have a magnitude
          of several hundred volts. But as the voltage spike across the
          winding 13c increases above the sum of the two diode drops of
          the rectifier 23, it causes an energy-recovery current to flow
          through the rectifier 23 and the voltage across the capacitor
          24 charge the capacitor 24. Thus, a significant portion of the
          energy released upon collapse of the current-induced magnetic
          field is recaptured and stored as a voltage in the capacitor
          24. In addition, the diode 17 prevents damage to the
          transistor 14 by clamping the reverse base-emitter voltage
          caused by the voltage spike across the winding 13b. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The recaptured energy can be used
          in a number of ways. For example, the energy can be used to
          charge a battery 29. In one embodiment, the timing wheel 26
          makes two revolutions for each revolution of the rotor 20. The
          contact rotor 27 closes a switch 28, and thus dumps the charge
          on the capacitor 24 into the battery 29, once each revolution
          of the wheel 26. Other energy-recapture devices and techniques
          can be used as well. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">One can stop the rotor 20 by
          braking it or by opening the switch 12. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Other embodiments of the monopole
          motor are contemplated. For example, instead of remaining
          closed for the entire operation of the motor, the switch 12
          may be a conventional optical switch or a Hall switch that
          opens and closes automatically at the appropriate times. To
          increase the power of the motor, one can increase the number
          of stators 18a and pole pieces 18b, the number of poles 19, or
          both. Furthermore, one can magnetize the stator 18a and pole
          piece 18b during the attraction of the pole 19 instead of or
          in addition to magnetizing the stator and pole piece during
          the repulsion of the pole 19. Moreover, the stator 18a may be
          omitted such that the coil 13 has an air coil, or the stator
          18a and the pole piece 18b may compose a permanent magnet. In
          addition, although the transistor 14 is described as being a
          bipolar transistor, it may be a MOS transistor. Furthermore,
          the recaptured energy may be used to recharge the battery 11.
          In addition, although described as rotating in a clockwise
          direction, the rotor 20 can rotate in a counterclockwise
          direction. Moreover, although described as attracting a rotor
          pole 19 when no current flows through winding 13a and
          repelling the pole 19 when a current flows through winding
          13a, the pole piece 18b may be constructed so that it attracts
          the pole 19 when a current flows through winding 13a and
          repels the pole 19 when no current flows through winding 13a.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In multiple stator/rotor systems,
          each individual stator may be energized one at a time or all
          of the stators may be energized simultaneously. Any number of
          stators and rotors may be incorporated into the design of such
          multiple stator/rotor monopole motor combinations. However,
          while there may be several stators per rotor, there can only
          be one rotor for a single stator. The number of stators and
          rotors that would comprise a particular motor is dependent
          upon the amount of power required in the form of watts. Any
          number of magnets, used in a monopole fashion, may comprise a
          single rotor. The number of magnets incorporated into a
          particular rotor is dependent upon the size of the rotor and
          power required of the motor. The desired size and horse power
          of the motor determines whether the stators will be in
          parallel or fired sequentially. Energy is made accessible
          through the capturing of available energy from the back EMF as
          a result of the unique circuitry and timing of the monopole
          motor. Individual motors may be connected in sequence with
          each motor having various combinations of stators and rotors
          or in parallel. Each rotor may have any number of rotor
          magnets, all arranged without change of polarity. The number
          of stators for an individual motor may also be of a wide
          range. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">One feature that distinguishes this
          motor from all others in the art is the use of monopole
          magnets in momentary apposition with the pole piece of the
          stator maintaining the same polarity when magnetized. In this
          particular embodiment, there are three magnets and one pole
          piece, said pole piece an extension of a permanent-magnet
          stator. Finally, although the invention has been described
          with reference of particular means, materials and embodiments,
          it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to
          the particulars disclosed and extends to all equivalents
          within the scope of the claims.</p>

          <p><b>Abstract --- </b>This invention is a back EMF permanent
            electromagnetic motor generator and method using a regauging
            process for capturing available electromagnetic energy in
            the system. The device is comprised of a rotor with magnets
            of the same polarity; a timing wheel in apposition to a
            magnetic Hall Effect pickup switch semiconductor; and a
            stator comprised of two bars connected by a permanent magnet
            with magnetized pole pieces at one end of each bar. There
            are input and output coils created by wrapping each bar with
            a conducting material such as copper wire. Energy from the
            output coils is transferred to a recovery rectifier or
            diode. The magnets of the rotor, which is located on a shaft
            along with the timing wheel, are in apposition to the
            magnetized pole pieces of the two bars. The invention works
            through a process of regauging, that is, the flux fields
            created by the coils is collapsed because of a reversal of
            the magnetic field in the magnetized pole pieces thus
            allowing the capture of available back EMF energy.
            Additional available energy may be captured and used to
            re-energize the battery, and/or sent in another direction to
            be used as work. As an alternative, the available back EMF
            energy may be dissipated into the system. </p>

          <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
          <p>[0001] <b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
          <p>[0002] The invention relates generally to the capturing of
            electromagnetic energy using a method and device to create
            back EMF (electromagnetic force) and re-phasing of the back
            EMF to recycle and capture the available back EMF energy.
            Back EMF is also referred to as regauging and may be defined
            as energy created by the magnetic field from coils, and only
            by coils, and not by magnets. </p>
          <p>[0003] <b>2. Background Information and Related Art</b> </p>
          <p>[0004] Operation of a normal magnetic motor has the rotor
            pole attracting the stator pole, resulting in the generation
            of power from the magnets to the rotor and flywheel. During
            this phase, energy flows from the magnetics to the
            rotor/flywheel and is stored in the increased rotation. A
            rotor pole leaving a stator pole and creating a condition of
            drag-back results in power having to be put back into the
            magnetic section by the rotor and flywheel to forcibly
            overcome the drag-back. In a perfect, friction-free motor,
            the net force field is therefore referred to as most
            conservative. In other words, a most conservative EMF motor
            has maximum efficiency. Without extra energy continually fed
            to the motor, no net work can be done by the magnetic field,
            since half the time the magnetic field adds energy to the
            load (the rotor and flywheel) and the other half of the time
            it subtracts energy back from the load (the rotor and
            flywheel). Therefore the total net energy output is zero in
            any such rotary process without additional energy input. To
            use a present day magnetic motor, continuous energy must be
            input into the motor to overcome drag-back and to power the
            motor and its load. </p>
          <p>[0005] Present EMF motors and generators all use such
            conservative fields and therefore, have internal losses.
            Hence, it is necessary to continually input all of the
            energy that the motor outputs to the load, plus more energy
            to cover losses inside the motor itself. EMF motors are
            rated for efficiency and performance by how much energy
            input into the motor actually results in output energy to
            the load. Normally, the Coefficient of Performance (COP)
            rating is used as a measure of efficiency. The COP is the
            actual output energy going into the load and powering it,
            divided by the energy that must be input into the device
            with its load. COP is the power out into the load, divided
            by the power input into the motor/load combination. If there
            were zero internal losses in a motor, that "perfect" motor
            would have a coefficient of performance (COP) equal to 1.0.
            That is, all energy input into the motor would be output by
            the motor directly into the load, and none of the input
            energy would be lost or dissipated in the motor itself. </p>
          <p>[0006] In magnetic motor generators presently in use,
            however, due to friction and design flaws, there are always
            internal losses and inefficiencies. Some of the energy input
            into the motor is dissipated in these internal losses. As a
            consequence, the energy that gets to the load is always less
            than the input energy. So a standard motor operates with a
            COP of less than 1.0 which is expressed as COP&lt;1.0. An
            inefficient motor may have a COP=0.4 or 0.45, while a
            specially designed, highly efficient motor may have a
            COP=0.85. </p>
          <p>[0007] The conservative field inside of a motor itself can
            be divided into two phases. Producing a conservative field
            involves net symmetry between the "power out" phase from the
            magnetics to the rotor/flywheel and the "power back in"
            phase from the rotor/flywheel back to the magnetics. That
            is, the two flows of energy (one from the magnetics into the
            rotor and flywheel, and one from the rotor and flywheel back
            to the magnetics) are identical in magnitude but opposite in
            direction. Each phase alone is said to be "asymmetrical";
            that is, it either has: 1) a net energy flow out to the
            rotor/flywheel; or 2) a net energy flow back into the
            magnetics from the rotor/flywheel. In simplified terms, it
            is referred to as "power out" and "power back in" phases
            with respect to the motor magnetics. Hence, the two
            asymmetrical phases are: 1) the power-out phase; and 2) the
            "power back in" phase, with reference to the magnetics. </p>
          <p>[0008] For the power-out phase, energy is derived from the
            EMF existing between the stator pole and incoming rotor pole
            in an attraction mode. In this phase, the rotary motion
            (angular momentum and kinetic energy) of the rotor and
            flywheel is increased. In short, power is added to the
            rotor/flywheel (and thus to the load) from the fields
            between stator pole and rotor pole (the electromagnetic
            aspects of the system). </p>
          <p>[0009] For the "power back in" phase, energy must be fed
            back into the magnetics from the rotor and flywheel (and the
            load) to overcome the drag-back forces existing between
            stator pole and outgoing rotor pole. In this phase, energy
            is returned back to the internal magnetic system from the
            rotary motion of the rotor and flywheel (the angular
            momentum, which is the rotational energy.times.time). As is
            well known in physics, a rotor/flywheel's angular momentum
            provides a convenient way to store energy with the spinning
            rotor/flywheel mass acting as an energy reservoir. </p>
          <p>[0010] All present day conventional magnetic motors use
            various methods for overcoming and partially reversing back
            EMF. Back EMF is the return pulse from the coil out of phase
            and is also referred to as regauging. The back EMF is
            shorted out and the rotor is attracted back in, therefore
            eliminating back drag. This can be accomplished by pouring
            in more energy, which overpowers the back EMF, thereby
            producing a forward EMF in that region. The energy required
            for this method must be furnished by the operator. </p>
          <p>[0011] The motor of the present invention uses only a small
            amount of energy to "trigger" a much larger input of
            available energy by supplying back EMF, thus increasing the
            potential energy of the system. It then utilizes this excess
            potential energy to reduce or reverse back EMF, thereby
            increasing the efficiency of the motor and, therefore, the
            COP. </p>
          <p>[0012] If the energy in phase 1 (the power-out phase) is
            increased by additional available energy in the
            electromagnetics themselves, then the energy in phase 1 can
            be made greater than the energy in phase 2 (the
            power-back-in phase) without the operator furnishing the
            energy utilized. This produces a non-conservative net field.
            Net power can then be taken from the rotating stator and
            flywheel, because the available energy added into the stator
            and flywheel by the additional effects, is transformed by
            the rotor/flywheel into excess angular momentum and stored
            as such. Angular momentum is conserved at all times; but now
            some of the angular momentum added to the flywheel is evoked
            by additional effects in the electromagnetics rather than
            being furnished by the operator. </p>
          <p>[0013] Electrodynamicists assume that the potential
            available energy of any system can be changed at will and
            without cost. This is back EMF and is well-known in physics.
            It is also routinely employed by electrodynamicists in the
            theoretical aspects. But to simplify the mathematics,
            electrodynamicists will create a back EMF twice
            simultaneously, each back EMF carefully selected just so
            that the two available forces that are produced are equal
            and opposite and cancel each other "symetrically". This is
            referred to as "symmetrical back EMF" . A symmetrical back
            EMF system cannot produce a COP&gt;1.0. </p>
          <p>[0014] On the other hand, the motor of the present
            invention deliberately creates a back EMF itself and its
            potential energy only once at a time, thereby retaining each
            extra force for a period of time and applying it to increase
            the angular momentum and kinetic energy of the rotor and
            flywheel. Specifically, this back EMF energy with its net
            force is deliberately applied in the motor of the present
            invention to overcome and even reverse the conventional
            drag-back (the back EMF). Hence less energy must be taken
            from the rotor and flywheel to overcome the reduced back
            EMF, and in the ideal case none is required since the back
            EMF has been overpowered and converted to forward EMF by the
            back EMF energy and force. In the motor of the present
            invention, the conventional back-drag section of the
            magnetics becomes a forward-EMF section and now adds energy
            to the rotor/flywheel instead of subtracting it. The
            important feature is that the operator only pays for the
            small amount of energy necessary to trigger the back EMF,
            and does not have to furnish the much larger back EMF energy
            itself. </p>
          <p>[0015] When the desired energy in phase 1 (the power out
            phase) is thus made greater than the undesired "drag-back"
            energy in phase 2, then part of the output power normally
            dragged back from the rotor and flywheel by the fields in
            phase 2 is not required. Hence, additional power compared to
            the system (without the special back EMF mechanisms) is
            available from the rotor/flywheel. The rotor maintains
            additional angular momentum and kinetic energy, compared to
            a system which does not produce back EMF itself.
            Consequently, the excess angular momentum retained by the
            rotor and flywheel can be utilized as additional shaft power
            to power an external load connected to the shaft. </p>
          <p>[0016] A standard magnetic motor operates as the result of
            the motor being furnished with external energy input into
            the system by the operator to reduce phase 2 (power back
            into the magnetics from the rotor/flywheel) by any of
            several methods and mechanisms. The primary purpose of this
            external energy input into the system is to overcome the
            back EMF and also provide for the inevitable energy losses
            in the system. There is no input of energy separate from the
            operator input. Therefore, the COP of any standard magnetic
            motor is COP less than 1.0. The efficiency of a standard
            magnetic motor varies from less than 50% to a maximum of
            about 85% , and so has a COP&lt;1.0. When nothing is done in
            the motor that will produce a reduction of the back EMF
            without the operator inputing all the energy for it, then
            for even a frictionless, ideal permanent magnet motor, the
            COP can never exceed 1.0. </p>
          <p>[0017] Until the introduction of the motor of the present
            invention, it has been standard universal practice that the
            operator must furnish all energy used to reduce the back
            EMF, provide for the internal losses, and power the load. It
            is therefore a common belief by the scientific community
            that an ideal (loss-less) permanent magnet motor cannot
            exceed COP=1.0. And that is true, so long as the operator
            himself must furnish all the energy. Further, since real
            permanent magnetic motors have real internal losses, some of
            the input energy is always lost in the motor itself, and
            that lost energy is not available for powering the
            rotor/flywheel and load. Hence a real permanent magnetic
            motor of the conventional kind will always have a
            COP&lt;1.0. </p>
          <p>[0018] The common assumption that the COP of a motor is
            limited to less than 1.0 is not necessarily true, and that
            COP&gt;1.0 is permitted without violating the laws of
            nature, laws of physics, or laws of thermodynamics. However,
            it can immediately be seen that any permanent magnet motor
            exhibiting a COP&gt;1.0 must have some available energy
            input returning in the form of back EMF. </p>
          <p>[0019] A problem relates to how back EMF energy can be
            obtained from a circuit's external environment for the
            specific task of reducing the back-drag EMF without the
            operator having to supply any input of that excess energy.
            In short, the ultimate challenge is to find a way to cause
            the system to: 1) become an open dissipative system, that
            is, a system receiving available excess energy from its
            environment, in other words, from an external source; and 2)
            use that available excess energy to reduce the drag-back EMF
            between stator and rotor poles as the rotor pole is leaving
            the stator pole. If this objective can be accomplished, the
            system will be removed from thermodynamic equilibrium.
            Instead, it will be converted to a system
            out-of-thermodynamic equilibrium. Such a system is not
            required to obey classical equilibrium thermodynamics. </p>
          <p>[0020] Instead, an out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic system
            must obey the thermodynamics of open systems far from the
            established and well-known parameters of thermodynamic
            equilibrium. As is well known in the physics of
            thermodynamics, such open systems can permissibly: 1)
            self-order; 2) self-oscillate; 3) output more back EMF
            energy than energy input by the operator (the available
            excess back EMF energy is received from an external source
            and some energy is input by the operator as well); 4) power
            itself as well as its loads and losses simultaneously (in
            that case, all the energy is received from the available
            external source and there is no input energy from the
            operator); and 5) exhibit negentropy, that is, produce an
            increase of energy that is available in the system, and that
            is independent of the energy put into the system by the
            operator. As a definition, entropy roughly corresponds to
            the energy of a system that has become unavailable for use.
            Negentropy corresponds to additional energy of a system that
            has become available for use. </p>
          <p>[0021] In the back EMF permanent magnet electromagnetic
            motor generator of the present invention, several known
            processes and methods are utilized which allow the invention
            to operate periodically as an open dissipative system
            (receiving available excess energy from back EMF) far from
            thermodynamic equilibrium, whereby it produces and receives
            its excess energy from a known external source. </p>
          <p>[0022] A method is utilized to temporarily produce a much
            larger source of available external energy around an
            energized coil. Then the unique design features of this new
            motor provides a method and mechanism that can immediately
            produce a second increase in that energy, concurrently as
            the energy flow is reversed. Therefore, the motor is capable
            of producing two asymmetrical back EMFs, one after the
            other, of the energy within a single coil, which
            dramatically increases the energy available and causes that
            available excess energy to then enter the circuit
            impulsively, being collected and utilized. </p>
          <p>[0023] The present motor utilizes this available excess
            back EMF energy to overcome and even reverse the back-drag
            EMF between stator pole and rotor pole, while furnishing
            only a small trigger pulse of energy necessary to control
            and activate the direction of the back EMF energy flow. </p>
          <p>[0024] By using a number of such dual asymmetrical self
            back EMFs for every revolution of the rotor, the rotor and
            flywheel collectively focus all the excess impulsive inputs
            into increased angular momentum (expressed as
            energy.times.time), shaft torque, and shaft power. </p>
          <p>[0025] Further, some of the excess energy deliberately
            generated in the coil by the utilization of the dual process
            manifests in the form of excess electrical energy in the
            circuit and is utilized to power electrical loads, e.g., a
            lamp, fan, motor, or other electrical devices. The remainder
            of the excess energy generated in the coil can be used to
            power the rotor and flywheel, with the rotor/flywheel also
            furnishing shaft horsepower for powering mechanical loads. </p>
          <p>[0026] This new and unique motor utilizes a means to
            furnish the relatively small amount of energy to initiate
            the impulsive asymmetrical self back EMF actions. Then part
            of the available excess electrical power drawn off from the
            back EMFs is utilized to recharge the battery with
            dramatically increased over voltage pulses. </p>
          <p>[0027] The unique design features of this motor utilize
            both north and south magnetic poles of each rotor and stator
            magnet. Therefore, the number of impulsive self back EMFs in
            a single rotation of the rotor is doubled. Advanced designs
            increase the number of self back EMFs in a single rotor
            rotation with the result that there is an increase in the
            number of impulses per rotation which increase the power
            output of this new motor. </p>
          <p>[0028] The sharp voltage pulse produced in the coil of this
            new motor by the rapidly collapsing field in the back EMF
            coil is connected to a battery in charge mode and to an
            external electrical load. The net result is that the coil
            asymmetrically creates back EMF itself in a manner adding
            available energy and impulse to the circuit. The excess
            available energy collected in the coil is used to reverse
            the back-EMF phase of the stator-rotor fields to a forward
            EMF condition, impulsively adding acceleration and angular
            momentum to the rotor and flywheel. At the same time, a part
            of the excess energy collected in the coil is used to power
            electrical loads such as charging a battery and operating a
            lamp or such other device. </p>
          <p>[0029] It is well known in the art that changing the
            voltage alone creates a back EMF and requires no work. This
            is because to change the potential energy does not require
            changing the form of that potential energy, but only its
            magnitude. Work is rigorously the changing of the form of
            energy. Therefore, as long as the form of the potential
            energy is not changed, the magnitude can be changed without
            having to perform work in the process. The motor of the
            present invention takes advantage of this permissible
            operation to create back EMF asymmetrically, and thereby
            change its own usable available potential energy. </p>
          <p>[0030] In an electric power system, the potential (voltage)
            is changed by inputing energy to do work on the internal
            charges of the generator or battery. This potential energy
            is expended within the generator (or battery) to force the
            internal charges apart, forming a source dipole. Then the
            external closed circuit system connected to that source
            dipole ineptly pumps the spent electrons in the ground line
            back through the back EMF of the source dipole, thereby
            scattering the charges and killing the dipole. This shuts
            off the energy flow from the source dipole to the external
            circuit. As a consequence of that conventional method, it is
            a requirement to input and replace additional energy to
            again restore the dipole. The circuits currently utilized in
            most electrical generators have been designed to keep on
            destroying the energy flow by continually scattering all of
            the dipole charges and terminating the dipole. Therefore, it
            is necessary to keep on inputing energy to the generator to
            keep restoring its source dipole. </p>
          <p>[0031] An investigation of particle physics is required to
            see what furnishes the energy to the external circuit. Since
            neither a battery nor a generator furnishes energy to the
            external circuit, but only furnishes energy to form the
            source dipole, a better understanding of the electric power
            principle is required to fully understand how this new motor
            functions. A typical battery uses its stored chemical energy
            to form the source dipole. A generator utilizes its input
            shaft energy to rotate, forming an internal magnetic field
            in which the positive charges are forced to move in one
            direction and the negative charges in the reverse direction,
            thereby forming the source dipole. In other words, the
            energy input into the generator does nothing except form the
            source dipole. None of the input energy goes to the external
            circuit. If increased current is drawn into the external
            load, there also is increased spent electron flow being
            rammed back through the source dipole, destroying it faster.
            Therefore, dipole-restoring-energy has to be inputed faster.
            The chemical energy of the battery also is expended only to
            separate its internal charges and form its source dipole.
            Again, if increased current and power is drawn into the
            external load, there is increased spent electron flow being
            rammed back through the source dipole, destroying it faster.
            This results in a depletion of the battery's stored energy
            faster, by forcing it to have to keep restoring the dipole
            faster. </p>
          <p>[0032] Once the generator or battery source dipole is
            formed (the dipole is attached also to the external
            circuit), it is well known in particle physics that the
            dipole (as is any charge) is a broken symmetry in the vacuum
            energy flux. By definition, this means that the source
            dipole extracts and orders part of that energy received from
            its vacuum interaction, and pours that energy out as the
            energy flowing through all space surrounding the external
            conductors in the attached circuit. Most of this enormous
            energy flow surging through space surrounding the external
            circuit does not strike the circuit at all, and does not get
            intercepted or utilized. Neither is it diverged into the
            circuit to power the electrons, but passes on out into space
            and is just "wasted". Only a small "sheath" of the energy
            flow along the surface of the conductors strikes the surface
            charges in those conductors and is thereby diverged into the
            circuit to power the electrons. Standard texts show the huge
            available but wasted energy flow component, but only
            calculate the small portion of the energy flow that strikes
            the circuit, is caught by it, and is utilized to power it. </p>
          <p>[0033] In a typical circuit, the huge available but
            "wasted" component of the energy flow is about 10.sup.13
            times as large as is the small component intercepted by the
            surface charges and diverged into the circuit to power it.
            Hence, around every circuit and circuit element such as a
            coil, there exists a huge non-intercepted, non-diverged
            energy flow that is far greater than the small energy flow
            being diverted and used by the circuit or element. </p>
          <p>[0034] Thus there exists an enormous untapped energy flow
            immediately surrounding every EMF power circuit, from which
            available excess energy can be intercepted and collected by
            the circuit, if respective non-linear actions are initiated
            that sharply affect and increase the reaction cross section
            of the circuit (i.e., its ability to intercept this
            available but usually wasted energy flow). </p>
          <p>[0035] The method in which the motor of the present
            invention alters the reaction cross section of the coils in
            the circuit, is by a novel use, which momentarily changes
            the reaction cross section of the coil in which it is
            invoked. Thus, by this new motor using only a small amount
            of current in the form of a triggering pulse, it is able to
            evoke and control the immediate change of the coil's
            reaction cross section to this normally wasted energy flow
            component. As a result, the motor captures and directs some
            of this usually wasted environmental energy, collecting the
            available excess energy in the coil and then releasing it
            for use in the motor. By timing and switching, the
            innovative gate design in this new motor directs the
            available excess energy so that it overcomes and reverses
            the return EMF of the rotor-stator pole combination during
            what would normally be the back EMF and demonstrates the
            creation of the second back EMF of the system. Now instead
            of an "equal retardation" force being produced in the back
            EMF region, a forward EMF is produced that is additive to
            the rotor/flywheel energy and not subtractive. In short, it
            further accelerates the rotor/flywheel. </p>
          <p>[0036] This results in a non-conservative magnetic field
            along the rotor's path. The line integral of the field
            around that path (i.e., the net work on the rotor/flywheel
            to increase its energy and angular momentum) is not zero but
            a significant amount. Hence, the creation of an asymmetrical
            back EMF impulse magnetic motor: 1) takes its available
            excess energy from a known external source, the huge usually
            non-intercepted portion of the energy flow around the coil;
            2) further increases the source dipolarity by this back EMF
            energy; and 3) produces available excess energy flow
            directly from the source dipole's increased broken symmetry
            in its fierce energy exchange with the local vacuum. </p>
          <p>[0037] No laws of physics or thermodynamics are violated in
            the method and device of the present invention, and
            conservation of energy rigorously applies at all times.
            Nonetheless, by operating as an open dissipative system not
            in thermodynamic equilibrium with the active vacuum, the
            system can permissibly receive available excess energy from
            a known environmental source and output more energy to a
            load than must be input by the operator alone. As an open
            system not in thermodynamic equilibrium, this new and unique
            motor can tap in on back EMF to energize itself, loads and
            losses simultaneously, fully complying with known laws of
            physics and thermodynamics. </p>
          <p>[0038] A search of prior art failed to reveal any devices
            that recycle available energy from back EMF of a permanent
            electromagnetic motor generator as described in the present
            invention. However, the following prior art patents were

          <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION ~</b> </p>
          <p>[0066] The device and method of the present invention is a
            new permanent electromagnetic motor generator that recycles
            back EMF energy (regauging) thus allowing the motor to
            produce an energy level of COP=0.98, more or less, depending
            upon configuration, circuitry, switching elements and the
            number and size of stators, rotors and coils that comprise
            the motor. The rotor is fixed between two pole pieces of the
            stator. The motor generator is initially energized from a
            small starter battery means, analogous to a spark plug, that
            sends a small amount of energy to the motor, thus
            stimulating a rotating motion from the rotor. As the rotor
            rotates, energy is captured from the surrounding
            electromagnetic field containing an asymmetrical pulse wave
            of back EMF. The energy produced and captured can be
            directed in one of several directions, including returning
            energy to the initial starter battery, rotating a shaft for
            work and/or sending a current to energize a fan, light bulb
            or other such device. </p>

          <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
          <p>[0072] The present invention is a device and method for
            creating a back EMF permanent electromagnetic motor
            generator. As described in the Background Information, this
            new motor generator conforms to all applicable
            electrodynamic laws of physics and is in harmony with the
            law of the conservation of energy, the laws of
            electromagnetism and other related natural laws. </p>
          <p>[0073] The back EMF permanent electromagnetic motor
            generator is comprised of combination of electrical,
            material and magnetic elements to capture available
            electromagnetic energy (back EMF) in a recovery rectifier or
            single diode from output coils. The capturing of back EMF
            energy is also known as regauging in the art. As an
            arbitrary starting point in describing this invention, an
            input battery, as a means of energy, sends power through a
            power on-off switch and then to a means for timing such as a
            magnetic timing switch (Hall Effect magnetic pickup switch,
            a semiconductor) which interfaces with or is in apposition
            to a magnet on a timing wheel. The timing wheel may contain
            any number of magnets of one or more, with the South
            polarity facing outward and in apposition with the Hall
            Effect pickup switch. The timing wheel is mounted at the end
            of a shaft that also runs through the center midline of a
            rotor containing any number of magnets of two or more. The
            rotor magnets are arranged in a manner wherein they have the
            same polarity and are equidistant from each other. The shaft
            has the timing wheel mounted at one end, the rotor, and then
            a means for work, such as a power take off at the opposite
            end. However, there are other embodiments in which the
            position of the rotor, timing wheel and power take-off have
            other arrangements. The rotor is stabilized to a platform or
            housing means and is fixed in a stationary position within a
            stator. </p>
          <p>[0074] The stator is comprised of a permanent magnet
            connected to a means for conducting electromagnetic energy
            such as two parallel bars, each bar having a magnetized pole
            piece at one end of each bar. The conduction material of the
            bar may be ferrous, powdered iron, silicon steel, stainless
            magnetic steel, laminations of conductive material or any
            other magnetic conductive material. Each bar is wrapped in a
            conducting means to form an input coil. The means for
            conducting may be copper, aluminum or any other conductive
            material suitable for making a coil. The primary or input
            coil is connected to the switching circuit. A second
            conductive wrapping on top of the input coil becomes a
            secondary or output coil. The secondary or output coil is
            connected to the recovery circuit. The rotor is
            symmetrically located between the pole pieces of the bars of
            the stator and contains a series of magnets all having the
            same polarity, North or South, with each magnet in the rotor
            being in apposition to the pole piece as the rotor is in
            rotation around the shaft. </p>
          <p>[0075] When the rotor is energized from the battery of the
            switching circuit, there is an initial magnetic field that
            is instantly overcome as the magnetized pole pieces are in
            apposition with the rotor magnets. As the rotor begins to
            move, increasing electromagnetic energy is produced as a
            result of flux gaiting from the apposed magnets of the rotor
            and pole pieces. The coils surrounding the bars "buck" the
            permanent magnet connecting the bars. This is known in the
            art as the "buck boosting" principle. When the permanent
            magnet is bucked by the coils, it reverses the polarity of
            the pole pieces which are apposed to the rotor magnets
            causing the rotor to increase its rotation or spin. The
            energy available from the fields that are collapsing in the
            primary and secondary coils, which creates the back EMF
            within the system, is now in non-equilibrium. Through
            circuitry and a switching means, energy can be put back into
            the system. Available energy captured from the back EMF, may
            be applied in different directions, including re-energizing
            the input battery, storage in a capacitor, conversion by a
            recovery rectifier to be stored in the input battery, a
            capacitor or a secondary or recovery battery. Recovery
            rectifiers convert AC to DC. Available energy may be used to
            energize an electric bulb, fan or any other uses. </p>
          <p>[0076] The shaft in the midline of the rotor can transfer
            energy in the form of work through a power take-off. The
            power take-off may be connected to any number of secondary
            shafts, wheels, gears and belts to increase or reduce
            torque. </p>
          <p>[0077] This is a description of the basic invention,
            however, there are an innumerable number of combinations and
            embodiments of stators, rotors, Hall Effect magnetic pickup
            switches, coils, recovery rectifiers and electronic
            connecting modes that may be combined on a single shaft or
            several shafts connected in various combinations and
            sequences, and of various sizes. There may be any number of
            stators to one rotor, however, there can be only one rotor
            if there is a single stator. The number of Hall Effect
            pickup switches may vary, for example, in the case of
            multiple stators of high resistant coils, the coils may be
            parallel to form a low resistant coil so that one Hall
            Effect pickup with one circuit may fire all of the stators
            at the same time. The number of magnets in both the timing
            wheel and the rotor may also vary in number as well as the
            size and strength of the magnets in gauss units. All types
            of magnets may be used. The number of winds on both the
            input and output coils on each conducting bar may also vary
            in number and in conductive material. </p>
          <p>[0078] The motor generator, as shown in FIG. 1, is an
            example of a single stator, single rotor back EMF motor and
            is comprised of a means of providing energy, such as input
            battery 10 connected to power switch 11 (shown in FIG. 2)
            and Hall Effect magnetic pickup switch 13. Magnetic pickup
            13 interfaces with timing wheel 12 to form a timing switch.
            Timing wheel 12 is comprised of four magnets 14 with the
            South pole of each said magnet facing outward to magnetic
            pickup 13. Timing wheel 12 is fixed at one end of shaft 15.
            Located on shaft 15 is rotor 16. Rotor 16 can be of any
            size, said rotor containing four rotor magnets 17. Said
            rotor magnets 17 are arranged in a manner so all have the
            same polarity. Opposite timing wheel 12 on shaft 15 is a
            means for work, such as a power take-off 18. Rotor 16 is
            mounted in a fixed position with rotor magnets 17 in
            apposition with magnetized pole pieces 19a and 19b. Each
            pole piece 19a and 19b is connected to iron bars 20a and
            20b. Iron bars 20a and 20b are connected by a permanent
            magnet 21. A means for conduction is wrapped around iron
            bars 20a and 20b to form input coils 22a and 22b.
            Superimposed upon input coils 22a and 22b are output coils
            23a and 23b. Output coils 23a and 23b are connected to full
            wave bridge first recovery rectifier 24a. First rectifier
            24a is connected to battery 10. </p>
          <p>[0079] FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of the motor generator
            circuitry showing input coil connections from input battery
            10 through power switch 11, transistors 30a,b, resistors
            31a-d, through power supply lead 32 (VCC+) and to magnetic
            pickup 13. Magnetic pickup 13 is in apposition with timing
            wheel magnets 14 located on timing wheel 12. Off of magnetic
            pickup 13 is collector lead 33 and ground lead 34. When
            current is reversed, it flows through resistor 31e and
            transistor 30c to input battery 10. Input coils 22a,b send
            power to full wave bridge first recovery rectifier 24a which
            then sends power through switch recovery 27 back into the
            system, and/or to input battery 10. Output coils 23a and 23b
            send power through single diode second recovery rectifier
            24b to recovery battery 25. In this particular embodiment,
            the value and type number of the components are as follows:
            Hall Effect magnetic pickup switch 13 is a No. 3020;
            transistor 30a is a No. 2N-2955; transistor 30b is a No.
            MPS-8599; and transistor 30c is a No. 2N-3055; resistors 31a
            and b are 470 ohms resistors; resistor 31b is a 2.2K ohms
            resistor; resistor 31c is a 220 ohms resistor; resistor 31d
            is a 1K ohms resistor; and recovery rectifier 24a is a 10
            Amp, 400 volts bridge rectifier. </p>
          <p>[0080] FIG. 3 is a box diagram showing the flow of voltage
            from input battery A, through recovery circuit B, switching
            circuit C and motor coils D. Motor coils D send available
            back EMF energy through recovery circuit B, and from B to
            recovery battery E and input battery A. Available back EMF
            energy can also flow from switching circuit C to recovery
            circuit B. </p>
          <p>[0081] In multiple stator/rotor systems, each individual
            stator may be energized one at a time or all of the stators
            may be energized simultaneously. Any number of stators and
            rotors may be incorporated into the design of such multiple
            stator/rotor motor generator combinations. However, while
            there may be several stators per rotor, there can only be
            one rotor for a single stator. The number of stators and
            rotors that would comprise a particular motor generator is
            dependent upon the amount of power required in the form of
            watts. The desired size and horse power of the motor
            determines whether the stators will be in parallel or fired
            sequentially by the magnetic Hall Effect pickup switch or
            switches. The number of magnets incorporated into a
            particular rotor is dependent upon the size of the rotor and
            power required of the motor generator. In a multiple
            stator/rotor motor generator, the timing wheel may have one
            or more magnets, but must have one magnet Hall Effect pickup
            switch for each stator if the stators are not arranged in
            parallel. The back EMF energy is made available through the
            reversing of the polarity of the magnetized pole pieces thus
            collapsing the field around the coils and reversing the flow
            of energy to the recovery diodes, which is capturing the
            back EMF. </p>
          <p>[0082] Individual motors may be connected in sequence with
            each motor having various combinations of stators and rotors
            or in parallel. Each rotor may have any number of rotor
            magnets ranging from a minimum of 2 to maximum of 60. The
            number of stators for an individual motor may range from 1
            to 60 with the number of conducting bars ranging from 2 to
            120. </p>
          <p>[0083] What distinguishes this motor generator from all
            others in the art is the presence of a permanent magnet
            connecting the two conducting bars which transfer magnetic
            energy through the pole pieces to the rotor, thereby
            attracting the rotor between the pole pieces. With the rotor
            attracted in between the two pole pieces, the coils switch
            the polarity of the magnetic field of the pole pieces so
            that the rotor is repelled out. Therefore there is no
            current and voltage being used to attract the rotor. The
            only current being used is the repulsion of the rotor
            between the two conductive bar pole pieces thereby requiring
            only a small amount of current to repel the rotor. This is
            known as a regauging system and allows the capturing of
            available back EMF energy for use. Finally, although the
            invention has been described with reference of particular
            means, materials and embodiments, it is to be understood
            that the invention is not limited to the particulars
            disclosed and extends to all equivalents within the scope of
            the claims.</p>

          <p>Peter, <br>
            It may be a little premature for me to say this but so far I
            have noticed that my useless batteries are charging faster
            than the first battery is discharging. These batteries would
            not take a charge to the point they are now. I have not done
            a load test as they are still charging. It may be slow (it
            increased when I replaced the four magnet rotor with the 6)
            but there is clearly something unusual happening with this
            circuit. There is no way that motor could run so long and
            not discharge. I could understand the first battery powering
            the spinning and then running out. But how could it also
            charge the two batteries at once? Here we have power
            necessary to move the wheel (I don't see how there could be
            any more power to charge the other batteries beyond this
            with regular electricity). Then we have one battery charging
            faster than the discharge of the first. And then another
            battery is also charging slightly faster than the same
            discharge. </p>
          <p>So I have seen several very interesting things so far. And
            if the above continues to be true, and if useless batteries
            are recovered, and possibly improved, then we have something
            very remarkable. Time will tell, and is telling, that more
            energy is coming out than going in. I wonder what would
            happen if I had good batteries hooked up? There may be
            something with my CD setup that works better than others
            because the bearing allows for faster spinning. I think if
            we reduce friction and wobble and air flow resistance then
            we will see a more noticeable result. I do believe that the
            objects of this project are accomplished. I am wondering if
            it is worthwhile to attempt to add several coils to my
            latest unit to increase the charge (as I read somewhere it
            was possible, and as I have seen pictures on this group <br>
            http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/Bedini_SG/lst <br>
            Are these pictures with the same curcuit and coils? Or did
            they use an imporved circuit? (And is Burts "Improved Bedini
            Circuit" really that?) I have finished making another coil
            and circuit and was attempting to hook it up to my latest
            bike wheel when, after a few minutes of adjustments, I hit
            the magnets and knocked three off. Before that happened I
            noticed increased speed and less wobble and a faster volts
            charge (I have not been measuring amps yet). I hooked both
            circuits up to the same two batteries as I had no other
            batteries to use. When the magnets came off I decided to rip
            the others off and place them in a position to allow for 16
            to fit. I am about to start that up soon. How should I wire
            these? Should I use the same battery to power both circuits?
            And should I use the same other battery to receive charge
            from both? or should I add one or two more batteries to
            them? I ran out of wire to make any more coils but I could
            use the other coil and circuit to have three on this system.
          </p>
          <p>Are the improvements that can be made to this charger just
            a matter of adding minor componants like capacitors (as it
            appears from John's web site), or is it a much more invloved
            production? I watched carefully both of your videos and it
            would be far beyond me to reproduce anything like you
            explained there, unless it was made easy enough as with this
            project. If someone would show me what parts to buy and how
            to hook everything up, I would be very interested in doing
            that. </p>
          <p>I suppose that one reason for taking time before rushing on
            to a system that puts out more charge, beyond wanting
            everyone to really understand what is going on, is that
            higher output comes with a risk of more danger. If people do
            not understand what is taking place, and are making
            adjustments to it, then a more powerful unit may be
            dangerous if one does not know what they are doing. </p>
          <p>Looking forward to the next steps. Thank you, <br>
            Rick </p>
          <p>Sterling, <br>
            Your conclusions in this post are on the right track. The
            purpose of&nbsp; this project is to demonstrate a motor with
            an energy recovery system. You have succeeded in building
            the system correctly. The only relavant questions are: <br>
            1) Does the second battery charge as the first battery goes
            down? <br>
            2) Does the second battery charge faster than the metered
            current suggests it should? <br>
            3) Does the unmeterable portion of what is charging the
            second battery ALMOST make up for the losses in the system?
            If your test data suggests that the answer to these
            questions is "yes", then you have succeeded with the
            project. That is all this "school girl motor" was ever meant
            to do, and all we ever said it would do. As far as we can
            tell, your very first test data showed all the necessary
            truths. Do you know of any other system that does this well
            or better? If someone out there is reading this, and knows
            of a better system,then please bring it forward. A number of
            people who have been working with this system quietly, are
            beginning to see the performance enhancements that appear in
            the battery. That is where we said it would show up. There
            is NO meterable OU coming out of the machine. I hope this
            helps people stay focussed on what is real and possible with
            this project. <br>

answer:













          </p>
          <p>Yes I have done this experiment, buy doing this you invoke
            the 'lamellar' currents" rule, this is from Kron not me.
            This means that you break up the currents into branches.
            Each 'lamellar' scalar current" is additive to equal the sum
            of the total. The Heaviside current surrounds the wire, this
            is almost like reactive power, the digital meter has a very
            hard time reading this. The system is a "Unity System", what
            you put in you get out, but you are loosing a lot with clip
            leads and bad wiring. If you want to see what is charging
            your batteries you need a scope. The output wire positive is
            run through the center of a solenoid coil of many turns this
            will couple at 90 degrees with the Heaviside current. What
            you will see is a ringing wave that is charging the battery,
            it is not electricity in a true form it is pieces of
            electricity. <br>
            What is this current? It is made up of mostly scalars this
            couples in the batteries when it meets the next scalar that
            it can couple with, this is what charges your batteries. You
            wanted to know so here it is. The next part of the system is
            more mysterious, I will save this for a later time. I did
            show Susan today what this wave looks like.The idea here is
            to charge the secondary batteries as fast as possible from
            one primary battery. The faster the charge, the more power
            you can use. This means speed with the motor/energizer. The
            energizer is a open loop system so it can expand this type
            of wave. You must have this type of wave with a Radiant type
            systems, just look at a Tesla Coil output you will see it,
            in many ringing waves. It takes Quaternion math to see this,
            along with the magnetic fields of the Motor/energizer. <br>

          <p>To all, I just want to keep the story straight so here is
            what I said. <br>
            John </p>
          <p>Koen, Horace, Etc, </p>
          <p>To all in question, this is why I will not supply Stefan
            any charts, waveforms, etc... It is simply not true, as I
            have been posting this information for years on my Internet
            site. All one must do is LOOK. If I read the answers from
            Stefan carefully, it looks like he is unwilling to devote
            his attention to anything I have said to him. I have
            answered his questions with complete honesty at every turn.
            I told Stefan that we use a very special meter to determine
            the charge in the secondary battery. That meter is called a
            BK Precision Battery Capacity Analyzer, Model 600. What is
            so hard to understand about this and what more proof do you
            need that the battery is REALLY CHARGED, knowing the meter
            reads the battery's capacity in amp-hours? The second thing
            here is this. The circuit is right in front of your eyes.
            This circuit does unexpected things. You can only discover
            these things by building one and testing it on your own lab
            bench. No amount of "thinking about it" will penetrate the
            mysteries. Coming to criticize me over Stefan's problem is
            not the answer here, because it goes much deeper then this.
            Stefan has a vast lack of knowledge in this field, and
            apparently, so do you. The ONLY way for you to remedy this,
            is to build the device and study what it does.This is what I
            have done for 35 years! </p>
          <p>I have stated plainly that I want nothing to do with Newman
            or his theory or his test results, and the machine is not
            over unity in any way. How many times must I say this? </p>
          <p>I will say this in plain English again for you both. Go
            through My pages. You will see pictures of the wave-forms.
            You will see every machine I have ever experimented with,
            including the "bucking field" generator. You will see
            everything I talk about. I do not just sit here and draw
            diagrams that do not work. I test everything. I do original
            work, and patent it. When I "duplicate" someone else's
            device, I report it and give credit to the inventor, like my
            "Adams" replication. I don't obscure other people's work,
            like Stefan's goofy "Easy Meg", which has no technical
            similarities to the monumental work of Tom Bearden. </p>
          <p>I did not give Sterling bogus information when he arrived
            here to see if my devices were real. I sat right here and
            let his engineer watch batteries charging, hooked up to the
            scope so he could see the wave-forms. I sat right here and
            showed him how the circuits work. I sat right here and
            explained everything I could within reason. But this company
            has millions of dollars worth of&nbsp; stockholders.
            Sterling and his group signed "Non-Disclosure Agreements"
            before the demonstrations. I gave Sterling permission to
            start his public replication project for the "School Girl
            Motor." The idea that I have some nebulous obligation to
            disclose everything about this technology on the Internet is
            pure fantasy. When I DO give you "step one" on the path to
            this discovery, you refuse to take it. This proves you are
            not even ready to take "step two", much less a complete
            disclosure. The fact is, you wouldn't understand what I am
            doing now, anyway. So why disclose it? </p>
          <p>I have posted the Kron work on my pages, along with the
            wave-form pictures. You obviously don't know what it all
            means. </p>
          <p>These systems do NOT capture "back EMF". Back EMF is not
            capturable. My patents say that my motor captures Back EMF
            because THAT is the only claim the Patent Office would
            accept. In reality, Back EMF is a term in electrical science
            that refers to the effect that reduces the current draw in a
            traction motor as the motor speeds up and generates a
            counter voltage that opposes the applied current. THAT is
            "back EMF." My systems do NOT use this process. </p>
          <p>Koen, you are correct when you say that I am quoting Tesla
            correctly. But it goes much deeper than that. I actually
            understand what Tesla was saying and my systems tap the same
            Radiant Energy that Tesla discovered. Stefan is clueless as
            to how this works, and has never listened to my suggestions
            about how this works. </p>
          <p>There is NO free electricity produced in these systems, or
            any other system that I know of. I have stated this
            repeatedly. The only thing these systems produce are a
            series of "high voltage spikes" that have no current
            associated with them. Voltage without current is the nature
            of Radiant Energy. This is what Tesla said. I call this
            "reactive power" because it does not represent voltage and
            current simultaneously, that could be measured as WATTS.
            This Radiant Reactive power WILL charge batteries, light
            light-bulbs andother things but it DOES NOT meter as REAL
            POWER. This is why your math is useless! So please, quit
            quoting your theories and analyses to me. My light-bulbs are
            on. Are yours? You are welcome to believe in your theory,
            but I KNOW that Tesla was right about the nature of
            electricity, and how to successfully tap its useful
            fractions. If you would just build the motor the way I have
            said, you could begin to learn about this too. </p>
          <p>Beyond this, I am done CHATTING with you. Leave the people
            alone who are trying to learn this. Your ignorant comments
            are of no use. That's as nice as I can be about it. </p>

            Jerry, John, </p>
          <p>Sorry can't seem to append to the thread, however, I
            believe something to consider is the recent work by NASA and
            others in the study of lighting. At a conference in 1999 I
            remember seeing data showing there is a constant return
            current flowing from all over the earth back into the sky
            resulting from lightning strikes hitting the earth. This
            current is very, very, small --- around 10-12 amps per
            square meter and varies slightly depending on temperature
            and wind conditions. The measured potential was 100 volts
            per meter as I remember, however, the high resistance of air
            normally masks us from any felt effects.&nbsp; An example
            was given saying one of the basketball players has about a
            200 volt potential at the top of his head. I would think a
            300' conductive antenna transmission line would make a
            really big difference. Also, a vertical arrangement would
            make more sense than a horizontal one. <br>
            X123 </p>
          <p>To All, <br>
            Lets make this much simpler then it is, and no one will get
            hurt doing the experiment. Just put up your 200 ft of coax
            40 feet high supported between two fiber glass poles, this
            should give 1000 volts potential charge. Next take an SCR
            800 volts, leave the high voltage capacitor where it is
            connected, now face the SCR cathode towards the positive
            pole of the battery and ground the negative side of the
            battery with an 8 ft ground. Connect a neon bulb between the
            anode and the gate, at 90 volts the neon will fire and the
            battery will get a "real radiant charge" (Conversion is
            backwards from electrostatic to radiant should see saw tooth
            wave, much stronger). The faster you fire this bulb the
            better the battery will charge. It's important to leave the
            .00047 uf 5000 volt capacitor between the cable or connected
            to the anode and ground, it's important to use a capacitor
            something like mica or a glass tinfoil capacitor. If looking
            at it with a scope be careful just look between anode and
            cathode. Please be very careful with this experiment. <br>

          <p>Ken, It looks like to me that your really getting into
            Tesla's work, What if, Tesla was dead wrong and all the
            power we are calling Longitudinal is not that at all. What
            if I said to you that Radiant energy when transformed is
            longitudinal and all information can be contained in that
            wave, and that the next transformation process is nothing
            more then reactive power?.... Then what if Emmett, in what
            he told you turns out to be after the transformation process
            total reactive power looking like a square wave, or more
            like a PWM wave at very low frequency and that reactive
            power can charge your storage battery. The next question is
            what if your cookbook math does not fit the transformation
            process that takes place, would you add numbers to make the
            equation balance? What if I told you that the engineers do
            not understand what a magnetic field is when it is used in
            the transformation process between radiant and reactive
            power. I do understand that you must use the math, and I'm
            not asking for any math here in your answers, simple terms
            on how you see all this, so those that are having a hard
            time following us can understand what we are talking about.
            It could be that we are all saying the same thing which just
            boil's down to charge in the end and how we get it. I also
            understand that you do electromagnetic engineering so you
            have seen many different things in your work. One more
            thing, if the process starts at the Radiant level and then
            proceeds to longitudinal and then moves to reactive and then
            to a square wave and from that point moves to the sing wave
            in the end would you agree with this?. That these are the
            transformations we must go through? I have a reason for
            asking these questions when I start to add something
            different to this equation, but I'm going to keep this on a
            simple level as much as I can. Also this is not any kind of
            contest in any way to see who knows what, but I want to get
            down to the basics of a full functioning radiant system that
            anybody can build with junk parts. I have found that most
            people do not understand the basics in electronics and want
            to keep it very simple. As I have stated before I will not
            use the terms Free Energy or Over Unity because I see none
            anywhere, even Tesla was going to use the generators to
            power his reactive power system tuned to certain frequency
            in a high Q pickup like you said in your post, no free
            energy here, just a nice transmission of power free for the
            taking, so Morgan said your not milking my cow for free. By
            the way, this system is already in use. <br>

          <p>To All, Roamer, Brett, Ken, Etc. </p>
          <p>To answer Roamer, that's right, that's all it takes to do
            this, its just the <br>
            basic system. </p>
          <p>Brett, You have had this so many times, but your just
            trying to do this so fast. your answer, It is in the upward
            spike that contains the Radiant energy, would you like a
            test tube, or are you going to fly on one of those airplanes
            for a visit? Expanding this system, Take 100 ft of coax
            cable RG59U and do the same hookup you will be surprised,
            watch the frequency it will be high. It will have uniform
            capacitance and low inductance, just like Tesla said. The
            problem in coil design, is the current through the coil, the
            more the magnetic field the more the heat. That means the
            bigger the coil is the more the waste the lower the
            frequency, so why do we need Iron in the system at all? This
            is the problem that Tesla faced at high frequency with iron,
            Pulsed Radiant Discharge was the answer and no iron. EV Gray
            had the same problem in his motor, his test stand was an
            iron-less coil to blow off the magnets under Pulse Radiant
            Discharge.&nbsp; The answer to the problem was a very sharp
            spike on the leading edge. This does not take rocket science
            to get the job done, and then a few little light bulbs for
            all to read by. </p>
          <p>Ken, If I could just find a power supply to bake people,
            what a great device. only kidding. But these devices have
            been known since the early 60's, but as time will tell its
            just to be used for mass sheep control in some sinister way,
            you'll see, hope you got your graphite shields up. </p>
          <p>Just a comment sent to me from another researcher, talking
            about&nbsp; the motor: "The electrons in the coil just get
            slapped and squeezed by the pulse. The pulse is so strong
            and the resistance high that a choking effect occurs. But
            the voltage is highly elevated in the coil from this effect.
            I think...the radiant energy must happen during coil brake
            down, between pulses. I cant see it on my meters. All I
            know, it is very, very powerful. I just don't understand why
            this is not being used. Surely other folks have built these
            designs. I use mine everyday." <br>

            Date: Fri, 1 Oct 2004 21:03:40 </p>
          <p>Ken, I want to try to answer you but I do not know where to
            start. I guess we must start at the basics of my work 35
            years ago. As a new engineer out of school, I had the
            opportunity to work in the semiconductor field, while
            working in this field I had seen many strange things that
            semiconductors do, so a little background. I think what I'm
            trying to explain to everybody is that I have changed my
            attitude on what is termed "free energy" and "over unity".
            It's not that I do not agree that there is no free energy,
            because there is, windmill, solar panels, water power, it
            just takes money to get there. What I have found out is that
            the energy machines that produce this Radiant Reactive Power
            are strange indeed, let's take an example, the G-Field
            generator. Looking at this machine indicates as if more
            power is being consumed then is coming out of the machine.
            When the waveforms are looked at, the power being produced
            is "Reactive" and of no use as real power goes, but it does
            light lights and it speeds up under load, when built right.
            The next thing is that when the machine is hooked to a
            storage battery it charges the hell out of that battery and
            speeds up even faster so the input power goes way down. This
            is the same thing I have noticed with the Mono-Pole motor, I
            have studied these wave forms until I could not see straight
            and all the time my mind refusing to see the truth about
            what it was I was looking at. I noticed that it charged
            capacitors very good and charged batteries and the power was
            really there except my meters could not measure it. This led
            me into studies of the coil that I was winding for these
            machines. Even if I had the machine working I still was not
            convinced something was charging the batteries I could not
            measure, it was not until about 15 years later I knew that I
            had to do something to find out what it was, just at that
            time Peter Lindemann's book, The Free Energy Secrets of Cold
            Electricity, so I bought three books and called Peter or
            Peter call me I can't remember, but so what. Any way Peter
            and I joined forces to explore what it really was that these
            machine were doing. So after working with Peter and building
            every possible machine, these are My conclusions, There is
            no "Free energy", there is no "Over Unity" in any of these
            machines that can be measured with normal scopes and meters
            and we are just all assuming uncles Joe's theory to be
            right. When I put up the new pages I did not want to debate
            anybody about what I posted. I only wanted to try to explain
            what I found to be the proof&nbsp; of what everybody is
            calling Free Energy/ Over Unity, as it turns out to be
            "Radiant Reactive Power", so term it as you will, di/dt or
            whatever it is all the same in the end. If the machine can
            produce this Radiant spike before the switch turns on and
            the spike is reactive and if it tapped off at the right time
            and sent to the battery in the proper polarity, it will
            charge your battery. I'm not going to by into all these
            theories about unproven experiments unless the experiment is
            done in front of me, as I have posted enough experiments to
            show everyone what it is. </p>
          <p>One step further on this is that, I know some of the people
            did try to build my motor's and did not get the results
            expected, but I can say that enough people have been to my
            shop to see the proof of what I say I have built and have
            watched these motors and solid state devices charging
            batteries. So I'm saying that the power you seek is "Radiant
            Reactive Electricity", and it takes an input to get it in
            some amount, that is all there is in these machines and
            strange devices. The riddle has been solved in my book. <br>

        Michael, If we start here in the paragraph below by Kron, we can
        see why this motor must recharge the battery.
        <p>Kron, Gabriel. "...the missing concept of "open-paths" (the
          dual of "closed-paths") was discovered, in which currents
          could be made to flow in branches that lie between any set of
          two nodes. (Previously &amp; #8212; following Maxwell ---
          engineers tied all of their open-paths to a single
          datum-point, the 'ground'); That discovery of open-paths
          established a second rectangular transformation matrix...
          which created 'lamellar' currents..."... "A network with the
          simultaneous presence of both closed and open paths was the
          answer to the author's years-long search." </p>
        <p>So what is it that Kron is talking about, What is very common
          to this in nature, and what took so long for Kron to find out.
          Here is how I see it, Kron is talking about branch currents.
          Nature has many branch currents but we do not talk about them
          in electrical terms. Example, a river can not flow if the
          little streams (branch currents) are not feeding it. A tree
          can not have a trunk if it had no branches. Nature has given
          us all the examples, but we must make use of the meaning as we
          see it before there can be any invention, and then it must
          follow all physical laws in that universe. For example what is
          the word " lamellar" mean, it means the stacking of plates ,
          wires and so on, in a battery the number of plates give rise
          to many branch currents that make up one high current output
          in the end result. Flowing between the plates are "lamellar"
          currents provided by the chemical reaction, only at the speed
          which nature works best at, this does not mean that the
          battery needs massive currents to charge it, it's quit the
          opposite. What is it that the meters read when we measure
          something, simple wasted energy that has just been dissipated
          out of that system. You can only measure that and nothing
          more, so the only thing that you can measure is the primary
          circuit, because this is the closed loop in this system. Kron
          goes on to say that currents were made to flow in branch
          currents between nodes in the primary circuit, so what is
          wrong with the coil in this motor, what is missing, and how
          could it be changed to act like the river?, you already
          have&nbsp; the second node away from the primary circuit to
          the battery that will collect it. The meter can not measure
          the longitudinal wave from these currents to the second
          battery, for these currents are radiant in nature and can only
          be translated by the chemical reaction in that second battery,
          this process does not boil the battery so there is no water
          loss, for if you loose the water in that battery you will have
          no electricity at all. But you can use your volt meter to see
          the charge on that secondary battery. We never got anything
          but a volt meter after all these years did we. More later on
          this subject. <br>

          <p>I've been looking over Mr. Bedini's patent, WO 01/52390 A1
            <br>
            &nbsp;
            &lt;http://student.ccbc.cc.md.us/~norman/Bedinimotor.pdf </p>
          <p>No where in the patent am I seeing claims of over-unity?
            What I am seeing is the "possibility of over-unity"
            suggested there in (page 5, line 13), but <br>
            NOT actual or real over-unity produced by his device! Now,
            Mr. Bedini does mention (page 12, line 4), "... the motor to
            produce an energy level of COP = 0.98, more or less,
            depending upon configuration, circuitry, switching elements
            and the number and size of stators, rotors and coils that
            comprise the motor." includes ONLY the electrical and
            electronic components, however, does NOT mention or include
            the efficiency, or inefficiency of charging the battery.
            Battery charge inefficiencies would most certainly lower his
            overall COP value! </p>
          <p>I would think that his systems (including motor, rotor, and
            batteries) would have an overall efficiency of around 85%,
            or COP = 0.85. This isn't too bad <br>
            for modern systems, however, this is a long way from being a
            "self-runner", which of course is the ultimate goal. </p>

            <p><b><font size="+1">Advanced Bedini Motor/Energizer</font></b></p>
            <p><i>From:</i> <b>Harlan Sanders</b> <br>
              <i>Date:</i> Fri, 3 Dec 2004 </p>
            <p>Hello All, </p>
            <p>Just wanted to let everyone know my experience with an
              ADVANCED version of the Bedini Schoolgirl motor/energizer.
              John gave me a <br>
              schematic a few weeks ago of a device that he said would
              put the issue of radiant energy battery charging to rest.
            </p>
            <p>Having built several other versions of his devices
              successfully, I was very excited to receive the schematic.
              I built the device EXACTLY as John said <br>
              with ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGES!!!! </p>
            <p>The first spin the device spun up to around 800 rpm's on
              a 22" bicycle wheel; and that's fairly fast. The device
              achieved resonance and the current drain dropped by about
              20%, maintaining the rotation speed, and even got a bit
              faster. </p>
            <p>The input battery was a 12v, 1.2aH battery, and as John
              suggested, I put 4 on the output side. Within a few
              minutes, the batteries began to rise in voltage. There has
              been some big debate for awhile about this "radiant
              charge" producing only a surface charge on the batteries.
              Well my friends, this is NO SURFACE CHARGE. </p>
            <p>The charge was held for 30 minutes at rest, and when I
              tested the batteries with the Computerized Battery
              Analyzer by West Mountain Radio, the batteries produced a
              steady drain for an extended period, after being
              previously dead, with readings as low as 8 volts per gel
              cell. They were NOT charged prior to the test with a
              conventional charger!!! They were completely dead. </p>
            <p>In a conversation with John, we were discussing the issue
              of larger batteries. I told John that I had 2 garden
              tractor batteries that were completely sulfated and would
              NOT take a charge at all with a conventional charger. </p>
            <p>Tested with the CBA, the batteries produced 1 amp for
              less than 1 second. I tried charging the batteries 4
              different times with a regular automotive battery charger,
              first on the 6 amp rate for 6 hours, and then overnight on
              the 2 amp rate. I tried this 4 separate times with no
              luck. The voltage of the batteries would rise to 14 volts
              but the current was not even 1 amp when loaded, and then
              the voltage would drop to 8 or 9 volts under load
              immediately. </p>
            <p>Then John advised that I attach 2 diodes to the output of
              the newest advanced device that I had built. That would
              give me 2 isolated branches to charge with. So, I did
              exactly that. He said to put a steady power supply on the
              input so as to produce steady input for an extended time,
              and simply walk away from the machine and the batteries. </p>
            <p>The following evening, I stopped the Advanced Energizer
              Circuit. I removed the recovery batteries. Now, listen
              closely! The 2 garden batteries that were completely
              useless and would have otherwise been thrown away are now
              producing as much as 7 amps of current for several minutes
              at a time before being discharged to 11.4 volts. </p>
            <p>Now, one secret to the Bedini process is the cycling of
              the batteries in the device. Each cycle, the batteries
              become less and less sulfated. I am compiling tests of
              each battery that I use in the device for increases in
              usefulness. Having proven the smaller devices last year, I
              am now proving the usefulness of the larger and more
              advanced Bedini circuitry. </p>
            <p>It seems that John has been right all along, and nobody
              has been listening or following his directions. I have
              seen engineers argue the Ohms law, and all of that other
              taught discipline in electrical theory. When these people
              forget the conventional way of thinking and just do the
              experiments and quit listening to incompetent people who
              fail, then there will be more advanced devices that will
              provide useful power to, otherwise helpless people. You
              will NOT measure a 1 amp drain in the circuits with a 4
              amp output!!! I REPEAT, the circuits do NOT indicate with
              conventional meters any gain!!! But the batteries become
              fully charged!!! When all of you forget meters to show
              this energy, you will see in the load tests that the
              energy has charged the batteries. It is provided as extra
              watts in the load tests. That's where you will see it.
              Perhaps some of you have been looking at this energy all
              along, but did not know what to look for. Or perhaps, some
              have been just following the words of a few unsuccessful
              people who could not walk and chew bubblegum at the same
              time. If I can do it, ANYONE CAN!!! </p>
            <p>I have PROVEN 100%; and I have the analyzer load tests,
              that these batteries were useless. And now they are
              resurrected to a useful level. And that increases with
              each charge and discharge in the unit. Now, if the battery
              will supply one amp of current for a period of time,
              perhaps into the hours, then these batteries have been
              saved, at least enough to charge more batteries with the
              machine. The way I see it, $50 worth of wire and
              transistors, scrap PVC for a frame, and some Radio Shack
              magnets and a scrap bicycle wheel , has begun recovering
              $50 worth of batteries within 24 hrs. </p>
            <p>I have posted some pics of the new, advanced device on
              www.nuscam.org . I have blocked out some areas of Bedini's
              proprietary circuitry, until such time that he wishes to
              release it, then I will replace with the untouched photos.
              But that is his decision, not mine. The general
              description of the circuits are in his patents. The
              schematic that was provided to Sterling Allen and others
              is a start. Learn the technology, and how it works, then
              perhaps the more advanced circuits will be available in
              the future. </p>
            <p>Best regards, <br>

        <blockquote>
          <div style="text-align: left;">Hi folks: </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">This is a prelim report that
            another Bedini deive has been replicated by two of us, and
            not only works, but after we built it to his specs, and
            gained a <br>
            basic understanding of why/how it may work, could then
            predict changes to the design which improved it's
            functioning. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">It is, in my opinion, imperative
            to follow his construction details closely, for first
            replication.&nbsp; This is necessary, as I believe he has an
            intuitive, <br>
            or objective grasp of some advanced concepts, or properties
            of the interaction of magnetic fields, and oscillating ones,
            and how they interact <br>
            with reality, and or&nbsp; - space-time; the ZPE; or the
            aether depending on what you call it. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">And yes, at times his details are
            difficult to comprehend.&nbsp; But it is not his task to
            give a basic course in electronics, or static/dynamic
            magnetics. <br>
            Also some concepts of correct functioning of certain devices
            may run counter to what we have been led to believe by
            conventional theory - so even if <br>
            something he specifies doesn't make sense - try it first,
            then after it works, figure out why. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">That said, the device / effect we
            have replicated is found here: </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>http://www.amasci.com/freenrg/bedini.txt</b>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I built it exactly as shown, as i
            have these size magnets (RS does not sell these large ones
            anymore, but they are available elsewhere) </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I had a suspicion, from the
            comments about this pencil thin "scalar beam" or effect,
            that this may be the same or similar to what is described on
            my site <br>
            as the "Primary Energy". </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Once built, and the motor turned
            on, there is indeed a "beam" of energy emitted from the
            sides where the magnet faces oppose each other (bucking). <br>
            This beam was exactly the same as the Primary Energy (PE)
            beams that can be made with a container of inert gas, and a
            magnetic field. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In the case of just the running
            device, in open air, emitting a beam, I surmised that this
            field arrangement and modulation was exciting the argon <br>
            atoms in the air (Ar is 1% of air) - so to see if this is
            the case, I placed a&nbsp; tube of another inert gas, at
            this location (the place where the "beam" <br>
            comes out of the magnet interface) - and a VERY powerful PE
            beam was created --- much more powerful than if the tube is
            simply placed against the magnets, without the modulation. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">And in addition, with the
            addition of a 25 ohm, wire wound rheostat in the circuit, to
            vary the motor's speed, (and hence the FREQ of the pulse
            signal, <br>
            thru the coil), the PE beam strength, varies as the FREQ is
            varied, and there are several resonant "nodes" where a small
            FREQ range, makes a much large beam effect, as this FREQ
            range is passed, while changing the speed.&nbsp; There are
            several of these resonant points. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">This has been replicated many
            times, by myself, now, and by another, using a different
            magnet size/shape, with similar results. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Both of us independently have
            found that our current crude, "measurement" of an anomalous
            quality which seems to be related to this energy (and not <br>
            thermal, or EM sources) is affected in the same way, by
            these "scalar" beams, augmented with a xenon flashtube. (not
            flashed) (this objective measurement, is separate from the
            subtle sensing of "feeling" of the PE, and will be detailed
            later, as we get a better handle on it) </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I am working on a write up for a
            post to my web site - in next few days, with all the
            details. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The magnetic field analysis,
            using QuickField, shows that this arrangement of permanent
            magnets, with the modulator coil is making the same field
            shape, and relative flux density gradients, as that of the
            "Magnetic Beam Amplifier" shown on my site, and detailed in
            US patent # 5,929,732. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In this case, it is a "dual
            beamer" as opposed to the "quad beamer" shown on the patent,
            and the "hex beamer" shown on my site.&nbsp; The two bucking
            or <br>
            opposing magnets, are like the radial "focusing" plane,
            described in the patent, and the modulating coil forms the
            field of the axial magnet - and <br>
            this axial field is pulsed, or alternated (if any back EMF's
            from the motor, cause complex AC harmonics in the
            modulation). </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In the "beamer" field
            configuration - there is found a "null" zone where the
            bucking fields intersect, or "collide" as Bedini describes
            it.&nbsp; And with the <br>
            modulation, this null zone then is caused to move front and
            back, along the same axis as the coil. And the overall
            beamer field shape is also caused to <br>
            move back and forth, and if AC is present, will flip or
            mirror on each oscillation.&nbsp; (our theory is this a
            severe "aether stretch", and forms a <br>
            resonant cavity for the PE) </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Now with reference to the "Hyper
            Light Speed Antenna" patent: <br>
            http://www.escribe.com/science/keelynet/m8147.html </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">There is also similar reports of
            bio effects, which are reported from this device's "beam" or
            field, and by the PE. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">And notice that this device also
            used a set of bucking magnetic fields, with a modulation
            injected.&nbsp; And this patent's author describes the
            interface <br>
            between the bucking magnetic fields as like a "window" to a
            higher dimension. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">One more note on the bedini
            "scalar field, or beam" device: --- I noticed in the field
            analysis that the field strengths of the coil, and magnets
            were <br>
            greatly mismatched - and surmised that if this "beamer field
            shape" was responsible for the effect, in some measure, that
            increasing the current to <br>
            the coil should then make it perform better. (better
            matching of magnetic field strengths) </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">So I did a test with applying a
            mechanical load to the motor shaft (and measured the
            current) - the current could be increased 5 fold this way,
            and <br>
            the resulting beam was greatly increased in intensity, and
            followed the current level in a proportional manner. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Also, I noticed that while
            applying this load to the motor, by hand, that a PE
            emanation was present at the motor housing, and shaft!&nbsp;
            So I believe there <br>
            is some kind of subtle "current" at work here, and some
            feedback, and resonance within the electrical conductors may
            occur, (the PE can be <br>
            "carried" on a good conductor, as shown in other
            experiments).&nbsp; So this crude modulation method, may in
            fact be a critical factor to achieving this! </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">An armature type permanent magnet
            motor, has pemanent magnets as the stators, and a rotating
            armature, of coils - that are sequntially energized by the
            action of the brushes on the armature.&nbsp; This creates a
            sparking effect at the brush/armature connection (and in
            this case, a spark, was observed, <br>
            indicating a plasma present) - and air is also
            present.&nbsp; So (possibly) another PE emanation is being
            created in the motor as well as it functioning <br>
            as the pulse generator! </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">And this may be indicative as to
            why some older methods to make certain effects work, while
            newer, "modern" methods do not.&nbsp; (when you use the
            sparks gaps, and electro - magnetic - mechanical systems -
            the effect is not necessarily the same as a "solid state"
            method! </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I believe Bearden commented on
            this - that many times a jury rigged device has stumbled
            upon a method, material, impurity, or configuration, which
            is <br>
            the key to an effect, but more modern, clean, or pure
            methods may not have the right elements to accomplish this.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A note of caution - any who are
            following the PE, and experimenting with it --- this beam
            method is VERY powerful, and may pose some dangers to body
            exposure.&nbsp; This is evidenced by my feeling the strong
            tingling, in the sense hand, turning into a strong numbness
            in the hand and arm, which then lasted for over an hour
            after each exposure!&nbsp; This numbness felt like the
            effect of using a "hammer drill" to drill many successive
            holes in concrete - the <br>
            strong mechanical vibrations making the arms/hands feel numb
            for a time after this work. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">As stated, I am working on the
            drawings, a field analyses, and writing up this info, and
            will inform when this is done. </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;">Hola Folks! </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Not exactly sure what happened,
            but Emmett sent the following which did not make it to the
            list or archive, so I'm reposting. <br>
            I think the problem was the photos he mentions since this
            list doesn't accept attachments as per the guidelines page
            at; </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">http://www.keelynet.com/discuss.htm












          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">So Emmett, if you'll send me the
            photos, I'll put them up on a webpage with your comments and
            a link to your email for private correspondence; </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Good Afternoon All, </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">TO START: I believe O.U. does
            indeed exist. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">There are some different ways to
            do this, some simple, and a little energy - some abit, how
            shall I say more complex, but unbelievable amounts of
            energy, I know, been there and have done it. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">HERE IS A SIMPLE WAY TO ACHIEVE
            THIS!!! </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">BUT FIRST; As I always give
            credit where credit is due, First and formost to John Bedini
            for his motor/energizers, Tom Bearden for the math and help
            in seeing what isn't always obvious, on his website, to my
            friend, Stan Mayer, for thoughts, encouragement and how to
            do things with what few electronic parts are available in my
            area, i.e. radio shack, and to all the greats before me,
            Maxwell, Faraday, Stubblefield and especially Tesla </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">NOW ON TO BUSINESS: I will
            provide a brief description and as&nbsp; you all can see
            there are photos, and if any are in my area or want to come
            to my shop, I will be glad to let you see, tinkker and
            phootograph to your hearts desire, on this project anyway. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">1). We will start with Johns
            school girl energizer(simplified) first. There are many of
            you out there that I know of that have achieved minor <br>
            o.u. in the .01-.1-.2 volt range for periods of time, there
            are those of you who have achieved a 1-1 unity, i.e.,
            trading the same voltage back and forth between batteries
            over time and the voltage does not go up or down altho in
            practical situations(not this) it would normally go down
            over time due to resistance in the wires, resistance in the
            bearings, air resistance of the rotor rotating, and general
            quality of workmanship, </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">there are those of you who are
            close to 1-1 unity but are only losing .1-.3 volts over a 24
            hr. period, that is good too, but not good enough but not to
            worry. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I have included in the pictures,
            photo1, of my sg energizer, "the black widow" so you can see
            all the wires and circuitry etc. nothing hidden, nothing
            magical. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Photo #2). rear view with a small
            coil with a screw thru the center attached to a copper/PVC
            pipe stand, the leads are attached to a home-made 4-diode,
            simple full wave bridge rectifier, (4)in4003 diodes, or a
            stand alone manufactured one will work also with a cap.
            connected across to smooth out the spikes. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I originally used a reed switch
            but they have a tendancy to burn shut and last only so long,
            so I asked my buddy, Stan Mayer, what I could substitute,
            thanks Stan. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Yes I know the pictures are dark,
            using an old polaroid instamatic, flash burnt out, but
            wanted pictures, NOW, you will notice that the leads from
            the fullwbrid.rec. are connected to a DVM and it reads 6.13
            volts. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Now this little coil is made from
            a screw about an inch long and 3/16" in dia. wrapped with
            radio shack 28g wire about 200' worth. This is far in excess
            of those who are losing .1-.13 volts every 24 hrs or so O.U.
            IN MY BOOK...BUT IT GETS BETTER. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Photo # 3). is just a side view.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Photo #4). now some of you have
            found that you don't need your wheel to rotate at all, that
            by just stacking your magnets on top and a few adjustments
            it becomes a resonate circuit and some of you are finding
            that it is still charging your batteries, both input and
            output at the same time, this is more than possible. Stan
            explained how the electronics do indeed do this thru a
            little window in time(pun intended). </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Picture #4 is mine doing just
            that BUT IT GETS EVEN BETTER!!! </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">NOT ONLY DO YOU NOT NEED A ROTOR
            ROTATING, YOU DON'T NEED MAGNETS TO MAKE IT RESONATE, JUST
            ANOTHER COIL, </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">photo #5, show my coil sitting on
            top, it is smaller than the main coil, so needed to get it
            closer, altho sidfe by side it will still provide a voltage,
            just not as big, now!! </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">1, if you make your coils larger,
            the same size and attach the circuit I described above, you
            not only achieve O.U. in charging the two batteries, but you
            can run extra voltage even above, the DVM reads 2.579 volts
            in case u can't see it. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">SO NOW YOU NOT ONLY HAVE O.U., IN
            ONE SYSTEM BUT A SECOND SYSTEM AND THERE IS NO MOVEMENT,
            POSSIBLY A SIMPLIFIED MEG WITH SIMPLIFIED STUFF, BUT I CAN'T
            NOT SAY FOR SURE, EITHER WAY IT IS A NON-MOVING GENERATOR
            THAT YOU ALL CAN BUILD EASILY IN A COUPLE OF HOURS!!! </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I ask only one or two things,
            PLEASE, tell and send this to all your family, friends,
            other energy sights, Rense .com , papers, radio, tv, or
            whatever as the momentum needs to raise sharply, like the
            spike on a scope of radiant energy as some have seen, or
            this will die a very quick death and my other peripheral
            devices along these lines are not worth&nbsp; putting out
            and I shall go into quiet retirement. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">ALSO.. any who want to&nbsp; come
            to my office and shop to see, tinker, experiment, and
            photograph etc. are more than welcome, I have NOTHING TO
            HIDE. my address is </p>

            <p><b><font size="+1">Measuring Output of Bedini Motors</font></b></p>
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">When scanning this site I noticed
            some postings concerning Bedini motors but had no idea what
            they were like. When I finally found what they were I wasn't
            surprised by the basic idea, but I was by the claim that
            these things put out more power than is put in and by the
            controversy. It turns out that there may be a fairly easy
            way to determine the output power. This has to do with the
            energy storing properties of capacitors.&nbsp; The Bedini
            motor has an output capacitor that is charged and then
            discharged into a battery pack. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">For a capacitor of value C farads
            the energy E stored in it as a function of its voltage V is
            E = 1/2xCxV^2.&nbsp; For instance, a capacitor of 1000
            Microfarads with a voltage of 100 volts contains 5 joules of
            energy.&nbsp; The voltage across a capacitor then gives an
            unambiguous measure of its energy. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A Bedini motor when tuned turns
            at a constant rpm.&nbsp; This means that the pulses
            generated will be uniformly spaced in time.&nbsp; An
            oscilloscope can be used to monitor the voltage across the
            output capacitor.&nbsp; The drop in voltage when the
            capacitor is discharged then gives energy outputted: E =
            1/2xCx(Vmax^2-Vmin^2).&nbsp; Multiplying this by the number
            of pulses per second (determined from the oscilloscope
            sweep) gives the total output in joules/second (watts). This
            method can be used for any capacitor pulse charging system.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Input power can be measured by
            putting a small resistor in series with the battery and
            measuring its waveform using the oscilloscope. </p>
          <div style="text-align: left;">
            <hr style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;"
              width="62%"></div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">You're overlooking two other
            system components, the source and receiving batteries. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">There is a specific relationship
            between the source battery and the motor, and also between
            the motor and the receiving battery. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The only real way to determine
            what's going on is to measure the REAL POWER that you can
            draw from the receiving battery VS the charge state of the
            primary. Then continue charging and repeat, over and over.
            This is just like what was done by the TUV testing labs on
            Bedini's prototype. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">That's the only set of
            measurements that really count, in the end. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Measuring the other items you've
            mentioned will mostly serve to confuse due to certain
            anomolous behavior in the source/motor/receiver process. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">But, as always, feel free to slap
            on the meters. </p>
          <div style="text-align: left;">
            <hr style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;"
              width="62%"></div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The power going into the
            receiving battery has to go through the output capacitor.
            Determine that power and you've put a limit on the power
            into the receiving battery. There is no other route for
            energy to get into the receiving battery.&nbsp; Otherwise
            get rid of the capacitor and the wires to the battery.&nbsp;
            Let the energy flow through the ether or hyperspace or
            whatever. The device exists in our space and can be tested
            in our space. <br>

          <p style="text-align: left;">Most electrically "educated"
            people have a very rigid set of preconceived notions when it
            comes to understanding various circuit behaviors. I can
            charge any kind of battery that I want, with a simple
            capacitor discharge system, mechanical or electronic. Still,
            I have met with much resistance from many "learned" people
            along the way, most of them INSISTING that IT WON'T WORK, in
            one way or another. It really doesn't matter since I'm just
            sharing my observations from my hobby experiments. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;As for measuring the motor,
            I'm only telling you what I see happening, like it or not. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The relationship between the
            motor, the capacitor and the batteries is not as simple as
            you might, at first, assume. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Casting aspersions about dabbling
            with "hyperspace" won't answer your measurement questions. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Slapping meters and resistors all
            over the thing might offer some insight into HOW it works
            and whether or not it's tuned properly. But, the BEST and
            MOST EFFECTIVE way to measure the input vs. output is to run
            the motor and do your final empirical testing by measuring
            real wattage available from the receiving battery vs charge
            dissipation in the primary battery. That's all I'm saying. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;By all means, measure
            everything. After all, there's no reason not to. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;While you're at it, make
            sure you also do some mechanical loading tests in parallel
            with the power in/out tests. Even more interesting stuff
            crops up. </p>
          <div style="text-align: left;">
            <hr style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;"
              width="62%"></div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">How much power ends up in the
            battery? </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Just hook up a simple load
            (perhaps a 20 watt lamp), a precision resistor, measure the
            voltage drop, and time the whole thing until the battery is
            discharged. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Replace the battery on the motor,
            recharge, and repeat. </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;">It's mighty fun to play with - at
            any rate at the very least I now have a pretty efficient DC
            motor on my desk.... </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;">That link is interesting. The
            concept of an EM absorption field in relation to the Bedini

            this link... </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;">Hi Charged, </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Kinda what I was thinking. I made
            that comment the other day about holding a small neo magnet
            near the motor when it's running. It almost vibrates right
            out of your hand - up to a foot away. That's one
            illustration that there's a field built around it when it's
            running. It will be interesting to carry on with testing...
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Ted. </p>

              width="62%"></div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I took a look at the site.&nbsp;
            No violation of conservation of energy or charge or mass
            there. Also the author uses normal devices and their
            characteristics. Measurements are implied. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In my original posting I said
            nothing about the magneto-mechanical aspects. The "motor"
            may act as a "tuned" "circuit" for all I know. My concern
            was with the capacitor and the power output. Since form
            follows function, the role of the capacitor appears to be
            temporary storage of energy. There is no indication that it
            is involved in the energy conversion process. That is done
            by the magnetic components.&nbsp; Hence the method I
            outlined should allow relatively straightforward
            determination of the output power. I noticed that at least
            one person building these things has an oscilloscope. It
            would be interesting to see what he finds. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Beyond this, if these Bedini
            Devices really are capturing energy, it behooves us to find
            out what the source is. If millions of these are built, it
            wouldn't be nice to find out that the earth's magnetic field
            is collapsing or its spin rate is slowing down or its orbit
            is decaying.&nbsp; There are a lot of potential sources of
            energy out there. We don't want to mess up any critical
            balances. If it comes from the solar wind or the expansion
            of the universe then maybe "Who cares". If it comes from the
            60 cycle power distribution system then Tesla's dream of
            broadcast power is realized and we get a whole new set of
            rules, but also possibilities. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Just because something is
            anomalous doesn't mean it can't be studied or measured. The
            people who discovered that they could cause a spark in a
            coil at a distance certainly had an anomalous
            situation.&nbsp; Look where it led. I reject the notion that
            something mysterious is happening between the output
            capacitor and the batteries. <br>

              width="62%"></div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">It's interesting stuff.... </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">and lots of it's a bit over my
            head. <br>
            But to me, it seems very simple. If any of these systems
            (Bedini Motors etc) are actually "capturing" some mysterious
            outside form of energy... then why is it that we have yet to
            see a motor that "runs" by itself? I realize there are LOTS
            of folks who make the claim that this has been done.... I
            remain highly skeptical till I see it with my own eyes
            though. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">On a different note... <br>
            Often when I see claims of overunity type motors and that
            "sort of thing" I jump to the pre-judgment that whoever is
            making the claims is either a con artist, or... doesn't know
            what they're talking about. I looked a bit into Bedini's
            webpages and career... and being a "vintage hi-fi"
            enthusiast, I was quite impressed by the really nice audio
            amplifiers he designed and manufactured. It appears they are
            possibly still manufacturing hi-end "vintage style" tube
            amplifiers! </p>
          <div style="text-align: left;">

              width="62%"></div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">According to Bearden, the
            electrical energy that's powering everything around you is
            ALREADY a 1:1 release of "vacuum energy" (zpe, radiant,
            etc...). </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In other words, we're burning up
            fossil fuels to FORCE the capture of this energy in heating
            elements, lamps, batteries, etc... <br>
            This is what he means about allowing the captured energy
            (working power) to also destroy the dipole (generator charge
            separation). This then requires more physical input to drive
            the generator to produce more charge separation to keep the
            ZPE release going to power your load. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">So if drawing ZPE is going to
            slow down the planet or something, it's already happening
            every time you make french toast. I'm more interested in
            finding ways not to have to choke on noxious fumes from
            expensive fuels. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Anyway, the Earth's magnetic
            field is almost zero at this point in time, so what would it
            matter? ;) </p>
          <div style="text-align: left;">
            <hr style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;"
              width="62%"></div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Bearden's idea sounds a little
            like the negative energy accelerating the expansion of the
            universe that astronomers have come up with. I prefer to
            stick with Beaty's ideas which show no contradiction with
            established knowledge. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">It struck me that the Bedini
            Device has a basic similarity with an atom. The electrons in
            an atom are moving in circles around the atom. The magnetic
            poles are also moving in circles. In both cases time varying
            electromagnetic fields will exist around the
            structures.&nbsp; These fields could interact with existing
            electromagnetic waves in the surrounding medium out to
            sizable distances. So the Bedini device could conceivably
            act as a collector of energy. But it's not then doing
            anything really mysterious. This leads to the further
            consideration: The most likely source of collected energy
            would be the 60 cycle energy that pervades our environment.
            This leads to some ideas for experimentation. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">At 60 hz a wavelength is 3100
            miles. For a Bedini device to be scaled at the same size as
            an atom it would have to have a wheel diameter of about 3000
            feet. Okay, not too practical. One could instead build a
            power system running at 60,000 hz with a three foot wheel.
            This could be done on a small scale. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Another question involves
            interactions between Bedini devices.&nbsp; If each unit has
            a magnetic footprint out to large distances will two close
            units interact, and how. How close is close? </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Also, a Bedini device may have a
            best frequency (greatest output power). At what frequency
            does this occur? Adjust the rpms while monitoring the power
            output by the method that I suggested. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Finally, by this analysis it
            should be possible to have the device function without a
            battery on the input by looping the output back in some
            manner. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">If Bedini wants to sell a large
            number of these devices all he has to do is start a rumor
            that they rob power from the power companies. They'd sell
            like hotcakes. <br>
            GeoM </p>

              width="62%"></div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Things are only mysterious until
            they are properly investigated. I suppose that curiousity is
            why I built one of these things. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">From what I've seen so far there
            are two things going on here - one is the EMF energy
            collection thing, and the other is the charging of the
            second battery. There may be something there in pulse
            charging vs. regular 'brute force' as Tom W called it.
            There's posts in lots of locations on the board about that
            subject. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">About the frequency of operation
            - you're right it does bear investigation. The main current
            consumer is the driving circuit. If a load is attached to
            the spinning wheel, the current consumption actually goes
            down substantially. My unit spins at about 2,900 rpm
            unloaded, and uses about 280 MA off the powering battery. I
            have tried a 5" diameter x 2" high squirrel cage blower
            wheel mounted directly to the Bedini rotor. That fan slows
            the motor down to about 1,000 RPM and the current draw for
            the driving circuit drops to around 90 MA. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I have the secondary stage of
            this unit set up with a 555 timer and rheostat pulsing
            circuit so the cap can be pulsed into the battery at lower
            voltage and faster pulses, or higher voltage (per pulse) and
            lower frequencies. There is a sort of sweet spot where you
            can adjust the pulse frequency and actually watch the
            voltage measured across the battery under charge rise. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">So far I can tell you that the
            voltage measured across the battery under charge rises to
            about 15 volts after the motor has been running for 10
            minutes or so. It doesn't seem to make much difference
            whether the fan is attached to the motor or not. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">More investigation and trials are
            needed. I'd really encourage anybody who's the least bit
            interested to build one of these things and start observing
            and testing. It only took me about 4 hours to build mine,

          <p style="text-align: left;">"The School Girl Radiant Energy
            Circuit and Motor is the most basic rendition of a patented
            circuit developed by John Bedini and researched by Dr. Peter
            A. Lindemann, based on the technology of Nikola Tesla, with
            follow-up work by Edwin Gray, Moray, and others. Bedini has
            done away with the need for a discharge gap. This "School
            Girl (Simplified)" design is the most basic presentation of
            the Bedini system. The circuit is run by an input battery,
            and charges an ouput battery, while turning a wheel, lined
            with magnets, that service to create a flux in the coils.
            There are some unusual characteristics observed in the
            process. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"<i>Operation ~</i> The motor has
            to be started by an external push, after which it turns on
            its own from the firing of the coil electromagnet. It
            gradually increases in speeds until it reaches an optimum at
            around 300 rpm. Applying load to the wheel results in lower
            amperage going from the input battery because it is
            dependant on the rate of firing only. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"<i>Features ~</i> Simple design.
            Inexpensive. Charger device whose oetput is friedly to
            batteries. Doesn't heat them, but actually refurbishes them.
            Charging takes less energy input by far than what is
            normally required, implicating Radiant (or whatever name is
            most suitable) energy infusion in the process. " </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Assembly Notes ~</b> </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The Frame Stand needs to be
            non-magnetic, and mechanically stable front-to-back and
            left-to-right. The gap between the coil spool and wheel with
            magnets affixed (super-glue and tape) should be 1/8 inch.
            The gap should be variable for experimental purposes. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Determine the "North" end of the
            magnets with a compass, and label it. The "north" end of a
            compass needle will be attracted to the "south" pole of the
            magnet. All the magnets are mounted with the North pole
            facing out, toward the coil. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Equal-distance spacing of the
            magnets on the wheel's perimeter is not critical with one
            coil. There is a limiting minimum distance, but not a
            maximum. Spacing need not be uniform.&nbsp; If you plan to
            add more coils --- with a separate circuit for each coil ---
            spacing must be symmetrical for proper firing. Do not space
            the magnets closer apart than 1.5 to 2 widths. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Coils are loosley wound with
            approximately 450 turns. The two wires on the coil are wound
            together. The number of turns is not critical, but an
            accurate count is necessary for proper scientific recording.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Miscellaneous Tips &amp;
              Precautions ~</b> </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Spacing of the magnets on the
            wheel's perimeter is not critical with one coil. There is a
            imiting minimum distance, but not a maximum. Spacing need
            not be uniform. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Do not draw power from the
            battery while it is being charged. Charge one bank of
            batteries, and discharge another bank, switching between
            them. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">This design can shock, though not
            dangerously. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">If the neon bulb is not in place,
            The transistor will burn out if the neon bulb is not
            installed, and if the device is run without a receiver-load
            (battery) for the radiant energy. The neon bulb serves as a
            "shock absorber" for excess output energy. </p>
