      <br>
      Dr. Gregory Chausovsky is a senior researcher of Psychological
      Science at the Zaporizhzhya National University in Ukraine. While
      famous in the Russian-speaking world, he only gained momentary
      attention in the West a few years ago thanks to his invention of a
      musical condom. The true depth of his inventiveness was sadly
      overlooked by English speakers.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="gregory_chausovsky.jpg"
          height="157" width="129"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Dr. Chausovsky's primary interests (as listed in his bios, here
      and here) are in: "biofeedback, self-bioadaptive psycho-emotional
      states, hardware diagnostics and correction of the mental and
      emotional status of an individual, and electronic neutralization
      of stress." Dr. Chausovsky describes his work as "technotronic
      psychotechnologies").<br>
      <br>
      His field of study can be classified as positive mind control: the
      use of mind control techniques (psychotronics, cerebrosonics,
      psyoptics, etc.) to alter one's own mind for beneficial effects
      (for example, see my own DePsych utility included with MindGuard).
      Paranoids should, of course, be wary of devices designed by others
      to control one's mind, but Dr. Chausovsky work is reproducible by
      the average paranoid maker, allowing them to be sure their
      homemade devices are safe. He even states in an interview:<br>
      <br>
      "I do not have any trade secrets. Moreover, I openly publish
      articles on the website with photos and a detailed description.
      And there is no problem for anyone wanting to repeat my invention.
      The copyright is, of course, a profitable thing, but when it comes
      to health, you can not keep saving invention under the pillow."<br>
      <br>
      His 2010 psychotechnic device pictured above (the
      "kaleidoscopic-trance for self-correction of mental and emotional
      state")&nbsp; synchronizes colorful LED kaleidoscope patterns to
      the wearer's exhalation, as measured through a nose-adapted
      microphone, which also provides aromatherapy with impregnation of
      essential oils in its porous support surface. Furthermore, there
      is a monaural earbud on the right side that provides
      autosuggestion via whispered psychocorrective affirmations.<br>
      <br>
      While obviously an experimental device given the use of
      polystyrene cups, he later refined the form factor, adding
      measurement of the user's torso contractions for enhanced
      biorhythmic feedback and claiming various health benefits,
      including "self-correction of individual vegetative status":<br>

      Technotronic psycho self-induction of the trance state for
      self-health applications<br>
      <br>
      Psy is a novelty developed for the combined use of self-induction
      of the trance state of instrumental techniques which provide
      synchronized breathing rhythms, playing monotonous sounds of
      different tone, torso twists and changes in dynamic scenes
      rendered symmetrical colored patterns with monaural sound system
      affirmations psychocorrective semantic orientation.<br>
      <br>
      Constructive design developed psycho (see. Photo) realized in the
      form of spectacles, which recorded two mirror prism with glass
      balls on the ends. Spectacle-frame mounted miniature electronic
      audio amplifier, included in the input electric circuit is a
      miniature electret microphone is inserted into the user's nostril,
      and included in the output electrical circuit of the amplifier
      microtelephones inserted into the ear canal of the right ear of
      the user. The development kit also includes a belt, which is fixed
      an electric generator melodic sounds of different frequencies, the
      consistent inclusion of which is carried out in a contactless
      manner (by synchronized with the rotation of the body by the
      movement of his hands with a magnetic ring along the outer surface
      of the belt). On the back side of the belt fastened magnetically
      reed, consistent electrical contact closure which is under the
      influence of an external magnetic field of the ring, move users in
      sync with the rotation of the torso. This provides a sound tones
      change from low to high and vice versa depending on the direction
      of rotation of the torso. At the same time, when the user turns
      the body renders the synchronous changing scenes of colorful
      symmetric patterns generated by fixed on eyeglass frame mirror
      prisms and glass balls. Monotonous, synchronized with the turn of
      a trunk, forming colorful symmetric patterns and musical sounds
      helps induce trance states....<br>
      <br>
      As noted above, attached to the eyeglass frame miniature
      electronic audio amplifier provides the scoring breathing rhythm
      user that introduces an additional component of the acoustic sound
      of monotony in the process of forming the state of trance. At the
      same time due to bone conduction acoustic user is able by
      whispering to implement various affirmations monaural effect
      autosuggestion (as, in particular, the information is presented
      right ear, lateralized in the left hemisphere). Experimentally
      validated (L. Tommasi, 2009), that task obtained through the right
      ear, solved more quickly than their sound system through the left
      ear. The effect of the right ear provides the activation of
      attention to hear the information, development and improvement of
      its memory (S. Scott, 2009).<br>
      <br>
      Thus, "the effect of the right ear of" neuropsychological creates
      preconditions for efficiency monaural autosuggestion techniques
      with a view to the successful utilization of induced trance states
      for government health applications.<br>
      <br>
      Characteristically, the technical solution proposed psycho allows
      a single device commonly available methods to realize the combined
      use of these psycho:<br>
      <br>
      - monitoring of the principle of rhythmic breathing
      biofeedback;monaural autosuggestion by means of electronic sound
      affirmations;<br>
      - dynamic meditation (formation colorful symmetric multi-colored
      patterns in sync with the user's torso bends);<br>
      - polytouch trance induction (by the monotone, synchronized with
      the breath user exposure to sound, light and tactile stimuli);<br>
      - forming an acoustic ("musical") anchor an emotional feeling
      emotional balance.<br>
      <br>
      Monaural autosuggestion allows utilization induced trance state in
      order to implement a very important for the health authorities
      following psycho:<br>
      <br>
      - authorities stress;<br>
      - efficiency psychoimmunology methods in the treatment of cancer;<br>
      - elimination of bad habits;<br>
      - reduce the level of anxiety;<br>
      - self-correction of feeding behavior;<br>
      - neutralizing pain psychophysiological methods of alienation,
      distraction, regression;<br>
      - self-correction of individual vegetative status;<br>
      - mobilize the body's defenses in the implementation of
      comprehensive treatment programs to address the psychosomatic
      disorders.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the proposed technical solution enables psycho in a single,
      publicly available on cost and operational capabilities, a
      portable device to implement a set of efficient psycho, enabling
      targeted <i>samovliyaniya</i> on the formation factors of mental
      and physical health.<br>

      <br>
      According to WHO, about 70% of the diseases associated with
      emotional stress, which inevitably leads to a decrease in
      efficiency, poor quality of life, physical and mental state of the
      person. Stress can serve as a basis for the development of
      pathogenic neurological, cardiovascular, endocrine and other
      diseases (K. Sudakov, 1976).<br>
      <br>
      The main methods of forming stress is moderate exercise, breathing
      exercises, contrasting temperature effects, methods of suggestion
      and auto-training (Stegantsev A., 2009).<br>
      <br>
      The novelty of this method of formation of stress is complex
      implementation within individual means of Mental Health, made in
      the form of points, polysensor biodaptivno-respiratory psycho
      anti-stress. Created by the proposed method of individual
      psycho-hygienic means - glasses can be used for preventive
      formation stress and to neutralize post-traumatic stress symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      Structural design of this method is in the form of dark points on
      the inner surface of which are fixed the green LEDs. These local
      sources of light include tactile sensor rhythmic diaphragmatic
      breathing. To monitor rhythmic diaphragmatic breathing tactile
      sensor is fixed to the wrist strap (when breathing tactile sensor
      using your hands in contact with the front wall of the abdomen).
      At the same strap secured another similar tactile sensor
      comprising a synchronous rhythm of breathing "elektrovkusovoy"
      stimulant. This promoter is in the form of two contacting with the
      tongue taste receptors microelectrodes mounted on rods of plastic
      food. On the stroke "inspiration" on microelectrodes applied weak
      electrical potential, initiating the formation of specific
      "elektrovkusa."<br>
      <br>
      On the earpiece attached electronic amplifier acoustic signals
      miniature microphone is equipped with anti-stress aromanositelem
      orientation, inserted into the nostril user, microtelephones
      amplifier is fixed to ear. This allows real-time monitor the
      rhythm of the breath of his acoustic effects and at the same time
      to implement elements of aromatherapy.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of contact tactile sensor wrist strap to the front
      wall of the abdomen that protrudes during inspiration and retracts
      on exhalation, it is possible to monitor the principle of
      biofeedback rhythmic diaphragmatic breathing in the form of
      polytouch (gustatory, olfactory, tactile, auditory and visual)
      sensations. Touching wrist strap with tactile sensors to the back
      of the head or limbs allows a similar polytouch monitoring
      synchronized with breathing various physical exercises associated
      with the tilt of the head, bending the limbs, etc....<br>
      <br>
      For example, the principle of monitoring polytouch biofeedback
      performing synchronized breathing tilted his head improves the
      efficiency of the implementation exercise for the "stretching" of
      the cervical spine with a view to Antistress activation of
      parasympathetic system.<br>
      <br>
      The functionality of the method developed as part of the permit in
      the form of individual points psychohygienic means comprehensively
      implement the following psycho formation stresses:<br>
      <br>
      - meditation on breathing with the help of "physiological mirror"
      that reflects the rhythm of breathing in the form of five-sensory
      (taste, olfactory, visual, tactile, auditory);<br>
      - neutralization anxiety, agitation, outbursts of negative
      emotions using diaphragmatic - relaxation breathing bioadaptive
      formed using polytouch self;<br>
      - arbitrary control psycho-emotional state of regulated breathing
      techniques, initiating (short-breath and slowly exhale followed by
      a pause) parasympathetic stimulation that promotes the
      transformation of emotional stress in the state of mental
      equilibrium;<br>
      - the formation of the dominant competitor and distancing from the
      stressful situation (A. Zhdanov, 2008) techniques polysensor
      concentrating on the rhythm of breathing;<br>
      - polytouch stimulation driven rhythm physiological diaphragmatic
      breathing, for the formation of anti-stress effects the receive
      direction the touch of monotony;<br>
      - coordination of their own rhythms of the brain with the rhythm
      polytouch external stimuli (assimilation brain slow rhythms,
      multiple respiratory rate) in order to move the brain into a state
      of low-level activity (Sandomirskiy M., 2001);...<br>
      - normalization of psycho-emotional state polytouch techniques for
      monitoring the implementation of special physical exercises
      associated with rhythmic tension of the neck muscles to "breathe"
      (head tilted back, overcoming the resistance of hands with tactile
      sensors on the back of the head) and the subsequent relaxation of
      muscles to "exhale" (head tilted forward);<br>
      - the formation of anti-stress effects, methods of synesthesia
      (overlapping time-synchronized with the breath of taste,
      olfactory, tactile, auditory and visual sensations);<br>
      - decrease in neuroticism, psychoticism, personal anxiety,
      depression forming psychological and emotional stability
      (Golosheykin S. 2002) polysensor meditation techniques;<br>
      - prevention of maladaptive disorders by targeted respiratory
      bioadaptive color stimulation;<br>
      - forming reaction calm, relaxation and techniques to optimize
      vegetative regulation of respiratory bioadaptive light and sound
      stimulation;<br>
      - deliberate self-correction techniques of individual vegetative
      Profile respiratory elektrovkusovogo formation, on the basis of
      biofeedback regulated breathing exercises (Chausovsky G., 2008);<br>
      - autosuggestive formation of optimal behavioral activity in
      stressful situations, by sound (whispering) affirmations
      antistress orientation (in development for the sound effects used
      affirmations registration miniature bone conduction microphone
      sound).<br>
      <br>
      Technotronic techniques developed method of forming a focused
      stress obtained by the audio-visual stimulation, synchronized with
      the breath of the user, the following anti-stress physiological
      responses:<br>
      <br>
      - the activation of the central nervous mechanisms that regulate
      the psycho-emotional state of the user, through targeted exposure
      through visual and auditory analyzers cortical, limbic structures
      and the reticular formation of the brain (J. Golub, 2008);<br>
      optimization of vegetative regulation of the use in- the methods
      oftalmofotostimulyatsii pulse light emitters (LEDs), green
      (Goldovskaya I., 1987; Petrov, K., 2008);<br>
      <br>

            Prevention of Negative Consequences of Office Work</b></big><br>

      <br>
      According to WHO, each year about two million people in the world
      die from diseases associated with lack of physical activity, and
      every third office worker has any disease of the spine.
      Characteristic for office work a sedentary lifestyle doubles the
      risk of cardiovascular and endocrine diseases, the cause of 10% of
      deaths in the EU.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of sedentary lifestyle (long sitting in the office, in
      front of television, computer monitor), there is a failure in the
      functioning of almost all human organs and systems.<br>
      <br>
      A pooled analysis of results of experimental research into the
      negative impact of inactivity on the integrated indicators of
      health shows that a sedentary lifestyle contributes to:<br>
      <br>
      - increased risk of various diseases by 37% (A. Dembo, 2010);<br>
      - formation of sarcopenia (I. Rosenberg, 2010), characterized by a
      decrease in muscle and increase body fat;<br>
      - telomere shortening (Cherkasy L., 2010), which causes
      accelerated aging by an average of 10 years;<br>
      - deformation of the spinal column (Serov A .. 2007), contributing
      to the development of various diseases (sciatica, gastric ulcer,
      gastritis, hemorrhoids, chronic bronchitis, mastitis);<br>
      - negative influence on metabolic processes and the resulting
      activation of growth overweight (A. Patel, 2010), resulting in an
      increase of 5% risk of obesity at daily stay seated about two
      hours (Tremblay, M., 2010);<br>
      - an increase of 18% risk of death from cardiovascular disease (J.
      Levin., 2010);<br>
      - increasing the threat of cancer (M. Tremblay, 2010);<br>
      - excessive strain eyes, muscles and joints, the formation of the
      state of fatigue and depression, cognitive decline (Chellenor J.,
      2010);<br>
      negative impact on the lymphatic and venous systems, the
      development of cellulite and varicose veins.<br>
      <br>
      To prevent "office diseases" have been developed previously by the
      author fixed on the body of a variety of electronic sensor
      systems, alarms incorrect posture of the user (Chausovsky G.,
      2009). However, these sensor systems do not allow to generate
      incentive signals for preventive breaks and the implementation of
      various methods of locomotor activity after a certain period of
      time spent in a sitting position, and the need to fix the
      specialized sensors on the body of the user barely acceptable in
      the real world production activities office workers.<br>
      <br>
      The novelty is a tool developed psycho implementation of
      continuous automatic control via fixed on the chair applicators
      sensors like sitting posture, and for the integral indicator of
      time spent in a sitting position and the formation of
      "signal-stimulus" that excludes the possibility of ignoring the
      need for user-chair of preventive interruptions in order to
      neutralize the negative effects of prolonged sitting. At the same
      time techniques developed psycho provide for the implementation of
      a preventive tool training the eye muscles, hands and neck, as
      well as the application of psychophysiological methods of
      maintaining a high level of mental capacity.<br>
      <br>
      Constructive design developed psycho (see photo) is implemented as
      fixed on the outer surfaces of the working chair of any type of
      miniature sensor applicators (mikrotaktilnogo sensor on the back
      of the chair for continuous automatic control of posture and
      sitting mikrotaktilnogo sensor on the seat chair for continuous
      monitoring of the duration of time spent in user sitting position.
      If any of sitting posture, located on the back of the chair
      includes a microsensor mikrovibrator providing formation
      imperceptibly signal information about the need for self-control
      your posture.<br>
      <br>
      Fixed at the seat of the chair mikrotaktilny sensor provides at
      its mechanical contact with the body of the user switch miniature
      electronic timer, including through pre-defined by the interval of
      time (40-60 minutes) located outside the tiny chairs (vibrotactile
      or acoustic) alarm. Placing signaling for armchair makes possible
      his trip is interrupted only when sitting and standing up. Thus
      the possibility of ignoring seated signaling the need to implement
      preventive break for the implementation of different motor
      techniques neutralize the negative effects of prolonged sitting.
      According to the results of experimental studies (coma F., J.
      Dunst, 2010), to neutralize the negative impact of a sedentary
      lifestyle on human health must be maintained, even if minimal,
      physical activity throughout the day (intermittent standing,
      walking, etc.) . This is due to the fact that even the nightly
      sessions in the gym can not fully offset the negative impact of
      sedentary work on the human body.<br>
      <br>
      Developed psycho also provides methods of preventing the
      implementation of psycho-physiological reducing mental performance
      of office employees with a special device, made in the form of
      spectacle frames, which recorded a laser pointer and pull rods,
      the ends of which are fixed to activate with a carpal expander LED
      emitters (see. Photo ). The laser pointer allows the principle of
      biofeedback for visual self-effectiveness of the prevention of
      gymnastic exercises for the neck (head movement is accompanied by
      a simultaneous appearance on the wall or ceiling of dynamic light
      figures). It is known that physical exercise with cervical spine
      help to eliminate headaches, mental states of discomfort and
      fatigue.<br>
      <br>
      Synchronization performing gymnastic exercises for the eyes (their
      circular and horizontal motions) with simultaneous inclusion of
      carpal expander using LED emitters, accelerates the process of
      self-learning techniques of preventive eye-motor exercises and
      helps to achieve the following effects:<br>
      <br>
      - improve the processes of memorization of the processed
      information, as experimentally confirmed (E. Parker, 2007), that
      preventive horizontal eye movements when working with textual
      information positively influence the processes of hemispheric
      interactions and 15% improves short-term memory;<br>
      - the formation of the state of the autonomic balance through
      implementation using carpal expander laterally Kinesiological
      effects (Chausovsky G., 2010);<br>
      - prevention of carpal tunnel syndrome and eyestrain.<br>
      <br>
      Techniques developed psycho also provide minimize the negative
      impact of computer information-analytical work on the processes of
      analytical thinking, which, according to the results of
      experimental studies using magnetic resonance imaging (N. Carr,
      2010), much worse with continued searching various information in
      the Internet resources. Instrumental implemented within the
      framework of the proposed method of automatic effect of prompting
      the computer user do every 40-60 minutes prophylactic breaks,
      helps to eliminate the negative impact of the above there
      prolonged computer information and analytical work on the
      efficiency of intellectual activity. Experimentally validated
      (Davachi L., 2010) that even short breaks during prolonged stay in
      a sitting position contribute to the activation of cognitive
      processes.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the techniques developed psycho, based on the use of
      specialized sensor heads for any type of chairs, create
      preconditions not only to minimize the negative impact of a
      sedentary lifestyle on virtually all human organs and systems, but
      also contribute to better implementation of its intellectual
      potential.<br>
      <br>
      Usefulness developed psycho (constructive cost of registration
      which does not exceed 8 USD) is obvious, since sedentary lifestyle
      inherent in much of the population is not only the initiating
      factor in the development of various "office diseases", but also
      determines the likelihood of reduced life expectancy of office
      employees (according to statistical studies, the risk of premature
      death for people who spend sitting more than six hours a day, on
      average 25% higher than those who do not ignore the need to
      implement preventive practices motor activity).<br>

      simulating the impact of the sword, and the glow of his blade with
      the help of being in an optically transparent case LED emitters .<br>
      <br>
      Simultaneously, the sensors provide simultaneous with the movement
      of swords discrete launch a computer program gradually (with each
      successive sweep of the sword) disappearance visualized on the
      computer screen symbolic image of illness or mental discomfort. To
      enhance the sensual imagery and visualization components
      controlled technical solution development envisaged use fixed on
      the user's body (above the projection of the problem area)
      miniature mikrovibratora, which also include strokes synchronized
      with swords and applying them "hits" on the symbolic image of the
      disease, which is reflected on the screen of a computer monitor .
      This allows for enhanced visualization of figurative
      representation sanogennykh vibrotactile sensations in the problem
      area.<br>
      <br>
      The implementation is based on the psycho-designed using the
      principle of biofeedback (BFB), thus expanding the possibilities
      of accelerated development techniques sanogennykh guided
      visualization. This is carried out following the formation of the
      complex biofeedback techniques:<br>
      <br>
      - a reflection of achieving positive results in guided
      visualization "physiological mirror" visually detected on the
      computer screen effect gradually (under the influence of another
      "attack" the sword of the symbolic image of an illness) reduce the
      pathological focus symbolic and its subsequent extinction
      ("erase");<br>
      - reflection of pictorial representation focused sanogennykh
      impact on the pathological focus in the "physiological mirror"
      vibrotactile effects, which generate in the problem area is
      synchronized with the alternating strokes and "blows" swords of
      figurative symbolism illness left and right hand users.<br>
      <br>
      The technical solution design not only increases the realism of
      perception purposefully initiated figurative sense-perception to
      achieve positive results in the fight against disease, but at the
      same time, to ensure the formation of a favorable background for
      this psycho-emotional (neutralization of the state of stress,
      fear, helplessness, etc.) . This is due to the fact that in the
      process variable "attacking" the sword of the rendered image of
      the symbolic disease left and right hand, implemented following
      psychotechnics self-correction of psycho-emotional state:<br>
      <br>
      elimination of stress disorders by harmonizing hemispheric
      interactions laterally kinesiology techniques (cross-arm movements

      young mounted on the left and a mirror on the right. By looking
      back and forth between the two, combined with breathing
      biofeedback, the user can slow the aging process.<br>
      <br>
      Experimentally validated (E. Langer, 1979), that the psychological
      age of the person (self-awareness of his age) is associated with
      biological and "any change in the emotional state is accompanied,
      consciously or unconsciously, the change in the physiological
      state (Green E., 1999).<br>
      <br>
      It is these aspects form the basis of the developed psycho
      psychological rejuvenation person, the novelty of which is to
      strengthen the emotional and mental components shaped "dive into a
      state of youth" against the backdrop of a focused reduction of
      traumatic visual perception of the natural negative age-related
      changes in appearance.<br>
      <br>
      Structural design of the development is realized in the form of
      spectacle frames, fitted with external pull-rods, one at the end
      of which is fixed photo best period of young users, and on the
      other end of the rod is fixed mirror mikrovibratorom. On the
      earpiece attached akustoprogrammiruemye miniature devices for
      audio playback of pre-recorded affirmations, semantic orientation
      which triggers the activation of the image-willed attitude to
      "dive into a state of youth." Above the photo attached local
      source of red, and above the mirror - Green light pulse.
      Management mikrovibratorom mirror svetoimpulsnymi emitters and
      sound reproduction devices affirmations by using fixed belt
      tactile sensors - loggers rhythmic diaphragmatic breathing person.<br>
      <br>
      On the stroke "inspiration" (eyes by facing a mirror), the green
      LED mikrovibrator mirrors and sound source which voiced the word
      "I". On the stroke "exhalation" (look at the photos by faces of
      youth) and the red LED lights incorporating a sound reproducing
      device which voiced affirmation: "Once again feel young, healthy,
      strong, full of energy and optimism."<br>
      <br>
      Repeated looked from the mirror to the photo of a young implements
      psychotherapeutic method of desensitization and reprocessing eye
      movement (EMDR) traumatic information (F. Shapiro, 1987).
      Previously, author proposed a method of psycho use EMDR to reduce
      traumatic perception of negative age-related changes mirror
      reflection face (Chausovsky G., 2008). However, the effectiveness
      of its use for applications psihologicheskogogo rejuvenation
      greatly reduced because of the traumatic factor due visualization
      mirroring the negative age-related changes in the face of the user
      during repeated transfers his gaze with photos of youth in the
      mirror,<br>
      <br>
      As already noted, novelty developed psycho psychological
      rejuvenation is to strengthen the emotional-shaped components
      forming sense of "immersion" in the state of youth by
      automatically initiating microvibrations mirror to measure
      "inspiration" (in translation by looking at the mirror). This
      microvibration mirror helps visually detectable "erase" definition
      mirroring the user's face, and thus the formation of figurative
      sense of the "disappearance" of negative external signs of
      age-related changes (wrinkles, age spots, etc.), which reinforces
      the emotional - shaped component "dive in state youth "in repeated
      looks from the mirror in the photo best period of his youth. This
      creates a favorable background for the implementation of
      psycho-emotional phenomena suggestive age regression - willed
      settings to create a sense of rejuvenation.<br>
      <br>
      Repeated series of eye movements by path "mirror - photos youth"
      not only help to neutralize the traumatic mirror negative
      information on age-related changes in appearance, but also form a
      positive self-representation (positive belief) on the possibility
      of a psychological rejuvenation. Thus the combined use of
      psychotherapeutic techniques and EMDR tsvetoimpulsnoy light
      stimulation (appearance soothing glow green when glancing at the
      mirror) and activating the flow of red color (when looked at
      photos of youth) can effectively generate the feeling of
      rejuvenation process of cultivation. It is known (Domoratsky R.,
      2003), that the integrated use of color therapy and EMDR
      techniques greatly enhances their use for the formation of the
      psychotherapeutic effects of desensitization and installations...<br>
      <br>
      Using photos youth contributes to the effective design of visual
      images in this age period, and by the emergence of the brain
      electrical activity of the well-defined neural network that is
      identical to an imaginary age period. This is due to the fact that
      according to the neurophysiological studies (Bennett, D., 1989),
      the creation of imaginary images accompanied by the initiation of
      the electrical activity of specific neural networks, specific to

      The implementation techniques developed psycho thus minimizing the
      impact on the emotional state by mirror rendered negative
      age-related changes in appearance. It is essential to achieve the
      goal of instrumental psychological rejuvenation, because "A person
      ages, when the body begins to read information about their
      condition with no reference image in the soul (youth and health),
      and with the images that represent his mind" (The Lermantov ..
      2007).<br>
      <br>
      The proposed development within a single unit (glasses with a
      belt), the value of which does not exceed $ 6 makes available to
      the public receptions comprehensively implement the following very
      important to decrease the psychological and biological age,
      psycho:<br>
      <br>
      - Using the principles of biofeedback for the targeted control of
      breathing rhythm in order to self-correction of individual
      autonomic profile (by reflection rhythmic diaphragmatic breathing
      and relaxation in the "physiological mirror" vibrotactile,
      svetoimpulsnyh and acoustic signals);<br>
      - the combined use of techniques of neutralization traumatic
      information in the form of visually recorded negative age-related
      changes in appearance, EMDR techniques and color-pulse
      stimulation;<br>
      - meditation on the breath;<br>
      - trance therapy;<br>
      - autosuggestivnye age regression techniques (by the synchronized
      rhythmic diaphragmatic breathing, relaxation automatic scoring
      affirmations "rejuvenating" semantic orientation against the
      background of deliberately initiated by the state of relaxation
      techniques method).<br>
      <br>
      The above complex allows you to create psycho-emotional balance
      and activate emotionally-shaped component autosuggestivnogo
      phenomenon of age regression, which provides as part of the public
      psychoprophylaxis premature aging techniques to achieve the
      following effects:<br>
      <br>
      - neutralization of the main psychological factors of aging
      accelerators (emotional stress, psycho-emotional instability,
      etc.);<br>
      - psychological rejuvenation, helps reduce biological age

      Currently it confirmed experimentally that the relaxation with
      visual representation and management of the images allows
      visualization purposefully influence the immune status of an
      individual (K. Simonton, 1980).<br>
      <br>
      Managed by the visualization of complex neurochemical processes
      affect the human immune system (Rossi E., 1986), the level of
      hormones (Antron Yu, 2001) and contributes to the stimulation of
      the very real favorable physiological processes and activate the
      body's defenses to fight the disease.<br>
      <br>
      According to the results of experimental studies (Leviticus
      Moscow, 1999), activation of the immune system is possible by
      means of the central nervous system transmitters.<br>
      <br>
      Obtained with the help of magnetic resonance imaging test data
      (Eyppert F., 2009) indicate that the figurative and symbolic
      visualization promotes the synthesis of endogenous opioids,
      reducing the pain reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the direction of figurative and symbolic visualization can
      serve as an effective auxiliary devices using psychotherapeutic
      techniques in treatment of various diseases.<br>
      <br>
      However, the efficiency of image management visualization
      techniques for therapeutic purposes depends largely on whether the
      patient's self-formation skills figurative sense notions of
      healing focus, relaxation, concentration and visualization, the
      inherent specificity of individual representative system.<br>
      <br>
      Earlier the author to extend the accessibility of using techniques
      of figurative and symbolic visualization (applications for cancer
      therapy) was offered respiratory fluorescence method (Chausovsky
      G., 2008). However, this method is characterized by a limited
      range of features in terms of formation of skills of concentration
      and psychological anchor to achieve positive physiological
      responses.<br>
      <br>
      The novelty is the implementation of psycho-developed
      image-symbolic visualization by slowing the formation of
      synchronous acts of diaphragmatic breathing and relaxation
      schematic plot healing focus on the background sound corresponding
      to the plot of affirmations and worm-flavor, which is then used as
      aromayakorya achieve positive physiological responses to visual
      presentation.<br>

      Hardware design developed psycho implemented as a belt with two
      tactile sensors, including sync with the rhythm of diaphragmatic
      breathing and relaxation by a miniature peristaltic pump device
      and acoustic playback of pre-recorded (with the story of images
      formed on the imaging paper) affirmations. The peristaltic pump is
      in sync with the rhythm of breathing user supplies drops of
      essential oil into the optically opaque sheet of paper, which
      covers a schematic drawing of an unknown user storyline healing
      semantic orientation, preformed therapist with the individual
      psycho-emotional, intellectual and psycho-physiological profile of
      the patient.<br>
      <br>
      Oiling masking schematic drawing of the plot for the imaginative
      visualization of optically opaque sheet of paper drops of
      essential oil provides a gradual empowerment of its optical
      transparency properties. This is because initially the paper
      fibers together constitute an optically opaque structure, but the
      essential oil by filling the gaps in the fibers of paper, provides
      it with uniform properties and refraction of light, respectively,
      the optical transparency. At the same time the process of gradual
      appearance on paper plot scheme of the image visualization, the
      user creates the state of concentration, and diaphragmatic
      breathing triggers a state of relaxation. This creates a favorable
      background for the application of psychophysiological techniques
      suggestive influence on the visual representation of the
      figurative sense load voiced affirmations and visualization of
      image management for therapeutic purposes.<br>

      Efficiency of psychotherapy (psychoneuroimmune-logical) methods in
      combination with other methods for the treatment of cancer
      confirmed by long-term experimental studies (K. Simonton, 1980;
      Gouler J., 1997).<br>
      <br>
      According to the literature (V. Kondrashov, 2004), using the
      method psychoneuroimmunology significant improvement or even a
      complete cure is achieved in about 21% of cancer patients with
      advanced disease...<br>
      <br>
      Offered technotronic-technology allows publicly available methods
      significantly enhance the ability of cancer therapy, as its design
      tool provides the principle of biofeedback successful development
      of skills of self-formation of special state of consciousness,
      which includes elements of relaxation, concentration and
      visualization. It is known (Shoyfet M., 2003, that it was a
      special state of consciousness ("presence between sleeping and
      waking, between reason and instinct, between the will and the lack
      of will, between the conscious and the unconscious") creates the
      preconditions for the successful introduction of the central
      nervous system of a variety of therapeutic programs. This
      emotional components shaped thoughts contribute to the initiation
      of targeted changes in physiological systems (producing
      predictable physiological responses healing direction).<br>
