              Target Kite Imitates Plane’s Flight</font></b> </p>

      <p>The Army and Navy have reached back 3000 years into history for
        something to improve the shooting eye of their air gunners. </p>
      <p>It’s a kite --- one that performs maneuvers no kite ever
        performed before. When the war is over it is going to be the
        delight of kids from 7 to 70. A quarter of a million of the
        kites have already been produced for machine gunners to rip
        apart, and production is still going on. </p>
      <p>This kite will dive, loop, and bank sharply. It will plummet
        like a stricken airplane hurtling earthward with its engine at
        full power. It will recover with all the ease of a pilot hauling
        back on his stick, and race for altitude. </p>
      <p>The Navy’s kite --- it was developed by the Navy and then
        adopted by the Army --- is called the best air-gunnery target in
        the world. It was perfected by Paul Edward Garber, who probably
        knows more about kites than anyone else and who might be called
        the champion kite flyer of five continents. </p>
      <p>As curator of aviation&nbsp; at the Smithsonian Institution in
        Washington DC, he was custodian of the museum’s kite collection,
        which ranged from weird oriental kites representing gods and
        demons to the box kite capable of carrying a man aloft, invented
        by Lawrence Hargrave, of England. </p>
      <p>Garber knew that kites, notably a type invented by Alexander
        Graham bell of telephone fame, had exerted a profound influence
        on early airplane design. He had studied kite shapes and their
        flying qualities from information covering a period of 30
        centuries. </p>
      <p>Shortly after the United States entered the war, Garberm bow a
        lieutenant commander in the Special Services Division of the
        Navy’s B ureau of Aeronautics, heard Admiral John H Towers
        remark that one of the things the Navy needed most was an
        improved moving target to speed up the training of aircraft
        gunners. </p>
      <p>Garber tucked that remark away in his head. At that time, he
        was helping with the production of millions of model airplanes
        needed by the armed services for recognition instruction. </p>
      <p>Garber kept thinking about targets. A kite might do. It would
        be cheap, easy to produce. But if it was stationary in the air
        it would be an easy mark for even a novice with a gun. What was
        needed was one that could do aerobics and dodge bullets. </p>
      <p>Working in hours mostly stolen from his sleep, and assisted by
        Lloyd Reichert and Stanley Potter, fellow kite enthusiasts,
        Garber perfected his target kite in a little less than a year. </p>
      <p>He used as a basis for his kite --- which is without a tail ---
        one with a bowed cross spar developed from a Malay kite half a
        century ago by an American experimenter, William A. Eddy. Garber
        was after instability; this kite had it. </p>
      <p>When the wind presses against the covering fabric, the lower
        portion of the kite becomes a sort of vertical keel. The bowed
        spar becomes a weight carrier similar to that of a bird’s wings.
        Lateral balance can be destroyed and restored simply by altering
        the air pressure on one side or the other of the face of the
        kite. Garber added a fin near the lower end of his upright mast
        to augment the keel surface. To this he attached a rudder,
        controlled by the kite’s operators by means of twin flying
        lines. </p>
      <p>When he was satisfied with his product, Garber demonstrated it
        for Captn Luis de Florez, Chief of the Special Devices Division,
        who in civilian life is a successful inventor and consulting
        engineer. Captn de Florex watched the kite’s spectacular
        aerobatics for a few minutes. </p>
      <p>‘That’s fine’, he said, with a cheerful disregard for navy red
        tape. ‘Get 1500 made up’. Demonstrations to other Navy officers
        and to the Army were enough. The Garber kite was adopted. </p>
      <p>The kite must be good. Gunnery officers are elated when their
        students hit it once in 50 shots. </p>
      <p>What the target kite will do to peacetime kite flying is easily
        imagined. Appropriately, it is being manufactured for the armed
        forces by A G Spalding and Bros, makers of athletic equipment. </p>

        <p><b>( Cl. 244-153 )</b></p>

      <p>This invention relates to kites, and in particular to those
        which can maneuver from the ground, together with devices for
        their control. </p>
      <p>Kites have been used for sport as well as for utilitarian
        purposes for a great many years. Some have been designed for
        great lifting power and some have been designed more in regard
        to their beauty or oddity. Several types of maneuvering kites
        have been known, among those being types which could be
        controlled from the ground. Among the latter type are those
        illustrated&nbsp; in the Patents # 1,744,529 and 1-908,325 to
        DeHaven. </p>
      <p>My invention relates to maneuvering kites of the type which may
        be controlled from the ground by the operator. The kite and
        control apparatus is specifically designed to provide a
        maneuvering target for anti=aircraft target practice, and the
        kite is rapidly and easily maneuverable, making it particularly
        useful and successful for that purpose, however it is also
        suitable for signaling purposes or the like and for sport. </p>
      <p>While the aforementioned patents to DeHaven disclose kites
        having some degree of maneuverability, there are differences in
        structure and control mechanism in my device which provide a
        much more speedy and maneuverable target. With my apparatus, the
        kite can be made to describe loops, vertical or horizontal
        figure 8s, steep dives and climbs, ordinary turns, and
        combinations of these maneuvers. The operator may stand in one
        place on the ground if there is sufficient wind to fly the kite,
        or he may ride a vehicle or other moving platform in order to
        provide relative wind to fly the kite or in order to tow the
        target past a long line of guns while maneuvering it. The
        simplicity, positiveness, and ease of operation of the control
        means makes it possible to operate the kite from such a moving
        platform. </p>
      <p>It is, accordingly, the major object of my invention to provide
        a maneuvering aerial target apparatus for anti-aircraft gun
        practice wherein a maneuvering kite and controls therefore,
        operated on the ground, cooperate to furnish a rapidly and
        completely maneuverable aerial target. </p>
      <p>Another object of my invention is to provide an improved
        apparatus for controlling a maneuvering kite from the ground by
        the kite strings. </p>
      <p>It is another object of my invention to provide an improved
        apparatus for controlling a maneuvering kite from the ground by
        the kite strings. </p>
      <p>It is another object of my invention to provide an improved

      <p><b>Figure 9</b> is a view if the structure shown in Figure 8,
        as seen when viewed from the left of Figure 8. </p>
      <p>Figure 1 shows the kite 1 in flight under the control of an
        operator on the ground. The kite is a two-stick, diamond-shaped
        Eddy pattern type. Operation is by means of two lines 2 and 3
        which extend up to the kite from the ends of a control bar 5
        held horizontally by the operator. The control bar is of
        substantial length so that by moving one of its ends towards or
        away from the kite a relatively large movement of the line 2 or
        3 will occur. A length of 4 feet for the control bar has been
        found to be effective, bit this figure is not intended by way of
        limitation. A reel apparatus, shown best in Figures 3 to 6 is
        combined with this bar for most effective operation. </p>
      <p>Near the kite, the lines 2 and 3 are connected to the opposite
        ends of a horizontal bridle sick 6 as shown best in Figure 2.
        Control cords 8 and 9 extend from the bridle stick, passing
        through a pair of screw eyes 10 and 11 and thence to the ends of
        a tiller bar 12 on a rudder 13 which is pivoted about an axis
        substantially perpendicular to the mast 17 (Figures 7-9) of the
        kite. The screw eyes 10 and 11 are screwed through the kite
        covering 18 into the bottom of the spar 19 (Figure 7), at equal
        distances from the mast 17, the total distance between the eyes
        being substantially equal to the length of the bridle stick 6. </p>
      <p>A bridle line 20 is fastened at its end to screw eyes 21 and 22
        which pass through the cover 18 and screw into the bottom of the
        mast as shown clearly in Figure 2. With a kite having a mast 17
        which is 5 feet 1 inch long the spar 19 is bolted thereto at a
        distance of 9 inches from the forward or top end of the mast.
        The screw eye 21 is located 4-1/2 inches on either side of the
        mast since the bridle stick is 12 inches long. The bridle line
        20 is 80 inches long, and fastened at each end to the screw eye
        21 and 22. At a point 23, which is 30 inches from where the
        bridle line is fastened to screw eye 21, it is fastened to a
        screw eye at the mid-point of the bridle stick as shown in
        Figure 2. The length of the bridle line 20, the positions of the
        eyes 21 and 22, and the position of the point 23 are important
        because they determine the angle of attack of the kite. </p>
      <p>Since the lines 2 and 3 are fastened to the ends of the bridle
        stick and the bridle line 20 is fastened to the middle of the
        stick, the tension or pull in the bridle line 20 when the kite
        is flying is evenly distributed to the two lines 2 and 3. The
        control cords 8 and 9 are not intended to take any of the
        tension in the lines 2 and 3 under most conditions, and for that
        reason when the bridle line 20 is under normal tension the
        control cords 8 and 9 are adjusted with a little slack. </p>
      <p>Details of the rudder 13 and vertical fin 25 to which it is
        attached are shown in Figures 8 and 9. The vertical fin has a
        portion 26 which extends through a slot in the mast 17, being
        fixed therein by a bolt 27 which passes through the portion 26
        and the mast. </p>
      <p>The rudder 13 is hinged to the rear of the fin 25 by means of a
        pintle 27 which passes through hinge straps 28 and 29 fastened
        to the fin and rudder respectively. The tiller bar 12 is
        suitable fastened to the rudder near the leading edge,
        projecting from each side of the rudder a substantial distance;
        in the case of a kite of the dimensions given above, the tiller
        bar will have a length of 5 inches from end to end. The rudder
        can be moved through an angle of approximately 90 degrees to
        either side of its midposition, whereupon it strikes the side of
        the vertical fin which provides a stop. </p>
      <p>The cover may be applied to the kite in any convenient manner.
        In the embodiment shown the ends of the mast 17 and spar 19 are
        slotted to receive a boltrope 30 which passes loosely within a
        hem in the periphery of the cover. At the corners the boltrope
        is exposed so that it will slip into the aforementioned slots.
        The boltrope is tensioned by drawing its two free ends through
        the slot in the forward part of the mast and then fastening them
        in any suitable manner, as by clamping them under a washer and
        wingnut 3. </p>
      <p>The spar is bowed by tightening the bowing line 32 (Figure 7)
        which is attached to its ends. The amount of bow is determined
        by the strength of the wind in which the kite is flown. </p>
      <p>In view of the fact that the cords 2, 3, 8, 9, 20 and 32 change
        in length with weather conditions, age, tension, etc., means
        should be incorporated in their connections to the kite whereby
        their length can be easily adjusted. </p>
      <p>As indicated in Figure 2 the outline of an airplane is painted
        n the cover of the kite. Preferably the outline is in black and
        the rest of the cover is the same color as the sky, by which
        device the airplane outline makes a more realistic target for
        anti-aircraft target practice. </p>
      <p>While the kite may be controlled with a plain stick for the
        control bar 5 shown, it is much more convenient to use the
        combination control bar and reel apparatus to be described
        below. If a plain stick is used it should be about 4 feet long
        and the lines 2 and 3 tied to its opposite ends. It will be
        understood that by manipulating the stick to pull line 2 or 3
        towards the operator the rudder 12 is shifted to make the kite
        turn one way or the other. </p>
      <p>The control bar 5 and reel shown generally in Figure 1 is shown
        in enlarged detail in Figures 3 to 6. Two wooden sticks 34 and
        35 of equal length are fastened together in parallel but spaced
        alignment, there being separators 36, 37, and 38 at their ends
        and at their mid-point. Intermediate separators 39 and 40, have
        passages therethrough to permit the lines 2 and 3 to pass
        through them and whereby these separators also act as guides. </p>
      <p>Adjacent each end, between the sticks 34 and 35 are pairs of
        spaced pulleys 48 and 49. The lines 2 and 3 pass between the
        pulleys 41, 42, and 45, 46 and into the space between the sticks
        34, 35, thence to the pulleys 48 and 49, and thence to the reels
        51 and 52, as shown in Figure 3. </p>
      <p>The reels are mounted on a shaft 53 which is journalled in the
        sides 55 and 56 of a frame 57 which is attached to the control
        bar at its midpoint, straddling the pulley 48 and 49. Each
        pulley if fixed to an outer shell 58 of a free-wheeling clutch,
        the shell being rotatably journalled on the shaft 53. Within
        each shell is a clutch hub 59 having wedge shaped pockets in its
        periphery, each pocket containing a roller 60. Each clutch hub
        is fixed to the shaft 53, and when the shaft is rotated
        clockwise as viewed in Figure 6 it will rotate the reel 51
        clockwise. Reel 52 will be simultaneously rotated by its clutch,
        as will be understood. The two reels 51 and 52 are slightly
        spaced by separating washers 61. A crank having a handle 63 is
        fixed to the end of shaft 53. A strap 62, which is fastened to
        the top of the control bar 5, may be slipped over the handle 63
        to hold it when desired. </p>
      <p>Brake drums 64 and 65 are fixed to the shaft 53, one on each
        side of the pair of reels. A brake yoke having side arms 37 and
        38 and a connecting handle 69, is mounted for pivotal movement
        with handle 69, is mounted for pivotal movement with respect to
        the reel frame 57 by means of the hinged mountings 70 and 71
        which are fastened to the frame sides 55 and 56. At their rear
        ends the brake yoke side arms 67 and 68 are provided with brake
        linings 72 and 73 which are curved to fit the surface of the
        brake drums. When the brake handle 69 is raised by the operator
        the brake linings 72 and 73 which are curved to fit the surface
        of the brake drums. When the brake handle 69 is raised by the
        operator the brake linings 72 and 73 will be simultaneously
        pressed against the drums to stop the rotation of the shaft 53.
        As the brake is used to stop rotation of the reels when paying
        out the lines 2 and 3, during which time the reels are rotating
        counter-clockwise as viewed in Figure 6, it will be apparent
        that stopping the shaft 53 by the brake will stop the reels due
        to the wedging action of the rollers 60. </p>
      <p>The frame sides 55 and 56 are joined at their rear end portions
        by an end wall 74 to which is fastened a hook 75 adapted to be
        hooked behind the belt of the operator. At their forward end the
        sides 55 and 56 are fastened at their bottom to the control bar
        5, there being a connecting brace 76 connecting their forward
        and upper portions. Screw eyes 77 and 78, fastened to the frame
        sides at their forward and upper end, provide fastenings to
        which are attached the ends of a shoulder harness 78 which
        passes over the shoulders of the operator. By means of the hook
        75 and the shoulder harness 79 the whole reel and control bar
        are suspended on the front of the operator and his hands are
        free to manipulate the reels, brake, crank handle, and the
        control bar 5. Normally, the operator can rest his right hand on
        the crank handle, and his left hand on the brace 76 at the front
        of the frame 57. He can easily reach the fingers of his left
        hand down to grasp the brake handle 69 to that he can raise the
        handle to apply the brake. The brake is useful not only in
        slowing the running out of the flying lines as the kite ascends,
        but can be often used to hold the lines taut to test their
        evenness while wither drum is being compensated to take up slack
        in the lines 2 or 3. The brake should always be used to arrest
        the revolving reels after paying out line. Grabbing of the
        rotating handle for that purpose pits a strain on the reel and
        kite. </p>
      <p>The necessity for the differential action of the two reels
        becomes apparent when the kite is flown. Then it is seen that
        although the reel is designed with narrow drums, and some
        lateral play while cranking, so that the incoming and outgoing
        lines will shuttle back and forth to avoid piling up on one side
        or the other of the reels, even so, there will be unevenness,
        often too great to be compensated by yawing the control bar 5.
        Moreover, the yawing action should be used only for maneuvering
        of the kite by moving the bridle stick and consequently the
        rudder. Therefore when the kite is being flown the length of the
        lines 2 and 3 should be adjusted by manipulating the individual
        reels 51 and 52 until the lines 2 and 3 are of the same length,
        with the bridle stick 6 and the control bar 5 both parallel to
        the kite. </p>
      <p>There are two methods of using the free wheeling clutches to
        adjust the length of the lines. First: If the crank handle 63
        has been secured in the crank handle strap 62, push forward on
        the top of the winding drum of whichever line is slack. Second:
        If the crank handle is being held in the hand, use the other
        hand to hold the drum of the line that is slack, and back off on
        the handle for a portion of a turn, then free the drum and wind
        both with a forward motion of the crank. </p>
      <p>In flying the kite, as mentioned above, a yawing motion of the
        control bar 5 causes a yawing of the rudder. The relative
        proportions of the control bar 5, the bridle stick 6 and the
        tiller bar 12 are therefore important because with the elongated
        control bar a relatively small yawing motion thereof results in
        a much larger or magnified motion of the bridle stick. </p>
      <p>One of the additional advantages of the control mechanism used
        with the described kite is an effect which results when the
        control bar 5 has been yawed to such an extent that the rudder
        13 has moved to an extreme position, where it is stopped by the
        engagement of the tiller bar with the vertical fin 25. When this
        occurs, the control cord 8 or 9, as the case may be, is placed
        under tension. Since the screw eyes 10 and 11 are spaced a
        distance from the mast it will be seen that the application of
        the above described tension to the cord 8 or 9 will apply a
        force to the kite to the side of the mast and on the same side
        thereof as that towards which the rudder is turned. The
        direction of this force is such as to incline the kite surface
        toward the direction of pull so that it reacts like the sail of
        a boat. </p>
      <p>The form of kite shown is inherently stable. The wind pressing
        the fabric of the cover on each side of the mast forms the cover
        along that line into a vertical keel. The vertical fin 25
        augments this keel surface and, being at the bottom, adds to the
        steadiness. The addition of the rudder provides a means of
        variable pressure against the air stream flowing along the keel
        and steer the kite. The recover of the kite from each maneuver
        is facilitated by its stableness and its natural tendency to
        climb. It is to be understood that the specific dimensions for
        the kite, as given in the preceding part of the description, are
        by way of example only, and are not meant as limitations. </p>
      <p>It will be understood that the above description and
        accompanying drawings comprehend only the general and preferred
        embodiment of the invention and that various changes in details
        of the construction, proportion and arrangement of parts may be
        made within the scope of the appended claims and without
        sacrificing any of the advantages of the inventions. </p>
