        Place: Environmental Testing Corp (Aurora, CO) <br>
        Date: August 15-26, 1980 <br>
        Equipment: WH test car was a 1979 Monte Carlo with a 6-cylinder
        250 cu in engine with a compression ration of 8.06:1. The
        baseline was provided by the same car without the device. No EGR
        or catalytic converter was used on either car. <br>
        Test: 50 mpg steady-state test <br>
        Test: EPA cold-start city test <br>

      <p>With 75 octane fuel (WH) the ping point was 2 degrees after
        TDC. With 97-octane (baseline) it was 8 degrees before TDC,
        confirming test vehicle variation for ping. </p>

        and all pollution equipment was operational. The manifold was
        not cooled on the WH modification and the electronic carburetion
        and closed loop calibration was not altered. </p>

      <p><b>Informal Tests and Observations by the Webster-Heise
          Corporation ~</b> </p>
      <p>During the development of the WHV, numerous in-house tests
        (totaling over 100,000 miles) were conducted. Several test cars
        (including a Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Chevrolet Monza, and an
        Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme) were used which, in addition to the
        data obtained in the formal tests, provided some information
        about the use of the valve. The disassembly of the Monte Carlo
        engine after 80,000 miles of testing also provides some
        interesting insight into the workings of this device. These
        observations were made by the Webster-Heise Corporation and are
        included here as an unverified supplement to the formal test
        data: </p>
      <p>Fuel economy in road tests increased by 15 to 25%. </p>
      <p>Driveability was improved with considerably more response at
        low rpm and a lighter throttle was required. </p>
      <p>Cold starts were greatly improved with the valve. The modified
        car would start cold with no choke and would sustain combustion.
        The same car, unmodified, would not start without choking and
        stalled at least once with it. </p>
      <p>No engine deposits were detected when the engine was
        disassembled after 80,000 miles (including many miles at high
        temperatures on dynometers). Cylinder wear was only 0.0025 inch
        instead of the expected 0.0100 to 0.0150 inch that would
        normally be expected. Crankshaft wear was not apparent. </p>
      <p>No lubricant oil was consumed except for extended-interval oil
        changes. No discoloration or contamination of the oil was
        detected. </p>
      <p>Coolant water temperature was lower than normal. One third of
        the radiator was covered to bring the engine temperature to the
        desired level of 195° F. </p>
