      <p>This report is an analysis of the concept, technology, and
        hardware of a new valve to increase engine efficiency that has
        been developed by the Webster-Heise Corporation. The methodology
        used in this report consists of a discussion of the attempts to
        improve internal combustion, a physical description of the
        Webster-Heise Valve (WHV) and its operation, a history of the
        development of the valve, the current status of the device, the
        outlook for its possible acceptance, and its potential impact on
        various issues of national concern. The appendix consists of a
        more detailed analysis of the nature of the existing problems in
        current production systems, the theoretical reasons for these
        problems, and their theoretical solutions as related to the WHV.
        In addition, a summary of tests is provided so that the reader
        will have relevant data on which to base his own conclusions.
        The technical analysis (Appendix I) is a system approach (from
        carburetor to tailpipe) explaining the effects of the valve upon
        different aspects of combustion (before, during and after). To
        the extent that a phenomenon (such as differential vaporization)
        is repeated in analyzing these effects, any such repetition
        should be considered to be supplemental rather than additive. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;This report should not be considered to be a
        recommendation for or against the WHV or the related technology.
        There is not et enough evidence to support such a judgment
        either way. The data that is available, however, suggests that a
        closer investigation of it by the auto industry and by the
        Federal Government would not be inappropriate, and lower octane
        requirements can be even partially realized, the introduction of
        the WHV could be a very significant development. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">II. Executive Summary ~</font></b><a
          name="exec"></a> </p>
      <p>From the inception of the gasoline-powered spark-ignition
        engine, there have been numerous attempts to improve the
        condition of the charge reaching the cylinders. The carburetor
        allows the proper amount of gasoline and air into the engine
        but, because much of the fuel is in the form of liquid droplets
        (which will not burn in that form), combustion cannot occur at
        maximum efficiency. This causes undesirable effects such as
        "engine knock", imperfect fuel distribution to the cylinders,
        cycle-by-cycle variations, dieseling, engine deposits, less than
        optimum conversion of heat to work, increased engine wear,
        increased fuel consumption, loss of power, some driveability
        problems, and increased pollutant emissions. </p>
      <p>The auto industry has attempted to solve the problems of
        inadequate vaporization by increasing the temperature of the
        intake manifold to heat the incoming air and fuel. This
        increases the rate of vaporization, but the high temperature in
        the manifold greatly reduces the density of the air that is
        admitted to the cylinders. This provides less air for combustion
        and expansion in the cylinders, resulting in reduced power. To
        deal with the problem of knock, tetraethyl lead or other
        additives are used to slow down the rate of consumption. They
        allow the engine to operate but introduce additional losses of
        thermal efficiency. The slower burn also gives nitrogen oxides
        (NOx), a principal contributor to smog and acid rain, a greater
        opportunity to form. Tetraethyl lead has been associated with
        health effects, particularly on children, and is currently being
        phased out of gasoline as a result. Both of these pollutants are
        currently the subjects of debate in the Congress. </p>
      <p>The WHV was developed to deal specifically with the combustion
        problems caused by incomplete vaporization. It is not a
        carburetor by is a valve that fits below the carburetor and
        extends into the intake manifold. According to the Webster-Heise
        Corporation, it causes more of the gasoline in the air/fuel
        mixture to vaporize at any given manifold temperature and
        provides complete vaporization at intake manifold temperatures
        as low as 125 degrees F. This claimed achievement is made
        possible, according to the company, by a transverse shearing of
        droplets in the gasoline spray by highly turbulent air followed
        by passage through an area of lower pressure. These effects are
        produced by a matrix of thousands of small nozzles formed by two
        stainless steel concentric screens of different mesh size
        through which both gasoline droplets and air pass before
        reaching the intake manifold. </p>
      <p>The turbulence and friction created by the passage of the air
        through the screens transfer enough energy to the gasoline to
        cause it to vaporize when it enters the low pressure area of the
        intake manifold, according to Webster-Heise (W-H). It is further
        claimed that, because of early gasoline droplet vaporization,
        the vaporized gasoline has time to mix uniformly with air prior
        to entering the intake valve of each cylinder. This
        pre-vaporized and then thoroughly pre-mixed fuel charge permits
        equal distribution t, and within, each cylinder, thereby
        satisfying the conditions required for efficient combustion. At
        temperatures lower than 125 F, even though the gasoline may not
        be fully vaporized, some efficiency gains are realized,
        apparently due to the small droplet diameters resulting from the
        finer atomization and to improved mixing. </p>
      <p>The effects of the WHV on combustion are very important,
        according to its designers. The vaporization of the gasoline
        prevents its collection as liquid on the metal surfaces of the
        cylinders and pistons. This also prevents dilution of the
        crankcase oil and promotes more complete combustion because the
        oxygen in the air has greater access to the hydrocarbon
        molecules and can oxidize them more completely. Carbon deposits
        are less likely to form as a result. Vaporization also reduces
        the occurrence of fuel-rich pockets in the extremities of the
        cylinders where detonation would otherwise take place. Catalysts
        such as lead, which slow down to reaction rate, do not appear to
        be needed because the conditions causing knock are not present
        to the same degree. This allows the combustion to occur more
        quickly, meaning that lower-octane fuels can be used without
        knock, that more pressure can be exerted on the crank at the
        optimum moment, that NOx has less time to form, and that less
        heat can be transferred to the engine walls. </p>
      <p>The WHV has been formally tested six times at EPA-recognized
        laboratories on all of the EPA vehicle tests on a wide range of
        octanes (97 to 75) and in the test laboratories of automobile
        and octane additive manufacturers. The test results vary to some
        extent with the type of test and the conditions under which they
        were run, but data (see Summary of Tests) comparing the W-H
        modified car with a baseline car (including the same car without
        the valve) show the following representative results: </p>
      <p>1. Fuel economy increased from 6 to 20%; </p>
      <p>2. Torque (power) at 1500 rpm increased 13 to 40%; </p>
      <p>3. NOx emissions declined from 4 to 48%; </p>
      <p>4. Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions declined from 17 to 54%; </p>
      <p>5. Hydrocarbon (HC) emissions declined from 5 to 13%; </p>
      <p>6. Engine octane requirements declined by 10 to 15 points. </p>
      <p>Tests to date indicate that the WHV enables an engine to
        operate on much lower octane than is possible in the unmodified
        engine. Because the charge is less likely to knock because of
        its conditioning by the valve, gasoline of lower octane (which
        burns faster than high octane) can be used effectively. In the
        W-H modification, gasoline with an octane rating of 75, blended
        and certified by the Phillips Petroleum Company, outperformed in
        all categories the 97-octane fuel used in the baseline car in
        comparative tests. </p>
      <p>More work needs to be done to determine whether or not the test
        results obtained so far can be translated into commercial
        products with wide utility. However, the potential of a
        technological breakthrough of this magnitude provides a
        significant incentive for continued effort. If the valve were in
        use in all of the automobiles in the US and if the fleet
        obtained the same results on average that the test showed, the
        refining industry could save about 600,000 barrels per day (b/d)
        in crude oil by avoiding the extra processing now necessary to
        boost the octane of gasoline. It could also take much of the
        pressure off petrochemicals such as aromatics, which have other
        non-combustion uses. In addition to the 600,000 b/d that could
        be saved by the refineries, the gasoline conservation that could
        be realized by consumers through better fuel economy could be on
        the order of 650,000 to 2,300,000 b/d (somewhat more than the US
        imports of crude oil from Saudi Arabia). The market for
        lower-octane gasolines would provide independent refiners with
        an opportunity to avoid the expensive investment in reforming
        equipment now needed to compete with the major oil companies in
        the manufacture of premium unleaded gasoline. It would also
        greatly reduce the pressure to increase allowable lead levels in
        gasoline and could accelerate the phaseout of tetraethyl lead as
        a gasoline additive (assuming appropriate timing). The positive
        health effects of eliminating lead could be supplemented by
        positive reductions in uncontrolled NOx, CO, and HC emissions
        and thus in control costs. The lower cost (about 20
        cents/gallon) of straight-run gasoline over premium unleaded
        could also benefit consumers. </p>
      <p>Despite the fact that the production costs of the valve would
        probably be under $100 each and that it could be easily adapted
        to most new car engines, the institutional barriers to the
        acceptance of a new device can be formidable and preproduction
        testing may reveal unforeseen problems. In addition, the
        skepticism generated by the failure of others, plus the known
        costs and reliabilities of the technologies and products now in
        use, would have to be overshadowed by the performance and
        promise of a new technology and product. At this time, the auto
        companies, the most likely beneficiaries of the W-H technology,
        seem to be, for the most part, unsure of the next step. They
        have so far been skeptical. This may be due to the fact that it
        was not invented in their own research laboratories, and
        consequently they have no "in-house" experience with it. The
        relative advantages from the use of such a device could change
        if current trends toward fuel injection and dieselization
        continue, because the auto industry has invested large amounts
        of capital and effort in them. On the other hand, the US auto
        industry has a desperate need to improve its existing products
        without substantial price increases, a need which might
        accelerate the rate of testing of the valve and possibly
        facilitate its subsequent acceptance. The disincentives of the
        cost and time required to evaluate the valve must be weighed by
        a company against the incentives of potentially improved
        performance and greater buyer acceptance of the cars on which it
        is used. </p>
      <p>More testing of the valve is clearly needed on a wide variety
        off vehicles to establish a larger data base before its full
        potential can be precisely determined. This would presumably be
        the responsibility of private industry bit some have proposed
        that the Federal Government might take an active role in
        evaluating it. The Government has testing facilities and vehicle
        fleets that are sometimes used for such purposes. Such testing,
        however, can be expensive for the Government as well and the
        desirability of doing it must be weighted against competing
        demands on Government resources. Because the effects of the
        valve touch upon several major issues of concern to the Congress
        (lead levels in gasoline, oil conservation, air quality,
        competitiveness of the auto industry, and others), this may be
        an appropriate course of action for consideration independent of
        the auto industry responses. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">III. Introduction ~</font></b><a
          name="intro"></a> </p>
      <p>The history of the spark-ignition gasoline-powered engine is
        filled with attempts to improve it. Although there have been
        many modifications made in engine design over the past century,
        the fundamental process of delivering air and gasoline to the
        engine has not changed much over the years. Gasoline is still
        sprayed by the venturi jet of the carburetor through a needle
        valve into the intake manifold as air passes through it. This
        causes the gasoline to atomize into droplets which may be
        further reduced in size through secondary atomization when they
        strike the throttle plate (when it obstructs the flow at low
        engine speeds). This atomization increases the surface area of
        the droplets and increases the amount of vaporization that can
        occur. Because of the extremely short time available for
        vaporization to occur in the manifold, however, this is not
        generally sufficient to fully vaporize all of the gasoline. The
        presence of the liquid gasoline (rather than gasoline vapor) in
        the cylinders contributes to a variety of mixing, distribution,
        combustion, and lubrication problems. The carburetor, therefore,
        does an excellent job of metering out precise amounts of
        gasoline and air to maintain the proper air/fuel ratio but,
        except for breaking the liquid gasoline into small droplets
        which result in some vaporization, it does not completely
        overcome the phase problem. In order to increase the rate of
        vaporization, most automobile manufacturers use high temperature
        (in the form of a hot spot on the bottom of the manifold or a
        heated water jacket around the manifold) to force more of the
        gasoline into a vaporized state. These elevated temperatures,
        however, reduced the density of the air reaching the cylinders,
        resulting in less power output from the engine. Baffles are
        often used to promote mixing of the air and gasoline but these
        tend to restrict the flow and provide surfaces on which the
        gasoline can impinge and recondense. </p>
      <p>Dozens of inventors, both individually and as employees of
        large corporations, have attempted to solve this phase problem
        but have been ultimately unsuccessful. These devices failed
        because of several common characteristics: </p>
      <p>1. They were not variable but were optimized for only one
        steady-state condition (a fixed screen, for example). As a
        result, any change from the optimum engine speed would mean
        reduced performance which on the average was almost always worse
        than that for the unmodified car. </p>
      <p>2. They constituted restrictions because they reduced the space
        open to the passage of air and fuel, especially at high engine
        speeds, and consequently reduced the power the engine was able
        to produce. </p>
      <p>3. Their gains were offset by losses (usually power or
        emissions) that made the devices impractical. </p>
      <p>4. They attempted to modify carburetion in some way. Even
        though the carburetor is a very efficient metering device, it
        atomizes the gasoline but does not fully vaporize it. </p>
      <p>5. They attempted to improve the vaporization rate of gasoline
        in the area above the throttle plate. As soon as the improved
        mixture, if any, impinged on the throttle plate it would
        reformulate droplets and destroy the gain. </p>
      <p>6. They did not work (for some combination of the above
        reasons). </p>
      <p>Some of these devices, such as the Pogue carburetor and its
        variations (which was marketed but turned out to be
        unsatisfactory because it was difficult to keep in proper
        adjustment), have been the subject of extreme claims. Because of
        the intense concern over fuel economy in the wake of serious
        international oil emergencies, the interest of the public, the
        auto industry, and the Federal Government has been raised and
        eventually dashed by these well-intentioned inventors who proved
        not to have the answer they sought. It should be noted that this
        applies to large corporations, including the auto companies, as
        well as to individuals. Some improvements in carburetion have
        been realized, but the fundamental phase problem still remains.
        Very little work, however, was done on charge conditioning below
        the carburetor. </p>
      <p>As a result of this succession of technological
        disappointments, Americans have become highly skeptical of any
        new device that promises to improve combustion. This makes it
        more difficult than ever for a new idea to succeed. To do so, it
        must overcome the inertia of justified doubt generated over the
        last 50 years and especially over the last 10. </p>
      <p>Sherwood F. Webster and Richard L. Heise claim to have
        discovered a means of vaporizing gasoline rapidly at low
        temperature. Their valve is a significantly different approach
        from the many devices which have preceded it. They have
        demonstrated in 6 formal tests and numerous informal ones that
        this has the effect if improving fuel economy, improving torque,
        reducing harmful exhaust emissions, improving driveability, and
        reducing the octane requirements of the engine on which it is
        used. Considerably more testing is needed, however. </p>
      <p>Although some earlier devices employed a screen, it was a
        single screen that was fixed horizontally in the path of the
        air/fuel mixture. The WHV uses two screens, which have specific
        shapes, sizes, and proximity to each other that are critical to
        the process of early vaporization (see Physical Description).
        The valve conditions and gasoline and air so that each cylinder
        receives a charge that can burn more efficiently. </p>
      <p>It is not unusual for major innovations to come from outside
        the auto industry. As Gushee, et al., point out (Ref. 1): </p>
      <p>"The tendency of innovations is to emerge from outside the
        industry. Several recent studies have shown this happening at a
        three to one ratio. The reason for this is that external
        industries do not have the commitment to the existing technology
        and do not have to worry about losing their existing market. </p>
      <p>"Typically, an innovation is introduced on a small scale,
        tested, and proved; gradually, it penetrates the market. The
        period of experimentation varies widely depending on numerous
        factors, and involving the complexity of the innovation, the
        extent of the supporting system for the existing technology, and
        the social values affected. Several years is almost certainly
        the shortest period in which a major innovation can fill a
        market opportunity. </p>
      <p>"In the auto industry, technological change seems to take a
        long time -- at least it seems like a long time while one is in
        the period of change. Today’s spark ignition engine produces
        about 10 times the horsepower per pound of engine that Henry
        Ford’s best efforts could produce in 1900, but all 7 decades
        have been needed for this progress to occur. In the area of
        technological substitution, these time lags are also apparent.
        It took 20 years for power brakes to be installed on half the
        new cars, 15 years for air conditioning on half the new cars, 10
        years for power steering on half the new cars." </p>
      <p>In a recent study on the competitive status of the US auto
        industry, the National Research Council and the National Academy
        of Engineering concluded the following (Ref. 2): </p>
      <p>"The clear competitive advantage accruing to products with
        advanced efficiency performance has created an incentive for the
        development of improved hardware. If the real price of oil
        continues to rise and we experience significant supply
        interruptions, the future of product innovation may become more
        radical... </p>
      <p>"We are concerned with the general price of innovation as well
        as its general character. The first is the diversity of
        technology growing out of the innovative process; the issue is
        essentially whether, for any given system, a new dominant design
        is apparent. The second aspect is the extent to which innovation
        departs from design concepts currently in use, whether
        innovation is epochal or incremental.. </p>
      <p>"The evidence suggests that innovation in the 1970s generally
        has proceeded first where the cost of change (in terms of its
        impact on the existing process) has been least. This serves to
        underscore the potential for change in future years. The
        technologies involve not only new design concepts but also in
        many cases totally new physical or mechanical and chemical
        principles. And indications are that such developments are not
        the flight of some engineer’s fancy; extensive development work
        is under way in all areas and in some cases has been speeded up
        remarkably in the last two years... </p>
      <p>"In terms of product technology, a period of intense
        technological competition may be just ahead." </p>
      <p>The WHV might be considered "incremental" in terms of its
        potential impact on the auto industry in that it probably would
        not require substantial change in the existing equipment or
        production techniques. Its impact outside of the industry,
        however, could be considered "epochal" in terms of eliminating
        the need for gasoline additives, reducing crude oil imports, and
        improving air quality. In contrast, downsizing has been
        incremental in terms of technology but epochal in that it
        requires major changes in capital, labor components, management,
        and organization. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">IV. Physical Description ~</font></b><a
          name="physdes"></a> </p>
      <p>The WHV is a relatively simple device, but it has a highly
        complex effect on the air and gasoline that pass through it and
        on the combustion that results. Of the 26 claims that were made
        in the two patent applications, all 26 were granted by the US
        Patent Office. It is covered by two patents each in the US and
        in 9 foreign countries (Japan, West Germany, UK, France, Italy,
        Sweden, Canada, Mexico and Brazil)(Refs. 3, 4). A related patent
        covering turbine and oil-burner applications has also been
        issued (Ref. 5) and one covering non-combustion applications
        such as spray drying, fluid-bed operation, and desalination is
        pending (Ref. 6). </p>
      <p>The valve is mounted at the intake manifold opening below the
        carburetor and throttle plate and extends down into the intake
        manifold (Figures 1 and 2). Air and gasoline are received from
        the carburetor and are directed through a slight funnel (the
        central down-tube) to promote centralized charge mixing. As
        needed, additional air can be drawn down the outer down-tube. At
        high speed or load conditions, air only is allowed into the
        outer down-tube (Figure 3). At the bottom of the central
        down-tube, the gasoline/air mixture changes direction by 90
        degrees and is directed toward the double-screen assembly that
        surrounds the valve (Figure 4). The bottom of the valve is solid
        and slightly concave to aid in the redirection of the mixture.
        Because the flow from the central tube must cross the radial
        jump space between the central tube and the screens, it
        accelerates after changing direction and strikes the screens
        with force. The screens consist of a cylindrical #50 stainless
        steel mesh (coarse) immediately followed by a #120 stainless
        steel mesh (fine). The mesh sizes are critical and so is their
        proximity; they must be in contact to maintain the appropriate
        level of turbulence and to form the matrix of thousands f
        orifices that the gasoline and air must pass through. The air
        forces the gasoline through the orifices to produce droplets of
        extremely fine diameters. Because of the lower pressure in the
        intake manifold, the high level of turbulence, and the higher
        energy level of the air, vaporization of the gasoline is
        believed to occur within a short distance after leaving the
        outer screen. Because moving air is the driving force and
        because turbulence is created by its passage through the valve,
        the gasoline vapor and air are thoroughly mixed. The radial
        structure of the screen assembly directs the gasoline/air
        mixture evenly toward the cylinders to that all receive the same
        quantity and quality of charge. </p>

      <p>The valve is automatically regulated by engine demand. A
        one-inch vacuum is maintained by a vacuum regulator which senses
        the pressure at a point above the valve (but below the
        carburetor throttle plate) and at a point below the valve in the
        intake manifold. As the accelerator is depressed and more
        gasoline and air are required, the manifold vacuum is lowered.
        The vacuum regulator senses this pressure change and relaxes
        enough to permit the valve t descend further into the manifold
        under the greater force of the increased flow of gasoline and
        air. This exposes more of the double screen to accommodate and
        to process the greater flow. Because of this variability, there
        is no restriction to the flow except for a one-inch pressure
        drop (maintained by a vacuum differential valve) which enhances
        the vaporization effect and which constitutes a restriction only
        at wide-open throttle. As the velocity of the flow diminishes
        with lower engine demand, the vacuum regulator causes the
        double-screen assembly to retract to maintain the one-inch
        differential under all speed and load conditions. </p>
      <p>The "double down-tube" is especially important to the
        performance of the valve. All of the gasoline droplets and most
        of the air from the carburetor are directed toward the center of
        the top of the valve where they are collected in a shallow
        funnel which accelerates them (through a Bernoulli Effect)
        through the center tube. As it exits the bottom of the tube, the
        gasoline/air mixture is forced outward in a radial pattern
        toward the double-screen assembly that surrounds the flow.
        Before the mixture reaches the screen, it must traverse a
        "radial jump space" across the width of the larger, outer tube.
        This causes the mixture not only to change direction by 90
        degrees but also to accelerate toward the double screens. At the
        same time, air and a very small amount of gasoline vapor descend
        under atmospheric pressure through the outer down-tube. In
        addition to providing the radial jump space that the primary
        flow must cross, this secondary flow around the center tube adds
        more turbulence when it intercepts the primary flow and greater
        volume of air when needed under high-speed or high-load
        conditions. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">V. History ~</font></b><a name="hist"></a> </p>
      <p>Development of the WHV began in 1978 when Sherwood F. Webster
        and Richard L. Heise decided to combine their knowledge and
        experience in an attempt to reduce the fuel consumption and
        pollution levels of modern internal combustion engines (Ref. 7).
        Webster had worked in this field since 1959, mainly with
        variable venturi carburetors and cold manifolds, and Heise was
        well known in the Phoenix area as a master mechanic. At the
        outset, they decided that their approach would be to atomize all
        of the fuel below the throttle plate rather than to attempt
        separation of the gasoline into its light and heavy components.
        They concluded that a cylindrical valve that could move up and
        down in the intake manifold in response to engine demand would
        be the best way to eliminate the problems that were know to
        exist with fixed systems. </p>
      <p>The problem confronting them at that point was the need to find
        a simple yet satisfactory atomizing mechanism to reduce the
        diameters of the gasoline droplets. Even though both inventors
        were familiar with the failure of single horizontal screens in
        the past, they decided to experiment with a variety of screens,
        not knowing whether any would work in their application or not.
        A test apparatus was constructed consisting of a simple venturi
        extending above the container of water in which it was immersed
        and an air compressor which directed a continuous flow of
        fast-moving air over the venturi to simulate the flow of the
        charge through an automotive carburetor. Various screen sizes
        from #50 to #250 were tried with no success. The water would
        merely run in large drops down the side of the screen onto which
        the flow was directed. After two months of screen testing, it
        was apparent to both Webster and Heise that a single screen
        would not work, as earlier inventors had already shown. In the
        process of changing from one screen size&nbsp; (#50) to another
        (#120), however, Heise accidentally held both screens together
        and noticed to his astonishment and that a totally unexpected
        phenomenon was occurring. The water was no longer falling in
        large drops on the impact side of the double screen combination,
        but the entire flow was passing through the screens in a
        virtually invisible mist. Only when a watch crystal was placed
        in the flow downstream from the screens did small droplets
        reform and become invisible, </p>
      <p>On the basis of that discovery, they added a double screen
        assembly to the valve and assumed that they had achieved a major
        breakthrough in automotive fuel conditioning. They assembled an
        early prototype of the valve and eagerly installed it on a 1972
        Chevrolet pickup truck. They were disappointed to discover that
        not only was there no apparent gain, they actually lost fuel
        economy. This setback was followed by a period of trial and
        error during which numerous modifications were tried and
        rejected as ineffective. After a succession of these failures,
        they concluded that the problem was due to the fact that the
        flow from the carburetor was not striking the screens with
        sufficient force because of the low angle of approach. To
        correct this situation, they developed the double-down tubes,
        which provided space between the bottom of the central tube and
        the double screens to force the flow to strike the screens
        directly at right angles rather than at an acute one. After
        further experimentation, they observed that the maximum effect
        appeared to occur when the pressure differential between the
        interior and the exterior of the valve was held to a constant
        one inch. A vacuum valve was used to replace the spring which
        originally controlled the action of the valve so that more
        precision could be obtained. As a result of these incremental
        improvements to the basic valve over a 6-month period, the fuel
        economy of the truck was raised by about 0.5 mpg at a time from
        12.5 mpg to 16.0 mpg with noticeably better performance,
        according to Webster and Heise. </p>
      <p>As the gains became more apparent so did the need for more
        sophisticated testing. Webster and Heise formed a corporation to
        attract the capital necessary to complete the development of the
        valve. Approximately $450,000 was raised privately, including
        $75,000 from Webster. This was used to cover the cost of
        patents, tests, vehicles, and equipment (including a complete
        dynamometer), professional services, legal fees, and travel
        (Ref. 8). Both Webster and Heise have worked exclusively on the
        development of the valve since 1978. </p>
      <p>In early 1980, after the initial development work was
        completed, the inventors asked the Ethyl Corporation to test the
        device. Webster and Heise suspected, but had not yet confirmed,
        that use of the valve reduced engine octane requirements. Their
        presumption was that Ethyl would be interested in an alternative
        to chemical octane because of the lead phasedown in gasoline
        that was underway as a result of the Clean Air Act. Ethyl agreed
        to test it at its research laboratory near Detroit (see Test 1,
        Summary of Tests). During the test at Ethyl, an octane
        requirement reduction of 10 points was established, an
        improvement in distribution was verified, and no loss of power
        was measured. (See Test 1, Summary of Tests)(Ref. 9). Ethyl
        wanted to dismantle the engine and the valve to analyze it
        further over a one-month period, which was acceptable to
        Webster-Heise, but would not agree to cover Webster-Heise’s
        expenses during the test period. As a result, Webster and Heise
        decided to use their limited funds for testing at other
        certified laboratories. </p>
      <p>In August 1980, tests were conducted at the Environmental
        Testing Corporation (ETC) near Denver, CO (an EPA-recognized
        test facility). These tests, as shown in the summary of tests,
        confirmed earlier, less complete tests that had shown gains in
        fuel economy, reduced emissions, and lower octane requirements.
        On the basis of these tests, invitations were sent to all of the
        major automobile and oil companies to attend the formal
        introduction and demonstration of the valve at ETC on October
        15, 1980. Fifteen major corporations sent representatives who
        witnesses the operation of the test car and a baseline car (see
        Test 4, Summary of Tests). EPA tests were run on both cars, and
        three different fuels were used (97-indolene, 85 pump-grade
        unleaded, and 75-octane specially blended and certified by
        Phillips Petroleum Co.). The gains demonstrated in these tests
        were consistent with the earlier tests. At the demonstration,
        John Marsh, Jr., the WH counsel (now Secretary of the Army),
        offered to license the valve to any US corporation and to
        provide a 5-year moratorium on its use in foreign cars imported
        to the US. </p>
      <p>Following the demonstration, the Standard Oil Company of Ohio
        (Sohio) expressed interest in the WHV. In arranging for further
        testing, Sohio noted (Ref. 19): </p>
      <p>"The data from these previous tests do indicate the potential
        for reduction in octane, improved fuel economy, reduced
        emission, and possibly improved driveability. Together these
        results, if realized, could represent significant value.
        Therefore, we are now exploring ways to further evaluate the
        valve." </p>
      <p>Sohio urged the Ford Motor Company to test the valve as part of
        a joint project. Ford agreed to a 3-week test, to be followed if
        successful by an 11-month testing program with the Webster-Heise
        Corporation. Ford required that Sohio not participate in the
        test and that no disclosure of data be made while the tests were
        being conducted. </p>
      <p>The tests were conducted at the Ford Laboratory in Dearborn in
        late January 1981. The baseline tests were conducted prior to
        the arrival of Webster and Heise. In the first test with the
        valve (Figures 16 and 17), significant gains were shown in
        torque and fuel economy (see Test 5, Summary of Tests). Ford was
        concerned, however, that some of these gains might be due to the
        fact that the baseline engine (without the valve) had been
        contaminated with carbon during the baseline tests (Ref. 11).
        The second test (Figure 18) was a very demanding wide-open
        throttle test. The gains of the valve in this test were also
        apparent but above 3000 rpm they dropped to the level of the
        baseline production system with heat due to the limited sized of
        the prototype valve. Webster offered to enlarge the valve to
        accommodate these testing conditions but was told that no
        modification was necessary (Ref. 12). Ford then exercised its
        option under the testing agreement to terminate the tests. Ford
        informed Webster that, "It is Ford’s opinion that the
        Webster-Heise device is not the most appropriate means of
        eliminating the necessity for carburetor heat" and that, "The
        Webster-Heise devise is not of interest to Ford at this time"
        (Ref. 13). </p>
      <p>The spark-advance test conducted at the Ethyl Corporation is a
        relatively severe engine test, although not as severe as the
        torque test at Ford and ETC, and it simulates the rapid
        acceleration sometimes encountered in normal driving. The valve
        apparently worked well in these tests, providing more fuel
        economy on low-octane gasoline than did the baseline engine. The
        early prototype valve completed the spark-advance test and did
        the same amount of work with approximately 4 inches more vacuum.
        This does not mean, however, that there was a restriction due to
        the presence of the valve (beyond the one-inch differential
        built into it). It does mean that the same work could be done at
        the same vacuum, although the effect diminishes as engine
        increases. In the spark advance tests at Ethyl, despite the
        octane and fuel economy gains, no loss of power was measured. In
        the Ford wide-open throttle test, the valve size limitation of
        the early prototype was encountered above 3000 rpm on 75 octane
        (R+M/2) gasoline. In order to accommodate these extreme
        conditions, a second-generation prototype was made 30% larger,
        so that it could descend further into the intake manifold under
        full throttle and expose more screen area to prevent any
        unwanted pressure drop. The vacuum differential at full throttle
        is about one inch due to the presence of the valve (not to be
        confused with the vacuum created by the throttle plate at lower
        rpm)(See Test 6, Summary of Tests). Despite the presence of
        manifold heat in Test 6, both the torque and fuel economy gains
        were substantial. </p>
      <p>In order to fully evaluate the new, larger prototype, Webster
        and Heise decided to test it on a new state-of-the-art
        automobile with electronic carburetion (which maintains a
        relatively constant air/fuel ratio) and the latest pollution
        controls. A 1982 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme was purchased and a
        complete baseline test prior to conversion was made at the
        Environmental Testing Corporation. The jacketed design of the
        Oldsmobile intake manifold, they discovered, was not amenable to
        heat removal. They also found that the design of the exhaust gas
        recirculation (EGR) equipment did not allow for adjustment (less
        was needed to control NOx with the WHV) without altering other
        calibration in the closed-loop system. Without the volumetric
        efficiency gains from a cooler manifold and with the higher EGR,
        they were concerned that their gains might be reduced,
        particularly torque and NOx. The test (Test 6, Summary of
        Tests), however, showed significant gains over baseline, even
        with 75-octane fuel instead of 97-octane. NOx decreased 45%
        despite a larger spark advance, and other emissions also
        declined. Fuel economy increased from 31.4 mpg to 35.6 mpg, well
        above the EPA highway standard. Torque was also significantly
        increased. To confirm these results, the test was run again with
        the same (and in some cases even better) results. The emissions
        were even rechecked on another computer to verify readings.
        Webster-Heise concluded from this test that in an optimized
        engine (with a cooler manifold and less EGR) even greater gains
        might be achieved (Ref. 14). </p>

      <p>The Webster-Heise Corporation makes several claims for its
        valve and offers data from several tests (see Summary of Tests)
        in support of its claims. It is claimed by Webster-Heise that
        the valve does the following: </p>
      <p>1. Reduces engine octane requirements by 10 or more points; </p>
      <p>2. Reduces gasoline consumption by as much as 40%; </p>
      <p>3. Reduces the formation of nitric oxides (NOx) by as much as

      <p>9. Requires no maintenance. </p>
      <p>Some automotive engineers, among others, are skeptical. Their
        concerns include the following: </p>
      <p>1. The pressure drop resulting from the presence of the screen
        could result in a power drop; </p>
      <p>2. The reduction in manifold heating could be a problem in
        sub-zero operation and could cause an increase in HC emissions;
      </p>
      <p>3. It might "gunk up" over time and be rendered inoperable.; </p>
      <p>4. There are more appropriate methods in development to achieve
        the same gains. </p>
      <p>These points, both pro and con, are addressed individually in
        more details in the sections on pre-combustion, combustion, and
        post-combustion effects. Overall, there is not enough evidence,
        based on the number of tests, to be considered conclusive. </p>
      <p>General Motors and Chrysler have reportedly expressed interest
        in the valve but have conducted no formal tests. R.M. Hokanson,
        the Chrysler representative at the ETC test on October 15, 1980,
        made a positive recommendation to his company (Ref. 15): </p>
      <p>"I think this device has merit for our company and recommend
        that we investigate the possibility of testing this device on
        our products as soon as possible." </p>
      <p>Despite recommendations such as these, no further testing has
        been done by any of the auto or oil companies. Most of the major
        oil companies have already made substantial investments in
        facilities to make premium unleaded gasoline. This product is
        more profitable (while it is in short supply) than the other
        grades of gasoline and cannot be readily made by many
        independent refiners. The market for high-octane unleaded
        gasoline is growing faster than any other grade because the
        octane requirement of cars increases as engine deposits
        accumulate. If all cars could use the same low-octane gasoline,
        it could make obsolete many of the existing facilities built at
        great cost by the majors. It could also eliminate the need for
        expensive octane additives and could improve the competitive
        position of the independents with respect to the major oil
        companies. Use of the valve, however, could also save the majors
        large investments in additional reforming facilities that might
        far outweigh these competitive aspects. </p>
      <p>One problem that Webster-Heise could expect to encounter on the
        long path to acceptance would be that of competing technologies.
        All of the major automotive companies have invested large
        amounts of effort and capital in devices that may not be
        compatible with the WHV. Fuel injection has become increasingly
        popular as a means of restoring some performance and diesels
        have found favor as a means of improving fuel economy. Some
        companies have committed considerable resources to these
        approaches and may prefer to continue them rather than to adopt
        a new device. Others may conclude that in the medium term (3 to
        8 years) other approaches might be more competitive. In
        addition, most auto companies have research projects of long
        standing that they may feel a need to protect from a competing
        device. It may be that the WHV will be found to improve the
        in-house projects as well. It has been suggested, for example,
        that the valve could be useful on a spark-assisted diesel. If
        so, companies that have shown a strong interest in dieselization
        may find this development to be complementary rather than
        contradictory. In any event, the reaction of the auto companies
        to this device could be expected to vary considerably depending
        on their own individual interests and priorities. </p>
      <p>Another barrier of considerable significance is the
        not-invented-here syndrome. There is a strong preference in the
        auto industry to use ideas invented in-house. Innovation from
        outside the industry must compete with these projects in which
        an investment has already been made. In house projects that
        address the same problem will generally be given preference, if
        for no better reason than that the companies are already
        familiar with them and have databases for them. It is also
        possible that having been shown that a type of improvement is
        possible, they may seek some other means of achieving similar
        gains without employing a particular technology purchased from
        outside. </p>
      <p>Because of the high cost of automotive testing, the valve has
        been tested on a limited number of test vehicles under a limited
        range of circumstances. As a result the database is not as large
        as most would like. The more data that becomes available, the
        stronger are the conclusions that can be drawn. Enough data has
        been obtained to demonstrate the promise of the valve, but not
        enough has been collected to erase all doubt among those who
        might risk large sums and professional reputations in developing
        and introducing the valve in mass-produced vehicles. It would
        clearly benefit from further testing, especially in actual road
        operation. </p>
      <p>The cost of obtaining the rights to manufacture the WHV for use
        on new automobile engines may or may not inhibit its acceptance.
        The Webster-Heise Corporation has expressed willingness to
        accept "standard and customary" royalty followed in the domestic
        auto industry. That would consist of 5% of the manufacturer’s
        invoice cost for the first million valves, 4% for the second
        million, 4% for the third million, and 2% for all subsequent
        production (Ref. 16). </p>
      <p>The response of the auto companies to date has been
        noncommittal. Only one company, Ford, has formally decided not
        to use the valve. Others may or may not; they have apparently
        not decided. Whether or not it will be accepted at all by the
        domestic auto industry is currently uncertain. If that proves to
        be the case, then foreign auto companies (who have reportedly
        expressed interest in the valve) may choose to pursue the
        necessary additional testing and development. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">VII. Potential Benefits ~</font></b><a
          name="benef"></a> </p>
      <p>The tests which have been conducted so far indicate that the
        WHV could have a significant beneficial impact on several major
        issues. The potential benefits described in this section are
        based on the assumptions that the demonstrated gains, which so
        far are suggestive but not conclusive, will be further
        substantiated in additional tests and that the use of the valve
        would be widespread. If that proves to be the case, then a
        substantial reduction in crude oil requirements may be possible
        at the refinery level. In addition, greater fuel economy in
        valve-equipped engines might lower the need for crude oil even
        more. To the extent that the valve can reduce the emission of
        pollutants and the need for toxic or carcinogenic additives to
        gasoline, air quality could be improved. If the valve proves to
        be a major advance in increasing the fuel economy and
        performance of modern internal combustion engines, it could be a
        major technological breakthrough that could attract new interest
        to domestic automobiles and increase the competitiveness of the
        US auto industry. </p>
      <p><b>A. Refinery Feedstock Conservation ~</b> </p>
      <p>One of the problems facing refineries is the need to increase
        octane and to make increasing amounts of unleaded gasoline,
        especially premium unleaded, as the use of lead is phased out.
        The manufacture of unleaded gasoline has proven to be a costly
        process in terms of the extra crude oil consumed in making it
        and of the reconfiguration necessary to increase its octane
        above the 82 or 83 level that it has when it comes straight from
        the fractionating tower. The extra processing used to make
        unleaded fuels consumes about 9.2% more crude oil than does
        straight-run gasoline, according to the Ethyl Corporation (Ref.
        17). The HCs used to increase the octane levels have many other
        uses in the petrochemical industry and their allocations have
        been a source of concern during oil supply emergencies. </p>
      <p>The high cost of making premium unleaded gasoline, for which
        demand is increasing faster than for any other gasoline type,
        has placed the independent refiners at a competitive
        disadvantage to the major oil companied. Because the refining
        industry has been depressed and profits have been limited or
        nonexistent in recent years, most investors have been reluctant
        to lend the capital needed to build the octane improvement
        facilities necessary to compete with the majors for a
        significant share of the premium unleaded market. The majors
        have had considerably more financial flexibility in upgrading
        their production facilities during this period. As a result only
        the majors, to a large extent, are able to make the high-octane
        unleaded gasoline that will perform satisfactorily in new cars
        after engine deposits accumulate and their octane requirements
        increase. In the US, there are 115 refineries (nearly 40% of the
        total) that lack the catalytic reformers needed to make unleaded
        gasoline, and all of these have capacities of 48,000 b/d or less
        (Ref. 18). This is a major reason for the independent refiners’
        desire to have allowable lead levels in gasoline increased
        despite strong environmental opposition to that proposal. Lead
        is preferred by refiners because it is the least costly octane
        enhancer currently available. The Lundberg Letter recently
        observed that, "The emergence of premium unleaded allows regular
        unleaded to drop in octane, and refinery profitability to be
        enhanced" (Ref. 19). </p>
      <p>If the entire fleet of automobiles in the US could use gasoline
        10 octane points lower than that currently sold with no
        offsetting losses in fuel economy, performance, or emissions, it
        would greatly reduce the crude oil requirement of the refining
        industry, eliminate the need for large capital investments in
        facilities, improve the competitive position of small refiners,
        and reduce the cost of making acceptable fuels for new cars. </p>
      <p>In its analysis of the potential impact of the WHV on refining,
        the PACE company, well known for its consulting and engineering
        work for the refining industry, reached the following conclusion
        (Ref. 20): </p>
      <p>"When we evaluated the impact of a 10 octane (R+M/s) reduction
        in our 1990 base case, over 600,000 b/d less crude oil were
        required to meet the product slate. This reduction is due to
        fuel savings in the refinery based on the assumption that the
        fuel quality was reduced and less processing was needed. If
        further efficiency can be gained through fuel/engine
        optimization, savings would be greater." </p>
      <p>PACE also noted that the production of lower-octane gasoline
        could use components, such as naptha, which have clear octanes
        of 40 to 65 and which are normally surplus for many refiners. </p>
      <p>The objective, according to PACE, should be (Ref. 21): </p>
      <p>"...To simultaneously minimize fuel consumed in the engine and
        the refinery. Most of the refinery fuel saved in our analysis
        occurs in about the first 5 octane number reduction, thus the
        optimum engine to take advantage of octane in this range would
        result in maximum miles per barrel of crude." </p>
      <p>PACE also identified seven areas of refining that would be
        helped by the production of low-octane gasoline that could be
        used in engines equipped with the WHV (Ref. 22): </p>
      <p>1. Reforming feed rates and severities would be reduced; </p>
      <p>2. Processing severity would be decreased and per-barrel
        utilization of crude oil would be increased; </p>
      <p>3. The need for hydrocracking would be decreased; </p>
      <p>4. The need for alternate blendstocks would be decreased; </p>
      <p>5. The availability for aromatics would be increased; </p>
      <p>6. The need for liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) would be
        reduced; and </p>
      <p>7. The need for octane additives would be eliminated. </p>
      <p><b>B. End-Use Fuel Conservation ~</b> </p>
      <p>As indicated in the section on fuel economy, the improvements
        in fuel economy with the WHV vary with the type of driving and
        other factors. The range of improvement is about 10 to 20%, with
        15% possibly representative of the average improvement that
        could be expected in normal driving. Of the valve were in use in
        all of the cars in the US and if the best-case improvement of
        20% were realized, the daily savings in gasoline consumption
        could be approximately 1.3 million b/d. At the worst case
        improvement of 10%, the demand for gasoline could be reduced by
        650,000 b/d. This, combined with the fuel conservation at the
        refineries, could yield total savings of more than 1.25 million
        b/d (37% of total crude oil imports in the second quarter of
        1982 and 79% of the crude oil imports from OPEC during that
        period)(Ref. 23). </p>
      <p>Because several years would probably be required for all of the
        vehicles in the fleet to be equipped with the valve, the
        reduction in gasoline consumption would be gradual as the number
        of cars using it increase. Nearly a decade would probably be
        required for most of the fuel economy improvement to be
        realized. This could be accelerated, however, if the market
        acceptance of new valve-equipped cars were to exceed the normal
        rate of replacement. The primary point of introduction would
        most likely be in new cars, but retrofitting old ones is also a
        possibility. If the engine deposits were removed, most older
        cars cold probably use the valve. Cars 5 years old or newer
        might require a change in EPA regulations preventing changes to
        an engine once it is certified. </p>
      <p><b>C. Air Quality ~</b> </p>
      <p>The emission improvements indicated with the valve could become
        a major factor in the debate over air quality in general and
        gasoline lead levels in particular. Lead and other additives
        such as aromatics (benzene and others) are either toxic or
        carcinogenic and pose a public health threat (Ref. 24). Reducing
        automotive pollution is of major importance in achieving better
        air quality because it is responsible for approximately 50%
        collectively of all the HC, CO, and NOx that are emitted each
        year (Ref. 25). A substantial reduction in these automotive
        emissions could greatly improve air quality, particularly in
        urban areas where concentrations of pollutants are especially
        high. </p>
      <p>The automobile industry has made substantial progress in
        pollution control, but the results have been achieved at a high
        cost to the consumer. Performance has been sacrificed in many
        models in order to achieve lower emissions and higher fuel
        economy in new cars. The control devices themselves (such as
        dual-bed converters) can become clogged or contaminated and can
        cease to function properly. When they malfunction, the pollution
        levels can rise to extremely high levels and in some rare cases
        can prevent restarting once the engine is stopped. Because the
        controls can be troublesome and sometimes do not work well
        enough to get through the EPA certification process, the
        automakers must occasionally ask for emission wavers. In
        addition, these controls are relatively complex and add up to
        $600 to the cost of new cars (Ref. 26). </p>
      <p>Much of the controversy is currently focused on lead because
        the independent refiners have asked that the lead levels allowed
        in gasoline be raised. This request, if granted, would permit
        them to increase the octane ratings of their gasolines so that
        they could compete at lower cost with the major oil companies.
        The majors, however, contend that the exemptions gave the small
        refiners (and blenders who are not mentioned at all in the
        regulations) a competitive advantage and, as a result, the
        special exemption should be removed entirely (Ref. 27). The
        independent refiners, however, claim that they cannot afford the
        average investment of $10 to $20 million each for the reformers
        necessary to chemically raise the octanes of their unleaded
        gasolines (Ref. 28). </p>
      <p>Extensive testimony was received by Congress on the subject,
        most of it strongly against weakening of the lead standards.
        Very little support was offered for eliminating the standards
        completely. A cost-benefit analysis prepared by the EPA did not
        support an easing of the lead levels, estimating that
        elimination of the standard would save the refining industry
        $100 million per year but would cost between $140 million and
        $1.4 billion per year to treat an additional 200,00 to 500,000
        children for the lead poisoning that would be caused by the
        higher lead levels (Ref. 29). An EPA official recently said in a
        memorandum that lead air pollution monitors had repeatedly
        underestimated the lead content of air because they were located
        "at sites which were not designed to measure maximum lead
        concentrations" (Ref. 30). </p>
      <p>NOx is best known as the principal cause of smog, but it is
        also an important factor in acid rain. The importance of NOx in
        the debate over acid rain was summarized in a report for the
        Canadian Embassy (Ref. 31): </p>
      <p>"NOx currently is responsible for approximately one-fourth to
        one-third of the acid rain -- but this proportion is expected to
        increase over the next two decades. In parts of the West, NOx is
        already the major contributor to acid rain. If current trends
        continue, by 1990 NOx-caused rain could equal or exceed the acid
        rain caused today by SO<sub>2</sub>. </p>
      <p>"NOx pollution also is associated with the production of ozone.
        High levels of ozone cause crop damage, forest damage and a
        number of respiratory problems. Ozone, like acid rain, is a
        product of atmospheric chemistry acting on pollutants. It, too,
        is principally a trans-boundary pollutant; most of the damage is
        done outside the state or province where the NOx originates. </p>
      <p>"NOx from metropolitan centers along the Pacific Coast is being
        deposited hundreds of miles to the east in the Sierras and
        Rockies in the form of nitric acid-contaminated rain or snow.
        Studies published in Science magazine show that precipitation
        with 4.6 pH (at least 5 times normal acidity) is occurring
        frequently in parts of Colorado. Mountain lakes in Colorado and
        California are becoming acidic, with local residents concerned
        about potentially adverse consequences for the tourism and
        recreation industries." </p>
      <p>Most of the emission standards promulgated under the Clean Air
        Act of 1970 are under pressure for revision. Under the Act, the
        1971 NOx levels were supposed to be reduced by 1976, but
        subsequent administrative and legislative actions have delayed
        the deadlines for NOx, CO (a poisonous gas), and HC (which can
        be carcinogenic). The current NOx standard of 1 gram per mile
        would probably provide for a steady reduction in NOx over the
        next decade but, if the auto industry request for a relaxation
        of the standard to 2 grams per mile were granted, there would
        probably be no decrease but a slight increase instead (Ref. 32).
        The industry, on the other hand, claims that these reductions
        would allow them to save billions of dollars in "unnecessary
        controls" which cold be used to increase the competitiveness of
        their products and which might not have a substantial effect on
        the environment and human health. The standard for HC is 0.41
        gram per mile, and for CO is 3.4 grams per mile. </p>
      <p>Data from initial tests of the WHV suggest that its widespread
        use could make possible a solution to this
        economic/environmental impasse. Because of the substantial
        reduction of NOx and CO (and HC to a lesser extent), the
        stricter standards could be met with existing equipment. It is
        very possible that some pollution controls could even be removed
        outright or replaced with less expensive ones. The dual-bed
        converter and closed-loop feedback systems, for example,
        probably could be removed in favor of simpler pre-1981 systems
        (Ref. 33). A smaller, less expensive converter might be
        possible, and some controls such as knock sensors probably could
        be eliminated. Even though some catalytic conversion and exhaust
        recirculation would still be required, it may be possible to
        reduce the cost of necessary emission controls by about $300 per
        car (Ref. 34). This could more than offset the cost of the WHV,
        which almost certainly would cost less than $100 each. </p>
      <p><b>D. Competitiveness of the US Auto Industry ~</b> </p>
      <p>The US auto industry is in trouble. Since the turn of the
        century, it has had a vital place in the economy; its success
        and its productive genius have long been a source of national
        pride. For a number of reasons, including increased concerns
        over fuel economy and air quality and the pressure from low-cost
        high-quality imports, the domestic industry has serious problems
        to overcome. </p>
      <p>The importance of the industry to the economy is well known.
        Employment in 1978 was 14 million people, about one-fifth of all
        the jobs in the nation (Ref. 35). Indirectly, many more people
        in other industries rely on sales to the auto industry and on
        purchases by its workers. It is not surprising, therefore, that
        the current depression in that industry has been a great setback
        for the economy in general. In 1980, auto production was the
        lowest it had been in 20 years, while auto imports (mainly from
        Japan and Germany) were at record highs. In that year, the
        industry lost $4.2 billion, the largest loss in its history, and
        severe losses have been experienced in 1981 and 1982. </p>
      <p>Compounding the problem for the auto industry is its need to
        meet this competition by investing in new models at a time when
        it can least afford to do so. The severe monetary losses have
        not only cut into income but also into company reserves. Faced
        with dwindling reserves, limited cash flow, and record-high
        interest rates in a highly competitive market, the industry is
        clearly in a dilemma. The industry has repeatedly recognized the
        need for innovation in its struggle for economic viability in
        the face of strong competition from foreign manufacturers. As
        the National Research Council and the National Academy of
        Engineering point out in their report on the competitive status
        of the US auto industry (Ref. 36): </p>
      <p>"The transformation of the auto industry from a mature,
        technologically quiet industry into a hotbed of innovation and
        change creates opportunities for US firms to attain competitive
        advantages through development of radically new products. The
        same, however, can be said of the Japanese and the Europeans.
        Whether US-based production regains lost market share by
        creating and exploiting new markets depends on its ability to
        "out innovate" its competitors." </p>
      <p>The least costly path to recovery would be for the auto
        industry to make the most efficient use of existing equipment
        and tooling while buying time to develop more advanced lines.
        The WHV, if proven successful and if accepted by the industry,
        could easily be adapted to most new cars at little or no
        additional cost because unnecessary equipment probably could
        then be removed. The only engine that it cold not be used on are
        those that do not have intake manifolds for the fuel such as
        port fuel-injection and some diesel engines. It might also be
        necessary to replace some intake manifolds that have baffles
        with simpler, straighter manifolds to increase the opportunity
        for thorough mixing of the gasoline vapor and air. Because it is
        self-regulated by engine demand, the same size valve could be
        used on a maker’s entire line of engines, thereby minimizing
        production costs. Test data indicates that the valve could be
        expected to increase&nbsp; fuel economy and torque, to lower
        emissions and octane requirements, and to improve driveability,
        while possible saving the maker (and ultimately the consumer)
        about $200 per car. Lower engine maintenance costs and operating
        expenses, if realized across the fleet, could also be expected
        to increase buyer interest in new cars equipped with the valve.
      </p>
      <p>When the valve was formally introduced to the automobile and
        oil industries on October 15, 1980, the Webster-Heise
        Corporation made an interesting proposal. It offered to grant US
        automakers a head start by preventing for 5 years the use of the
        valve on foreign cars imported to the US. If accepted, this
        could be expected to have the effect of shifting buyer interest
        away from the imports and toward the domestic models. The
        increased performance and lower operating cost of the modified
        domestic cars would probably increase their appeal in the
        marketplace. If that proved to be the case, then it is possible
        that the WHV could enhance the competitiveness of the US auto
        industry. </p>
      <p><b>VII. Is There A Federal Role?</b><a name="fed"></a> </p>
      <p>In a market economy, improvements in automotive technology are
        normally the province of private enterprise. Such innovation is
        a matter of entrepreneurial decision and risk; it ultimately
        succeeds or fails in the crucible of the competitive
        marketplace. This process, to which virtually all products and
        services are subject, is constant and pervasive. The Federal
        role, in theory and to a somewhat lesser extent in practice, is
        largely to be a rational consumer in this market and to regulate
        the marketplace in such a way that competition operates to the
        benefit of society. Occasionally, however, the Federal
        Government intervenes to accomplish certain consensus national
        goals. There are, therefore, cases both for and against Federal
        encouragement of the WHV. </p>
      <p>Federal options in this matter include (a) no Federal action,
        (b) Federal laboratory testing of the valve in the wide range of
        vehicles and circumstances necessary for commercial utilization
        and publication of the results, and (c) Federal field testing of
        the valve by installation in a working fleet of Government
        vehicles over an extended period with published results. </p>
      <p>The case for Federal action along the lines of (b) or (c) might
        be summarized as follows: </p>
      <p>1. There is reason to believe that the market is working
        imperfectly in this case with the result that full testing and
        introduction of the valve is being prevented or delayed and
        consumers are being denied its benefits. </p>
      <p>2. Significant progress in meeting certain important national
        goals is being frustrated by corporate timidity or an
        unfortunate confluence of market forces with respect to the
        Webster-Heise technology. The national interests being
        frustrated are: </p>
      <p>a. Fuel self-sufficiency; </p>
      <p>b. Reduction of severe balance-of-trade deficits; </p>
      <p>c. Competitiveness of the US auto industry; </p>
      <p>d. Environmental health and well-being; </p>
      <p>e. Reduction of inflation. </p>
      <p>3. The potential social benefits if this technology far
        outweigh the market rewards to be reasonably expected by auto
        manufacturers or commercial users of the WHV. For this reason,
        it is justifiable in theory and in practice that society
        (through the Federal Government) share in the cost of
        development and testing. </p>
      <p>4. The cost of Federal laboratory or field testing is small
        relative to the potential benefits. Tests might be conducted on
        the Postal Service fleet, where a large body of information
        could be obtained on a wide variety of vehicles. Other Federally
        sponsored tests might be conducted by the NASA, EPA, DOT, and
        DOE, all of which have conducted similar tests in the past. </p>
      <p>The case against Federal intervention with respect to the WHV
        might include the following: </p>
      <p>1. The market is not working imperfectly in this case. The
        Webster-Heise technology has been in the marketplace for only
        two years; substantial testing has occurred and the results are
        known to a limited extent in the industry; much about the valve
        remains unknown and corporate decision-making is in progress. </p>
      <p>2. All of the claimed societal benefits rest on the assumption
        that the technology works as claimed and that it would be
        practically and economically applicable to mass production and
        use. Similar societal benefits were or could have been argued
        over the past 50 years for scores of device which failed or had
        negative offsets in practical application. </p>
      <p>3. Market acceptance of the Webster-Heise technology also rests
        upon its not being preempted by other technologies designed to
        achieve similar automotive goals; toward these ends a
        considerable research effort is currently underway both here and
        abroad. This is a matter for testing and decision-making in the
        marketplace without preferential government intervention. </p>
      <p>4. Whether or not the market fully reflects the potential
        social benefits of this technology, if it works as claimed and
        is competitively superior to the other approaches, there is more
        than ample incentive for entrepreneurial venture investment. If
        the leading automotive and engine makers and users show
        reticence to being testing there may also be cause for reticence
        on the part of the Federal Government to subsidize testing when
        there are other technologies competing for market acceptance. </p>
