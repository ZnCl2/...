    <blockquote>&nbsp; <br>
      <b>A. Pre-Combustion Effects</b>
      <p><b>1. Gasoline Vaporization ~</b> </p>
      <p>Gasoline will burn only as a vapor. For that reason, all
        engines attempt to vaporize gasoline prior to combustion,
        sometimes achieving as much as 60% vaporization with the rest of
        the gasoline in the form of droplets ranging in diameter from 20
        to 100 microns or more. These liquid droplets, along with the
        vapor and air, are introduced into the combustion chamber and
        burn incompletely, often producing detonation (engine knock),
        carbon deposits, high emissions, unequal distribution to and
        within the cylinders, and lower than optimum fuel economy.
        Engines that have achieved 60% vaporization prior to combustion
        have done so by using exhaust heat to obtain high temperatures
        in the intake manifold (over 240° F). These high temperatures
        can increase the vaporization of gasoline by boiling it to the
        60% level, but they have the associated disadvantage of
        decreasing volumetric efficiency. Fuel injection is a technique
        used by the auto industry to increase volumetric efficiency by
        using cooler air but, because injected fuel has very little time
        to vaporize and mix with the air in the cylinder, the timing
        must be retarded with a consequent loss in fuel economy. The
        optimum solution to this problem is to vaporize the gasoline at
        low temperature (around 130° F, the ambient temperature of the
        air entering the manifold) so that the negative effects of high
        temperature are not a factor. This, however, had not proven
        practical prior to development of the WHV, although it had been
        demonstrated experimentally by GM in single-cylinder engine
        tests in the mid-1970s (Ref. 37). </p>
      <p>In order to convert a liquid (such as gasoline) to a gas, a
        considerable amount of energy is necessary to break the forces
        that hold the liquid together (Ref. 38). The amount of energy
        required is determined by the magnitude of the intermolecular
        forces to be overcome. Generally, the components having higher
        boiling ranges have higher chemical energy contents. In the case
        of gasoline, this is complicated by the fact that it has at
        least 16 different components, each with its own boiling point
        under standard conditions (Figure 5). It is not necessary,
        however, to heat gasoline to its final boiling point in order to
        achieve full vaporization. As long as the dew point of the
        gasoline (determined by the air/fuel ratio of the mixture, the
        fuel composition, and the inlet manifold pressure) is below the
        manifold temperature, then the fuel can be vaporized and evenly
        distributed (Ref. 39). </p>

      </center>
      <p>Because the heavier components of gasoline do not vaporize as
        readily as the lighter ones (because of their higher boiling
        points), there is a substantial amount of "heavy ends"
        (approximately 50% of the gasoline by weight) which is normally
        admitted to the combustion chamber as droplets (figure 6). There
        they coat the piston heads and cylinder walls and burn unevenly
        and incompletely, leading to crankcase dilution and
        contamination, engine deposits, gum and varnish formation, and
        spark plug fouling. The liquid gasoline gets past the rings and
        into the crankcase where it dilutes the oil and reduces its
        viscosity. The crankcase dilution is aggravated by the low
        engine operating temperatures associated with cold weather,
        especially in stop-and-go driving where engine temperatures do
        not reach levels high enough to evaporate the gasoline that is
        diluting the oil (Ref. 42). This promotes engine wear, poor
        performance, and high emissions. It has been widely suggested
        that if the volatility of these heavy ends could somehow be
        increased, then these negative effects would be greatly
        diminished (Ref. 43). </p>
      <p>The importance of vaporization of the fuel to the engine
        performance is shown in Figure 7. In a standard engine, cold
        start problems are common and even as it warms up, the engine is
        subjected to stalling, carburetor icing, dilution, and engine
        deposits. If the vaporization level were about 95% of the intake
        mixture and the temperature in the intake manifold maintained at
        a level above 125° F (both are conditions which apply in
        Webster-Heise modifications), then the engine should operate in
        a zone of maximum power, smoothness, and economy under all speed
        and load demands. </p>

          Performance (Ref. 44)</b> </p>

      </center>
      <p>The heat energy required to convert gasoline from the liquid to
        the gaseous state with no temperature change is called the
        latent heat of vaporization. The heat is transferred by both
        conduction and convection of energy between adjacent molecules
        (Ref. 45). Vaporization of gasoline may be accomplished,
        therefore, by increasing its manifold temperature (as in
        standard engines) or by lowering the pressure, by increasing the
        surface area of the droplets by forming more of them and
        reducing their diameters, and by increasing the heat transfer
        (as in the WHV). To obtain lower emissions, greater power, lower
        octane requirements, and greater fuel economy, it is far more
        effective to reduce manifold pressure and to increase heat
        transfer to the gasoline rather than to increase temperature. </p>
      <p>At standard atmospheric pressure and temperature, some vapor
        will evolve from gasoline and given enough time the gasoline
        will evaporate completely. Because the pressure in the intake
        manifold is far less than one atmosphere (due to the vacuum
        created in the cylinders by the pumping action of the pistons
        and by the one-inch pressure drop caused the double screens),
        the boiling point of gasoline is lowered substantially (Ref.
        46). At reduced pressure, latent heat is rapidly transferred to
        the hydrocarbon molecules by the large number of air molecules
        surrounding each fuel droplet, resulting in partial evaporation.
        If finely atomized gasoline is heated by the intake air in a
        zone of lower pressure (the partial vacuum of the intake
        manifold), it will undergo differential vaporization (rapid
        vaporization due to the sudden drop in pressure)(Ref. 47). This
        is the process at work in the WHV (Figure 8). </p>
      <p><b>Figure 8 ~ Evaporation of Gasoline</b> (Differential
        evaporation begins at 125° F because the screens in the valve
        act as a nozzle matrix that creates low pressure streams of
        turbulent, high energy air and atomized fuel. The air
        temperature in the intake manifold does not exceed 130° F. Also
        note that vaporization with the WHV takes place in a fraction of
        a second whereas the theoretical evaporation curve is not
        time-limited. Source: Webster-Heise Corporation.) </p>

      <p>The WHV allows the throttle plate to be closed to a greater
        degree than in a standard engine at the same speed and load. The
        valve adds one inch of Hg to the intake manifold vacuum and the
        throttle can add another 4 to 5 inches for a total vacuum that
        is 5 or 6 inches higher than standard at the same low speeds or
        loads. The vacuum decreases as the engine speed increases and,
        at wide-open throttle, the vacuum difference is reduced to one
        inch (See test 6, Summary of tests) because the vacuum due to
        throttling is no longer present. A differential of that size
        reduces the fuel/air ration mixture density ratio. In a standard
        engine, this would normally create a small power loss, but in
        the WH modification this facilitates vaporization and is
        apparently more than offset by a variety of combustion benefits
        and by greater volumetric efficiency. Although the density
        effect diminishes with higher speeds and loads as the vacuum
        decreases, there are marked benefits at low and moderate speeds
        and loads. These include an effective reduction in compression
        ratio, contributing to the tolerance for low-octane fuels. </p>
      <p>The higher manifold vacuum created by the partial closing of
        the throttle enhances the vaporization of the fuel. More
        complete vaporization increases the evenness of fuel
        distribution to the cylinders and provides a more complete burn.
        Fuel consumption at a given speed is reduced in near proportion
        to the density ratio. Lower fuel consumption also reduces
        exhaust emissions. HC and CO are further reduced because the
        fuel is more completely vaporized before combustion. The lower
        effective compression reduces combustion peak temperatures and
        correspondingly reduces the formation of NOx. Early tests
        suggest that torque is enhanced by the better vaporization and
        distribution of the fuel. Further quantification of this effect
        on work output, engine speed, and fuel requirements would be
        valuable in assessing the performance of the valve. </p>
      <p>According to the Webster-Heise Corporation, the valve has
        several features that are unique, without any of which it would
        not be effective. The valve, in self-regulated response to
        engine demand, moves up and down in the intake manifold. This is
        a critical characteristic because without the ability to
        sufficiently vary the screen area exposed to the air/fuel flow
        as needed there would be a restriction that would impede the
        flow of air and fuel and would result in a power drop. For
        decades single fixed screens have been tried, without success,
        to increase fuel vaporization, but because they were fixed they
        were optimized for only one power requirement. For all other
        states they actually constituted restriction that were worse
        than no screen at all. Because there was only one screen
        involved, there was also no control over the scale or intensity
        of the turbulence produced. </p>
      <p>The WHV differs from these early attempts in that it consists
        of two stainless steel screens pressed together, a coarse
        stainless steel mesh (#50) followed immediately by a fine mesh
        (#120). The openings in the two adjacent screens constitute a
        series of thousands of micronozzles that force the liquid into
        small droplets (well under 10 microns in diameter) which quickly
        and totally vaporize within a few inches of the outer screens
        because of three improvements in the quality of the air that
        occur when it passes through the double screens: </p>
      <p>1. more internal energy (from impingement and compression); </p>
      <p>2. lower pressure (because of the Bernoulli Effect resulting
        from the air passing through the nozzles); and </p>
      <p>3. greater intensity of turbulence (due to the small orifice
        sizes). </p>
      <p>The screens must be tightly pressed together or the scale of
        turbulence will not be great enough and the rapid vaporization
        effect will be lost. The vaporization effect diminishes rapidly,
        and may be lost altogether, if the mesh sizes are varied by more
        than a few numbers. Very little variation in design can be
        tolerated in either case if maximum vaporization is to occur.
        Recent experiments suggest that even greater results may be
        obtained if one of the screens is rotated 45 degrees (in the
        same plane) with respect to the other so than the openings of
        the two screens are completely random and not in registration. </p>
      <p>Another important factor in the operation of the valve is the
        "radial jump space" near the bottom of the valve. The air and
        fuel droplets are accelerated as they pass through the jump
        space and impinge on the vertical screens and are compressed as
        they enter he matrix, at which time much of their kinetic energy
        is converted into internal energy. </p>
      <p>Flow through double screens of different mesh sizes is the
        equivalent of flow through a number of orifices or nozzles (a
        nozzle matrix)(Ref. 48). The pressure drop across the screens is
        controlled by a vacuum valve at a level of about one inch of
        mercury, although the pressure drop on the outer surface of the
        screen may be much greater (for a very short distance downstream
        from the valve) because of the relatively high vacuum that is
        created between each of the nozzle jets. The change in pressure
        is apparently sufficient to permit differential vaporization.
        Although the one-inch pressure drop is a slight restriction, it
        has the effect of reducing fuel consumption. The small negative
        effect that the one-inch pressure drop has on torque is more
        than offset by the greater density and combustibility of the
        charge in the cylinders (cool air mixed thoroughly with gasoline
        vapor) and the improved distribution to the weak cylinders. The
        greater mass of air available for expansion and the more
        favorable timing result in a net increase in available torque,
        despite the slightly higher vacuum. </p>
      <p>Droplet size increases with the square of the orifice diameter
        (Ref. 49). The orifices in the WHV are exceptionally small,
        0.0046 inches square or smaller. An orifice this size induces
        three times as much heat transfer as an orifice 0.008 inches in
        diameter (Ref. 50). Because the air is moving faster than the
        fuel droplets inside the valve, its high velocity can readily
        penetrate the liquid as it forms a film on the inner screen,
        producing the necessary turbulence and energy transfer to finely
        atomize the fuel (Ref. 51) Upon exiting the outer screen,
        transverse shear forces are set up by the intersecting sprays,
        which work in conjunction with the rapid drop in pressure to
        cause the fuel to vaporize. Before passing through the screen,
        the fuel is deposited as a film on the coarse mesh openings by
        turbulence within the valve. It is then accelerated through the
        smaller micronozzles (fine mesh), and then sheared by the other
        existing streams on the outside of the valve. This is important
        because only a slight reduction in droplet size causes a marked
        increase in fractional evaporation (Ref. 52). Small droplets
        evaporate virtually instantaneously, and a large proportion of
        the evaporation is accomplished during the deceleration of the
        droplets (Ref. 53). The diameters of the droplets exiting the
        valve are uniformly very small, probably less then 20% the size
        of the smallest droplets produced by the carburetor. Because of
        the droplet small diameters and the conditions created both
        inside and outside of the valve, most of the gasoline apparently
        vaporizes almost instantly (within 0.2-2.0 inches from the
        valve) at temperatures above 125° F. </p>
      <p>The combined effect of internal circulation, oscillation,
        surface distortion, acceleration, deceleration, shearing, and
        depressurization, along with high intensity of air turbulence
        results in vaporization rate that is probably close to but not
        quite 95% (Ref. 54). </p>
      <p>During experimentation with different screen sizes, it was
        found that only the combination of the #50 interior coarse mesh
        and the #120 exterior fine mesh would achieve the differential
        vaporization effect, probably because the intensity of
        turbulence is increased proportionately more than the scale of
        turbulence is decreased.&nbsp; These two meshes produce a
        reverse taper (wider spray) orifice with an exit diameter of at
        most 0.0046 inches. This is much smaller than conventional
        state-of-the-art micronozzles which have diameters as small as
        0.008 inches. These valve-actuator combinations produce a very
        fine droplet size (Ref. 55). Because the heat and mass transfer
        value that results from dispersion by the WHV is exceedingly
        high (1/0.0046)<sup>2</sup> or 47,260 (a gain of about 200% over
        a standard engine), ultra-fine droplets are favored (Ref. 56).
        The smallest commercial aerosol orifice is only (1/0.008)<sup>2</sup>
        or 15,625 (a transfer rate one-third that of the WH rate).
        Because the orifice diameter is so small, the air stream is
        rotated and internally mixed within the nozzle and mixed again
        externally as it emerges from the nozzle, resulting in very fine
        sprays even at low feed rates and pressures (Ref. 57). The WHV
        can operate with a smaller orifice because the air is
        accelerated by passing through the double down-tube and by the
        greater pressure differential between the intake manifold and
        the interior of the valve. </p>
      <p>Turbulence appears to be essential to the high speed of
        vaporization in the WHV. The high friction produced by the
        passage of air and gasoline through these screens results in an
        irreversible thermodynamic process in the intake manifold of an
        operating engine (Ref. 59). Nonequilibrium thermodynamics (the
        extension of classical thermodynamics to transport systems) is
        an area of science that is not yet well understood. It is clear,
        however, that this kinetic energy is converted to latent heat by
        high friction flow, thereby increasing the internal energy of
        the air to the point where it can cause a change of state of the
        gasoline in an environment of low pressure and high turbulence.
      </p>
      <p>Turbulence has long been known to be essential to rapid
        vaporization. It has long been known that turbulence can be
        effectively used to homogenize fluid mixtures and to accelerate
        chemical reactions (Ref. 59). The mass transfer takes place
        through the relatively fast process of eddy diffusion and can
        result in values 10,000 times that of normal molecular
        diffusivity (Ref. 60). A 5% increase in turbulence in the air
        can increase the rate of vaporization 20 to 30% (Ref. 61). The
        WHV creates turbulence that is apparently over 200% higher than
        standard and may yield potential increases in the vaporization
        rate of 800% or more. </p>
      <p>Turbulent flows are always dissipative because viscous shear
        stresses perform deformation work on the gasoline which
        increases its internal energy at the expense of the kinetic
        energy of the turbulence (Ref. 62). In other words, the rapid
        movement of the air molecules and gasoline droplets are
        converted to internal heat energy upon deceleration after
        exiting the WHV. The intensity of the turbulence shears the main
        flow after it passes through the WH screens. </p>
      <p>The most important characteristic of turbulence is its ability
        to transport or mix momentum, kinetic energy, and contaminants
        such as heat, particles, and fluids Ref. 63). The rate of
        transfer and mixing are several orders of magnitude greater,
        therefore, than the rate s due to molecular diffusion (Ref. 64).
        The diffusivity of turbulence is the single most important
        feature as far as automotive applications are concerned because
        it increases the transfer rates of heat and momentum, both of
        which result in vaporization at temperatures well below the
        normal boiling point (Ref. 65). In the case of the WHV, this
        takes place at a temperature slightly above 125° F (the dew
        point of gasoline in an intake manifold). The ambient intake
        manifold temperature is about 130° F if the exhaust heat
        recirculation normally used in standard engines is removed and
        about 240° F or more if it is employed. </p>
      <p>The fact that turbulence has not been used to better effect in
        automobile engines illustrated the degree to which turbulence
        theories are not understood. As Tennekes and Lumley point out
        (Ref. 66): </p>
      <p>"Randomness and nonlinearity combine to make the equations of
        turbulence nearly intractable; turbulence theory suffers from
        the absence of sufficiently powerful mathematical methods. This
        lack of tools makes all theoretical approaches to problems in
        turbulence trial-and-error affairs. Nonlinear concepts and
        mathematical tools have to be developed along the way; one
        cannot rely on the equations alone to obtain answers to
        problems. This situation makes turbulence research both
        frustrating and challenging; it is one of the principle unsolved
        problems in physics today." </p>
      <p>Perhaps the most important point made by Tennekes and Lumley is
        the following (Ref. 67): </p>
      <p>"This book has been designed to get this point across. In
        turbulence, the equations do not give the entire story. One must
        be willing to use (and capable of using) simple physical
        concepts based on experience to bridge the gaps between the
        equations and actual flows. We do not want too imply that the
        equations are of little use; we merely want to make it
        unmistakably clear that turbulence needs spirited inventors just
        as badly as dedicated analysts." </p>
      <p>Screens have been used in other applications where similar
        conditions exist (but which do not involve combustion) and where
        similar effects were desired (Ref. 68): </p>
      <p>"...At large pressure-drop coefficients, turbulence may be
        caused by screens and it is recommended that several
        low-pressure-drop screens are preferable to a single
        high-pressure drop screen. This is the practice normally
        followed in blowdown tunnel design." </p>
      <p>The intake manifold equipped with a WHV is essentially a minute
        wind tunnel with a one-inch pressure differential or more and an
        ambient temperature of about 130° F. It has been observed that
        (Ref. 69): </p>
      <p>"Uniform fluid distribution is essential for efficient
        operation of chemical processing equipment such as contactors
        and reactors, mixers, burners, heat exchangers, extrusion dies,
        and textile-spinning chimneys. To obtain optimum distribution,
        proper consideration must be given to flow behavior in the
        distributor, flow conditions upstream of the distributor, and
        flow conditions downstream of the distributor... </p>
      <p>"A non-uniform velocity profile of turbulent flow through
        channels or process equipment can be smoothed out to any desired
        degree by adding sufficient uniform resistance, such as
        perforated plates or screens across the flow channel." </p>
      <p>Droplet breakup is accomplished by the WHV through three
        separate but related processes (Ref. 70): </p>
      <p>1. The impingement of the fuel and the air, after accelerating
        across the radial jump space, on the screens; </p>
      <p>2. A pressure drop due to the presence of high-friction nozzles
        (the combined screens); </p>
      <p>3. The high intensity of turbulence caused by the micronozzle
        effect of the adjacent nonuniform screen openings. </p>
      <p>In all of these, the density of the air involved is an
        important consideration. Perry and Chilton found that when a
        solid jet of liquid (in this case gasoline) is being impinged
        upon a gas (air), its relative velocity assumes a much greater
        importance than it does without impingement (Ref. 71) Generally,
        there is a strong decrease in droplet size with increasing gas
        density. It is important to note that in an engine modified with
        a WHV, the intake manifold temperature may be as low as only
        130° F versus the 240° F that is normal in standard engines (the
        extra heat recirculation can be removed because it is no longer
        necessary for the vaporization of gasoline). Thus, the cool air
        is much denser and capable of greater droplet size reduction
        because of its greater dynamic force (Ref. 72) </p>
      <p>There are four flow regions associated with a valve of this
        type (Ref. 73): </p>
      <p>1. Region of flow establishment -- a short region whose length
        is about 5 nozzle diameters or slot heights (for a slot of
        infinite width). The fluid within the cone or core of same
        length has a velocity of about the same as the initial discharge
        velocity; </p>
      <p>2. A transition region that extends to about 8 nozzle
        diameters, slightly less for slots; </p>
      <p>3. Region of established flow -- the principal region of the
        jet, extending to about 100 nozzles diameter or about 2000 slot
        heights; </p>
      <p>4. A terminal region where the residual center-line or maximum
        velocity reduces rapidly within a short distance. For air jets,
        the residual velocity will reduce to less than 1 ft./sec.,
        usually regarded as still air. </p>
      <p>Virtually all of the droplet breakup (and much of the
        vaporization) probably occurs within the first half-inch after
        exiting the outer screen (113 nozzle diameters times a nozzle
        diameter of 0.0046 inch).The time required for this phase
        dispersion is about 13 milliseconds (Ref. 74). </p>
      <p>The rapid rate of vaporization in the WHV is highly dependent
        upon the unusually high internal energy of the air and the rate
        at which it can be transferred to the fuel droplets which also
        are subject to an increase in their own level of internal energy
        (Ref. 75). </p>
      <p>Pierce has shown that (Ref. 76): </p>
      <p>"For an adiabatic flow with zero shaft work, the changes in
        system directed kinetic energy will result in system temperature
        changes with changes in the internal energy content and
        distributions in the various degrees of freedom... </p>
      <p>"As the gas is decelerated, there is an energy exchange between
        the directed kinetic energy of the gas stream and the internal
        energy of the gas itself. Assuming an adiabatic stagnation, then
        all of the directed kinetic energy must manifest itself as an
        increase in internal energy. The stagnation can occur so
        rapidly, however, that the vibrational degree of freedom may not
        accept its share of this directed kinetic energy as rapidly as
        necessary to insure that equilibrium exists. Then since the
        total energy is constant, the active degrees of freedom must
        accept more energy than equilibrium requires to compensate for
        the deficiency in energy content of the lagging degree of
        freedom... </p>
      <p>"In the flow through the shock front there is a sharp reduction
        in the directed kinetic energy of the gas. Assuming adiabatic
        flow along stream tubes, then this directed kinetic energy must
        be transferred to the gas molecules and manifest itself as
        intrinsic or internal energy of the gas. Since the vibrational
        degree of freedom is slow in acquiring its share of this new
        energy, a non-equilibrium situation can occur where initially
        virtually all this transformed directed kinetic energy is
        absorbed by the active translational and rotational degrees of
        freedom, and almost none is absorbed by the inert vibrational
        degree of freedom." </p>
      <p>Another very important mechanism acting concurrently with the
        turbulence the WHV is differential vapor recoil. This principle,
        despite its dramatic effects on vaporization (especially at low
        temperatures), has not been well understood outside of research
        laboratories (Ref. 77). The WHV is apparently the first
        application of this principle to automotive use. Palmer has
        described the effects of vapor recoil on the evaporation rate
        (Ref. 78): </p>
      <p>"A mechanism for inducing spontaneous convection, that of
        instability induced by differential vapor recoil, was first
        noted and correctly interpreted by Hickman in 1952 but has since
        attracted surprisingly little attention despite its dramatic
        effect on the evaporation of liquids at pressures above 1 Torr.
      </p>
      <p>"Hickman (1952) has shown that an increase as high as 20-fold
        in the liquid evaporation rate may be enjoyed if the interface
        is interrupted by differential vapor recoil. The onset of such
        convection appears as a sharp transition fro a relatively
        quiescent evaporating liquid surface as the pressure above the
        liquid is decreased. </p>
      <p>"Because mass must be conserved, the change in fluid density
        during evaporation results in a discontinuity in both the fluid
        velocity normal to the interface and the rate of transport of
        linear momentum across it. Momentum must also be conserved.
        Therefore the discontinuity in velocity results in a downward
        force on the interface (vapor recoil) which increases with the
        evaporation rate and with an increase in the density ratio of
        the liquid and gas phase. Since the density of the gas phase is
        linearly proportional to the pressure, the magnitude and, thus,
        the importance of this vapor recoil force increase markedly as
        the pressure is reduced." </p>
      <p>If a liquid in contact with its own vapor is evaporated at low
        pressure, interfacial heat transfer and evaporation rates can be
        increased dramatically by the onset of interfacial convection by
        differential vapor recoil (Ref. 79). The resulting discontinuity
        produces a downward force on the interface (vapor recoil) which
        increases with the increasing evaporation and the decreasing
        pressure. Palmer has demonstrated that this mechanism dominates
        interfacial behavior for evaporation into a partial vacuum (Ref.
        80). This same research provides the explanation for the
        likelihood that the Webster-Heise vaporization rate is probably
        on the order of 95% rather than 100% (compared to approximately
        60% prior to combustion in warmed-up standard engines).
        Experiments and stability analyses have shown the extreme
        sensitivity of the vapor recoil mechanisms to interfacial
        contamination such as engine oil and water (from condensation)
        (Ref. 81). As a result, the interface (between the liquid and
        vapor phases) will still develop some "torpid" patches about 5%
        of the time because evaporative fluxes are suppressed wherever
        the less volatile material accumulates on the surface (Ref. 82).
      </p>
      <p>Phase changes of fluids in pipelines have been observed for
        many years. In pipelines, this is an unwanted effect, but it
        serves as a useful analogy in explaining the way in which
        gasoline flashes to vapor on exiting the WHV and entering the
        intake manifold, which is very much like a pipeline in that it
        is a tube transporting a liquid which is subjected to pressure
        changes. In a pipeline, differential vaporization occurs because
        of the rapid relative velocity of the gas phase (Ref. 83). As
        the saturated liquid flows through the pipe, friction (as in the
        Webster-Heise screens) causes a pressure drop in the direction
        of flow followed by vaporization (Ref. 84). The mass transfer
        rate from the gas back to the liquid phase is zero (or very
        close to it)(Ref. 85). The vapor is swept away without
        contributing to the equilibrium composition, promoting further
        vaporization. The cooling effect accompanying the pressure drop
        is much less than would be predicted in an equilibrium model and
        apparently has the effect of increasing the volatility of the
        liquid (Ref. 86). </p>
      <p><b>2. Mixing ~</b> </p>
      <p>Mixing is a critical part of the pre-combustion phase of the
        operation of a gasoline-powered engine. It has been somewhat
        neglected in current engine design in which only limited mixing
        occurs due to the presence of baffles and ridges in the intake
        manifolds. This not only is a relatively ineffective way to mix
        air and gasoline, it often has a negative effect in that it
        provides numerous opportunities for the liquid gasoline issuing
        from the carburetor to collect on the walls of the intake
        manifold. </p>
      <p>Harrow has described the compromises that current engines
        represent because of imperfect mixing (Refs. 87, 88): </p>
      <p>"Traditionally, at full throttle, part of the latent heat of
        vaporization of the fuel us used to chill the mixture entering
        the engine and thus to increase the maximum power. In the
        absence of a perfect mixture preparation system which will
        provide both a chilled mixture and a fully atomized fuel, engine
        inlet manifolds have to cope with mixtures of liquid and vapor.
        A consequence of this need to combine several functions is that
        an engine mixture preparation system is a package that
        represents the manufacturer’s best compromise between the
        conflicting requirements of power, emissions and economy. The
        result is invariably sensitive to minor changes in the
        carburetion and inlet system geometry, which can give an
        improvement for one type of engine condition at the expense of
        performance in another. </p>
      <p>"The engine manufacturer tries to ensure uniform distribution
        of fuel between the cylinders by providing a hot spot to
        transmit exhaust heat to the mixture and by drawing some of the
        inlet air to the engine from around the exhaust manifold. The
        inlet manifold is also designed to permit a certain amount of
        liquid flow to flow freely to the cylinders. These procedures
        are not normally very effective, and almost invariably some fuel
        maldistribution does occur." </p>
      <p>A homogeneous mixture of gasoline vapor and air is the ideal
        condition for the inlet charge of a gasoline engine (Ref. 89).
        Vaporization greatly improves the mixing rate but, even in
        high-heat engines, the charge is still far from homogeneous by
        the time it reaches the entrance of the cylinders. This is
        because insufficient turbulence is available to cause the
        gasoline vapor molecules and air molecules to associate
        completely. It is compounded by the fact that many intake
        manifolds are not sufficiently large to permit good mixing. </p>
      <p>The WHV, by design, forces the gasoline vapor and air to mix
        thoroughly within a short distance from the outer screen. The
        high turbulence and shearing forces subject both components to
        an intense mixing process. Because the gasoline is in a
        vaporized or finely atomized state, it is far less likely to
        impinge and recondense downstream in the intake manifold. To
        reduce this possibility, all baffles and other obstructions are
        removed to provide a straight and clear path to the intake valve
        for each cylinder. </p>
      <p>The mixing principles employed in the WHV have been known for
        some time. As Goulburn and Hughes, based on work by Ashley, have
        observed (Ref. 90): </p>
      <p>"There are two important principles: break the stream down into
        a series of smaller streams to speed up mixing and break down
        stratification patterns; then pass the streams across and
        through one another to redistribute major stratification
        patterns. Multiple jets tend to overcome two undesirable
        characteristics of all of the natural mixing means, which are a
        relatively unmixed core inside a well mixed outer envelope, and
        insufficient turbulence. </p>
      <p>A design of mixer was produced which met the above criteria and
        had the added advantage that the heat transfer fins in the
        vaporizer could, with some modification, also be used to produce
        a series of jets of mixture directed so that adjacent layers of
        jets have an interface where fluid shearing will occur. Consider
        a vaporizer with horizontal fins, and consider one flow passage
        between the fins. At the end of the passage the flow encounters
        vertical deflector tabs positioned at 45 degrees to the flow
        turning the flow to the left (say). The flow passages
        immediately above and below will have deflector tabs set at 45
        degrees to the flow, but turning the flow to the right. The two
        layers of flow will then, at their interface, be shearing across
        each other at 90 degrees." </p>
      <p>Virtually the same conditions exist in the WHV. </p>
      <p>The benefits of improved mixing have been described by Harrow
        and are well worth considering in the case of the WHV (Ref. 91):
      </p>
      <p>1. The effect of mixture quality on fuel economy is significant
        and increases in importance the weaker the mixture strength
        becomes. It is of particular importance for smooth engine
        operation under transient conditions; </p>
      <p>2. In multi-cylinder engines, good mixture quality eliminates
        inter-cylinder fuel maldistribution and allows the carburetor to
        be tuned to the maximum-economy mixture strength; </p>
      <p>3. Under cold-running conditions, good mixture quality allows
        minimal use of the choke, thereby reducing short-trip fuel
        consumption; </p>
      <p>4.With a perfect fuel mixture preparation system, at least part
        of the engine power could be controlled on mixture strength
        alone. This would significantly improve part-load fuel economy;
      </p>
      <p>5. Many devices exist for improving mixture quality. They
        improve fuel economy, however, only if the mixture strength and
        spark timing are adjusted correctly to exploit the benefits that
        they confer. </p>
      <p><b>3. Distribution ~</b> </p>
      <p>Fuel distribution in conventional engines is a problem that is
        widely recognized. For efficient combustion and smooth engine
        operation, the air and fuel must be thoroughly and uniformly
        mixed, delivered in equal quantities to each cylinder, and
        evenly distributed within each cylinder (Ref. 92). It is
        generally acknowledged that the3 best way to achieve this is
        through a homogeneous charge (Ref. 93): </p>
      <p>"The process whereby the gasoline fuel and air are metered in
        the desired proportions and then mixed has been isolated as one
        of the key elements in making improvements in engine combustion,
        hence in efficiency and products of combustion. It has been
        conclusively established that a homogeneous mixture of gasoline
        and air is the best condition for the inlet charge of a gasoline
        engine..." </p>
      <p>In actual practice, however, the mixture in the intake manifold
        (even with the addition of heat) is not completely vaporized. As
        a result, the quality and quantity of the fuel charge reaching
        the cylinders vary considerably (Ref. 94). Because this
        distribution is unequal, some cylinders produce more power than
        others and some will have a greater tendency to detonate than
        others (Ref. 95). If the carburetor is adjusted to provide an
        adequate mixture to the weak cylinders, then the other cylinders
        will receive a mixture that is far too rich. The industry has
        compromised, therefore, by accepting weak and rich cylinders in
        order to obtain sufficient performance from the other cylinders
        (Figure 9). Unfortunately, these extreme cylinders produce a
        number of undesirable effects. The rich cylinders receive too
        much fuel which results in incomplete combustion and high
        hydrocarbon emissions because there is insufficient air
        available to burn all of it. The lean cylinders, in contrast,
        receive sufficient air but are relatively starved for fuel, and
        the resulting combustion pressures are so low that little useful
        work is done on the crankshaft. NOx formation is likely in these
        cylinders because of the relative abundance of oxygen and
        because the nitrogen is subjected to high heat levels for a
        comparatively long time due to the long duration of the primary
        flame. </p>

          cylinder (Ref. 96)</b> </p>

      <p><b>Figure 11 ~ Maldistribution results from heavy components of
          gasoline flowing to end of manifold rather than entering
          branches (Ref. 101)</b> </p>
      <center><img src="1fig11.jpg" height="161" width="306"></center>
      <p>There are several reasons for these variations in distribution
        (Ref. 96). When the throttle valve of the carburetor is partly
        open (as it almost always is except at full throttle), the flow
        of air and fuel is deflected to one side (Figure 10). The choke
        valve can also have a similar effect. Even more important is the
        fact that the heavy components of the air/fuel mixture have
        greater inertia than the lighter ones. Consequently, the heavy
        components move past the branches of the manifold. The cylinders
        supplied by those branches, therefore, receive too many light
        components (which burn rapidly) and too few heavy components
        (which contain most of the energy). The problem is shown in
        Figure 11. For the same reasons, some cylinders will receive
        more tetraethyl lead (or other negative catalysts) than others.
        Those cylinders receiving the leanest mixture, the lightest
        gasoline components, and the least amount of negative catalyst
        (such as tetraethyl lead) will have the greatest tendency to
        knock (Ref.97). The variation between minimum and maximum
        cylinder pressure on the power stroke in a typical 6-cylinder
        engine is on the order of 185 psi, with two cylinders delivering
        the minimum (125 psi) and only one delivering the maximum (310
        psi)(Ref. 98). The addition of multiple barrels to the
        carburetor reduces to some extent the variations in cylinder
        pressure due to poor distribution but does not eliminate them. </p>
      <p>The distribution problem has been described by Toboldt and
        Johnson (Refs. 102, 103): </p>
      <p>"The purpose of a carburetor is to deliver a metered amount of
        atomized fuel mixed with air, to the manifold. However,
        regardless of how well mixed and vaporized the fuel mixture is
        as it leaves the carburetor, its characteristics are unchanged
        as it passes through the manifold. Cold surfaces in the manifold
        will cause some of the vaporized fuel to condense, and changed
        in direction of flow will, through inertia, cause some portions
        of the mixture to settle out. These conditions have been
        observed using glass manifolds. </p>
      <p>"The problem is further complicated by the characteristics of
        the fuel itself. Formerly, when the fuel was highly volatile,
        the problem was not so difficult. With today’s fuels, which are
        relatively non-volatile, it is necessary to supply heat to
        obtain better vaporization and more equal distribution of the
        fuel to each cylinder." </p>
      <p>One of the ways the industry has used to avoid quantity
        distribution problems is fuel injection. This approach delivers
        a precise amount of fuel to each cylinder and injects it into
        the cylinder separately from the air flowing through the intake
        manifold. This system eliminates the need for manifold heat and
        permits lower intake temperatures, hence more volumetric
        efficiency. Fuel injection has its own associated problems,
        however, including higher emissions, lower fuel economy, and
        more difficult tuning. Because the gasoline is injected directly
        into the cylinder as a liquid rather than as a vapor, the
        quality of distribution is very low and more time is needed for
        the heat in the cylinder to partially vaporize the gasoline. As
        a result, the spark must be retarded severely with a
        considerable loss of fuel economy (the power stroke is partly
        over before the combustion begins)(Ref. 104). Retarding the
        spark does, however, reduce NOx emissions but not HC or CO
        emissions. The WHV has been shown to reduce all three
        simultaneously. </p>
      <p>The effect of quality distribution on HC emissions has been
        described by Marsee and Olree (Ref. 105): </p>
      <p>"...Quality is indirectly measured by measuring its effect on
        HC emissions and HC turn-up point as the mixture is leaned. Poor
        mixture quality at lean mixture leads to slow flame propagation
        and the extinguishing of combustion as the pressure and
        temperature decrease with the descending piston. Poor quality
        also leads directly to increased HC emissions as some portions
        of the charge may be too lean to burn." </p>
      <p>The WHV is designed to address, through charge conditioning,
        the distribution shortcomings of both the standard carburetion
        and fuel injection approaches. The advantage over standard
        carburetion is apparently a result of the elimination of two
        long-associated problems: (1) incomplete vaporization of the
        fuel, and (2) incomplete mixing with the intake air. </p>
      <p>The controlled turbulence created by the WHV (but lacking in a
        standard engine) forces the air and vaporized fuel to mix to a
        much greater extent than would otherwise be possible. Quantity
        distribution at idle is an especially difficult problem in a
        standard engine because of the low rate of flow (the throttle
        valve is almost completely closed)(Ref. 106). With the WHV,
        however, the combination of more complete vaporization and
        better mixing apparently permit idle speeds to be halved. </p>
      <p>The advantage of the WHV over fuel injection is a direct result
        of the elimination of liquid fuel in the cylinders. By providing
        a central injection point for a substantially vaporized and
        thoroughly mixed fuel-air mixture, the quantity distribution
        problem that fuel injection addresses is effectively eliminated,
        as measured in the test at Ethyl (See Test 1, Summary of Tests).
        Just as importantly, the quality distribution is much greater
        with the WHV because only completely mixed fuel vapor and air
        reach the cylinder, as opposed to the liquid fuel that is
        injected separately by fuel injection. With the WHV, the spark
        can be advanced considerably to obtain maximum fuel economy
        (including lower pumping losses) and lower emissions without
        sacrificing the power gains available through fuel injection. </p>
      <p><b>4. Volumetric Efficiency ~</b> </p>
      <p>One of the reasons that no engine is ever 100% efficient is the
        difficulty of getting a full charge of combustion mixture into
        each cylinder. A theoretical full charge does not reach the
        cylinder because of restrictions in the intake manifold,
        atmospheric temperature, valve timing, and other factors (Ref.
        107). Volumetric efficiency is the ratio of the charge actually
        taken in per cycle to a complete charge. This ratio is very
        sensitive to heat (because it lowers the density of the incoming
        air) and atmospheric pressure (because the pressure difference
        between the air inside the cylinder and the air outside will
        determine the volume of air admitted to the cylinder). </p>
      <p>The importance of additional air in raising the power output of
        an engine has been understood since 1902 when Louis Renault
        patented the supercharger. This device compressed the air, using
        a pump driven by the engine, to force more air into the
        cylinders. Even though superchargers are effective in raising
        power levels, they do so at a considerable loss in fuel economy
        due to the additional demands on the engine to drive the pump.
        They have generally been abandoned in favor of turbochargers,
        which use the pressure of exhaust gases to compress the intake
        air. While they have proven to be more satisfactory than
        superchargers, they are an expensive and relatively fuel
        inefficient means of boosting power outputs on gasoline-powered
        engines. </p>
      <p>The WHV accomplished much of the same effect as superchargers
        and turbochargers without increasing engine loads or pumping
        losses. Torque gains of as much as 20% were recorded in Test 5,
        Summary of Tests. This is accomplished by removing the high
        intake manifold temperatures, which is currently used by
        automobile manufacturers to increase vaporization rates but
        which appears to be unnecessary when a WHV is used. Because
        incoming air reaches the intake valve at 130° F rather than 240°
        F or more, its density is much greater. In practical terms, this
        means that more air is available to complete combustion and to
        expand upon combustion, creating more pressure on the pistons
        immediately after top-dead-center. This results in substantially
        more torque. Because there is more air mass to expand after
        combustion, pressure is also exerted for a longer duration
        during the power stroke when the crank angle is most advanced
        (between 0° and 90° ). It should be noted, however, that
        substantial torque gains may be possible even if the heat is not
        removed on the Webster-Heise system. Torque increases of up to
        40% may be obtainable (as shown in Test 6, Summary of Tests),
        and these gains are very likely due to the improved distribution
        and the greater pressures that are created in what would
        otherwise be the weak cylinders. </p>
      <p>The benefits of lower intake manifold temperatures are readily
        apparent. Brake specific fuel consumption and engine coolant
        temperatures are both reduced (Ref. 108). Based solely on fuel
        consumption considerations, the optimum intake manifold
        temperature at rated power conditions is 130° F for gasoline
        (Ref. 109) (5° F over the dew point temperature of 125° F). This
        is the same approximate manifold temperature that ios maintained
        with a WHV. </p>
      <p><b>B. Combustion Effects</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Combustion Stoichometry ~</b> </p>
      <p>The ideal combustion is stoichometric, meaning that there is no
        excess gasoline or excess air. This condition, in which the
        ratio of air to gasoline is 14.7 to 1 by weight, produces the
        hottest flame and the lowest emissions (Ref. 110). The maximum
        temperature peaks and expansion pressures occur when the
        combustion air is 100% of stoichometric (neither too rich or too
        lean), giving further evidence that stoichometric combustion is
        the most effective condition for the utilization of thermal
        energy (Figure 12)(Ref. 111). </p>
      <p><b>Figure 12 ~ Influence of air/fuel ratio on power, fuel
          consumption and emissions (Ref. 112)</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1fig12.jpg" height="226" width="359"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In this ideal situation, the gasoline is fully vaporized and
        distributed evenly to and within the cylinders, where blue-flame
        combustion converts to heat energy of the gasoline to mechanical
        energy. The gasoline must first be vaporized to individual
        molecules before oxidation to carbon dioxide and water can occur
        (Ref. 113). As discussed earlier, the incomplete vaporization
        and uneven distribution greatly affect the air/fuel ratio in
        individual cylinders even in the most modern automobile engines.
        In the rich cylinders, there is insufficient air to burn the
        relatively large amount of gasoline present, creating most of
        the HC and CO emissions. In the lean cylinders, the heat and
        pressure in the primary flame force some of the excess oxygen to
        combine with the nitrogen in the air rather than oxidizing the
        hydrogen and carbon for which the oxygen normally has a greater
        chemical affinity. To reduce NOx emissions, engine manufacturers
        currently recirculate some of the exhaust gases back into the
        primary intake air. Because these gases are less reactive, the
        formation of NOx is inhibited but the combustion process is
        deprived of oxygen that could be used to produce more energy
        from the unburned hydrocarbons. </p>
      <p>Excess oxygen is not desirable either. Although it can decrease
        HC and CO emissions within certain limits, it does reduce power
        because the full amount of the work available from the fuel is
        reduced by the lower flame temperature resulting from the
        heating of the excess air to the temperature of the burned
        gasoline (Ref. 114). The flame temperature can be increased to
        its maximum, therefore, by using a stoichometric air/fuel ration
        (when possible) and low levels of residuals or recirculated gas
        (Ref. 115). The flame stability afforded by the use of a
        vaporized charge is very high under these conditions (Ref. 116).
      </p>
      <p>Despite the recent interest in lean-burn combustion systems, it
        may be more desirable to use an air/fuel mixture that is closer
        to stoichometric. If the combustion conditions can be brought
        closer to the ideal stoichometry, then the optimum mixture is
        probably also very close to stoichometric. In an internal
        combustion engine, it is impossible to get something for nothing
        as some lean-burn techniques attempt to do. The best that can be
        achieved is the conversion of as much chemical energy in the
        fuel charge as possible into mechanical energy that can perform
        useful work with a minimum of harmful emissions. </p>
      <p><b>2. Octane Requirements ~</b> </p>
      <p>One of the most unexpected and potentially most important gains
        shown by the WHV is its lowering of engine octane requirements
        by 10 points or more. To understand the reasons for this
        reduction, which was not an original objective of the inventors,
        it is necessary to examine first the combustion problems
        identifiable in standard engines and then to analyze the effects
        that the WHV has on them. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;When the fuel charge is burned in a combustion chamber,
        the gasoline vapor and oxygen (which comprises approximately
        one-fifth of the air) combine and form new compounds. This
        reaction releases a large amount of heat which drives
        temperatures up to about 3500° F. This creates pressure on the
        gases in the cylinder which expand to push on the piston,
        forcing it downward on its power stroke. Normal combustion
        consists of three phases (Ref. 117, Toboldt and Johnson): </p>
      <p>"As soon as the ignition spark jumps the gap of the spark plug,
        a small ball of blue flame develops in the gap. This ball is the
        first stage or nucleus of the flame. It enlarges with relative
        slowness and, during its growth, there is no measurable pressure
        created by the heat. </p>
      <p>"As the nucleus enlarges, it develops into the hatching-out
        stage. The nucleus is torn apart, so that it sends fingers of
        flame into the mixture in the combustion chamber. This causes
        enough heat to give a slight rise in temperature and pressure in
        the entire air/fuel mixture. Consequently a lag still exists in
        the attempt to raise pressure in the entire cylinder. </p>
      <p>"It is during the third stage, or propagation, that the
        effective burning of the fuel takes place. The flame burns in a
        front which sweeps across the combustion chamber, burning
        rapidly and causing great heat with its accompanying rise in
        pressure. It is this pressure which causes the piston to move
        downward. </p>
      <p>"During normal combustion, the burning is progressive. It
        increases gradually during the first two stages. But, during the
        third stage, the flame is extremely strong as it sweeps through
        the combustion chamber. However, there is no violent or
        explosive action such as when detonation (ordinarily responsible
        for pinging and knocking) occurs. </p>
      <p>"If detonation takes place, it occurs during the third stage of
        combustion." </p>
      <p>When the flame is first propagated, it sweeps from the area
        around the spark plug toward the walls of the combustion
        chamber. Because the air/fuel mixtures used in all production
        gasoline engines contain a substantial amount of liquid fuel
        droplets, especially on the wetted surface of the cylinders and
        the piston heads, fuel-rich pockets (due to incomplete
        vaporization and poor mixing) tend to develop in the extremities
        of the combustion chamber. These pockets are compressed and
        heated far past the self-ignition point (even for high-octane
        fuels) by the combustion emanating from the spark plug. As the
        flame front advances, these unburned gases and droplets are
        further heated and compressed. This extreme heating of the
        unburned mixture can cause spontaneous ignition and explosion
        independent of the flame. It is this rapid, uncontrolled burning
        that is known as detonation and is perceived as knock or pinging
        when the rapidly burning flame front, expanding outward from the
        spark plug, collides with the secondary wave front produced by
        the detonation of the fuel-rich pockets ahead of the primary
        front (Ref. 118). </p>
      <p>Detonation is more than an annoyance or an indication of
        inefficient engine operation. It can do great harm to an engine
        and can considerably impair its performance and expected life.
        It can shatter pistons, burst cylinders, melt pistons, overheat
        engines, break spark plugs, overload bearings, increase fuel
        consumption, and decrease power (Ref. 119). The problems caused
        by detonation have been observed by Khovahk (Ref. 120): </p>
      <p>"An engine should never be allowed to operate for a long time
        with knocking, since the shock waves sharply increase heat
        transfer from the combustion products to the walls. This leads
        to overheating of the engine and destruction of some of the
        components in the combustion chambers (piston edges, gaskets
        between the cylinder and its head, electrodes and insulators of
        spark plugs). The vibrational nature of the load on the piston
        with detonation may destroy the antifriction layer in the
        connecting rod bearings and intensify the wear of the upper part
        of the cylinder liners, since the shock waves destroy the oil
        film on the surface of the metal, causing dry friction and also
        corrosive wear by the active substances, particularly nitrogen
        oxides, contained in the combustion products." </p>
      <p>There are several factors that contribute to detonation (Ref.
        121). These include lean air/fuel mixtures (which are more
        likely to contain uneven distribution of the gasoline with each
        cylinder), fuel of too low an octane rating (especially under
        poor vaporization and mixing conditions), high compression
        ratios, over-advance of ignition timing, engine lugging, and
        buildup of carbon deposits in the combustion chamber. </p>
      <p>A separate but related problem is pre-ignition, the burning of
        the fuel charge before the ignition spark. If this premature
        combustion is completed before the spark-induced ignition begins
        there is no knock. Pre-ignition can cause detonation which, in
        turn, can cause more pre-ignition. The principal cause of
        pre-ignition is excess heat, particularly that retained by hot
        carbon deposits which act as impromptu spark plugs. This can
        raise the octane requirements by several numbers and, if
        excessive, can break the crankshaft. </p>
      <p>The negative effects of detonation and pre-ignition have led
        gasoline refiners to increase the octane ratings of their fuels.
        The rating of a fuel is made by comparing it to mixtures of
        normal heptane and iso-octane (hence the term) in a test engine
        under certain test conditions. The combination of these pure
        hydrocarbons which provide the same knocking in the engine as
        the gasoline being tested is considered to have that "octane".
        The octane number of the fuel is the percent of iso-octane in
        the matching mixture of iso-octane and normal heptane (Ref 122).
      </p>
      <p>The gasoline additive used as the most common knock suppressant
        for the past 50 years is tetraethyl lead. Other additives are
        also used to reduce the buildup of carbon deposits, to absorb
        water in the fuel, and to lubricate the valve stems and upper
        cylinder walls. Most of these additives have high associated
        toxicity, and some are being phased out by law. Fuel economy was
        not a principal objective in the development of these additives
        (Ref. 123). The major concern was in avoiding engine destruction
        due to knock. </p>
      <p>Both detonation and pre-ignition are serious combustion
        problems. Both are uncontrollable explosions which generate
        their own flame fronts. Because they normally occur early in the
        process of compression and ignition, both violations reduce
        engine power because work is required to compress the combustion
        products (Ref. 124). They also transfer additional heat to the
        cylinder walls because burnt gases with high temperatures remain
        longer in the cylinders. </p>
      <p>Even with the addition of knock suppressants, carbon deposits
        in high-compression engines using high-octane gasoline sometimes
        produce foci of self-ignition independent of the primary flame
        front. Known as "rumble", this violation occurs after periods
        when the engine has been operating for long periods under light
        loads (forming carbon deposits in the process) and then run at
        full throttle (Ref. 125). Often the engine will continue to run
        at very inefficient levels after the ignition is turned off
        because the compression and the hot carbon deposits are
        sufficient to cause self-ignition. This is known as "dieseling"
        or "engine run-on". </p>
      <p>Tetraethyl lead and other anti-knock additives are negative
        catalysts which slow down the rate of flame travel and
        combustion so that extreme heat and pressure waves will not be
        created. This reduces the detonation tendency of the air/fuel
        charge and lowers the combustibility of the fuel-rich pockets in
        which detonation takes place. </p>
      <p>Reducing the volatility of the fuel (low-octane gasoline is
        more reactive than high-octane) through the use of negative
        catalysts hinders detonation beyond the primary flame front. It
        does, however, have numerous associated disadvantages. Most
        anti-knock additives, particularly tetraethyl lead and
        aromatics, are highly toxic, and some are carcinogenic. Because
        of this, Federal laws have been enacted to reduce and eventually
        phase out their use. At the same time the demand for fuel
        economy has led manufacturers to increase compression ratios,
        which increase the octane requirements of their engines. At the
        same time, the refining industry is severely depressed and only
        the largest companies can afford the expensive reconfigurations
        necessary to increase octane of their gasolines. Those that can
        increase them do so at a great expense in extra crude oil
        consumed through more severe processing. </p>
      <p>The alternatives to chemical octane have never been attractive
        because there appeared to be no effective way to improve the
        conditions in the combustion chamber. The fuel-rich pockets,
        carbon deposits, and low-density air inherent in automobile
        engines strictly limited the options. The Webster-Heise
        Corporation, however, claims that processing the charge (as
        described earlier) through a valve eliminates or greatly reduces
        those factors that artificially increase octane requirements.
        The highly vaporized and fully mixed charge prevents the
        formation of fuel-rich pockets, the low-temperature vaporization
        reduces the charge temperature, and because combustion is more
        complete, carbon deposits do not form. </p>
      <p>The rate of combustion is of critical importance in determining
        the efficiency of an engine. As Khovahk has observed (Ref. 126):
      </p>
      <p>"Combustion takes place in the gaseous phase. For the reactions
        of oxidation to develop at sufficiently high velocities, the
        liquid fuel should be vaporized and its vapors mixed with the
        air. The process of combustion takes place at the maximum
        velocity in homogeneous mixtures when the fuel molecules are
        uniformly distributed among the molecules of oxygen. In
        heterogeneous gas mixtures, the rate of combustion is mainly
        determined by the velocities of mutual diffusion of the fuel
        vapors and air, while the rates of the chemical reactions are of
        a secondary importance. The rate of liquid fuel consumption is
        limited by the rates with which it evaporates and the vapors
        formed mix with air." </p>
      <p>Because of the conditions that apply in a conventional engine,
        slowing the reaction rate of the fuel is the only way that
        detonation can be avoided when it would otherwise occur. If
        those conditions are made more benign, as is possible through
        improved charge preparation and distribution, then a fuel of
        substantially lower octane can be used without detonation.
        Khovahk has noted that, "Detonation is hampered by the factors
        that accelerate combustion of the last portion of the charge in
        the flame front" (Ref. 127). If the flame travel is faster and
        less time is required to develop the pre-flame reactions in the
        unburned part of the charge, then the tendency to detonate is
        reduced (Ref. 128). If the air/fuel mixture, therefore, is
        highly vaporized and homogeneous, is relatively low in
        temperature (to accelerate the propagation of the flame front),
        then fuel with higher reactivity (lower octane) can be used. The
        size of the octane reduction varies but, based on laboratory
        tests, appears to be at least 10 octane points lower and may be
        as much as 15. </p>
      <p>Flame speed is known to increase with decreasing initial
        droplet size, with the fastest speed for vapor (Ref. 129). The
        presence of droplets produces local variations in the air/fuel
        mixture which can cause the formation of a secondary diffusion
        flame in the wake of the propagating flame and produce local
        variations in the combustion temperature. This unsteadiness is
        due to the time-varying stratification of the droplets and their
        transient heating (Ref.130). These variations work against
        efficient engine operations and tend to increase the formation
        of undesirable emissions. In a premixed homogeneous charge, the
        secondary flame does not develop and the primary flame tends to
        propagate with a steady velocity (Ref. 131). </p>
      <p>The ability of the Webster-Heise system to run on low octane
        gasolines with high spark advances and without detonation (as
        shown in the Summary of Tests) tends to suggest that
        vaporization of the gasoline is responsible for the likely
        absence of a secondary flame and consequent knock. </p>
      <p>Another apparent factor in reducing the octane requirement with
        a WHV is the increased turbulence of combustion. It can be
        inferred from internal combustion theory that, because of the
        homogeneity if the charge, the intensity of the turbulence of
        the charge upon admission to the cylinder is probably higher
        than in a standard engine. This turbulence greatly increases the
        velocity of the flame front (Ref. 132). Experiments independent
        of the Webster-Heise development have shown that these intensive
        vortices and turbulent pulsations distort the flame front and
        break it into separately burning foci which greatly increase the
        actual surface of combustion by several orders of magnitude
        (Ref. 133). The turbulent pulsations that are smaller than the
        thickness of te laminar flame front do not produce distortions,
        but they do intensify the processes of heat transfer and
        diffusion in the flame front thereby increasing the combustion
        rate in the foci. These two factors combine to cause the
        velocity of the turbulent flame to increase in approximate
        proportion to the intensity of the turbulence (Ref. 134). These
        factors may also apply in the Webster-Heise system. </p>
      <p>Another important factor in octane requirements is the manner
        in which the charge burns. As Khovahk has shown (Ref. 135): </p>
      <p>"Heterogeneous mixtures such as jets of gas flowing into air or
        droplets of atomized liquid fuel suspended in air burn in a
        quite different manner than homogeneous ones. The rate of
        combustion of a heterogeneous gas mixture is determined in
        practice by the velocity of diffusive mixing of the fuel with
        the oxidant, since the chemical reactions of combustion have
        much higher rates than the mixing processes. This kind of
        burning is therefore known as diffusive combustion. </p>
      <p>"The rate of combustion of liquid fuel droplets is mainly
        determined by the rate of vaporization (the vapors of fuel
        formed on the droplet surface diffuse into the air surrounding
        the droplet and form a combustible mixture at some distance from
        it)." </p>
      <p>The heterogeneous mixtures always develop fuel-rich local zones
        which serve as centers for ignition of the surrounding leaner
        mixture. This permits the use of a very lean mixture but greatly
        increases the potential for harmful detonation and NOx
        formation. </p>
      <p>In a series of tests at the Environmental Testing Corporation
        in Denver CO (an EPA-recognized testing laboratory), the use of
        the WHV was shown to reduce the octane requirements of the test
        car (a 1979 Chevrolet Monte Carlo) by 10 or more points (see
        Summary of Tests). </p>
      <p>In real terms, the octane gains are greater than indicated
        because they were not offset by negative effects in other areas.
        Results in all other categories were favorable (low emissions,
        high torque, high fuel economy, and good driveability). He
        ability to use 75-octane fuel with no offsetting losses could
        eliminate the need to boost the octane of gasoline, a practice
        that is expensive in terms of crude oil requirements, of cost to
        the end-user, and of deterioration of air quality. The lowest
        octane fuel that can legally be sold is 85 (available only at
        high-altitude location). The test data shows that the WHV
        permits improved performance on fuel 10 octane points lower than
        that on the cars tested so far; wider applicability will need to
        be determined by testing on a wide range of vehicles. </p>
      <p>As a practical mater, refiners probably would not wish to push
        octane as low as 75 but would probably prefer to sell the
        gasoline (once a large enough fleet were established) directly
        as it comes from the fractionating towers. The octane of this
        raw gasoline is normally about 82 or 83 (R+M/2), and it would
        need no further octane enhancement. It is the current effort to
        boost octane from these levels to the upper 80s and low 90s that
        consumes so much crude oil, and that adds significantly to the
        cost of the gasoline at the pump (as much as 20cents/gallon). </p>
      <p>The octane reduction observed in the test of the WHV has also
        been observed in other tests. In its work on fast-burn engines,
        the General Motors Research Laboratories compared the octane
        requirements of a fast-burn engine and a slow-burn engine (Ref.
        136): </p>
      <p>"Comparing these two chambers shows that the fast-burn chamber
        requires a fuel octane number of only 80 to operate at MBT
        (minimum advance for best torque). In contrast, the slow-burn
        chamber needs a fuel with 97.5 octane rating for optimum timing.
        Alternatively, retarding spark timing to allow an 80 octane
        number fuel to be used in the slow-burn chamber would reduce
        efficiency significantly. </p>
      <p>"A diagnostic study of combustion in the two chambers
        identified shorter combustion time in the fast-burn chamber as
        the dominant factor contributing to its lower octane needs.
        Specifically, analysis of pressure movement in both chambers
        showed end-gas temperature and pressure to reach higher values
        in the fast-burn case, primarily due to its higher energy
        release rate. Despite this higher temperature, more rapid flame
        front propagation into the end gas more than compensates." </p>
      <p>Mattavi observed that fast-burning of the charge is a
        fundamental approach for reducing octane requirements. Most of
        the industry efforts, such as the May "Fireball" concept, have
        been concentrated on new combustion chamber designs that
        increase the swirl to reduce the opportunity for detonation
        pockets to form. All of these systems introduce liquid rather
        than vaporized gas into the chamber. None of them have yet to be
        used in large-scale production. The WHV may prove to be a far
        less expensive and possibly more efficient means of
        accomplishing the same objective as the fast-burn chambers:
        reducing octane requirements, improving fuel economy, and
        lowering emissions of pollutants. </p>
      <p><b>3. Torque ~</b> </p>
      <p>The conditions for maximum efficiency in an automobile engine
        were established in Paris in 1862 by the originator of the
        operating cycle theory for the internal combustion engine,
        Alphonse Beau de Rochas. He determined that the engine should
        have the following characteristics (Ref. 137): </p>
      <p>1. maximum cylinder volume with a minimum cooling surface; </p>
      <p>2. maximum rapidity of expansion; </p>
      <p>3. maximum ratio of expansion, and </p>
      <p>4. maximum pressure of the ignited charge. </p>
      <p>The two conditions that are of primary interest here are (2)
        and (4). Tests to date suggest the likelihood that the WHV,
        condition the charge so that combustion can occur much more
        quickly (once ignited by the spark) than in a conventional
        engine. Because it reduces the octane requirements of the engine
        (as indicated by its ability to run on low octane fuels with
        high spark advance and without detonation, it can use
        lower-octane fuels which burn faster than those with additives
        such as lead. Because of the faster burn, the expansion of the
        combustion products is more rapid and exerts more force on the
        pistons. The high density of the intake charge also increases
        the available torque because there is a greater mass to expand
        upon combustion. </p>
      <p>Obtaining the maximum pressure of the ignited charge is crucial
        to achieving the maximum operating efficiency. The maximum work
        of a cycle and the maximum power and efficiency of an engine can
        be obtained when the main combustion phase begins and ends
        almost symmetrically with respect to top-dead-center (actually
        about 10° after TDC to get leverage on the crank). Because
        standard engines are not octane tolerant below certain limits,
        either the octane must be increased or the timing retarded. If
        the octane is increased, the combustion starts late and takes
        place over a range of 30 to 40 crank angle degrees. During that
        time, the volume of the combustion chamber increases as the
        piston moves downward on its power stroke. The effective
        compression ratio during most of the combustion, therefore, is
        lower than it is at TDC. If the timing is retarded (to decrease
        the pressure on the detonation-prone fuel-rich pockets ahead of
        the flame front) then the expansion of the gases does not occur
        until after the volume of the combustion chamber begins to
        increase as the piston moves away from it. </p>
      <p>In both cases, the engine is not operating with maximum
        efficiency because the maximum available pressure is not being
        exerted due either to the slow reaction rate or to the late
        expansion. This is the principal reason that most modern
        automobile engines have relatively low torque, especially at low
        engine speeds. At the very beginning of the development of the
        four-cycle engine, Beau de Rochas theorized that maximum
        efficiency could be achieved only of the maximum pressure were
        exerted just after TDC, followed by expansion during the power
        stroke. Because the WHV permits combustion to occur rapidly
        without detonation, the timing can be advanced to provide the
        maximum pressure at a point just past TDC, thus increasing both
        torque and fuel economy. </p>
      <p>The faster heat release and the greater volumetric efficiency
        made possible through the use of the WHV means that the peak
        pressures can be higher and can be made to occur at the moment
        they will be most effective (just after TDC). As a result, the
        torque has been shown to be as much as 40% higher than standard
        on 75 octane gasoline, as measured in tests at the Environmental
        Testing Corporation (see Test 6, Summary of Tests). This was
        accomplished with better fuel economy (lower brake-specific fuel
        consumption) than the standard production system. </p>
      <p>A gain of that size over standard is substantial, but even more
        remarkable is that the torque increase began at low rpm. In the
        Ford tests the torque gain was largest at low engine speeds
        (1200 rpm) and was maintained throughout most of the test
        (through 3500 rpm). The difference was greatest at low rpm,
        however, where torque is needed most. </p>
      <p>As Toboldt and Johnson have noted (Ref. 138): </p>
      <p>"In the case of the automotive engine, torque is low at low
        engine speeds and increases rapidly with the speed. Automotive
        engineers make every effort to increase the torque at low speeds
        and to remain as nearly constant as possible." </p>
      <p>In addition, the WHV apparently eliminates the problem of
        "manifold lag". Burtner and Morris have described this
        phenomenon Ref. 139): </p>
      <p>"It is well known that octane distribution over the gasoline
        boiling range affects road octane numbers of loaded gasolines in
        manual transmission cars. At full throttle and low engine speed,
        some of the unvaporized gasoline flows along the walls of the
        intake manifold so that at the beginning of an acceleration, the
        cylinders are receiving more than the normal share of
        low-boiling components, Because of this phenomenon, known as
        "manifold lag", such cars respond to octane quality in the
        low-boiling "front end" of the gasoline. </p>
      <p>"The higher boiling aromatics tend to remain in the "heavy end"
        of the gasoline and therefore do not contribute to octane
        quality of the "front end" while increasing the octane number of
        the whole gasoline." </p>
      <p>These octane distribution effects can be important in limiting
        early torque. In conventional engines the components with the
        greatest heat content (and the highest boiling points) are the
        least likely to reach the cylinders as burnable vapor when
        additional torque is needed. As a result, only the lightest,
        most volatile components are burned, and these are the ones most
        likely to cause detonation. Because their heat content is so low
        they cannot generate as much pressure as a charge with the full
        range of gasoline components, particularly the heavy ones which
        are less volatile but which contain most of the heat energy
        (Ref. 140). </p>
      <p><b>4. Cycle-By-Cycle Combustion Variations ~</b> </p>
      <p>Cycle-by-cycle combustion variations (CBC) have always been a
        problem in four-cycle engines, but the problem has become even
        more vexing with the advent of emission controls. CBC occurs
        under all operating conditions and increases as the air/fuel
        ratio moves away from a stoichometric value in either a lean or
        very rich direction (Ref. 141). It occurs to the greatest degree
        when excessive amounts of exhaust gases are recirculated to
        reduce the oxygen available for NOx formation (Ref. 142). As
        exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) increases, the combustion rate
        slows and the flame stability deteriorates. If CBC variations
        are too extreme, partial burn occurs and the unburned charge is
        carried over to the next cycle as a residual gas. Consequently,
        unburned HC and fuel consumption skyrocket. CBC variation is the
        random variation in the time between the spark and the
        establishment of a stable flame front in successive firings
        (Ref. 143). In an engine running at 2500 rpm and having a
        typical spark duration of a 20 degree crank angle, the limiting
        effect of CBC variations is the equivalent of randomly retarding
        timing between 0 degrees and 20 degrees (Ref. 144). This causes
        considerable variations in the rate of pressure rise and peak
        cylinder pressure and greatly reduces efficiency. This
        degradation of the combustion process limits the maximum
        air/fuel ratio (currently used to reduce emissions and to lower
        fuel consumption). </p>
      <p>Traditionally, the method used for reducing CBC variations was
        to operate the engine with a richer mixture but, because of
        restrictions on exhaust emissions and the need for better fuel
        economy, this method is no longer practical. The ideal approach
        is to consistently increase the average combustion rate, as the
        WHV appears to do. This was not done by the auto industry,
        however, because faster combustion promoted detonation of the
        incompletely vaporized and poorly mixed charge. The effect of
        the fast-burn on CBC variations has been described by Rashidi
        (Ref. 145): </p>
      <p>"Reducing the delay period in the second phase of ignition or
        reducing the flame stabilization time decreases the cyclic
        variation. This can be achieved by selecting a mixture with a
        high reaction rate. In this respect the high temperature of the
        flame nucleus is important." </p>
      <p>With a fast burn, combustion duration declines sharply. With
        20% EGR, the combustion duration of a fast burn is virtually the
        same as that of a conventional engine with no EGR. An
        improvement in the quality and rate of combustion, therefore,
        can greatly decrease the CBC variations in cylinder pressure
        (Ref. 146). The shorter combustion duration also reduces pumping
        losses (the piston does not have to compress the burning charge
        as much as the crank approaches TDC) which substantially reduces
        fuel consumption and lowers NOx emissions. The WHV’s inventors
        claim that because it conditions the charge to accept fast-burn
        rates and reduces the need for EGR, it is very effective at
        improving combustion stability and eliminating CBC variations. </p>
      <p><b>5. Fuel Economy ~</b> </p>
      <p>The thermal efficiency of conventional gasoline-powered engines
        is very low. Because of te high internal friction in four-cycle
        engines, the theoretical maximum is only about 25% conversion of
        the thermal energy mechanical energy (Ref. 147). Virtually no
        engines achieve these levels because of incomplete combustion,
        poor mixture distribution, detonation, pumping losses, engine
        deposits, and other inherent problems. A relatively new car
        (after break-in) might get as much as 13%, but about 10% is more
        typical as wear and deposits accumulate (Ref. 148). In an engine
        far out of tune or badly worn, the efficiency can drop to as low
        as 6% or less. </p>
      <p>The WHV appears to increase the thermal efficiency of the
        engine in several ways. The better mixture preparation and equal
        distribution result in more complete combustion and more
        effective work on the crankshaft. The vaporized state of the
        fuel and the cooler air temperature reduce detonation (which
        lowers fuel economy) and improves torque (less fuel is consumed
        to do the same amount of work). The WHV apparently facilitates
        the greater use of the heavy components of gasoline which
        contain most of the energy (Figure 5). When this fuel is burned,
        much of which would otherwise be lost as part of the exhaust in
        the form of unburned or partially oxidized hydrocarbons, it
        provides additional energy that reduces overall fuel
        requirements. This is consistent with experiments which have
        shown that a simultaneous reduction in droplet evaporation and
        entrainment reduces the combustion efficiency (Ref. 149). </p>
      <p>Perhaps the most important factor, however, is the increased
        rate of combustion (fast-burn) which has been shown to improve
        fuel efficiency by about 10% compared to conventional engines
        under equal NOx conditions (Ref. 150). Fast burn greatly reduces
        the heat cycle rejection, which has a direct and significant
        effect on fuel consumption. The energy within the charge that is
        transferred to the coolant during the compression, combustion,
        and expansion phases of the engine cycle when the valves are
        closed is particularly important because it represents a direct
        depletion of the energy available for useful work (Ref. 151).
        The heat losses and related effects reduce the thermal
        efficiency of a standard engine by about 40% (Ref. 152). If
        greater use is made of the chemical energy available in the
        gasoline, then the overall engine efficiency and fuel economy
        are also increased. The application of this principle, plus the
        factors already noted, allow the modified engine to operate at a
        level much closer to the theoretical maximum efficiency. </p>
      <p>The high heat losses in conventional engines not only increase
        fuel consumption directly but also indirectly through increased
        detonation. This necessitates retardation of the combustion
        timing to maintain the optimal pressure-versus-crank angle
        history in each cylinder (Ref. 153). The elimination of cycle
        heat losses would increase fuel economy by about 12% in most
        engines, and advancing the timing where possible) would add
        another 1% for each angle of advance (Ref. 154). Webster-Heise
        claims that the valve greatly reduces, but does not completely
        eliminate, these heat losses. This probably accounts, however,
        for at least some of the fuel economy gains observed in all of
        the tests, </p>
      <p>As Novak and Blumberg point out (Ref. 155): </p>
      <p>"The high wall and charge temperatures associated with reduced
        heat losses would undoubtedly aggravate the already serious
        problem of engine knock. Hence, any design alternative that
        reduces in-cylinder heat losses without addressing the knock
        limitation would be impractical." </p>
      <p>They also observed that to prevent deterioration of the
        combustion process, especially with charge dilution, "would
        require major advances in fuel preparation, ignition, and
        controlled turbulence for its implementation" (Ref. 156). </p>
      <p>In EPA-recognized laboratory tests, the WHV has shown
        substantial gains in fuel economy. In the EPA cold-start test
        and using an early prototype valve, the Webster-Heise modified
        automobile showed a 9.2% increase in fuel economy (with lower
        emissions) over baseline. The gains in other official tests were
        somewhat higher, ranging up to 20% in some. In unofficial road
        tests and under favorable conditions, even higher gains on the
        highway have been observed. </p>
      <p>It is particularly important to note that in the EPA highway
        economy tests on October 15,1980, the WH car (1979 Monte Carlo)
        achieved 25.9 mpg with 75 octane fuel and a timing advance of 13
        degrees before TDC (See Summary of Tests). The same car, without
        the valve, would barely run on that fuel at that timing and had
        severe knock. Even with 97 indolene (a high octane research
        gasoline) and the same spark advance, the fuel economy of the
        baseline car was only 23.8 mpg, 8.1% lower. In the July 1982
        tests at ETC on a 1982 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme (See Test 6,
        Summary of Tests), the fuel economy on 75 octane gasoline was
        35.614 mpg versus 31.414 mpg for the same car without the valve
        on 97 octane, an increase of 13.4 %. The EPA highway fuel
        economy for that model is 30 mpg. </p>
      <p>As a general rule, each one degree of spark retardation causes
        a 1% reduction in fuel economy (Ref. 157). For this reason, the
        actual fuel economy obtained with the WHV tends to be greater
        than baseline because of the additional timing advance made
        possible by the lower octane requirements of the modified
        engine. The fuel economy of most new cars is less than the EPA
        numbers would suggest because the timing has to be retarded in
        order to prevent detonation when using 87-octane gasoline (EPA
        tests are run on 97-octane gasoline). This reduction in fuel
        economy can be as much as 8%, but spark retardation is widely
        practiced by new car dealers to eliminate knock when their
        customers complain about it in their engines (Ref. 158). </p>
      <p><b>Figure 13 ~ Engine and Fuel Utilization Patterns found for
          typical road service (Ref. 160)</b> </p>

        <p><img src="1fig13.jpg" height="560" width="449"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The greatest potential for fuel savings is probably at low rpm
        in urban stop-and-go driving (Figure 13). Tests indicate that
        the greatest fuel economy (possibly as much as 30%) could be
        expected in that type of driving because it is the mode in which
        combustion in conventional engines is least efficient. As
        Knovahk has reported (Ref. 159): </p>
      <p>"When the power of an engine is reduced by throttling, the
        initial and final compression pressure decrease and the dilution
        of the working mixture with the residual gases increases. First
        of all, this appreciably impairs ignition of the mixture by a
        spark and the development of the initial focus of combustion.
        This prolongs the initial phase, the process of combustion loses
        its stability and frequently cannot be resumed in some cycles. </p>
      <p>"This difficulty can be overcome to a certain extent by so
        enriching the mixture with considerable throttling as to make
        spark ignition more dependable (less than 0.8-0.9). But here,
        too, it is very difficult to avoid combustion continuing during
        a substantial portion of the expansion stroke, since it is
        impossible to ensure uninterrupted ignition at large advance
        angles when the compression pressures are still very low. </p>
      <p>"Poor combustion at low loads and the necessity for mixture
        enrichment are among the principal shortcomings of
        spark-ignition petrol engines which cause a waste of fuel and
        the ejection of a large amount of the products of incomplete
        combustion (including carbon monoxide another poisonous
        substances) into the atmosphere together with the exhaust
        gases." </p>
      <p>There are two principal reasons for the low combustion
        efficiency of conventional engines at low engine speeds. The
        first is the longer time available during each cycle for
        combustion to occur. When it does take place, it develops
        unevenly and produces limited torque. The second is the highly
        restricted volume of air that manages to get by the throttle
        plate (it is nearly a total restriction when closed at idle). In
        unmodified engines, the limited air flow at low engine speeds is
        even less effective than usual in atomizing and partially
        vaporizing the gasoline. As a result, the standard engine has
        difficulty idling at speeds below 500 rpm. The WHV, on the other
        hand, is claimed to maintain a high degree of turbulence, even
        with heavy throttling, because the fuel is still substantially
        vaporized rather than atomized in large droplets. This permits a
        faster combustion rate, even at low engine speeds. Webster-Heise
        reports that in its test the valve allowed engine speeds as low
        as 300 rpm without significant deterioration of combustion
        quality. This means not only that less fuel will be used at
        complete idle but also that far fewer engine deposits
        (particularly carbon), which could impair performance later, are
        likely to form. </p>
      <p>This aspect takes on added significance when considered in the
        context of the EPA tests. The EPA certification test consists of
        55% city driving and 45% highway driving. According to the Dept.
        of Transportation, however, these percentages are not
        representative of actual driving patterns. DOT reports that 90%
        of the driving is done in the city and rush-hour driving and
        only 10% is done at high speeds on highways (Ref. 161). That 90%
        is where most of the improvement in fuel economy can come
        because it is the least fuel-efficient mode of driving. </p>
      <p>This weighting of the EPA tests inflates the fuel economy
        numbers to the high side and consequently they are seldom
        matched in actual experience. One of the main reasons that new
        car buyers so not obtain the fuel economy promised in the
        automakers’ advertisements is that the stop-and-go mode of
        rush-hour driving (over 35% of all driving) is far more
        important than its representation in the tests. Because this is
        also the most efficient engine speed at which to operate, the
        potential gains over standard is much greater than in other
        modes of driving. </p>
      <p><b>C. Post-Combustion Effects</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Emissions ~</b> </p>
      <p>The presence of harmful emissions in the exhaust of internal
        combustion engines has been a source of concern for over two
        decades. Limited progress has been made in reducing them, but a
        substantial air quality problem still remains, particularly in
        urban areas. The efforts of the automobile industry have been
        directed at devices such as the catalytic converter (which is
        sensitive to contamination). Efforts to reduce NOx often result
        in increases in HC and vice versa. The WHV is unusual in that it
        apparently reduces all three pollutants simultaneously
        (especially if the manifold is cooled), although not all are
        reduced to the same extent. </p>
      <p>HC emissions, as indicated earlier, are principally the result
        of incomplete combustion. This is especially true if the engine
        is run rich (air/fuel ratio less than 14.7:1). Enrichment
        assures maximum power and stable operation at low loads and
        idle. The lack of oxygen, however, prevents complete combustion
        of all of the charge and reduces the evolution of heat upon
        combustion (Ref. 162). As a result, the products of incomplete
        combustion (CO, free hydrogen, and others) appear. </p>
      <p>A direct relationship exists between knock and HC emissions.
        For this reason, the reactions that take place ahead of the
        flame and those that occur behind it are most important. As
        Bracco observes, "The pre-flame reactions are responsible for
        the process of engine knock and determine the nature of the
        unburned hydrocarbons that are emitted when the flame fails to
        process all of the combustible mixture ahead of it" (Ref. 163).
      </p>
      <p>A major reason for the high concentrations of liquid gasoline
        in the extremities of the cylinders, which lead to detonation
        and contribute to high emissions, is the admission of the
        gasoline to the cylinders in the form of liquid droplets. These
        droplets, especially the larger ones, tend to collect on the
        metal surfaces of the cylinders, the cylinder heads, and the
        pistons. This wetted surface is very difficult to ignite
        properly because of its thickness and because oxygen can reach
        it from only one side. Because of this surface wetting, the fuel
        concentration in the extremities of the cylinders can be quite
        high even in very lean air/fuel mixtures. When the heat and
        pressure from the advancing flame front emanating from the spark
        reaches these areas, the fuel-rich pockets detonate before the
        flame itself actually reaches them. The WHV, because it
        apparently delivers a basically homogeneous vaporized charge to
        the cylinders, greatly limits the potential for the formation of
        these knock-inducing concentrations. </p>
      <p>An effect known as "wall quenching" is also a factor in HC
        emissions (Ref. 164). This refers to the fact that the
        temperatures of the metal surfaces of the combustion chamber are
        lower than that of the combustion itself and tend to extinguish
        the flame when it reaches them. This normally results in some
        fuel not being completely burned and in its exhaustion as a
        pollutant. If quenching occurs early in a cycle, fewer HC
        molecules are retained by the wall than if it occurs late in the
        cycle due to the longer post-oxidation time available (Ref.
        165). The greater timing advances that have been recorded with
        the WHV and low-octane gasoline tend to minimize the
        wall-quenching effect to the extent that it occurs, according to
        Webster-Heise. Because the charge is apparently vaporized,
        however, wall-quenching is a relatively unlikely source of
        exhaust HC, in contrast to standard engines which receive
        heterogeneous charges that are more prone to this effect (Ref.
        166). Higher cylinder pressures, such as those produced in the
        Webster-Heise modified engines, also reduce the quench distance
        (Ref. 167). </p>
      <p>In the EPA-recognized laboratory tests, the Webster-Heise
        modified car obtained HC levels that were as much as 13.4% lower
        than standard (Test 6, Summary of Tests). This pollutant was
        reduced the least of those tested. It should be noted, however,
        that the baseline engine had been thoroughly cleaned prior to
        testing. Therefore, there were no carbon deposits present which
        probably would have increased the HC levels in the standard
        engine under normal operating conditions. Conversely, the
        Webster-Heise test car reportedly did not form carbon deposits
        even after 80,000 miles, including severe dynamometer tests (See
        Summary of Tests, Informal Testing). If this proves to be
        characteristic in general use, the difference in HC levels could
        be expected to increase over time in favor of the Webster-Heise
        modification. </p>
      <p>Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions are subject to many of the same
        influences as HC, and they tend to rise and fall inversely,
        although at somewhat different levels. Retarding the spark
        increases CO emissions because the airflow must increase to
        maintain power; advancing the spark lowers CO levels (Ref. 168).
        CO is a measure of incomplete combustion and is indicative of
        low droplet vaporization rates within the cylinder, assuming a
        constant air/fuel ratio. It is also one of the most difficult
        emissions to control in modern catalytic converters (Ref. 169).
        If the turbulence of the charge is increased, as it is believed
        to be in the Webster-Heise system, then the oxygen concentration
        will be sufficiently high for the chemical reaction to proceed
        with a high intensity (Ref. 170). The CO is then oxidized to CO2
        to a greater degree than in a standard engine. In the ETC tests
        (Tests 3 and 6), the Webster-Heise modification lowered CO by
        19.4 % in the Monte Carlo and 15.4 % in the Oldsmobile Cutlass
        Supreme, although in one test the decrease was 54 %. </p>
      <p>Another difficult emission to control is nitrogen oxide (NOx),
        which (together with oxidants, HC, and sunlight) is responsible
        for smog. Because NOx rises when HC is lowered, virtually all
        emission controls on standard cars are compromises. Because NOx
        peaks on the lean side of stoichometric (about 16:1 air/fuel
        ratio), it has proven to be a barrier to improved fuel economy
        (Ref. 171). </p>
      <p>The automobile industry has dealt with the problem of NOx by
        lowering the spark advance and by using exhaust gas
        recirculation (EGR) and most recently three-way catalytic
        converters. A metered amount of exhaust gas is recirculated into
        the air/fuel mixture on the intake stroke. Because these exhaust
        gases are deficient in oxygen, they slow down the combustion and
        absorb heat (Ref. 172). This retarded combustion and shortage of
        oxygen then reduces temperatures and pressures which, in turn,
        reduce NOx emissions. Unfortunately, these reductions also
        increase the HC and CO levels because less oxygen is available
        for their oxidation and for flame propagation. This can cause
        misfiring or inhibition of flame development, increase of
        cycle-by-cycle variations in combustion, deterioration of
        driveability, increase in HC and CO emissions, and other
        disadvantages (Ref. 173). </p>
      <p>The combustion rate is a very important factor inreducing NOx.
        As Thring has observed (Ref. 174): </p>
      <p>"For given engine operating conditions, there is an optimum
        rate of combustion for minimum NOx emissions from spark ignited
        engines. In essence, this is because if the combustion rate is
        too slow, there is plenty of time for NOx formation, while if it
        is too fast, charge temperature becomes very high and more NOx
        is formed. It was considered that rates of combustion higher
        than those attained in current production spark ignition engines
        might be desirable, firstly because current rates of combustion
        were believed to be slower than the optimum for minimum NOx
        emissions and secondly because previous research had indicated
        that fast burn improved the lean mixture and EGR tolerances.
        Also, there were indications that fast burn improved economy." </p>
      <p>In conventional engines, a shorter burn time would increase NOx
        emissions. Most of the total NOx comes from the first part of
        the charge to be burned, due to its continued heating by the
        combustion of the rest of the charge (Ref. 175). High turbulence
        combined with a homogeneous vaporized charge, however, should
        theoretically provide better distribution within the cylinder
        and should increase the opportunities for the oxygen to combine
        with the hydrogen and carbon in preference to the nitrogen.
        Combined with the faster flame travel, this tends to reduce the
        time-temperature histories of each element of the gas in the
        charge (Ref. 176). The faster combustion reduces the time during
        which the heating takes place and during which NOx can form.
        Because the temperatures are most intense in the primary flame,
        NOx can be greatly reduced by accelerating the combustion rate
        and by lowering the charge temperature. The addition of a slight
        amount of EGR to the chamber permits the highest efficiency
        possible while lowering NOx levels (Ref. 177). </p>
      <p>The WHV has a greater effect on NOx than on any of the other
        automobile emissions. The test car showed a 48.6% reduction in
        NOx over baseline on the Monte Carlo (cold manifold) and 45% on
        the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme (hot manifold) (Tests 3 and 6,
        Summary of Tests). Most significantly, these NOx reductions were
        achieved despite a large increase in the spark advance. The NOx
        reduction probably is due to two factors: (1) the faster
        combustion rate and (2) the shorter spray flame. Mellor has
        shown that faster evaporation leads to a shorter spray flame and
        results in less NOx production (Ref. 178). The faster
        vaporization observed by Mellor was achieved by increasing the
        pressure drop through air-assist and pressure atomizing
        injectors. </p>
      <p><b>2. Driveability ~</b> </p>
      <p>Driveability is a subjective consideration not amenable to
        quantification. There are, however, several qualitative
        observations that can be made. As would be expected in an
        essentially vaporized charge, the cold-start characteristics of
        an engine are greatly improved with the use of the WHV. Because
        the automobile uses a weak choke to obtain satisfactory HC
        emission levels in the cold-start tests, most new cars are very
        difficult to start when cold (the low vaporization rate of the
        gasoline is not sufficiently offset by fuel enrichment because
        it would increase HC emissions). As a result, the standard
        engine is provided with a choke to restrict the amount of air
        going into the cold engine so that the small amount of fuel that
        does evaporate will comprise a large enough part of the total
        air/fuel mixture to allow combustion to occur. </p>
      <p>Harrow has pointed out that all of the mixture problems
        normally present in a fully warmed-up engine are exaggerated
        during a cold start for the following reasons (Ref. 179): </p>
      <p>1. The manifold has to handle relatively large amounts of
        liquid; </p>
      <p>2. Because of the low engine speed, the gas velocities through
        the carburetor are low so that mixing is even poorer than usual;
      </p>
      <p>3. Again because of the low cranking speed, there is little
        manifold depression to encourage fuel evaporation. A consequence
        of this is that very rich mixtures must be used for starting and
        cold running, and these rich mixtures have a serious effect on
        the engine’s fuel economy. </p>
      <p>Repeated tests of the Webster-Heise equipped engines, however,
        have shown no cold-start problems. Webster-Heise claims that
        this is because the vaporization rate is very high initially,
        even at ambient temperatures. Because enrichment is unnecessary
        with the WHV, cold-start emissions are very low (see Summary of
        Tests). </p>
      <p>Because the torque is greater than standard, as discussed in
        the section on torque, performance is improved over baseline.
        One of the most chronic complaints about new domestic cars being
        built today is that they have very limited power. Although some
        specialty cars forego fuel economy in favor of high compression
        ratios and lower gearing to regain better performance, most
        manufacturers seem to have accepted the loss of performance as a
        necessity to retain fuel economy gains. The WHV makes possible
        increases in both torque and fuel economy. During the ETC tests,
        the Webster-Heise car (on 75-octane fuel) was noted by the
        certified test driver as having consistently better driveability
        than the baseline car (see Summary of Tests). </p>
      <p>Another characteristic observed in the tests is the resistance
        of the WHV to engine stalling and flooding. Because the WHV
        forces the gasoline to change state at low manifold
        temperatures, the charge is in a more combustible state for
        ignition in the combustion chamber. As a result, the air/fuel
        ratio does not have to be as rich as standard (because much more
        of the gasoline is in vapor form). Air/fuel ratios of 1:1 or 2:1
        are normally needed to provide a reliable cold start in
        conventional engines (Ref. 180). The reason most accelerators
        have to be pumped to start conventional cars is to force so much
        liquid into the manifold that enough gasoline vapor will evolve
        to permit stable combustion, although this greatly increases HC
        emissions. </p>
      <p>Improvement in combustion stability at idle has been observed
        as a characteristic of the WHV. Because the time available for
        combustion increases with a decrease in engine speed, the
        already slow combustion in standard engines is reduced to the
        point (around 500 rpm) where flame instability causes roughness
        and eventual stalling. Because the WHV appears to accelerate
        combustion, the idle limit can be lowered to a much lower speed
        (around 300 rpm) before instability appears. This could be
        especially important in reducing HC emissions and in increasing
        fuel economy in city and stop-and-go driving. </p>
      <p><b>3. Engine Maintenance ~</b> </p>
      <p>There are a variety of problems which plaque the standard
        engine and which can interfere with continued operation or, if
        severe enough, can cause engine failure. As discussed earlier,
        detonation is a most serious problem and is a common one in
        modern automobiles. Knock can cause serious damage to engine
        parts as well as limiting performance. Use of the WHV, as
        indicated in the test data in the Summary of Tests, appears to
        be even more effective than chemical additives in reducing this
        problem. </p>
      <p>Removal of the additives from gasoline, especially tetraethyl
        lead (which is not combustible), can greatly reduce the amount
        of engine deposits formed and the contamination of catalytic
        converters. The use of lead-free gasoline, for example, greatly
        reduces combustion chamber deposits which, if not removed, can
        double the HC emissions with mileage (Ref. 181). Spark-plug
        fouling from lead can also sharply reduce fuel economy. Removing
        lead, however, can cause other deposits to form in a standard
        engine. The aromatics and other octane enhancers that are
        substituted for lead tend to form carbon deposits more readily
        than leaded gasolines. This eventually causes engine octane
        requirements to increase. Webster-Heise claims that its valve
        eliminates the need for either type of additive and greatly
        reduces the formation of engine deposits when additives are
        used. </p>
      <p>The vaporization of the fuel itself is an important factor in
        reducing engine deposits. The part of the fuel that is not
        vaporized and burned will accumulate and form sludge, varnish,
        and other harmful deposits in the engine (Ref. 182). These
        carbonaceous deposits are abrasive and greatly contribute to
        engine wear, especially if the unvaporized gasoline dilutes the
        lubricating oils. It was observed during testing of the
        Webster-Heise modified car that the crankcase oil stayed clean,
        even after extensive operation, indicating an absence of carbon
        deposits in the cylinders. Webster-Heise also reported that no
        oil was consumed or needed to be added, other than for
        infrequent oil changes. When the engine was disassembled after
        80,000 miles of testing, not only were there no engine deposits
        found but the expected cylinder wear of 0.0100 to 0.0250 inch
        was found to be only 0.0025 which is within the normal factory
        tolerance (See Informal Testing, Summary of Tests. This
        represents a reduction in normal wear of between 75 and 83 %,.
        There was no appreciable crankshaft wear. </p>
      <p><b>4. Catalytic Converter Operation ~</b> </p>
      <p>A long-standing concern in automotive pollution control has
        been the need to maintain exhaust temperatures high enough to
        "light off" unburned HCs in the exhaust. The WHV reduces the
        amount of HC left after combustion but, because of its higher
        thermal efficiency (less heat is transferred to the coolant
        because of the faster burn), it also produces exhaust
        temperatures that are somewhat higher (about 4%) than standard.
        This makes the catalytic converter more effective and extends
        its useful life because the volume of pollutants that it must
        treat is lower. This is also supported by the fact that the
        engine coolant temperature is lower than standard and exhaust
        temperatures are higher, indicating greater thermal
        efficiencies. </p>
