      ...Dr. Khavinson found that introducing epithalamin into mammals
      resulted in a reversal of age related diseases, and a reversal of
      the signs of aging. He was able to take geriatric female mice, who
      were no longer fertile, give them epithalamin, and after about two
      weeks of treatment, the mice became fertile again, got pregnant
      and had pups.[4] He showed that Epitalon induces telomerase
      activity in human somatic cells, proving that telomeres were
      lengthened by the peptide.[5] The synthetic version of epithalamin
      was patented by Dr. Khavinson and called “Epitalon” (also
      sometimes called epithalon since the original word is in Russian).
      It was approved for general use in the Soviet Union in 1990 and
      has been used in gerontology there ever since. No adverse side
      effects have ever been reported, according to Dr. Khavinson.<br>
      <br>
      Since Epitalon is patented and trademarked, no drug company will
      research it. Since drug companies pay for almost all of the
      research on new medicines, no human clinical trials have been done
      in the West on it. Almost all of the research has been done by Dr.
      Khavinson and his associates. The results of his research are
      startling: for example, the application of Epithalamin diminished
      mortality in aged humans by 1.8 times over a 6 year period of
      observation. [6] Here in the West, Epitalon is sold as a research
      chemical, not approved by the FDA for any purpose, but unregulated
      for research purposes. Anyone who uses it is considered a
      “researcher,” in other words.<br>
      <br>
      Epitalon is a small peptide of 4 amino acids: <b>Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly</b>
      and can be administered via injection, as a nasal spray, or
      through the skin. The most effective route of administering it is
      via injection, either subcutaneously or intramuscularly. The
      peptide is typically given 2-3 times a day for 10-20 days in doses
      of 5-10 mg each. This cycle is repeated once every six to twelve
      months, but Epitalon can be given as often as desired. There are
      no negative side effects from the drug ever reported in over 100
      studies on the peptide and from clinical use in Russia since 1990.
      Epitalon works mainly on the endocrine system but has effects on
      the entire body.[7]<br>
      <br>
      When I first started taking it, my sense of smell returned, my
      digestion improved and I slept better. I have also noted positive
      changes in my vision and hearing. All of these functions are
      related to the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system.
      Epitalon has been shown to restore normal melatonin production in
      aging monkeys, as well as restore the normal circadian rhythm for
      cortisol production, both of which result in better sleep at
      night.[8]<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Epitalon, Part II: Mechanism of Action</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      ...Epitalon is a synthetic peptide which were originally developed
      based upon the action of epithalamin, a hormone produced by the
      pineal gland. This hormone was found to stimulate the production
      of telomerase, an enzyme which plays a role in maintaining
      telomere length. Telomeres are non-coding terminal regions of DNA
      strands which preserve the integrity of the strand. With each
      revision, telomeres are shortened until the DNA strand cannot be
      further replicated. This process is highly implicated in the
      ageing process. Elongating telomeres theoretically extend the
      lifespan of a copy of DNA and allows it to replicate more times
      than usual. This was the theory behind the development of
      Epitalon®, a synthetic version of epithalamin which also
      stimulates the production of telomerase. Indeed, this theory has
      been confirmed in vitro in human cell cultures[1]...<br>

        Abstract</b><br>
      The 20 month-long treatment of female rats with daily doses of 0.1
      or 0.5 mg of polypeptide pineal extract (PPE) per animal increased
      their lifespan by 10 and 25%, respectively, as compared with
      controls. At the age of 16--18 months, 38% of control rats
      exhibited persistent disturbances in estral function (constant
      estrus or repeated pseudogestations), whereas these disorders were
      observed in 7% of experimental animals only. After administration
      of PPE to 16--18 month-old female rats checked for sterility by a
      two-week mating, a second mating period resulted in gestation
      development in four out of 16 animals and deliveries, accordingly.
      While chronic treatment with PPE did not affect the rate of
      neoplasm incidence, the mean age of tumour detection in the
      control group was 697 days and in experimental groups it was 811
      and 868 days, respectively. Certain aspects of the
      interrelationship of rate of ageing, lifespan and specific age
      pathology are discussed.<br>

      <b></b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN:<br>
      Researchers of the St. Petersburg Institute of Bioregulation and
      Gerontology of the North-Western Branch of the Russian Academy of
      Medical Sciences and the Institute of Gerontology of the Ukrainian
      Academy of Medical Sciences (Kiev) clinically assessed the
      geroprotective effects of thymic (Thymalin) and pineal
      (Epithalamin) peptide bioregulators in 266 elderly and older
      persons during 6-8 years. The bioregulators were applied for the
      first 2-3 years of observation.<br>
      <br>
      RESULTS:<br>
      The obtained results convincingly showed the ability of the
      bioregulators to normalize the basic functions of the human
      organism, i.e. to improve the indices of cardiovascular,
      endocrine, immune and nervous systems, homeostasis and metabolism.
      Homeostasis restoration was accompanied by a 2.0-2.4-fold decrease
      in acute respiratory disease incidence, reduced incidence of the
      clinical manifestations of ischemic heart disease, hypertension
      disease, deforming osteoarthrosis and osteoporosis as compared to
      the control. Such a significant improvement in the health state of
      the peptide-treated patients correlated with decreased mortality
      rate during observation: 2.0-2.1-fold in the Thymalin-treated
      group; 1.6-1.8-fold in the Epithalamin-treated group; 2.5-fold in
      the patients treated with Thymalin plus Epithalamin as compared to
      the control. A separate group of patients was treated with
      Thymalin in combination with Epithalamin annually for 6 years and
      their mortality rate decreased 4.1 times as compared to the
      control.<br>
      <br>
      CONCLUSIONS:<br>
      The obtained data confirmed the high geroprotective efficacy of
      Thymalin and Epithalamin and the expediency of their application
      in medicine and social care for health maintenance and age-related
      pathology prevention in persons over 60 to prolong their active
      longevity.<br>
