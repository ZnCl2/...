      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BERTIL WERJEFELT AND THE MAGNETIC
        BATTERY-GENERATOR</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Bertil Werjefelt sports a Hawaiian suntan because the islands are
      his adopted home, but he has little time for the beach. Consulting
      on aviation safety, overseeing a small corporation, and writing
      technical papers make up only part of his life. Werjefelt has also
      been working on a magnet-energy device for several decades. A
      representative of the Sumitomo Corporation who visited Werjefelt's
      manufacturing facility said that the invention could be "the most
      important discovery this century."<br>
      <br>
      Werjefelt was educated in his native Sweden and then came to the
      United States in the early 1960s. He furthered his education in
      mechanical engineering at both the University of Utah and the
      University of Hawaii. He now heads a research and development
      group, Poly Tech USA, that devises safety equipment for airplanes'
      such as a system that allows pilots to see the flight path and
      vital instruments regardless of how much smoke is in the cockpit.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A New Device From Old Concepts</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In the 1970s, Werjefelt was one of many people who became
      concerned about the problem of fossil-fuel pollution. So he used
      his engineering background to create an energy invention - a
      generator powered by energy extracted from magnetic fields.<br>
      <br>
      Standard generators, which use magnets, are subject to a problem
      known as magnetic drag. Drag is a residual magnetism that slows
      the spinning of the rotor, the part that either moves the magnets
      past an electric coil or the coil past the magnets, depending on
      the generators design. Werjefelt improved the standard generator;
      he added a special spinning system that cancels magnetic drag by
      counteracting it with the force fields of additional magnets. The
      result is a generator that puts out more power with the same
      input.<br>
      <br>
      That raises a question: Where does the excess energy come from? "I
      don't know," Werjefelt says. "It could be [space] energy, or
      something we don't even know about."<br>
      <br>
      Werjefelt's experimental models have not yet evolved into the
      Remanufacturing stage they have only produced more power output
      than input for several minutes at a time. But results are
      impressive enough to keep him going. For example, at one point his
      generator has shown <span style="font-weight: bold;">160 watts
        input and 450 watts output</span>, or almost triple the power.
      He believes his crew has solved some of the most troublesome
      technical problems and that magnetically powered electric
      generators could be available for everyday use within a few years.<br>
      <br>
      Some onlookers in the new-energy field are as impressed with the
      scientific paperwork Werjefelt has done as they are with his
      experimental models. After he came up with the design, Werjefelt
      realized that he would need to explain the results in order to get
      a patent. He would also need to convince a skeptical scientific
      community.<br>
      <br>
      So Werjefelt dug into the physics literature and found evidence to
      Support his claim. He used this evidence in a 1995 lecture at MIT
      to argue that standard science's teachings on magnetism have been
      incomplete from the beginning, and that as a result, the
      scientific community declared early on that it was impossible to
      use magnetism as an energy source. The other fundamental forces in
      nature nuclear physics and gravitation have been harnessed in the
      forms of nuclear power plants and hydroelectric dams, but science
      has been blind to the possibility of using magnetism as a source
      of power.<br>
      <br>
      In general, though, Werjefelt refuses to become caught up in what
      he calls "paralysis by analysis." He is more interested in proving
      that his device works. "Look at it as a quantum leap in the energy
      field,'' he says, "like the leap from slide rulers to handheld
      electric calculators."<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Corporate Interest From Japan</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In 1990, Werjefelt sent a notice to large corporations such as
      General Electric and Westinghouse in the United States, Siemens in
      Europe, and Hitachi and Sumitomo in Japan about his discovery Most
      of the replies were, "It is not possible." Others thanked him and
      said, "Call us when the patent is issued."<br>
      <br>
      It turned out that the Japanese were very interested in magnets
      and energy. In October 1993, Japanese television aired a program,
      The Dream Energy, in which Japanese scientist Terohiko Kawai
      discussed a device similar to Werjefelt's.<br>
      <br>
      Well-funded Japanese research teams have engineered this discovery
      into reliable units for existing motors. Werjefelt spent two days
      with an official from Sumitomo and learned that the Japanese
      motors are running for hours, days, weeks. Japanese industrialists
      are switching over to the new units, which will use about half as
      much fossil fuel as existing motors. For example, the television
      program showed a refrigerator, a vacuum cleaner, and other common
      appliances with such motors.<br>
      <br>
      Werjefelt, on the other hand, is more interested in producing
      electricity. He estimates that if power plants are built using his
      Magnetic Battery-Generator instead of conventional equipment, they
      could put out fifteen to eighteen times as much electricity. <br>

      <br>
      ...Bert Werjefelt from PolyTech(USA) in Hawaii spoke about his
      work on magnetic motors and the theory behind them. He reported
      that experiments have seen output powers of 450 watts electric,
      with only 150 watts electric going in. Attempts at seif-sustaining
      have been successful for periods of minutes. The company now
      thinks it knows how to make a self-sustained operation continue
      indefinitely and is building one right now, expected to be ready
      in the next month or two. He showed gorgeous CAD diagrams of the
      100-200 watt "self-sustainer" now under construction in Hawaii. He
      explained how it worked (the precise balancing of repulsion and
      attraction systems to substantially reduce torque). It was obvious
      that many, if not most, in the audience accepted his apparently
      very solid experimental conclusions — even some I would have
      thought would have left in disgust. Werjefelt put forth his
      theoretical ideas, which are based, in part, on suggestions made
      by several (now) Nobel laureate physicists in the 1950s regarding
      nuclear magnetic spin systems (Pound, Purcell, and Ramsey). Others
      in the audience were extremely excited by this report, and put
      forth their theoretical ideas. Werjefelt is a solid mechanical
      engineer, whose company manufactures pioneering FAA-certified
      safety equipment. He is deeply involved in aviation safety issues
      and would have much credibility to lose if he were not on
      absolutely solid ground with this magnetic energy technology. He
      has been working quietly in this field for about ten years. On the
      advice of his patent attorneys, he published his general ideas in
      an article titled, "Magnetic Battery," in that counter-scientific
      culture journal, "Extraordinary Science" (Tesla Society),
      May/June/July 1993, which is available in places like Barnes &amp;
      Noble book stores. Don't let your prejudices about the Tesla
      Society fool you, this is a very carefully crafted scientific
      article with some excellent possible avenues to explain concrete
      experimental results. The 8-minute video tape of the Japanese
      developments in this area of "Dream Energy" (Magnetic Energy) "was
      shown. This had aired on FUJI TV in Japan on October 20, 1993.
      There are four major corporations involved under MITI aegis:
      Sumitomo, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, and Matsushita. Werjefelt's company
      appears to have a very strong patent position in his area,
      however. The chief engineer of the Aerospace Division of Sumitomo
      has visited Werjefelt and told him that this discovery is "the
      greatest discovery of the 20th century."<br>

      &nbsp;<br>
      February 15, 1994 - The following release is the latest update
      from Bert Werjefelt's work on Magnetic Batteries, published in
      Summer Fall `93 Edition of <span style="font-style: italic;">Electrifying






        Times</span>, titled "A New Source of power: Magnetic
      Batteries."<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">NOTE:</span>&nbsp; We report
      Bert's work&nbsp; again because David Hudson's work and Bert
      Werjefelt's work are revolutionary and is necessary to understand
      in order to appreciate the advanced technology of
      superconductivity, over-unity, cold fusion and fusion, antigravity
      and alchemy.&nbsp; The Japanese appreciated this technology and
      took Bert seriously <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Battery Prototype
        Equipment</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      This is to inform you of what has happened since the publication
      of the Magnetic Battery article in Extraordinary Science (a
      simplified basic explanation of our discovery, which includes an
      elementary prototype experimental set up, utilizing some of the
      basic principles) and your subsequent article in Electrifying
      Times "A New Source of Power; Magnetic Batteries."&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Last year we notified many industry leaders in the U.S., Europe,
      and Asia of our discovery that energy can he extracted from
      magnetism. With very few exceptions, we were told that it is
      "impossible" this "appears to violate the laws of physics."&nbsp;
      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Regardless of the common disbelieves, I am very pleased to inform
      you that scientists at Meiji and Waseda universities in Japan and
      researches with Sumitomo Corporation have now proven out point by
      successfully extracting substantial energy from magnetism. In a
      recent visit to our facility. Sumitomo told us this is in all
      likelihood "the most important discovery this century." We are, of
      course, very pleased that such prestigious academic institutions
      and one of Japan's largest and most successful industrial
      concerns, have now also confirmed our findings. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The abstract of Werjefelt's scientific paper in April June '93
      issue of Extraordinary Science reads as follows: "The
      circumstances under which electricity can be derived directly from
      magnetic materials magnetic fields are discussed and reviewed in
      the context of the standard formulations of the conservation law.
      The possibility of extracting energy in the aforementioned manner
      is in conflict with this law. However, it is not in conflict with
      a recognized exception to this law; the third corollary of the 2nd
      law of thermodynamics. This is demonstrated and thereby confirms
      the possibility of the development of magnetic batteries
      magnetically powered electric generators/turbines. An elementary
      description of the process is provided and described in full. It
      is disclosed the magnetic batteries can maintain permanent
      electric circuits at normal temperatures and therefore function as
      macroscopic high temperature superconductors.&nbsp; It is believed
      that it can be deduced from the disclosures that the time interval
      from this discovery to the time of applied tehnology and hardware
      for everyday use can be very short (on the order of a few
      years).&nbsp; Because of the simple straightforward nature of ths
      discovery it can easily be placed into development and production
      with already available knowledge and technology in a mature field
      of science and engineering."&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      It is possible&nbsp; that we are on the brink of being able to
      directly extract electricity from one of the fundamental forces in
      nature (gravitation, the strong and the weak nuclear forces, and
      magnetism). "Electrifying Times interviewed Werjefelt to find out
      more about this potentially very far reaching discovery. <br>
      <br>
      As Werjefelt points out, this discovery is in direct contradiction
      to the current formulation of the laws of conservation of mass and
      energy. However, he says, it is not in contradiction to a little
      known hut scientifically fully accepted exception to the basic
      conservation laws. Scientists with impeccable credentials (Nobel
      Prize winner) involved in research on lasers, masers, microwave
      technology, and atomic clocks, were instrumental in formulating
      this exception to the conservation laws, which is referred to as
      "Negative Absolute Temperature". As Werjefelt explains, as early
      as the 1950s, they had discovered that a crystal of lithium
      fiuc&nbsp; tide when given a burst of microwave radiation would
      emit far&nbsp; more radiation than it received. In other words, in
      some way the crystals functioned as an amplification mechanism.
      The subsequent explanation for this phenomena was documented by
      Norman F. Ramsey, Professor Emeritus of Physics at Harvard
      University,&nbsp; as a consequence of tile actions of the magnetic
      movement of two distinct spin systems in the atomic structure of
      the crystals (This I&nbsp;&nbsp; exception to the Conservation
      Laws is now accepted and noted in the encyclopedias)&nbsp; In
      other words, as Werjefelt explains, the magnetic energy inherent
      to the material (crystal) becomes activated by coupling two
      distinct magnetic spin systems in the atomic structure and can
      thereby emit vast amounts of energy far in excess of the input
      energy to the system (crystal) Dr. Wright in a later June/March
      1994 "Extraordinary Science" article questions the magnetic
      battery... <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</span>&nbsp; A method
      for producing electricity comprises the steps of providing a
      source of magnetic field (10); providing a system (10 and 26) for
      extracting energy from the magnetic field, the system having a
      certain efficiency level; and inputting energy (2E¿f?) to the
      system to at least compensate for losses from the certain
      efficiency level, thereby causing the system to operate to
      generate energy from the magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates generally to method and apparatus
      for deriving electricity from magnetism. The present invention is
      representative of many physical systems including the fundamental
      structure of matter. The field of the invention therefore ranges
      from the microscopic to the macroscopic. For example, the
      invention provides an enhanced understanding of phenomena ranging
      from photon-electron/positron conversion and the population
      inversions of lasers and other amplification systems to
      superconductivity with itfs enigmas of pair-bonding and Cooper
      pairs as well as common conduction and nuclear processes. We also
      believe guantum physics phenomena may be better understood and
      possible to manipulate based on the disclosures herein.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Current methods for producing or generating electricity have their
      origin in the primary energy source of nuclear power or in the
      energy derived from the gravitation field or a combination of
      both. These forces are fundamental to nature and matter (e.g. the
      strong and weak nuclear forces and gravitation) . By example, it
      should be noted that the nuclear forces that are recognized as
      powering the sun are in turn transmitted to earth via
      electromagnetic radiation means, to fuel the growth of plants,
      which later become the source for petroleum. Alternately, heat
      from the sun create the winds for power, or the same heat lifts
      the rain ladened clouds to rejuvenate water reservoirs or rivers
      to drive the combined heat and gravitational cycle of the
      hydroelectric generation of electricity.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the previously mentioned primary forces of nature,
      the fourth, and last one, is electromagnetism. Up until this time,
      this force, dipolar in nature, has not been thought of as useful
      for the purposes of a primary energy source other than in the more
      or less static sense, utilizing the forces of permanent magnets in
      ballbearings or delicate mechanical suspension systems, or as an
      exciter in electric generators.<br>
      <br>
      In virtually all applications to date, magnetic fields, whether
      permanent or electric in origin, are used as conduits or
      conversion mechanisms for altering one form of power to another,
      i.e., mechanical to electrical or vice versa.<br>
      <br>
      The inventions disclosed herein will describe how it can be
      accomplished to directly generate useful energy from magnetic
      fields by incorporating them so they function as the primary
      energy sources as well as the conduits. In other words, where
      electromagnetis functions in whole or in part as the primary input
      energy source for the production of electricity. It is puzzling
      that electromagnetism, another fundamental force of nature, which
      mathematically follows essentially the same formulation as
      gravity, would not be used as an energy source in the way that
      gravity is utilized. Nevertheless, such has been the case until
      now. Furthermore, although we make extensive use and reference of
      "negative absolute temperature" systems, this esoteric side of
      science is necessary to put the present invention into proper
      thermodynamic perspective. It is also an effort to bridge the well
      known theoretical gap between thermodynamics and electromagnetism.
      However, it should also be noted that the descriptions herein
      serve as an explanation for the internal geometries and dynamics
      of negative absolute temperature states. These states appear to be
      derived from an intricately balanced magnetic pairing mechanism
      between two or more spin systems, ranging from nuclear to
      macroscopic.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, to assist in understanding the inventions it is helpful
      to consider the primary spin systems referred to in the text as
      analogies, or the electromagnetic equivalents, of the combined
      heat and gravitational cycles that comprise the primary energy
      sources for the hydroelectric process. These continuously and
      oppositely directed forces function as the seemingly inexhaustible
      energy reservoirs for the hydroelectric process. The same
      functions can be accomplished electromagnetically.<br>
      <br>
      In view of the preceding explanations, the following background
      and description of the inventions will be easier to comprehend.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetism and electricity have long been known to be closely
      related. Despite their close association, a comprehensive
      understanding of their interrelationship remains elusive. Dirac
      proposed the existence of monopoles to account for contradictions
      inherent to the mathematical formulation of electromagnetism.
      After more than 50 years, the existence of monopoles has not been
      verified.<br>
      <br>
      The phenomenon of permanent magnetism is in many ways similar to
      the permanent electrical circuits created in superconducting
      materials. Since its discovery in 1911 by H.K. Onnes,
      superconductivity has fascinated and perplexed the scientific
      community, particularly in regard to the capability of creating a
      continuous energy loop in apparent contradiction of Lenz's law and
      the 2nd law of thermodynamics as they are currently written and
      understood. Lenz's law states that "when the flux through a
      secondary circuit is changed because of the relative motion of
      primary and secondary circuits, the direction of the induced
      current in the secondary is related to the mechanical force
      between the circuits or as defined by Maxwell: "If a constant
      current flows in the primary circuit A, and if, by the motion of A
      or the secondary circuit B, a current is induced in B, the
      direction of this induced current will be such that, by its
      electromagnetic action on A, it tends to oppose the relative
      motion of the circuits." A generator is an example of this law;
      the currents induced by the relative motion of the field and
      armature tend to oppose the motion, and it requires mechanical
      power to keep up the rotation of the generator.<br>
      <br>
      Superconductivity is defined as the ability of certain substances
      to display perfect conductivity enabling the formation of a
      permanent electrical circuit, despite the removal of the
      current-inducing magnetic field. A subsidiary effect of
      superconductive phenomenon are magnetic levitation/suspension
      characteristics displayed by superconducting materials (i.e.,
      Meissner effect and magnetic suspension) . The magnetic
      levitation/suspension process has been attributed to diamagnetism
      by many researchers. As opposed to levitation, the suspension of a
      magnet below a superconducting material requires paramagnetic
      forces to be directed upward towards the superconductor
      (effectively an "attractive" force) to balance the downward
      gravitational force. It would appear that paramagnetism and
      diamagnetism may be at work at the same time in the same system.
      The ability to suspend a magnet either above or below a
      superconductor at the same time may on the other hand imply that
      an electric circuit has been created that is switching at
      extremely high speeds, consequently switching the magnetic
      polarity of the field that is created by the circuit.
      Alternatively, microscopic circuits may be moving in opposite
      directions, creating the same effect.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the relative ease which measurements can be made on
      small samples, the absence of resistance and the Meissner effect
      are the characteristics most commonly measured to verify
      superconductivity and therefore, the most identifiable to the
      layperson. However, recent discoveries appear to indicate that
      perfect conductivity can be realized in the absence of the
      Meissner effect. Another way of measuring perfect conductivity or
      absence of resistance in a (superconductive) system can be
      accomplished by comparing the total energy input relative to the
      output (i.e., no losses = 100% efficient). This applies to both
      macroscopic and microscopic systems.<br>
      <br>
      The existence of a permanent electrical circuit (loop) , wherein a
      superconductive circuit was created and self-maintained (at the
      requisite superconductive temperature) for over one year with no
      measurable decay, is now considered common knowledge. Using
      nuclear resonance to assess the continuity of the created
      superconductive circuit, no change in field or current strength is
      expected for times less than (1010)10 years, i.e., a truly perfect
      and apparently permanent electrical circuit is created. In
      relation to currently known superconductive processes, extremely
      high temperature superconducting systems have been ascribed to the
      processes associated with Neutron stars.<br>
      <br>
      The recent discovery of the Y-Li-Sr/Ba-Cu Oxides, Thallium, and
      other superconducting compounds (Ln2.?Ce?Cu04.y (Ln=Pr,Nd,Sm) )
      has significantly raised the operating temperatures required for
      superconductivity to levels above 90*K (-183*C) , where easily
      obtainable and inexpensive liquid nitrogen can be employed to cool
      and maintain the material in a superconductive state. The present
      goal of superconductor researchers is to attain a room temperature
      (or higher) superconductor. Ideally, the superconductive
      temperature should be high enough to permit the extraction of heat
      or light from the superconductive circuit (e.g., the operating
      temperature of filaments in incandescent light bulbs) , thereby
      accommodating common needs in everyday society.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the ease in demonstrating superconductive effects and the
      corresponding plethora of practical and theoretical
      investigations, theories that completely account for the phenomena
      remain unresolved. An early account of superconductivity was
      provided by Bardeen et al. , wherein it was proposed that
      electron-phonon interactions were responsible for the
      superconductive phenomenon. Recent theoretical explanations have
      proposed that electron conduction interactions resulting from
      magnetic processes in coupled spin systems produce the
      superconductive effect. In addition, superconductivity based on
      current-carrying "electrons" instead of "holes" (areas devoid of
      electrons) in Cerium cuprates (Ln2.?Ce?Cu?.) has been recently
      discovered. Citing inconsistencies with the 2nd law of
      thermodynamics, Gal-Or proposed that a room-temperature
      macroscopic superconductor may provide the required
      symmetric/asymmetric link between thermodynamics 5 and
      electromagnetism (as will be described herein) .<br>
      <br>
      Contradictions to fundamental thermodynamic theorems and the
      search for explanations, as well as experimental results requiring
      modifications of the thermodynamic theorems, are not without
      precedence. Nearly 40 years ago, Purcell and Pound discovered the
      existence of negative absolute temperatures. Subsequently, Ramsey
      documented that negative absolute temperatures constitute an
      exception to the conventional formulation of the 2nd law of
      thermodynamics, whereby in "special systems", entropy or 15 the
      degree of disorder can decrease with increasing energy (negative
      absolute temperatures now constitute an accepted corollary to the
      2nd law; elementary descriptions can be found in current
      encyclopedias) . Ramsey explained that this process may best
      describe the self-maintained oscillating systems ("population
      inversions" related to masers/lasers) discovered by Townes and
      co-workers and Bloembergen, although no internal thermodynamic
      equilibrium is said to exist within spin systems associated with
      molecular beam experiments.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted by Ramsey that at negative absolute temperatures,
      various novel properties can be observed (e.g., attenuating
      systems become amplifiers, most resistances are negative) .
      Magnetic Carnot cycles can be made to function at negative
      absolute temperatures and efficiencies can be very large (T2/T1
      &gt; 1) . However, up until now, no means has yet been devised in
      which a Carnot cycle can be operated between positive and negative
      absolute temperatures.<br>

      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">MAGNETIC COROLLARY TO A CARNOT
        CYCLE </span><br>
      <br>
      We present a preliminary disclosure of our basic theories and
      experimental proof whereby magnetism is a direct primary source of
      electricity by means of unique magnetic/energy gradients. The
      dipolar nature of magnetism (i.e., the two opposing forces of
      attraction and repulsion) makes this possible, whereas by analogy,
      if the singular attractive force of gravity could have an equal
      and opposite repulsive force, energy could be harnessed directly
      from gravitation in a continuous, unlimited process.<br>
      <br>
      We describe the manner in which spin systems can operate at
      negative absolute temperatures as well as between positive and
      negative absolute temperatures. Intriguingly, this can be
      accomplished in a functional macroscopic framework as a
      "superconductor at any temperature", providing the link between
      thermodynamics and electromagnetism. Our negative absolute
      temperature system can be described as the "Magnetic Corollary of
      the Carnot Cycle" or MCS (MCCC) . The system operating between
      positive and negative temperatures is referred to as the "Expanded
      Magnetic Corollary of the Carnot Cycle" or EMC1. Operating such
      cycles permit the extraction of energy from magnetic fields and
      the establishment of superconductive states at all temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      As stated earlier, creation of a superconductive or permanent
      electric circuit is in apparent contradiction to Lenz's law since
      seemingly no "induced" electromagnetic force is required to
      maintain the circuit. Up until now, the magnetically-induced drag
      forces described by Lenz's law have never been questioned as being
      possible to manipulate, nor have the magnetically attractive
      forces in single or multiple dipolar systems. The current inducing
      magnetic field (required by Lenz's law) that appears to be absent
      in superconductive systems may actually be overshadowed by the
      dominant magnetic moment forces, but still functioning in one or
      more of the individual spin systems that comprise the overall MCJ
      system. We consider superconductive phenomena as transition states
      between positive and negative absolute temperature. In addition to
      other beneficial implications, we will demonstrate that this
      approach provides clarification to the apparent conflict that
      exists between the observation of superconductive circuits and the
      ostensible contradiction of Lenz's law.<br>
      <br>
      Negative absolute temperature is explained and defined beginning
      with the 3rd corollary of the 2nd law as follows:<br>
      <br>
      "A system in a stable equilibrium state can receive but cannot
      produce work. Although this statement is satisfactory for all
      ordinary systems, recent developments in the theory of nuclear
      spins-the spinning of neutrons and protons of the atomic nucleus
      that contributes to both the angular momentum and the magnetic
      moment of the atom-have shown that some systems, which will be
      called special systems, in stable equilibrium states can produce
      work but cannot receive work.<br>
      <br>
      A special system requires the following characteristics: (1) the
      energy of its allowed states has a finite upper limit; and (2) it
      must be coextensive in space with another system that shields it
      from work interactions that would change its volume or the
      velocity of its parts. For example, a lithium fluoride crystal may
      be considered to contain two distinct systems occupying the same
      space. The first, a special system, consists of the nuclear spins
      of the atoms of the crystal and has the energy of these spins. The
      second, a normal system, consists of the same atoms in the
      crystal, but its energy does not include that of the nuclear spins
      of the atoms. The stable equilibrium states of the two systems can
      be identified and distinguished because each comes to equilibrium
      in itself much more rapidly than they together approach mutual
      stable equilibrium."<br>
      <br>
      We achieve negative absolute temperature states by unifying two
      separate spin systems, one "normal" and one "special", to form one
      coupled spin system. Based on the accepted definition above, to
      assess whether negative absolute temperatures have been attained,
      any one of the following conditions apply: (1) Upon removal of the
      input energy, the angular velocity and the magnetic moment of
      individual spin systems will decay faster than the coupled system;
      or (2) Each individual spin system will require more energy to
      sustain a given angular velocity and overcome the magnetic moment
      relative to the coupled system; or (3) More energy is required to
      bring individual spin systems up to a specific angular velocity
      and/or magnetic moment relative to the coupled system.<br>
      <br>
      A series of simple schematics show the requisites of an elementary
      MC1 spin system. Following is a description of how negative
      absolute temperature states are achieved in macroscopic models.<br>
      <br>
      A first spin system ("Normal" Attractive Spin System or NA) , as
      best shown in Figure 1, consists of an interior dipole 2 (e.g.,
      permanent magnet rotor) and exterior neutral poles 4 (e.g.,
      ferromagnetic stator), which together create a cyclic magnetic
      circuit (e.g., the basis for a 2-pole electric generator) ,
      whereby the neutral poles 4 assume the opposite polarity of the
      respective interactive poles of the spinning dipole 2. The
      magnetic relationship between the interior and exterior poles is
      an attractive force.<br>
      <br>
      A second spin system ("Special" Repelling Spin System or SR) , as
      best shown in Figure 2, consists of interior and exterior
      repelling poles 6 and d, respectively (e.g., permanent magnets on
      both rotor and stator with "like" interactive repelling pole
      faces; the other non-interactive pole faces, at opposite ends of
      their respective dipoles, are isolated from interaction. In more
      complex system designs (e.g., lattice structures or frameworks) ,
      the isolated poles may actually be utilized as interactive poles.
      Although permanent magnets are used, a person of ordinary skill in
      the art will understand that electromagnets or combinations of
      permanent magnets and electromagnets can be used efficiently, once
      the technology is optimized.<br>
      <br>
      Each respective spin system revolves through a cycle of magnetic
      gradients during each 160* of rotation. (Note that inertial mass
      or the effects of conventional momentum of systems in motion are
      well known and in fact enhance the performance of the system.
      Therefore, for the purpose of simplicity of explanation, these
      forces are not considered in the models described herein) .
      Starting at 0 °, the NA is in a strong stable state due to the
      interactive attraction between the interior attractive dipole 2
      and the exterior neutral pole 4; energy Ee is required (i.e.,
      "external energy" Ee) to revolve the interior attractive pole 2
      toward 90* (akin to a braking system). At 90* (equidistant from
      the two exterior neutral poles 4) , a weak unstable state exists
      in the NA due to the attractive forces from the direction of both
      exterior poles 4. Continuing from 90* to ldO", no energy is
      required (by virtue of its "internal energy" E- which is inherent
      to permanent magnets) to revolve the interior attractive dipole 2
      because of the attractive forces of the opposite interior/exterior
      poles (assuming these forces are greater than the friction of the
      system) . The procedure is repeated through the next ldO* to
      complete a revolution.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast to the NA, the SR, because of the opposing polarities,
      experiences exactly the opposite conditions; at 0° , the SR is in
      a strong unstable state due to the interactive repulsion between
      the stator and rotor pole faces; no energy is required (as a
      result of the "internal energy" E,) to advance the interior
      repulsive pole 6 toward 90". At 90", a weak stable state exists in
      the SR due to the repulsive forces exerted by both the 0° and ldO"
      exterior repulsive poles acting on the interior repulsive poles 6
      (akin to a braking system). From 90° to 180°, energy Ee is
      required ("external energy") to revolve the interior repulsive
      pole 6, due to the repulsive forces of the "like"
      interior/exterior poles 8. The procedure is repeated through the
      next ldO" to complete a revolution. A curious observation is that
      when the SR is considered as an isolated system, it appears to
      have no reasonable macroscopic or sub-atomic function, except as a
      "phase-coupling device"; any energy received at the SR is output
      in the same form, less the frictional losses (i.e., no energy
      conversion - just losses) . The conventional measurement of
      electrical degrees cannot be applied in this system (SR) , nor can
      the conventional dipole moment. This, may be the reason that it
      has taken so long to establish fundamental theories relating to
      these overall phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      The negative temperature state (MC3 ) will be achieved by coupling
      the two NA and SR spin systems, as best shown in Figure 4. The
      most important factor in the coupling is that an equally stable
      state of one spin system is precisely coupled to an equally
      unstable state of the other spin system ("out-of-phase" coupling,
      akin to the function of population inversions in lasers) ,
      eliminating or nullifying the resistance or attenuation of the
      individual spin systems to provide a collective display of zero
      magnetic moment (magnetic torque force cancellation; assuming
      essentially the same magnetic torque forces/magnetic moment for
      each respective spin system) . Conversely, when the two respective
      spin systems are coupled exactly "in phase", the result is a
      maximum resistance. Therefore, a continuum in resistance exists
      from a minimum (zero) at exact "out-of-phase" coupling to a
      maximum at the point of exact "in-phase" coupling. The range in
      conductance (lack of resistance) in all materials (e.g., elements
      and compounds) may relate to the degree of proper phase coupling
      in the atomic or molecular structure. All of the varying states
      between minima and maxima in the NA and SR systems have been
      proportionally coupled; the internal potential energy of one
      system is coupled to the exterior energy requirements of the other
      system and vice versa. In terms of magnetic moment (torque forces)
      , there is no difference between the NA and the SR component,
      individually both systems act as resistors or attenuators. The
      "external energy" required to drive the SR can be minimized by
      altering the interactive pole face geometries (lowering the
      amplitude of the "external energy" mechanical torque curve) ,
      resulting in a more efficient use of energy. It is interesting to
      note that a unique magnetic/energy gradient also exists between
      the magnetically isolated interactive NA and SR spin systems, the
      gradient being from repelling to attractive. We theorize that two
      types of individual magnetic gradients are acting in the Magnetic
      Corollary to the Carnot Cycle (MCCC) : adiabatic positive
      compression and negative expansion on the SR side, and isothermal
      negative compression and positive expansion on the NA, wherein
      "positive" refers to "force required" and "negative" refers to "no
      force required". The SR is viewed as being "adiabatic" due to the
      absence of a magnetic circuit between stator and rotor.
      Conversely, the NA is "isothermal" due to the creation of a
      magnetic circuit or exchange between the stator and rotor. A third
      type of magnetic/energy gradient exists between the two spin
      systems. Ideally, this gradient should be equal to zero and at the
      same time constitute the most "out-of-phase" coupling that is
      possible between the two spin systems. This will result in maximum
      amplification within the allowable energy states.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, we consider the magnets and their fields (individually
      and collectively) to constitute the requisite reservoirs to
      generically describe Carnot cycles. By analogy, it can be said
      that "fuel" provides the replenishment in Carnot's reservoirs,
      whereas such replenishment needs are already inherent in MC1 and
      EMC3 systems because of the fundamental nature of magnetism.<br>
      <br>
      Torque forces are effectively nullified by the precise "coupling"
      or "pinning" of the contrasting spin systems (Note: this is a
      contrived state because the systems resist this coupling) .
      Therefore, by virtue of the definition and as will be shown in our
      test results, the coupled system appears to be in the negative
      absolute temperature state since each individual spin system
      displays distinct magnetically induced torque forces (positive and
      negative compression and expansion forces) , whereas the precisely
      coupled MC3 system displays no net magnetically induced torque
      forces, only frictional forces, even though the attracting and
      repelling states of the individual respective spin systems are
      undiminished. In this regard, the MC3 system contrasts with common
      Carnot cycles (in the positive temperature regime) , which by
      definition display net expansion and compression forces. To
      prevent interference problems and aid in balancing the forces of
      the two spin systems by making dissimilar fields precisely
      opposite one another (i.e., fine tuning magnetic field gradients)
      , various pole face geometries, magnetic shielding methods, or the
      like may be in place within and between respective spin systems.<br>
      <br>
      The general MC3 example described herein is obviously not limited
      to the specific geometry shown. MC3 can be achieved using a
      variety of geometric configurations, including variations in size
      and absolute number of poles, as well as the interactive distances
      between poles and their relative direction of rotation. The
      multitude of potential macroscopic configurations are comparable
      to the assortment of superconducting geometric structures
      intrinsic to individual naturally occurring elements (e.g., Al,
      Pb, Sn, etc.) or contrived compounds (e.g., Y-Li-Sr/Ba-Cu oxides).
      As a result of the required geometric precision of the coupled
      magnetic spin systems, MC3 's appear to be rarely occurring in
      nature. However, it is clear that the physiochemical elements
      required to obtain superconductivity must already be present in
      the atomic structure of some elements, since only a temperature
      change is required to achieve the superconductive state in these
      elements (e.g., Al, Pb, Sn, etc.). By precisely combining two
      individual attenuating spin systems we have created one overall
      amplifying spin system. Given certain magnitudes of magnetic
      forces, the degree of amplification is a direct result of the
      precision of the balancing of the magnetic torque forces. It is
      important to note that a system does not have to be exactly
      counterbalanced to derive some of the benefits of magnetic torque
      balance.<br>
      <br>
      Coupling of a positive temperature system to a negative absolute
      temperature system can be achieved by connecting a means for
      electrical conduction to the MC3 system, resulting in an "open
      electrical circuit" system that yields an asymmetric energy output
      with a finite decay time, as best shown in Figure 4.<br>

      colder reservoir, there then exists an engine that will operate in
      a closed cycle and produce no other effect than the extraction of
      heat from a reservoir and the performance of an equivalent amount
      of work."<br>
      <br>
      Negative absolute temperature by convention and definition would
      appear to require the existence of negative mass. We view magnetic
      dipoles and their fields as manifestations of negative mass. A
      plurality of which, precisely organized or positioned in motive
      spin systems as described herein, constitute "negative temperature
      reservoirs" (after Ramsey) , where it is possible that T2/T1
      &gt;1.<br>
      <br>
      In terms of entropy relating to negative temperature systems,
      increasing states of disorder (entropy) correspond to decreases in
      temperature, precisely the opposite of the relationship at
      positive temperatures, where disorder increases with increasing
      temperature. Thus, to effectively link the positive temperature
      system to the negative absolute temperature system in a closed
      circuit manner, means are required to allow "heat" to flow from a
      colder to a hotter reservoir and in turn flow back to the colder
      reservoir. With a macroscopic system at negative absolute
      temperature(MC3 ) , this is accomplished by coupling a 3rd spin
      system we call an Inverted NA (e.g., electric motor) and
      conduction means to the first spin system (NA) , wherein a portion
      of the internal energy of the MC3 system is converted to positive
      temperature in the form of electricity (i.e., the first spin
      system functions as a generator) . In turn, a portion of this
      "heat" (electricity) is allowed to flow back to the colder
      reservoir by means of magnetic coupling (3rd spin system-electric
      motor) to the negative temperature system. This process allows the
      negative absolute temperature system to maintain its angular
      velocity and magnetic moment and is sufficient to compensate for
      the losses inherent to transitions to or from positive temperature
      states (e.g., friction and resistance; note that there is also
      friction inherent to the negative temperature state) . Therefore,
      by allowing a portion of the energy to "flow back", continuous
      transitions or a superconductive state is attained since the
      system no longer exhibits a decay time. We call this system an
      "Expanded Magnetic Corollary to the Carnot Cycle" or EMC3 , as
      best shown in Figure 5.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to raising the positive temperature output (e.g.,
      electricity), energy flow-back can be confined to the MC3 system
      to raise the internal energy of the system. Processes from
      spontaneous fission to thermal combustion may be attributed to
      such internal energy flow-back processes. Moreover, a better
      understanding of these processes may explain the perfectly stable
      superconductive circuits (i.e., no increase or decay in strength
      over (1010)10 years).<br>
      <br>
      The resultant output from an EMC3 system is an undiminished
      alternating current, even though the magnetic moment phases cancel
      each other out. With slight modification (e.g. , geometric
      alteration) , the system can produce a pulsating direct current.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">MACROSCOPIC VERIFICATION OF
        NEGATIVE ABSOLUTE TEMPERATURE STATE </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The difficulty in achieving EMC3 lies in the MC3 portion of the
      system. The transition from negative to positive temperatures, or
      the expansion of the MC3 system to communicate with positive
      temperature systems, is quite simple to achieve. Initially, by
      definition, any one of the previously mentioned tests comparing
      energy requirements between individual and coupled spin systems
      can be performed to assess whether negative absolute temperatures
      have been achieved. Because of its simplicity, we have chosen to
      compare the amount of energy required to bring individual spin
      systems up to a specific angular velocity and/or magnetic moment
      relative to the collective system. The spin systems can be
      evaluated independently (i.e., NA or SR individually) or
      collectively (i.e., NA-SR as a coupled spin system) . We have
      constructed a simple 2- pole rotating test stand with interactive
      stator and rotor components which contains two separate spin
      systems (i.e. NA and SR.) Prior to any testing, the magnetic field
      was measured (with a Gaussmeter) at each pole face to ensure that
      the magnetic forces would cancel each other out as much as
      possible, (Table 1) . Using a dynamometer, we initially measured
      the (rest to motion) frictional forces of the system and
      determined them to be 100 grams when the system was inactive
      (Table 1) . Next we measured the force required to bring the
      individual spin systems (i.e., NA and SR) into motion from a rest
      state. The NA required a peak of 1000 grams (friction = 100 grams)
      to complete 160° revolution, whereas the SR required 700 grams
      (friction = 100 grams; Table 1). This is the closest we could come
      to equalling the required motive forces of the respective spin
      systems in our somewhat primitive experiment. It is interesting to
      note that the character of the interactive magnetic forces for the
      NA and SR differ substantially. The attractive forces associated
      with the NA acted over a more localized area with strong
      attractive forces at the area of direct pole interface. In
      contrast, the repelling forces associated with the SR were
      distributed over a larger area (geometric degrees) , with lower
      absolute forces at any given point. Variations in the
      attractive/repelling magnetic field character may require that
      pole face geometries compensate for these differences by altering
      the interactive magnetic fields to optimize the force balancing
      process. Magnetic shielding methods can also be employed within
      and between respective spin systems to maintain optimal force
      balancing. Variations in pole face geometries and consequent
      magnetic field geometries and intensities could be analogous to
      variations in geometries of atomic and sub-atomic orbitals.<br>
      <br>
      Once the two spin systems were coupled (MC3 state) , a peak of
      only 300 grams (friction = 100 grams) were required to accomplish
      the same ldO" revolution compared to the 1000 grams (friction =
      100 grams) required to revolve the NA by itself.<br>
      <br>
      Our test results prove that negative temperature states can be
      achieved in a macroscopic framework. We have met the requirements
      for a "special system" wherein; the energy of allowed states have
      finite upper limits (finite magnetic/energy gradients in the
      coupled system) , the systems are coextensive in space (the most
      unstable state of one is exactly coupled to the most stable state
      of the other, as best shown in Figure 4) and at the same time
      shielded from work interactions ("isolated" yet "coupled" spin
      systems) , and individual (isolated) systems display longer decay
      times than the coupled system (or more energy is required to
      revolve the individual spin systems relative to the coupled spin
      system) .<br>

      <br>
      By connecting a conduction means (e.g., coil) to the NA (stator)
      component of the MC3 system (e.g., electric generator) , a
      rudimentary evaluation of the transition from positive to negative
      absolute temperatures (i.e., coupled MC3 system) can be made. The
      coupled MC3 system only requires 300 grams of torque force
      (friction = 100 grams) to revolve the spin systems 160°, producing
      a voltage of 100 millivolts. Since this voltage output signal
      equals the voltage of the NA operating independently (1000 grams)
      , we can effectively produce the same output energy for 4.5 times
      less input energy (correcting for friction) . Therefore, the
      coupled MC3 system in the rudimentary preliminary model tested
      herein is 4.5 times more efficient than the simple two-pole NA
      generating device. The voltage output can be manipulated to
      produce work or heat and at the same time a portion of this
      (preferably at least proportional to the frictional forces) can be
      allowed to flow back through the system via the 3rd spin system
      (e.g., electric motor) , as best shown in Figure 3, to achieve a
      superconductive state at any temperature (i.e., a portion of the
      system can be brought up to operating temperatures of filaments in
      incandescent light bulbs or greater) . However, the magnetic
      portions of the EMC3 or superconductive system must be maintained
      below the Curie Temperature (1023°K for Iron), or the magnetic
      properties will cease. Therefore, it follows that the
      superconductive circuit as a whole (as described by our model
      herein) cannot be characterized by a single electric circuit nor a
      single temperature. Rather, it is characterized by unique
      combinations of electric circuits, magnetic circuits, interactive
      magnetic fields; and in terms of temperature, 5 the system as a
      whole is comprised of several temperature states. Moreover, in
      terms of resistance, it is clear that the superconductive circuits
      contain internal resistance networks, even though they as a whole
      may manifest what appears to be no resistance.<br>
      <br>
      Just as in other superconductive circuits, the activated EMC3
      system will not exhibit a decay time as long as output energy is
      allowed to flow back into the EMC3 system in proportions that meet
      or exceed frictional forces. When precision balancing of magnetic
      torque forces is accomplished, the efficiency of the EMC3 system
      can be optimized.<br>
      <br>
      If the forces required to revolve the EMC3 coupled test spin
      system had been only 100 grams (i.e., frictional forces only) ,
      then we would have demonstrated 100% balance or "zero magnetic
      torque". Our test results are therefore most encouraging since we
      have achieved -78% (i.e., 1
      -[(300g(MC3)-100g(F))/(1000g(NA)-100g(F))] of the maximum that is
      theoretically possible in the portion of our theory that deals
      with magnetic force balancing.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it appears that the EMC3 system can operate in a
      negative torque mode (i.e., internal (magnetic) energy is used to
      overcome friction of the system) as shown in the "regenerative"
      coupled system, as best shown in Figure 5. In addition, the same
      effect can be achieved by replacing the function of the 3rd spin
      system by altering the pole face geometries of the SR spin system.
      As described herein and as best shown in Figure 4, the conversion
      of magnetic energy into electricity is most efficiently
      accomplished at near zero or negative torque. This is readily
      apparent when the diagrammatic representation of internal and
      external energy is analyzed. For instance, it is clear that Ee
      from 90* to 180" and 270° to 0°, when diminished in amplitude,
      will cause the coupled spin system to be in a state of negative
      torque. Altering the amplitude is a consequence of changing the
      pole face geometry, wherein the magnetic repelling forces are so
      directed that they give preference to the direction of rotation to
      optimize the negative torque states. Controlling the effects of
      impedance, inductance, hysteresis, and heat losses from resistance
      (I2R) are important in establishing efficiencies in macroscopic
      systems. The sub-atomic equivalents must also be considered when
      determining the susceptibility to superconductive states by
      certain materials. Internal interference effects from an imbalance
      of impedance and inductance loads can be reduced or eliminated by
      conventional load-balancing means. Hysteresis can be completely
      eliminated as a loss in pulsating DC systems as shown in Figure 4,
      wherein the ferromagnetic stator poles are not subjected to
      complete switching from one magnetic polarity to the other. Such
      generating devices are similar to homopolar generators which were
      conceived and demonstrated in the early years of electrical
      research. In sub-atomic systems, heat losses from resistance (I2R)
      and consequent heat migration may substantially impair sub-atomic
      superconductive functions. In macroscopic systems, these losses
      are of less concern as heat migration can be dealt with using
      conventional engineering techniques (i.e., the effects can be
      isolated and controlled).<br>
      <br>
      It is clear that there are many precise requirements for positive
      and negative absolute temperature states and their transitions
      that must be met. The basic requirements are presented in this
      preliminary disclosure.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      From a practical standpoint, the Expanded Magnetic Corollary to a
      Carnot Cycle (EMC3 ) permits magnetism itself to be a primary
      non-polluting energy source for electricity. The ease with which
      practical devices can be accomplished would appear to warrant
      urgent social, scientific, and commercial attention. Note the
      macroscopic version of the 3rd (inverted NA-motor) spin systems
      have already been developed and are commercially available. The
      1st and 2nd spin systems (NA and SR) can readily be developed
      using essentially an extension of the same technology that is
      applicable to the 3rd.<br>
      <br>
      Up until now, magnetism has been overlooked as a primary energy
      source and has only been exploited as a means to convert fossil
      and nuclear fuel (via mechanical energy) into electrical energy or
      electromagnetic radiation. In light of the aforementioned
      theoretical explanations and experimental results, it appears that
      EMC3 systems can represent macroscopic superconductors at all
      temperatures providing the required symmetric/asymmetric link
      between thermodynamics and electromagnetism. With present day
      technical expertise, practical macroscopic systems operating
      between positive and negative absolute temperatures can now be
      easily realized, resulting in the highly efficient generation of
      electricity. It appears that EMC3 systems comprise negative
      absolute temperature (energy) reservoirs. These reservoirs can be
      made to function in superconductive generators and magnetic
      batteries.<br>
      <br>
      The extent to which an element (or material) incorporates
      requisite spin systems and the optimization of their alignments
      (e.g., "in-phase" vs. "out-of-phase" coupling) may correspond to
      the relative degree of electrical conduction or ultimately
      superconduction (EMC3 ) that is observed (e.g., a continuum from
      resistor to semi-conductor to conductor to superconductor) .<br>
      <br>
      Since the existence of negative absolute temperature has been
      confirmed and accepted (and in light of these disclosures) , it
      would seem by definition, negative absolute mass should also be
      recognized in as much as a motive mass is a requirement for the
      establishment of temperatures (i.e., motion of particles).
      Negative mass may reside in the atomic structure or the
      inter-atomic space (both within the nucleus and associated with
      electron clouds as well as the space between electron clouds) .
      The quantity and location of negative mass in a particular element
      may determine its susceptibility to EMC3. By changing the
      alignment by simple chemical mixing, cooling (compression) ,
      heating (expansion) , electrification, magnetization, or by
      induced frequency/radiation, the negative mass component can be
      altered to promote or demote the outflow of energy from
      "amplification" and "superconductive", or "emission" processes as
      in MC3 and EMC3 systems.<br>
      <br>
      The dual behavior of magnetized mass (i.e., attraction and
      repulsion) is inconsistent with the definition of mass in
      Gravitational Theory where mass only has a singular behavior
      (attraction) . For many current theorems to remain valid, it would
      seem appropriate to assign negative mass values to atomic
      structures and elements and incorporate them into the theorems and
      a revised classification of naturally occurring elements (e.g.,
      periodic table of the elements).<br>
      <br>
      Analysis of our theories and experiments reveal that a number of
      dynamic interactive processes, along with spatial displacements
      and geometries, predicate the efficiency of an EMC3 system. All of
      these dynamic interactive processes will need to be more precisely
      translated to their sub-atomic quantum mechanical equivalents.<br>
      <br>
      Although we have described the fundamental principles of
      constructing Expanded Magnetic Corollaries to the Carnot Cycle
      (EMC3 ) , it may be of greater scientific (and social) importance
      to identify how and why it appears most systems are not EMC3 's
      and if and how it is possible to manipulate them. Conversely, how
      can this knowledge be used to manipulate already existing EMC3
      systems (e.g. , spontaneous fission) ; perhaps through magnetic or
      electrical means it may be possible to deactivate the fissioning
      (EMC3 ) process. Processes ranging in diversity from combustion
      and spontaneous fission to conduction and amplification may be
      directly related to the degree and magnitude in which EMC3 is
      functioning on the sub-atomic level. Although at first it may seem
      surprising that the applicability of our theories are so broad, it
      is justified by the test results and the concomitant proposal of
      the existence of new, previously undiscovered components or
      behaviors in the inter-atomic or atomic structures. This is
      supported by our macroscopic tests and their sub-atomic analogies,
      as well as the behavior of superconducting elements (e.g., Al, Pb,
      Sn, etc.). Moreover, the interrelationship of gravitational,
      thermodynamic, and electromagnetic theories and their bearing on
      unified field theory development is obviously affected by
      introduction of any new component or processes in the atomic
      structure or its surroundings. In addition, now that it is
      possible to make transitions between positive and negative
      absolute temperatures, it may be possible to establish the unit
      ratios between positive and negative absolute temperatures and
      their corresponding positive and negative mass.<br>
      <br>
      An instructive embodiment only exemplifying the basic principles
      of the invention will now be described. Referring to Figure 6, a
      two pole generator 10 is disclosed. The generator includes a
      C-shaped stator 12 with a coil of wire 14 wound around its
      intermediate portion. A permanent magnet armature 16 is disposed
      to rotate between the pole portions 18 and 20 of the stator. As
      the armature is rotated through its shaft 22, a voltage is
      generated across the output 24 of the coil 14. The input power to
      the generator 10 is characterized by alternating external energy
      Ee and negative internal energy E{, as best shown in Figure 6. The
      input power also includes power to overcome friction losses within
      the generator, as generally indicated as Ef.<br>
      <br>
      To reduce the magnetically induced torque or drag forces, a
      special repelling spin system 26 is coupled thereto. The system 26
      includes a stator comprising a pair of permanent magnets 28 and an
      armature comprising a pair of permanent magnets 30. The magnets 28
      and 30 are disposed in such a way that like poles are disposed
      across each other, as best shown in Figure 7. The armature rotates
      about shaft 32. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate
      from an analysis of Figure 7 that in order to maintain rotation of
      the system 26, external energy Ee must be supplied to the system
      in alternating fashion, as best shown in Figure 7. One of ordinary
      skill in the art will understand that there is internal potential
      energy stored in the system 26 at the 0" position, such that the
      armature will turn without any application of external energy from
      0ß to 90". From 90° to 180°, external energy must be applied to
      the system to bring it to the orientation, as shown in Figure 7
      where it attains potential energy. From ldO* to 270", this
      potential energy is utilized to turn the system 26. From 270* to
      360°, external energy Ee is again applied to the system 26. Thus,
      one can see that the power requirement at the shaft 32 is
      characterized by alternating external energy and internal energy.
      Energy to account for friction losses, generally indicated as E ,
      is also supplied to the system 26.<br>
      <br>
      When the generator 10 is mechanically coupled to the system 26
      through their respective shafts, a balance of the shaft power
      occurs, such that only the frictional losses of the combined
      system must be supplied in order to keep the coupled system
      rotating and generating power. This is best illustrated in Figure
      8.<br>
      <br>
      A person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that a
      conventional control system (not shown) might be necessary to
      maintain the proper phase relationship between the generator 10
      input power envelope and the SR spin system 26 output power
      envelope to account, for example, for varying loads connected to
      the generator and for hysteris in the system. The control system
      may be implemented electronically or mechanically.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment of the system disclosed in Figure ß is shown in
      Figure 9. A generator 34 has a rotor 36 and a stator 3d. The rotor
      36 is secured to shaft 40 and includes a pair of U-shaped
      permanent magnets 42 disposed along the shaft 40 in a back-to-back
      fashion, as best shown in Figure 9. The magnets 42 are disposed
      such that adjacent poles are like poles. The stator 3d includes a
      pair of coils 44 disposed in intermediate portions of respective
      U-shaped ferromagnetic magnetic cores 48 with pole portions 50
      disposed opposite respective pole portions of the rotor magnets
      42.<br>
      <br>
      The generator 34 is mechanically coupled to a special repelling
      spin system 52, which is similar to the spin system 26 disclosed
      in Figure 7. The system 52 includes a rotor 54 having a pair of
      C-shaped permanent magnets 56 secured to a shaft 58. The spin
      system 52 includes a stator 60 having a pair of C-shaped permanent
      magnets 62 which are disposed relative to the permanent magnets 56
      such that respective opposing poles of the rotor and the stator
      are like poles.<br>
      <br>
      The input power to the generator 34 is similar to that of the
      generator 26 disclosed in Figure 6. Likewise, the input power to
      the spin system 52 is similar to the input power of the spin
      system 26 disclosed in Figure 7. Therefore, one of ordinary skill
      in the art will understand that when the generator 34 and the spin
      system 52 are mechanically coupled together through their
      respective shafts 40 and 58, cancellation or balancing of the
      input power to the generator 54 and to the spin system 52 occurs.
      Consequently, only enough power to compensate for frictional
      losses of the system are needed to keep the coupled system
      rotating. Appropriate output leads are taken from the coils 44 to
      produce an output E0, as best shown in Figure 9.<br>
      <br>
      While this invention has been described to explain the principles
      in the simplest manner possible, it is understood that it is
      capable of further modification, uses and/or adaptations of the
      invention following in general the principle of the invention and
      including such departures from the present disclosure as come
      within known or customary practice in the art to which the
      invention pertains, and as may be applied to the essential
      features set forth, and fall within the scope of the invention or
      the limits of the appended claims. <br>

      </div>
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Werjefelt qui est originaire de
        Suède est arrivé aux Etats-Unis au début des années 60. Il a
        terminé ses études dans les universités de l’Utah et à Hawaï. Il
        partage son temps entre la direction d’un groupe s’occupant de
        sécurité aéronautique R&amp;D</span><i style="font-weight:
        normal;"> Poly Tech</i><span style="font-weight: normal;">, et
        la rédaction d’articles techniques.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Depuis des années, il travaille
        sur un appareil à énergie magnétique, un système en rotation qui
        annule le freinage magnétique en le neutralisant avec des champs
        d’aimants supplémentaires, et produit plus d’énergie qu’il n’en
        consomme. Un essai a montré 450 watts de sortie pour 160 watts
        d’entrée.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Werjefelt a découvert dans la
        littérature scientifique les preuves à l’appui de ses
        affirmations. Il a donc consigné ses résultats sous forme
        brevetable et capable de convaincre la communauté scientifique,
        néanmoins il préfère de loin démontrer que son appareil
        fonctionne (il existe une vidéo de l’appareil en
        fonctionnement).</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">En 1990, il a écrit à</span><i
        style="font-weight: normal;"> General Electric, Westinghouse,
        Siemens, Hitachi et Sumimoto</i><span style="font-weight:
        normal;">. La plupart des réponses venant des Américains et des
        Européens étaient du genre&nbsp;: " ce n’est pas possible ", ou
        " appelez-nous quand vous aurez obtenu un brevet."</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Lors d’une conférence donnée au
        M.I.T., il a soutenu que les enseignements de physique classique
        sur le magnétisme étaient toujours incomplets et que la
        communauté scientifique avait déclaré prématurément qu’il était
        impossible de se servir du magnétisme en tant que source
        d’énergie.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">En octobre 1993, dans un
        programme télévisé japonais, Teruhiko Kawaï a fait mention d’un
        appareil similaire à celui de Werjefelt. Des équipes de
        recherche japonaises, convenablement financées, ont travaillé
        sur cette découverte afin d’obtenir des appareils fiables pour
        des moteurs actuels.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Werjefelt a passé deux jours
        avec un représentant de la société Sumimoto - qui estime à sa
        juste valeur sa découverte. Il a appris que les moteurs japonais
        tournent très bien (l’émission montrait des réfrigérateurs, des
        aspirateurs et autres appareils ménagers ainsi équipés).
        L’équipe de l’inventeur a résolu les problèmes techniques, ce
        qui permettra aux générateurs d’être disponibles d’ici quelques
        années. Werjefelt s’intéresse davantage à la production
        d’électricité et pense que de nouvelles centrales (NDLR : mais
        est-il nécessaire de centraliser l'énergie ?)basées sur son
        Générateur Magnétique produiraient de 15 à 18 fois plus
        d’électricité que celles actuellement en service.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Des commentaires extraits d'un
        groupe de discussion</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <font style="font-weight: normal;" size="4">" … le secret des
        moteurs de Werjefelt et de Muller (voir ce nom) pourrait résider
        dans la commutation rapide du système d’équilibrage on et off.
        Il s’agit là de dévier le flux avec une bobine sans noyau avec
        une énergie électrique plus faible quand le temps de commutation<i>
          on </i>diminue. La force de champ maximum doit toujours
        atteindre le même niveau, mais plus le temps<i> on </i>est
        court, plus le système est efficace. C’est là que peuvent
        intervenir valablement les électroniciens.<br>
        <br>
        Est-il possible de réaliser et utiliser une bobine sans noyau
        afin de commuter<i> on </i>et<i> off </i>sur des périodes de
        temps plus courtes tout en assurant une force de champ donnée,
        et avec ce processus, réduire la puissance à la bobine par
        impulsions&nbsp;? Il me semble qu’une bobine traversée par un
        courant pendant une minute utilise davantage d’énergie que la
        même bobine traversée pendant une seconde. La question se pose
        alors de réduire la constante de temps inductive tout en
        conservant une force de champ donnée et tout en diminuant
        l’énergie d’entrée dans la bobine.&nbsp;"</font><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Le principe de base des
        machines de Werjefelt (et de Muller) est simple.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Dans celle de Werjefelt, les
        forces d’attraction entre le rotor et le stator sont équilibrées
        en connectant un rotor et un stator fonctionnant en répulsion.
        En fait, tous les deux, une fois couplés, tournent comme s’il
        n’y avait aucune force au travail, comme s’il n’y avait aucun
        aimant&nbsp;; c’est comme si le montage était en bois. La
        machine a été construite sur ce principe et fonctionne selon le
        témoin qui poursuit&nbsp;: mais que se passe-t-il lorsque l’on
        met une charge sur la machine&nbsp;?</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Si le circuit de répulsion a
        été coupé au bon moment, il y aura des forces d’attraction dans
        la partie génératrice, et un travail pourra être accompli. Plus
        la machine tourne vite, plus le temps de commutation dans la
        partie de la répulsion est court et meilleure est l’efficacité.</span><br
        style="font-weight: normal;">
      <br style="font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">C’est comme si ces machines
        supprimaient la gravité pour un temps, soulevaient un objet, et
        rétablissaient la gravité, le tout générant un travail. Les
        aimants permettent d’accomplir la même chose car on peut les
        commuter. La vitesse de rotation, le</span><i
        style="font-weight: normal;"> timing</i><span
        style="font-weight: normal;">, l’utilisation d’une section
        d’équilibrage pour annuler les forces entre le rotor et le
        stator dans la partie génératrice font que ces machines, peu
        connues, produisent un excès d’énergie vérifié.<br>
