            [ Excerpt ]<br>
            <br>
          </b>Mr. Tripler of New York, who has made liquid air in great
          quantities, does it substantially as follows: First, he
          compresses air to about 2500 pounds to the square inch. Of
          course the air is very hot when it is first compressed because
          all the air in the tank has been reduced in bulk about 166
          times, and all the heat that was in the whole bulk of air is
          concentrated into one-166th of the space it occupied before it
          was compressed. It is 166 times hotter. There are two sets of
          pipes running from the compressor to a long upright tank
          called the liquefier. These pipes pass through running water,
          so that the compressed air is quickly cooled down to the
          temperature of the water (about 50 degrees Fahrenheit). The
          pipes — at least one set of them — run the whole length of the
          liquefier, and most likely are coiled. This set of pipes
          contains the air to be liquefied. A second set of pipes runs
          to the bottom of the liquefier, where there is a valve. By
          opening this valve a jet of compressed air is allowed to play
          on the other set of pipes, when intense cold is produced by
          the sudden[Pg 150] expansion of the air. This cold air rushes
          up around the pipe containing the air to be liquefied and
          escapes at the top, thus absorbing the heat until the
          temperature is reduced to 312 degrees below zero. Then the air
          liquefies and runs into a receptacle, where it may be drawn
          off at pleasure...<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b> -- Vapour engines. Relates to engines in which
      the working fluid is liquid air, carbon monoxide, or other
      substance having a sufficiently-low critical pressure and
      temperature. The invention depends upon a revised statement of the
      first and second thermodynamic laws, and consists in a special
      cycle or system of working, whereby the heat rejected in the
      Carnot cycle is intercepted and returned to the source, thus
      rendering it possible to convert into motive power the diffused
      heat existing in the atmosphere or elsewhere at ordinary
      temperatures. Fig. 8 shows in plan a suitable form of motivepower
      apparatus for putting the invention into effect, and Fig.
      8&lt;A&gt; shows on larger scale a diagram to illustrate the heat
      exchanges in the cycle. The heat to be converted into motive power
      is abstracted by the working fluid in the conduit K from air
      flowing through the adjacent conduit H. The working fluid is
      conveyed from the conduit K to the cylinders E', E&lt;2&gt;,
      E&lt;3&gt; of ordinary fluid-pressure engines, and is thence
      exhausted by the pipe V into a conduit where it receives an
      admixture of gas evaporated at the trap Z. The mixture is next
      compressed in the cylinder C', and in flowing thence gives heat on
      the one side to the gases entering the cylinder C' and on the
      other to the liquid in the conduit K. This results in liquefaction
      at the trap Z. Thence liquid is drawn by the pump P&lt;3&gt; and
      delivered into the conduit K, leakage being made up by the pump.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I have invented a new and useful art, an apparatus, and a method
      of operation, all of which pertain to said new art.<br>
      <br>
      This new and useful art consists in utilizing as a source of
      energy heat that is common to terrestrial matter and manifested as
      temperature condition. A rationale and description here follows.<br>
      <br>
      Heat engines which operate by the varying condition of a working
      fluid, as regards pressure, volume, and temperature, have properly
      been divided into two classes.<br>
      <br>
      1st. Those known as heat motor engines, and which by their
      operation transform or convert heat into dynamic energy or work.
      2nd. Those known as heat pumps, and which are merely motor engines
      with a reversed cycle of operation, .and consequently transform
      dynamic energy into heat.<br>
      <br>
      Heretofore, an essential to the operation of such motor engines
      has been the maintenance of a refrigerator or medium of heat
      reception to receive the accumulation of unconverted heat after
      passing through the engine.<br>
      <br>
      Whereas, the object of my invention is to dispense with this
      refrigerator, either wholely, or partially.<br>
      <br>
      Also, heat engines heretofore made exemplified the following
      principles, first enunciated by Sadi Carnot, and now commonly
      known as the second law of thermodynamics.<br>
      <br>
      1. All heat motor engines are similar in that they receive heat
      from some source, transform part of it into work, and deliver the
      remainder to a refrigerator. <br>
      <br>
      2. In the, thermodynamic sense, a heat motor engine is perfect
      only when the cycle is reversible, and the efficiency of such an
      engine is expressed by an average ratio of loss of temperature to
      initial absolute temperature of the heat applied.<br>
      <br>
      Although these two principles or laws apply with correctness to
      heat engines heretofore made, I have discovered or observed that
      they are not correct for a broader and more comprehensive
      treatment of the subject. In fact, they apply only to a specific
      type of engine, have not the broad scope of a general nature, and
      do not apply to all heat engines. However, they disclose the
      present state of the art.<br>
      <br>
      Also, I have discovered or observed that the two above mentioned
      laws should be revised so as to read as follows--<br>
      <br>
      1. All heat motor engines are similar in that they receive heat
      from some source; transform this heat into work, wholely, or
      partially; and deliver what remains to a refrigerator.<br>
      <br>
      2. In the thermodynamic sense, a heat motor engine is perfect only
      when the cycle is reversible, and the efficiency of such an engine
      is expressed by a ratio of loss of heat to quantity of heat
      applied.<br>
      <br>
      An application of my invention consists in combining it. heat
      motor engine with a novel apparatus which is merely a part of my
      invention and is herein called a potential transformer; in a
      manner to intercept the transfer to a refrigerator unconverted
      heat that has passed through the motor engine; and return such
      intercepted heat to its source, or to the motor engine, by the
      expenditure of less dynamic energy than is generated by the motor
      engine.<br>
      <br>
      When the heat from a heat motor engine is thus intercepted and
      retained, a supply of heat can be utilized at a comparatively low
      temperature and from some convenient source such as the
      atmosphere, or a body of water, because it is not necessary to
      maintain a' refrigerator' for the reception of an accumulation of
      ejected heat.<br>
      <br>
      The above rationale of the matter is simple and explicit but
      necessitates an explanation in regard to the nature and properties
      of the potential transformer.<br>
      <br>
      For a potential transformer ; I have invented a new kind of heat
      engine which I term potential transforming engine.<br>
      <br>
      When perfect and reversible in a thermodynamic sense; this kind of
      engine can transform a fluid from one potential condition to an
      other, without changing the intrinsic or total contained energy of
      the fluid ; and consequently at no cost, nor gain, as regards
      external work or dynamic energy. Also, its operation can be
      regulated so as to transform the potential condition of the fluid
      either with cost, or gain, as regards external work; and
      consequently with a corresponding changed condition as regards the
      intrinsic energy of the fluid.<br>
      <br>
      My invention is based on the feasibility of transmuting or
      transforming the fluid from a lesser to a greater potential
      condition, accompanied by but a meager increase in intrinsic
      energy, for the purpose of affording means to manipulate for a
      transmutation of its contained energy into dynamic energy or work;
      all in accord with the first law of thermodynamics; and with the
      second law, as hereinbefore revised by myself.<br>
      <br>
      In a generic sense; my preferable process or method of operation
      for trans- forming a fluid from a lesser to a greater potential
      condition; consists in densifying the fluid by abstracting heat or
      energy therefrom while maintaining it at conveniently low
      pressure, transferring this heat to the thus densified .fluid
      while maintaining it at higher pressure, by or through a medium
      which is adapted to cause a greater increase in potential
      condition than' increase in intrinsic energy considered
      proportionately respectively as regards total potential condition
      and total contained or intrinsic energy.<br>
      <br>
      A perfect transformation is effected when there results no change
      in intrinsic energy. With regard to most fluids ; it may be
      remarked that such transformation of the potential condition
      results at a corresponding temperature which does not differ from
      that corresponding with the initial potential condition, when the
      fluid is a perfect gas; and at a changed temperature when the
      fluid is in the condition of a mixture of liquid and saturated
      gas. With such a mixture, a change in potential condition
      corresponding with no change in intrinsic energy necessitates a
      change in the relative proportion of liquid to gas, and
      consequently a change in its temperature because the values for
      specific-heat respectively for the liquid and gas are not equal.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to the accompanying drawings. For the purpose of
      simplicity, these drawings have been made in a conventional
      manner, and refinements in matters of detail and scale have been
      purposely omitted because the specified parts when taken
      separately are well known devices and may be constructed in any
      manner that is suitable and known.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 1. shows an elementary type of potential transforming
      engine which approximates an ideal in a thermodynamic sense, but
      is not so efficient in a mechanical sense. A diaphram capable of a
      ready conduction of heat therethrough is shown at A, it separates
      the 'Interior of a non-conducting cylinder into the two .parts B
      and B B, each of these cylindrical parts are provided with a
      non-conducting piston respectively indicated by C and C C, these
      pistons are moved to and from the diaphram A by means of separate
      racks and pinions respectively shown at D and D D. For explanatory
      purposes, crank arms indicated at G and G G are here shown for
      operating their respective pinions; and for the purpose of
      avoiding prolixity, mechanism for operating these crank arms has
      been 'purposely omitted because such explanation is not essential
      to a proper understanding of the particular principles and
      operation herein involved.<br>

      <br>
      Preparatory to operating; a permanent charge of working fluid is
      charged through the conduit E and opened cock F and into the
      cylinder B while partially withdrawing the piston C ; the cock F
      is then closed to put the engine in condition for operation. This
      fluid is only a working fluid and not the fluid to be treated or
      transformed. It is preferable that this fluid shall be the same
      kind as that which is to be treated. Also, it is essential that
      this cylinder shall now be only partially expanded and thereby
      permit ample room for subsequent expanding and contracting of the
      piston C.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, a cycle is effected by the following successive
      operations.-<br>

      1. Starting with the pistons placed as shown in Figure 2. Through
      the conduit E E and opened cock F F and while withdrawing the
      piston C C to its full extent; a charge of vaporous, or gaseous
      fluid to be operated upon or transformed is receivcd into the
      cylinder J3 I3. '1'he cock F 1' is then closed. The pistons have
      now acquired the positions shown in Figure 3.<br>
      <br>
      This fluid is thus received in a certain condition as regards its
      contained or intrinsic energy, also in a certain potential
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      This operation causes the piston C C to effect external work or
      dynamic energy by reason of its withdrawal with the fluid pressure
      thereon.<br>
      <br>
      2. The piston C C remaining stationary; the working fluid in the
      cylinder B is expanded and cooled by a partial withdrawal of the
      piston C; at a slow rate of speed so as to make efficient the
      accompanying transfer of heat through the diaphram A, from the
      fluid in the cylinder B 13 to the fluid in the cylinder B. Tins
      operation causes the fluid in the cylinder B B to lessen its
      pressure by reason of its loss of heat, while the fluid in the
      cylinder B effects work by reason of its expansion and pressure.
      The pistons have now acquired the positions shown in Figure 4.<br>
      <br>
      3. With the piston C slowly continuing its course of withdrawal;
      the cylinder 13 B is contracted by forcing the piston C C towards
      the diaphram A, preferably at constant pressure. The pistons have
      now acquired the positions shown in Figure 5. This operation
      causes the fluid in the cylinder B to be further cooled and
      continue its production of work by reason of its expansion; while
      the fluid in the cylinder B B is caused to contract by reason of
      the application of external work thereon, and loss of the heat
      transferred to the contents of the cylinder B.<br>
      <br>
      4. With the cylinder B B contracted, and the piston C C remaining
      stationary, the cylinder B is contracted by slowly forcing its
      piston C back to its initial position. This operation causes the
      fluid in the cylinder B B to acquire temperature and pressure by
      reason of the compression of fluid in the cylinder B.<br>
      <br>
      The pistons have now acquired the positions shown in Figure 6.<br>
      <br>
      5. The piston C remaining stationary, the fluid in the cylinder B
      B is removed in a transformed condition through the conduit E E,
      by opening the cock F F and forcing the piston C C to its initial
      position; the pistons have again acquired the positions shown in
      Figure 2, and the cycle is completed.<br>
      <br>
      The relative extent of the successive operations which make up a
      cycle can be regulated so as to produce any desired degree of
      change in potential condition.<br>
      <br>
      The degree of change in intrinsic energy is dependent upon the
      degree of pressure under which the treated fluid is densified, and
      is an increasing function of this pressure.<br>
      <br>
      This transforming engine posesses the following objectionable
      features --<br>
      <br>
      1st. The process is not continuous. 2nd. The engine is not highly
      efficient, in a mechanical and constructive sense.<br>
      <br>
      To overcome these objectionable features; I have invented the type
      of transforming engine herein shown by Figures. 7A and 7", taken
      together as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      I prefer to operate this engine so as to effect a process or
      method of operation that is. less generic than that hereinbefore
      mentioned, which consists in liquifying the fluid by abstracting
      heat or energy therefrom while maintaining it at a relatively low
      pressure, and transferring this energy to the liquified fluid
      while maintaining it at a higher pressure. With this particular
      apparatus'; this process or method of operation is effected in the
      more specific manner which consists in liquifying the fluid by
      abstracting heat therefrom, while maintaining it at a relatively
      low temperature and pressure by a regenerative action; and
      transferring this heat to the liquified liquid while maintaining
      it at a higher pressure;<br>
      <br>
      A regenerative action is herein understood to be an action in
      which there is an interchange of heat between working fluid that
      precedes and working fluid that follows in the same routine.
      Referring to Figures 7A and 7". In order to clearly show the
      operation of this engine and the principles involved; in a
      conventional manner the apparatus is shown by these two figures,
      when they are taken together as a whole ; certain conduits shown
      in one figure connect with and continue as the same conduit in the
      other figure, these conduits are respectively indicated by the
      same reference letter m each figure, and are the conduits Z, Y, X,
      and W; the direction which the fluid is caused to pass through the
      various conduits is indicated by conventional arrows. Figure 7A is
      a sectional-elevation and shows that portion of the apparatus
      where manipulations are effected) as regards regeneration .of
      heat. Figure 7" is a plan and shows the dynamic mechanism, In a
      conventional manner, and where desirable, the conduits and engine
      cylinders are shown to be surrounded by suitable insulating
      material to. prevent thermal inefficiencies by reason of external
      radiation<br>
      <br>
      In operation, preferably, the fluid to be treated or transformed
      is received in a gaseous condition by the conduit U and, passes
      therethrough into the conduit Y which extends from the pressure
      reducing-valve V to the compression cylinder Cl.<br>
      <br>
      This fluid enters the conduit Y, therein mixes with the current of
      fluid passing therethrough from. the valve V, passes from this
      conduit into the compression cylinder Cl, is compressed in this
      cylinder and delivered therefrom into the conduit Z and passes
      therethrough until the valve V is reached at the end of this
      conduit Z, by passing through this opened valve it again enters
      the conduit Y to again pass therethrough to the compressor Cl.
      Through the conduit X, and as explained later, a portion of the
      fluid is withdrawn from this circuit.<br>
      <br>
      A diaphram or siding capable of a ready conduction of heat
      therethrough is indicated by D, and: separates the above mentioned
      conduits Y and Z. The above mentioned compression effected by the
      compression cylinder C1 causes a changed 'condition to the fluid,
      as regards pressure and temperature; thereby the fluid pressure is
      increased and also the temperature of the fluid is increased.<br>
      <br>
      The above mentioned passage of this fluid through the conduit Z,
      in this compressed and heated condition, causes. an efficient
      regenerative interchange of heat through the diaphram D, and with
      the colder fluid passing in an opposite direction in the
      adjoining, conduit Y.<br>
      <br>
      This regenerative interchange of heat effects a self-intensifying
      frigerative effect, culminating at the valve V, and causing the
      fluid in the thus frigefied end of the conduit Z to condense to
      the liquid condition. By reason of gravitation, this frigefied
      liquid fluid collects in the trap or upturn at the bottom of the
      conduit Z, from whence it is forced through the upward turn of
      this trap until it reaches the valve V at the top of this upturn
      in the conduit. By passing from thence through the orifice or
      opened pressure reducing valve V, the culminating frigefaction is
      then effected by reason of the evaporation of this liquid due to
      its entry into the conduit Y wherein a lesser pressure is
      maintained by the combined action of the valve V and the
      compressor C 1.<br>
      <br>
      For the purpose of effecting an efficient regenerative interchange
      of heat to condense the hold in the conduit Z; the irigel1ed end
      of the conduit Y and the adjoining branch from the conduit Z are
      purposely , extended upwards and separated by the heat conducting
      diaphram, in order that the released liquid from the valve V may
      gravitate along the diaphram and toward the warmer portion of the.
      conduit and thus insure a rapid, evaporation and thus prevent .an
      accumulation of this liquid after passing through the valve V.<br>
      <br>
      Through the conduit X, a portion of the liquid fluid is withdrawn
      from the conduit Z. This withdrawn liquid passes through the
      conduit X and enters the pressure pump P 3 wherein it is put under
      pressure and ejected therefrom into and through the conduit W
      wherein this increased pressure is maintained. The conduit W is
      separated from the conduits Z and Y by the diaphram or siding F
      which is capable of a ready conduction of heat therethrough. for a
      normal working or the apparatus ; the weight of the liquid fluid
      thus withdrawn from the conduit % and forced through the conduit
      W, and therefrom from this apparatus, is equal to the weight of
      gaseous fluid received into the apparatus through the conduit U.
      Through the diaphram F, there is an efficient interchange of heat
      between the frigefied liquid passing through the conduit W and the
      warmer and gaseous fluid passing under a lesser pressure and in an
      opposite direction through the adjoining conduit Z. Thus; the
      gaseous fluid to be treated or transformed is received into the
      apparatus, through the conduit U is condensed to the liquid
      condition when it reaches the frigefactive end of the conduit Z is
      kept in a liquid condition and under a greater pressure after
      passing through the pump P 3; and while under this pressure and
      passing through the conduit W along the diaphram F, it receives
      heat abstracted from the gaseous fluid in the adjoining conduit,
      for the purpose of aiding the condensation in the conduit Z.<br>
      <br>
      The circuit through the valve V is maintained for the purpose of
      producing the self-intensive frigefactive effect, and should .be
      operated with sufficient flow, but with little difference in
      pressure through this valve; because the efficiency of a
      reducing-valve or orifice for . this purpose, in a-thermodynamic
      sense, is affected by this difference in pressure and is a
      decreasing function thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The counter shaft '1' is driven by any suitable source of
      dynamic-energy. By means of suitable regulating devices such as
      the belted sprocket cones shown at R and R 3, the counter shaft T
      actuates the compressor C 1 and the pressure pump P 3 by means of
      their respective crank shaft and piston shown at S 1 and S 3.
      These sprocket cones or an equivalent regulating device afford
      suitable means for regulating the relative flow through the
      compressor C 1 and the pressure pump' P 3. The pressure reducing
      valve -NI is of the type used on self-intensive frigefactive
      apparatus, and can be readily adjusted to effect any desired
      change of pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Thus as preeexited a description of a type of potential
      transforming engine that receives a continuous, now of gaseous
      fluid to be treated ejects the same in a continuous flow, and in a
      changed potential condition in the same sense as hereinbefore
      mentioned and described in connection with the apparatus shown by
      Figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 8A and 8B, taken together as a whole, show a preferable
      manner of combining the type of potential transforming engine
      shown in Figures 7A and 7" with an ordinary type of heat motor
      engine. In order to clearly show the operation of this combination
      and the principles involved; in a conventional manner the
      apparatus is shown by these two figures, when they are taken
      together .as a whole; certain conduits shown in one figure connect
      with and continue as the same conduit in the other figure, these
      conduits are respectively indicated by the same reference letter
      in each figure, and are the conduits Z, Y, X, W, U, and L ; the
      direction ,which the fluid is caused to pass through the various
      conduits is indicated by conventional arrows. Figure 8, is a
      sectional elevation. and shows that portion of the apparatus where
      manipulations arc effected, as regards regeneration, and
      interchange of heat. Figure 8" is a plan and shows the dynamic
      mechanism. 1'or the purpose of convenience, the various parts of
      the transforming engine, where shown in this combination, arc
      respectively indicated by the same reference letters that are used
      in Figures 7A and 7". In a conventional manner and where
      desirable, the conduits and engine cylinders are shown to be
      surrounded by suitable insulating material to prevent thermal
      inefficiencies by reason of external radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The object of this combination is to effect an interception of the
      ejected low pressure fluid from the heat motor engine, transform
      the potential condition of this ejected fluid by passing same
      through the potential transforming engine, return this transformed
      and high pressured fluid to the heat motor engine, increase the
      intrinsic energy of this returned fluid by raising its temperature
      to that of available terrestrial atmosphere, pass this
      comparatively heated fluid through the working cylinder of the
      heat motor engine, and thus complete the cycle -in accordance with
      the principles hereinbefore explained in the rationale oi the
      matter as regards utilizing heat that is common to terrestrial
      matter for the purpose of transmuting same into dynamic energy.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, the low pressure gaseous fluid is ejected from tho
      working cylinder 2 of the heat motor engine, it is also.ejected
      from the working cylinders of the auxiliary motor engines E 1 and
      E 3, which are directly attached respectively to the compression
      cylinder C 1 and the pressure pump P 3 for the purpose of
      supplying the necessary dynamic energy to operate same. This
      ejected low' pressure fluid is received in the conduit U and
      therefrom passes into and through tho various conduits of the
      transforming engine in identically the same manner as was
      described for Figures 7" and 7". The transformed and comparatively
      cold fluid, under high pressure, and in liquid condition, passes
      from the conduit W into a continuation of this conduit shown at K
      which is separated from the conduit H by a diaphram or siding J
      capable of a ready conduction of heat there- through. Through the
      conduit H; preferably; is forced a current of air taken directly
      from the atmosphere, or a current of water taken from some large
      body of same, by means of a suitable fan or circulating device
      which it is not necessary to show here, and is purposely omittcd
      in order to avoid prolixity. Through the diaphram J, the current
      of atmosphere passing through the conduit H effects an exchange of
      heat with the current of colder fluid passing in an opposite
      direction in the adjoining conduit K; thereby, the high pressured
      liquid fluid is heated and evaporated at high pressure and is
      forced through the continuation of this conduit shown at L. From
      thence, this high pressure gaseous fluid is withdrawn to operate
      the before mentioned motor cylinders E 1, E 2, and E 3. From these
      motor cylinders, this fluid is ejected at low pressure into the
      conduit U, and thus the cycle is completed.<br>
      <br>
      In order to renew ).he working fluid lost. by leakage, and to
      maintain a proper quantity of fluid in the conduit system, the
      pump P 4 forces a supply through the conduit N and from thence
      into the conduit W. '1'he fluid is supplied to this pump in a
      liquified condition, and by means of the conduit M which leads
      from some suitable reservoir containing a supply thereof. It is
      desirable that this liquid shall be volatile, cheap, readily
      available; and non-corrosive. Consequently, I prefer to use liquid
      carbonic acid, or liquid air.<br>
      <br>
      The current of atmosphere passing through the conduit H is the
      source from which heat is supplied for actuating this whole system
      of mechanism. If it were possible to construct the apparatus so
      that a perfect efficiency would be obtained from all of its parts;
      the heat that disappears or is abstracted from the current of
      atmosphere would represent the surplus of dynamic or mechanical
      energy developed by the whole apparatus; in other words, all of
      the heat taken from this current would be transmuted into dynamic
      energy available for any purpose. In a practical apparatus; the
      difference between the actual available dynamic energy and the
      heat abstracted from the current of atmosphere represents that
      portion of the abstracted heat that is not transmuted into dynamic
      energy but is dissipated; consequently, it is desirable that the
      various parts shall be constructed so as to effect the greatest
      possible degree of efficiency, particularly as regards fluid
      expansion and fluid compression. From the pulley U on the shaft of
      the motor engine E 2, all available dynamic energy can be taken by
      means of a belt or other suitable device and applied to any
      desired purpose. For the purpose of effecting a suitable
      regulation of the relative flow through the various conduits; the
      various pistons are connected one to the other by means, of the,
      counter shaft T and the several belted sprocket cones connecting
      this counter-shaft with the crank shafts that operate with these
      pistons, and shown respectively at R 1, R 2, R 3, and R 4.<br>
      <br>
      For convenience in starting. and stopping the apparatus; valves
      for stopping the supply of motive fluid from the conduit L to the
      engine cylinders E 1, E 2, . and E 3, are shown respectively at L
      1, L 2, and L 3; clutches for disconnecting ''the torsional action
      of the shaft T in regard to the several sets of sprocket cones are
      shown respectively at T 1, T 2, '1' 3, and T 4. In like manner the
      clutch T 5 disconnects the pulley R 5 which is used only when
      starting the apparatus, and as a means, for then connecting some
      suitable steam engine or other convenient source of dynamic energy
      for the purpose of actuating the counter shaft and thereby actuate
      the mechanism of the apparatus until a normal working is effected;
      when the apparatus has acquired a normal working condition, this
      pulley&nbsp; is disconnected from the shaft T by this clutch T 5,
      the auxiliary starting engine is stopped, and the apparatus
      continues by its self operating action.<br>
      <br>
      By utilizing the cooled current of atmosphere ejected from the
      conduit H, for frigefactive purposes, the apparatus becomes a self
      operating frigefactive engine.<br>
      <br>
      In order to make clear the principles involved ; in Figures 7A and
      8A, it was necessary to adopt a conventional manner of showing the
      conduit system. In ' practice, it is desirable to adopt an annular
      spiral coil system.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably; this coil system consists of a continuous series of
      flat spirals placed one over the other, separated into successive
      layers by horizontal partitions of non-conducting material; and
      between these horizontal partitions, a spiral partition of the
      same material is arranged to form a flat spiral conduit in each
      layer, and so as to continue successively through the series of
      layers, and to conduct the current of low pressure fluid; in and
      along; this insulated conduit 'containing the current of low
      -pressure fluid, are placed conduits or pipes containing
      respectively the several high pressure fluid currents, these pipes
      are made of material which is capable of a ready conduction of
      heat therethrough.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 9 and 10 show a, spiral coil constructed on this system,
      Figure 9 is a ~sectional plan, Figure 10 is a sectional elevation,
      and the same reference letters are used in both of these figures
      .to indicate the same parts. In the interior of the hermetically
      closed casing C, the high pressure fluid pipes or conduits 2 and 3
      arc contained in the insulated spiral conduit 1 and there
      surrounded by the current of low pressure fluid contained in this
      conduit 1.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, is presented a description of an operative and practical
      apparatus for effecting the purpose. of my Invention.<br>
      <br>
      It is herein understood that any operation mentioned in connection
      with my invention may be performed in any manner that is suitable
      and known. Also, my invention is not limited to the use of any
      particular material in the construction of the various parts, nor
      to the use of any particular working fluid, Also, the application
      of a multiplex method of combination, which consists in effecting
      the same cycle of operation by means of interdependent action
      between two or more apparatus, shall be considered as a mere
      equivalent of the simple single apparatus shown.<br>
      <br>
      <b>COMPLETE SPECIFICATION.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Improvements in or relating to Fluid Pressure Thermodynamic
      Engines.<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of this art consists in utilizing as a source of
      energy heat that is cpaimmi to terrestrial matter and manifested
      as temperature condition. A rationale and description here
      'follows.<br>
      <br>
      Heat engines heretofore made which operate by the varying
      condition of a working fluid, as regards pressure, volume, and
      temperature; have properly been divided into two classes. 1st.
      Those known as heat motor engines; and which by' their operation
      transform or convert heat into dynamic energy or work.<br>
      <br>
      2nd. Those known as heat pumps, and which are merely motor engines
      with a reversed cycle of operation, and consequently transform
      dynamic energy into heat ' 'Heretofore, an essential to the
      operation of such motor engines. has been the maintenance of a
      refrigerator or medium of heat reception to receive the
      accumulation of unconverted heat after passing through the engine.
      Whereas, . the purpose of my invention is to dispense with this
      refrigerator, either wholly, or partially.<br>
      <br>
      Also, heat' engines heretofore made exemplified the following
      principles, first enunciated by Sadi Carnot, and now commonly
      known as the second law of thermodynamics.<br>
      <br>
      1. All heat motor engines are similar in that they receive heat
      from some source, transform part of it into work, and deliver the
      remainder to a refrigerator.<br>
      <br>
      2. In the thermodynamic sense, a heat motor engine is perfect only
      when the cycle is reversible; and the efficiency of such perfect
      engine is expressed by the difference between the respective
      temperatures of heat reception and heat rejection, divided by the
      absolute-temperature of heat reception, taken as an average with
      respect to the units of heat applied and the portions of these
      units which are rejected."<br>
      Although these two principles or laws apply with correctness to
      heat engines heretofore made, I have observed that they are 'not
      correct for a broader and more comprehensive treatment of the
      subject. In fact, they have not the broad scope of a general
      nature, do not apply to all heat engines, and merely apply to that
      particular type in which all portions of the working fluid
      progress through the same temperature changes with cOl1unon-to-aI1
      corresponding rates of ' change in potential condition. <br>
      <br>
      Also, I have observed that the two above mentioned laws should be
      revised so, as to read. as follows.- <br>
      <br>
      1. All heat motor engines are similar in that they receive heat
      from some source ; transform this heat into work, wholely, or
      partially; and deliver what remains to a refrigerator.<br>
      <br>
      2. In the thermodynmnic sense, a heat motor engine is possible
      only when the cycle is reversible, and the efficiency of such
      perfect engine is expressed by a ratio of loss of heat to quantity
      of heat applied.<br>
      <br>
      A preferable application of my Invention consists in combining a
      heat motor engine, with a novel apparatus which is merely a part
      of my invention and is herein called a potential transformer; in a
      manner to intercept, the unconverted heat that has passed through
      the motor engine, and prevent the transfer of same to. a
      refrigerator; and return such intercepted heat to its source, or
      to the motor engine, by the expenditure of less dynamic energy
      than is generated by the motor engine. When the heat from a heat
      .motor engine is thus intercepted and returned, a. supply of heat
      can lie utilized at a comparatively low temperature and from, some
      convenient source such as the atmosphere, or&nbsp; a body of
      water, because, it is not necessary to maintain a refrigerator for
      the reception of an accumulation of ejected heat..<br>
      <br>
      The above rationale of the matter is simple and explicit but
      necessitates an explanation in regard to the nature and properties
      of the potential transformer.<br>
      <br>
      For a potential transformer, I have .invented a new kind of heat
      engine which.<br>
      <br>
      I term potential transforming engine. Its function, as applied to
      my invention in. a preferable manner, is to transform or transmute
      the potential condition of the working fluid after passing through
      the motor engine, and thus dispense with the necessity of
      maintaining an external refrigerator for receiving the
      accumulation of such ejected heat. The preferable manner in which
      this result is attained consists in reducing the potential
      condition of the fluid to be treated, by abstracting heat from
      same; when this fluid has thus acquired a. comparatively low
      potential condition and consequently is not capable of developing;
      much latent beat by. a change in condition as regards density and
      pressure, its condition is then caused to be changed by a meager
      external application of dynamic energy or work; the above
      mentioned 'abstracted heat is then returned to the thus densified
      fluid held under an increased pressure and thereby causes a
      transmutation to the condition of greater potential by reason of
      the returned heat existing in the same but more densified fluid;
      and effecting this abstraction and return of heat by a
      regenerative action which is made effective by causing different
      portions of regenerative fluid to progress through the same
      temperature changes with corresponding rates of change in
      potential condition that differ.<br>
      <br>
      When perfect and reversible in a thermodynamic sense, this kind of
      engine' can transform a fluid from one potential condition to an
      other, without changing the total contained energy of the fluid ;
      and consequently at no cost, nor gain. as regards external work or
      dynamic energy. Also, its operation can be regulated so as to
      transform the potential condition of the fluid either with cost,
      or with gain, as regards external work; and consequently with a
      corresponding. changed condition as regards the total contained
      energy of the fluid.<br>
      <br>
      My invention is based on the feasibility of transmuting or
      transforming the fluid from a lesser to a greater potential
      condition, accompanied by but a meager increase in total contained
      energy, for the purpose of affording means to manipulate for a
      transmutation of its contained energy into dynamic energy or work;
      all in accord with the first law of thermodynamics; and with the
      second law of thermodynamics, as hereinbefore revised by myself.<br>
      <br>
      In a generic sense ; my preferable process for effecting such
      transformation consists in lessening the potential condition of
      the fluid by abstracting heat from same ; when the fluid has thus
      acquired a, lowered potential condition, effecting a changed
      condition. by Increasing its density, or fluid pressure, or both,
      by an external application of force; returning said abstracted
      heat to the thus densified fluid held under increased pressure ;
      and effecting this abstraction and return of heat by a
      regenerative action in which different portions of regenerative
      fluid are caused to progress through some identical temperature
      changes with corresponding rates of change in potential condition
      that differ.<br>
      <br>
      A perfect transformation of the potential condition is effected
      when there results no change in the total contained energy. With
      regard to most fluids ; it may be remarked that such
      transformation results at a temperature which does not differ from
      that corresponding with the initial potential condition, when the
      fluid is a perfect gas; and at a changed temperature when the
      fluid is in the condition of a mixture of liquid and saturated
      gas. With such a mixture, a change in potential condition
      corresponding with no change in total contained energy
      necessitates a change in the relative proportion of liquid to gas,
      and consequently a change in its temperature because the values
      for specific-heat respectively for the liquid and gas are not
      equal.<br>
      <br>
      The drawings filed with my Provisional Specification are herein
      referred' to. in all cases. For the purpose of simplicity/these
      drawings have been made in: a conventional manner, and refinements
      in matters of detail and scale have been purposely omitted because
      the. specified parts when taken separately are well known devices
      and may be constructed in any manner that is suitable and known.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 1 shows an elementary type of potential transforming engine
      which approximates an ideal in a. thermodynamic sense, but is not
      so efficient in a' mechanical sense. Figures 2; 3, 4, 5, and 6,
      are merely of the nature of a diagram, and are for the purpose of
      explaining the successive operations that make up a cycle. A
      diaphram capable of a ready conduction of heat therethrough is
      shown at A, it separates the interior of a non-conducting cylinder
      into the two parts B and 13 B, each of these cylindrical parts are
      provided with a non-conducting piston respectively indicated by C
      and C C, these pistons are moved' to and from the diaphram A by
      means of separate racks and pinions respectively shown at D and D
      D. For explanatory purposes, crank arms indicated at G and G G are
      here shown for operating their respective pinions ; and for the
      purpose of avoiding prolixity, mechanism for operating these crank
      arms has been purposely omitted because such explanation is not
      essential to a proper understanding of the particular principles
      and operation herein involved.<br>
      <br>
      Preparatory to operating, a permanent charge of working fluid is
      charged' through the conduit E and opened cock F and into the
      cylinder B while partially withdrawing the piston C; the cock F
      is, then closed to put the engine in condition for operation. This
      fluid is manipulated as a portion of the working fluid and is not
      the fluid to be treated or transformed. It is preferable that this
      fluid shall be the same kind as that which is to be treated, but
      in&nbsp; more densified condition. It is essential that this
      cylinder shall now be only partially expanded and thereby permit
      ample room for subsequent expanding 'and contracting by means of
      the 'piston C.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, a cycle is ejected by the following successive
      operations.-<br>
      <br>
      1. Starting with the pistons placed as shown in Figure 2. Through
      the conduit E E and opened, cock F and while withdrawing the
      piston C C to its full extent ; a charge of vaporous, or gaseous
      fluid to be operated upon or transformed, -is received into the
      cylinder B B. The cock F F is then- closed. The pistons have now
      acquired the positions shown in Figure 3. This operation causes an
      interchange of heat through the diaphram A until a common
      temperature is acquired in both cylinders, and also causes the
      piston C C to effect external work or dynamic energy by reason of
      its withdrawal with the fluid pressure thereon.. <br>
      <br>
      2. The piston C C remaining stationary; the working fluid in the
      cylinder B is expanded and cooled by a partial withdrawal of the
      piston C ; at a slow rate of speed' so as to make efficient the'
      accompanying transfer of heat through the diaphram A, from the
      fluid in the cylinder B B to the fluid in the cylinder B.<br>
      <br>
      This operation causes the-fluid in the cylinder B 13 to lessen its
      pressure,by reason of its loss of heat, while the fluid in the
      cylinder B effects work by reason of its expansion and pressure.
      The pistons have now acquired the positions shown in Figure 4.<br>
      <br>
      3. With the piston C slowly continuing its course of withdrawal,
      the cylinder , B B is contracted by forcing the piston C C towards
      the diaphram A, preferably at constant pressure. The pistons have
      now acquired the. positions' shown in . Figure 5. This operation
      causes the fluid in the cylinder B to be further cooled and
      continue its production of work by reason of its expansion; while
      the fluid in the cylinder B B is caused to contract by reason of
      the application of external work thereon, and loss of the heat
      transferred to the contents of the cylinder B.,<br>
      <br>
      4. With the cylinder B B contracted, and the piston C C remaining
      stationary; the cylinder B is contracted by slowly forcing its
      piston C back to its initial position. This operation causes the
      fluid in the cylinder B B to acquire temperature and pressure by
      reason of the compression of fluid in the cylinder B.<br>
      <br>
      The pistons have . now acquired the positions shown in Figure 6.<br>
      <br>
      5. The piston C remaining stationary, the fluid in the cylinder B
      B is removed in a transformed condition through the conduit E E,
      by opening the cock F F and forcing the piston C C to its initial
      position; the pistons have again acquired the positions shown
      in-Figure 2, and the cycle is completed.<br>
      <br>
      The relative extent of the successive operations which make up
      this single cycle can, be regulated so as to produce any desired
      degree of change in potential condition. The degree of increase in
      total contained energy is dependent upon the degree of pressure
      under which the treated fluid is densified, and is an increasing
      function of this pressure.<br>
      <br>
      A more controllable result can be attained by a cycle which
      consists in one or more repetitions of such single cycle modified
      by retaining the fluid in the cylinder 13 B for the repeated
      treatment. '1'he relative extent of the successive. operations can
      be regulated to produce any desired change in potential condition,
      and any desired change In total contained energy.<br>
      <br>
      This transforming engine possesses the following objectionable
      features <br>
      <br>
      1. The process is not continuous.<br>
      <br>
      2nd. the engine is not highly efficient, in a mechanical and
      constructive sense.<br>
      <br>
      To overcome these objectionable features; I have invented the type
      of transforming engine herein shown by Figures 7 any 7", taken
      together as a whole. I prefer to operate this engine so as to
      effect a process or method of operation that is less generic than
      that hereinbefore mentioned, which definiteness consists in
      liquifying the fluid by abstracting heat or energy therefrom while
      maintaining it at a relatively low pressure, and transferring this
      heat to the thus liquified fluid while maintaining this liquified
      fluid at a greater pressure. With this particular apparatus; this
      process or method of operation is effected in, the more specific
      manner having definiteness as regards the liquifaction of the
      fluid by abstracting heat or energy therefrom while maintaining it
      at a relatively low temperature and pressure by a regenerative
      action, and transferring this heat to the thus liquified fluid
      while maintaining this liquified fluid at a greater pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Figures 7A and 7B. In order to clearly show the
      operation of this engine and the principles involved; - in a
      conventional manner the apparatus. is shown by these two figures,
      when they are taken together as a whole; certain. conduits shown
      in one figure connect with and continue as the same conduit. in
      the other figure, these conduits are respectively indicated by the
      same reference letter in each figure, and are the conduits Z, Y,
      X, and W; the direction which the fluid is caused to pass through
      the various conduits is indicated by conventional arrows. Figure
      7A is a sectional-elevation and shows that portion of the
      apparatus where manipulations are effected as regards interchange
      of heat. Figure 7" is a plan and shows the dynamic mechanism. In a
      conventional manner, and where desirable, the conduits and engine
      cylinders are. shown to be surrounded by suitable insulating
      material to prevent thermal inefficiencies by reason of external
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, preferably, the fluid to be treated or transformed
      is received in. a gaseous condition by the conduit U and passes
      therethrough into. the conduit Y which extends from the pressure
      reducing-valve V to the compression cylinder.Cl.<br>
      <br>
      This fluid enters the conduit Y, therein mixes with- the current,
      of, fluid -passing therethrough from the valve V, passes from this
      conduit into the compression cylinder Cl, is compressed in this
      cylinder and delivered therefrom, into the conduit Z and passes
      therethrough until the valve .Y is reached at the end of this
      conduit Z, by passing through this opened valve it again enters
      the conduit Y to again pass therethrough to the compressor Cl.
      Through the conduit X, and as explained later, a portion of the
      fluid is withdrawn from this circuit.<br>
      <br>
      A diaphram or siding capable of a ready conduction of heat
      therethrough is indicated by D, and separates the above mentioned
      conduits Y and Z. The above mentioned compression ejected by the
      compression cylinder C causes a changed condition to the fluid, as
      regards pressure and temperature; thereby the fluid pressure is
      increased and also the temperature of the fluid is increased.<br>
      <br>
      The above mentioned passage of this fluid through the conduit Z,
      in this compressed and heated condition, causes an efficient
      regenerative interchange of heat through the diaphram D, with the
      colder fluid passing in an opposite direction in the adjoining
      conduit Y.<br>
      <br>
      This regenerative interchange of heat effects a, self-intensifying
      frigefactive effect, culminating at the valve V, and causing the
      fluid in the thus frigefied end of the conduit Z to condense to
      the liquid condition. By reason of gravitation, this frigefied
      liquid fluid collects in the trap or upturn at the bottom of the
      conduit Z, from whence it is forced through the upward turn of
      this trap until it reaches the valve V at the top of this upturn
      in the conduit. By passing from thence through the orifice or
      opened pressure reducing valve V, the culminating frigefaction is
      then effected by reason of the evaporation of this liquid due to
      its entry into the conduit Y wherein a lesser pressure is
      maintained by the combined action of the valve V and the
      compressor C 1.<br>
      <br>
      Through the conduit X, a portion of the liquid fluid is withdrawn
      from the conduit Z. This withdrawn liquid passes through the
      conduit X and enters the pressure pump P 3 wherein it is put under
      pressure and ejected therefrom into and through the conduit W
      wherein this increased pressure is maintained. The conduit it' is
      separated from the conduits and Y by the diaphram or siding 1'
      which. is capable of a ready conduction of heat therethrough.<br>
      <br>
      For a normal working of the apparatus; the weight of the liquid
      fluid thus withdrawn from the conduit Z and forced into the
      conduit W, is equal to the weight of gaseous fluid received into
      the apparatus through the conduit U.<br>
      <br>
      Through the diaphram F, there is an efficient interchange of heat
      between the frigefied liquid passing through the conduit W and the
      warmer and gaseous fluid passing under a lessor pressure and in an
      opposite direction through the adjoining conduit Z. Thus; the
      gaseous fluid to be treated or transformed is received into the
      apparatus, through the conduit U ; is condensed to the liquid
      condition when it reaches the frigefactive end of the conduit Z;is
      kept in a. liquid condition and under a greater pressure after
      passing through the pump P 3 and while under this pressure and
      passing through the conduit W along the diaphram if, it receives
      heat abstracted from the gaseous fluid in the adjoining conduit,
      thereby aiding the condensation in the conduit Z.<br>
      <br>
      The circuit through the valve Y is maintained for the purpose of
      producing the self-intensive frigefactive effect, and should be
      operated with sufficient flow, but with little difference in
      pressure through this valve; because the efficiency of a reducing
      valve or orifice for this purpose, in a thermodynamic sense, is
      affected by this difference in pressure and is a. decreasing
      function thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The counter shaft T is driven by any suitable source of dynamic
      energy. By means of suitable regulating devices such as the belted
      sprocket cones shown at R 1 and R 3, the counter shaft T actuates
      the compressor C 1 and the pressure pump P 3 by means of their
      respective crank shaft and piston shown at S 1 nnd S 3. These
      sprocket cones or an equivalent regulating device afford suitable
      means for regulating the relative flow through the compressor C 1
      and the pressure pump P 3. The pressure reducing valve V is of the
      type used on self-intensive frigefactive apparatus, and can be
      readily adjusted to effect any desired change of pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Thus is presented a description of a type of potential
      transforming engine that receives a continuous flow of gaseous
      fluid to be treated; ejects the same in a continuous now, and in a
      changed potential condition in the same sense as hereinbefore
      mentioned and described in connection with the apparatus shown by
      Figure 1. Also, it may be remarked that with each of these devices
      it is desirable to densify the treated fluid at a degree of
      pressure that is below but somewhat near its critical-pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 8A and 8B, taken together as a whole, show a preferable
      manner of combining the type of potential transforming engine
      shown in Figures 7A and 7D, with an ordinary type of heat motor
      engine. In order to clearly show the operation of this combination
      and the principles involved ; in a conventional manner the
      apparatus is shown by these two figures, when they are taken
      together as a whole; certain conduits shown in one figure connect
      with and continue as the same conduit in the other figure, these
      conduits are respectively indicated by the same reference letter
      in each figure, and are the conduits Z, Y, X, W, U, and L; the
      direction which the fluid is caused to pass through the various
      condiii4g is indicated by conventional arrows. Figure S' is a
      sectional elevation and shows that portion of the apparatus where
      manipulations are effected as regards interchange of heat. Figure
      8B is a. plan and shows the dynamic mechanism. For the purpose of
      convenience, the various parts of the transforming engine, where
      shown in this combination, are respectively indicated by the same
      reference letters that are used in Figures 7A and 7B. In a
      conventional manner and where desirable, the conduits and engine
      cylinders are shown to be surrounded by suitable insulating
      material to prevent thermal inefficiencies by reason of external
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The object of this combination is to effect an interception of the
      ejected low pressure fluid from tho heat motor engine, transform
      the potential condition of this ejected fluid by passing same
      through the potential transforming engine, return this transferred
      and high-pressured fluid to the heat motor engine, increase the
      total contained energy of this returned fluid by applying heat
      taken from available terrestrial atmosphere, pass this
      comparatively heated fluid through the working cylinder of the
      heat motor engine, and thus complete the cycle in accordance with
      the principles hereinbefore explained in the rationale of the
      matter as regards utilizing heat that is common to terrestrial
      matter for the purpose of transmuting same into dynamic energy.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, the low pressure gaseous fluid is ejected from the
      working cylinder E 2 of the heat motor engine, it is also ejected
      from the working cylinders of the auxiliary motor engines E I and
      E 3 which are directly attached respectively to the compression
      cylinder 0 1 and the pressure pump P 3 for the purpose , of
      supplying the necessary dynamic energy to operate same. This
      ejected low pressure fluid is received in the conduit U and
      therefrom passes into and through the various conduits of the
      transforming engine in identically the same manner as was
      described for Figures 7A and 7B. The transformed and comparatively
      cold fluid, under high pressure, and preferably in liquid
      condition. -passes from the conduit W into a continuation of this
      conduit shown at K which is separated from the conduit H bv a
      diaphram or siding J capable of a ready conduction of heat
      therethrough. Through the conduit H; preferably: is forced a
      current of air taken directly from the atmosphere, or a current of
      water taken from some large body of same, by means of a. suitable
      fan or circulating device which it is not necessary to show here
      and is purposely -omitted in order to avoid prolixity. Through the
      diaphram T the current of atmosphere passing- through the conduit
      H effects an exchange of heat with the current of colder fluid
      passing in an opposite direction in the adioining conduit K;
      thereby, the hijyh pressured fluid is heated and expanded, or
      evaporated, at high pressure, and is forced through the
      continuation of this conduit shown at L. From thence, this high
      pressured Pa.aeous ftniel is withdrawn to operate the before
      mentioned motor cylinders E 1. E 2, and E 3. From the motor
      cylinders, this fluid is ejected at low pressure into the conduit
      TT, nnll thus the cycle is completed. In order to, rencw the
      working fluid lost by leakage, and to maintain a proper quantity
      of fluid in the conduit system, the pump P 4 forces a supply
      through the conduit N and from thence into the conduit W. The
      fluid is supplied to this pump in a liquified condition, and by
      means of. the conduit M which leads from some suitable reservoir
      containing a supply thereof. It .is desirable that this liquid
      shall be non-corrosive, cheap, readily obtained, and .possess a
      critical temperature and a critical-pressure that are conveniently
      low. Consequently, I prefer to use liquid air, or liquid carbon
      monoxide.<br>
      <br>
      The current of atmosphere passing through the conduit H is the
      source from which heat is supplied for actuating this whole system
      of mechanism. If .it were possible to construct the apparatus so
      that a perfect efficiency would be obtained from all of its parts;
      the heat that disappears or is abstracted from the current of
      atmosphere would represent the surplus of dynamic or mechanical
      energy developed by the whole apparatus; in other words, all of
      the heat taken from this current would be transmuted into dynamic
      energy available for any purpose. In a practical apparatus; the
      difference between the actual, available dynamic energy and the
      heat abstracted from.the current of atmosphere represents that
      portion of the abstracted heat that is not transmuted into dynamic
      energy but is dissipated; consequently, it is desirable that-the
      various parts shall be con- 8li'uctqd so .as to . effect the
      greatest possible degree of efficiency, particularly as regards
      fluid expansion and fluid compression. From the. pulley O on the
      shaft of the motor engine E 2, all available dynamic energy can be
      taken by. means of a belt or other suitable device and applied to
      any desired purpose. For the purpose of effecting a suitable
      regulation of the relative flow through the.various conduits; the
      various pistons are connected one to the other by means of the
      counter shaft T and the several belted sprocket cones connecting
      this counter shaft with the crank shafts that operate with these
      pistons, and shown respectively at R, R 2, R 3, and R 4.<br>
      <br>
      For convenience in starting and stopping the apparatus; valves for
      stopping the supply of motive fluid from the conduit L to the
      engine cylinders E 1, E 2, and E 3, are shown respectively at, L
      1, L 2, and L 3 ; clutches for disconnecting the torsional action
      of tile shaft '1' in regard to the several sets of sprocket cones
      are shown. respectively at T l, '1' 2, '1' 3,' and '1' 4. In like
      manner the clutch '1" disconnects the pulley R 5 which is used
      only when starting the apparatus, and as a means for then
      connecting some suitable steam engine or. other convenient source
      of dynamic, energy for the purpose of actuating the counter shaft
      and thereby actuate the mechanism of the apparatus until a .normal
      working is effected ; when the apparatus has acquired a normal
      working condition, this pulley is disconnected from the shaft T by
      this clutch T 5, the auxiliary starting engine is stopped, and the
      apparatus continues its action by reason of the self operating
      feature...<br>
      <br>
      By utilizing the cooled current of atmosphere ejected from the
      conduit H, for frigefactive purposes, the apparatus becomes a self
      operating frigefactive engine.<br>
      <br>
      In order to make clear the principles involved, in Figures 7A and
      8A it was necessary to adopt a conventional manner of showing the
      conduit system. In .practice it is desirable to adopt an annular
      spiral coil system.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably; this coil system consists of a continuous series of
      flat spirals placed one over the other, separated into successive
      layers by horizontal partitions of non-conducting material; and
      between these horizontal partitions, a spiral partition of the
      same material is arranged to form a flat spiral conduit in each
      layer, so as to continue successively through the series of
      layers, and to conduct the current of low pressure flu14, In and
      along this insulated conduit&nbsp; the current of lower pressured
      fluid are placed conduits or pipes containing respectively the
      several higher pressured fluid currents, these pipes are made of
      material which is capable of a ready conduction of heat
      therethrough. <br>
      <br>
      Figures 9 and 10 show a spiral coil cont1'lcted on this system,
      Figure 9 is a sectional plan, Figure 10 is a sectional elevation,
      and the same reference letters are used in both of these figures
      to indicate same parts. In the interior of the hermetically closed
      casing C the higher pressured fluid pipes or conduits 2 and 3 are
      contained in the insulated spiral conduit 1 and there surrounded
      by the current of lower pressured fluid contained in this conduit
      1.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, is presented a description of an operative and practical
      apparatus for effecting the purpose of my invention. ' A
      self-intensifying heat engine is herein understood to be a heat
      engine in which the action of the cycle tends to intensify or
      extend the limit of the working range of temperatures, when
      interchange of heat with external sources is dispensed with. A
      regenerative action is herein understood to be an interchange of
      heat between fluid tha,t precedes and fluid tha,t follows in the
      same routine, or the abstraction and subsequent return of heat to
      and from the same fluid.<br>
      <br>
      Also, it is understood that any operation herein mentioned in
      connection with my invention may be performed in any manner that
      is suitable and known.<br>
      <br>
      Also; my invention is not limited to the use of any particular
      material in the construction of the various parts; any particular
      working fluid; nor any particular type of engine or device for
      converting fluid pressure and expansion into dynamic energy,
      particularly as regards the application of fluid jets and turbines
      to such purposes. Also, the application of a multiples method of
      combination, which consists in effecting the same cycle of
      operation by means of inter-dependent action between two or more
      apparatus, shall be considered as a mere equivalent of the simple
      single apparatus shown.<br>
