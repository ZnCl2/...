      </center>
      <p>For some time past there has been quite a controversy going on
        regarding the subject of interplanetary communication by means
        of electric waves. I have been very much interested in the above
        on account of experiments which I have made and data collected
        pertaining to gravitation effects on high frequency oscillations
        and electronic discharges in general. A series of experiments
        which I conducted during the year 1904, caused me to formulate
        the theory that interplanetary transmission of electrical
        impulses was an impossibility on account of the sun’s resisting
        and absorbing influence which virtually isolates our planet from
        all other electrical vibrations of a lesser tension or power. </p>
      <p><b>Gravitation Suspended in Experiments</b> </p>
      <p>The above theorem was arrived at after I had succeeded in
        sustaining a metallic object in space by means of a
        counter-gravitational effect produced through the action of an
        electric field upon the above object. A strong electric field
        was produced by means of a special form of generator and when
        the metallic object was held within its influence it drew up to
        approximately a distance of 1 mm from the center of the field,
        then was repelled backward toward an earthed contact, going
        within 10 cm of the same when it was again attracted toward the
        field’s center but this time getting no nearer than 5 cm from
        the polar nucleus. This backward and forward movement contained
        for some time until the metallic object at last came to a
        comparatively stable position, about 25 cm from the field’s
        center where it remained until the power was shut off. While the
        metallic object was suspended, I was able to study the effect of
        the surrounding field and found by means of a powerful
        microscope, assisted by the insertion of a vacuum tube within
        the field, that the metallic object (having of course a certain
        electrical capacity) became fully charged and gave off part of
        said charge to and against the surrounding field which tended to
        hold said object in space, apparently without any other
        sustaining influence. Around the outside of the metallic object
        and extending to a distance of about 1/2 cm was a completely
        dark belt or space in which there appeared to be no electrical
        agitation due, possibly, to neutralization caused by the contact
        of the large incoming energy supply from the field’s center of
        with the small oscillating radiations from metallic object. The
        ever-changing action of attraction and repulsion resulted in the
        overcoming of gravitation. Going farther I will state that the
        dark belt above mentioned after many tests gave no sign of
        electrification, inasmuch as its width was but 1/2 cm. In fact,
        a dark line was shown in the vacuum tube when it was introduced
        between metallic object and center of field. It is my firm
        conviction that somewhere on the outer confines of our planet
        there exists a similar counteracting belt through which naught
        but the gravitational vibrations of the sun penetrate, and these
        vibrations absolutely annihilate or absorb all other less
        powerful ones. </p>
      <p>Therefore, after making many experiments to ascertain as nearly
        as possible the absolute facts and conditions as they exist, I
        have come to the conclusion that all electrical disturbances not
        due to our own radio oscillations, on this globe are due to the
        sun’s electrical activities in semi-inductional contact with our
        polar extremities. </p>
      <p><b>Details of ‘Defying Gravity’</b> </p>
      <p>The illustrations 1 to 4 will possibly give a fair idea of the
        apparatus used, and the manner in which the experiments were
        carried on. </p>
      <p>Figure 1 shows the general scheme of arrangement of devices. In
        the lower left hand corner is shown the ‘ground contact’, which
        can be turned around and placed in any position found necessary;
        in fact, when a metallic object is in suspension, this ground
        can be entirely eliminated. </p>
      <p>I have found that any substance within the limits of my
        experiments can he held in suspension, viz: water globules,
        metallic objects, and insulators being among those tried. Some
        materials such as cork and wood exhibit peculiar properties when
        suspended; a piece of green maple would not rest in one position
        in the field, but oscillated backward and forward, continuously,
        going to the field’s center, then back to ground </p>
      <p>Heated materials exhibited equally peculiar characteristics: A
        silver ball 11 mm in diameter when heated, remained farther away
        from the field’s center than when at normal temperature; upon
        cooling it gradually drew up to the position it would occupy if
        unheated. </p>
      <p>Figure 2 shows a generator of the Wimhurst type (improved), the
        generating or collecting units being entirely enclosed in an
        insulating case and operated under a pressure of 3 atmospheres;
        completely dry air only, enters the case through the drying
        device attached to the air pump shown in Figure 1. Interior
        parts of the generator will retain quite a powerful charge for a
        long period of time. </p>
      <p>Figure 3 illustrates suspension stand and field producing
        electrode. The latter can be revolved in any direction by means
        of a spring motor shown on the upper section of the stand. </p>
      <p>The small apertures seen in electrode, which is hollow, are
        there for the purpose of ascertaining the action of the reduced
        field tension at these points, and are also made use of to hold
        different sized metallic discs, which are cemented to insulating
        plates, forming condensers, the function of which is to create
        weak opposite polarities at these points and thus show a
        reaction on the suspended object and also a greater ocular
        effect in the vacuum tube. </p>
      <p>Figure 4 is a detailed drawing of the vacuum tube principally
        used; this is of the spectrum type, without sealed-in electrodes
        and when introduced into the electrical fields, flows very
        brightly at its extremities, especially giving a sharp line
        bordering the dark space around the metallic object. A very high
        vacuum is sustained in the tube and it is found necessary to
        build it of a very perfect insulating glass; the bulb must be
        kept absolutely dry on its outer surface. </p>
      <p>Different tubes have been used beside the above; corrugated
        spherical, cone shaped, and cylindrical, with various results. </p>
      <p>The electric field produced for suspension&nbsp; experiments is
        very powerful and intense, being detectable with a vacuum tube
        at a distance of over 6 meters (19.68 ft). </p>
      <p>In conjunction with the above and drawing an analogy between
        the same, I am of the opinion that cometary motion is
        undoubtedly due to the activity of its compositional elements
        and their susceptibility t changes of polarity which, when the
        comet is far distant from the sun, would be opposite in sign to
        that of the latter, or when in close proximity to the ventral
        orb, would be of the same sign and therefore repelled. </p>
      <p>All bodies in process of formation possibly have their cometary
        stage, and doubtless future experiments will reveal this fact. </p>
      <p><b>Actual Effects Achieved by Mr Piggott</b> </p>
      <p>The total power required to operate the generator, which was
        run by an electric motor, was about 1/4 KW; the machine voltage
        was in the neighborhood of 500,000 when the electrodes were
        separated beyond sparking distance. The electrostatic charge
        left on the suspension electrode retained the average object in
        space for a short length of time, about 1-1/4 seconds after the
        machine ceased rotating. </p>
      <p>Some objects such as copper and silver balls, which are of
        course good electrical conductors, and very nearly homogeneous,
        when falling toward the earth, after power had been shut off,
        seemed to slow down when they neared same, and hovered about 2
        cm above contact for approximately 1 second of time before
        striking same; this was due no doubt to the inductional change
        in polarity which was imparted to balls almost at the instant of
        earth contact. </p>
      <p>The aura, shown in Figure 3, near suspended balls (which in
        this experiment were made of silver) extended outward to a
        distance of about 1 cm and covered about one-half of the upper
        hemisphere and a trifle more of the lower hemisphere. </p>
      <p>This bluish emanation appeared to be made up of numerous
        infinitesimal dots or darting particle, each apparently
        separated from the other by a very narrow, glowless belt.
        Wverything was, however, in a constant state of agitation and it
        was quite impossible to get an absolutely perfect view
        microscopically, of an individual particle. Different substances
        have different auras both in length and breadth, and also in
        luminosity. </p>
      <p>The silver balls used in these experiments had an actual
        gravitational weight of 1-3/10 gram (nearly 0.05 oz.,
        avoirdupois) and were the heaviest objects suspended at this
        time, their diameter being 11 mm as before mentioned in another
        part of this article. </p>
      <p>The largest object suspended was a cork cylinder 10 cm long by
        4 cm diameter (approximately 4 by 1-9/16 inches) which had a
        copper wire pushed through its center, and extending beyond its
        ends to a distance of 3 mm. The weight of the above cylinder was
        3/4 grams (0.002645 oz., avoirdupois). </p>
      <p>The behavior of metal spheres used in the above experiments was
        a most interesting spectacle; silver and copper balls floated
        very steadily on one position and when suspending electrode was
        revolved, would follows and turn slightly axially, but would not
        revolve entirely around same, there being a peculiar slipping
        effect not entirely accounted for. <br>

      </b><b>PIGGOT</b><br>
      <br>
      George S. Piggot (July 1920) designed, built, and utilized a
      fantastically potent electrostatic machine with which he observed
      powerful electrogravitic effects. The device was heavily encased
      and "dried out" with high-pressure carbon dioxide gas. With this
      dramatically dehumified static generator, Mr. Piggot observed a
      strange electro-gravitational effect. It was first seen, the
      result of accidental occurrences while performing unrelated
      electrical experiments.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Piggot was able to suspend heavy silver beads (112 inch in
      diameter) and other materials in the air space between a charged
      sphere and a concave ground plate when his generator was fully
      charged at 500,000 electrostatic volts. The levitational feat was
      only observed when the charged sphere was electropositive.<br>
      <br>
      The Piggot effect was clearly not a purely electrical phenomenon.
      If it were, then the presence of the grounded plate would have
      destroyed the effect. The very instant in which a discharged
      passed to ground, every suspended object would have come crashing
      down. But, without the ground counterpoise, the levitational
      effect was not observed. Mr. Piggot believed that he was modifying
      the local gravitational field in some inexplicable manner, the
      effect being the result of interaction between the static field
      generator and some other agency the ground.<br>
      <br>
      Piggot further stated that heated metal marbles fell further away
      from the field center than cold ones. These suspended marbles
      remained in the flotation space for at least 1.25 seconds even
      after the static generator ceased rotating. The marbles fell very
      slowly after the field was completely removed; a noticeable
      departure from normal gravitational behavior.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Piggot stated that suspended objects were surrounded by a
      radiant "black belt". The surrounding space was filled with the
      ephemeral electric blue lumination common with very powerful
      electrostatic machines. Many academicians explained such phenomena
      away. Employing electro-induction theories, it was stated that the
      effects were "simple outcomes of highly charged conditions in
      conductive media". The suspension of matter in Piggot's experiment
      was explained by academes to be the simple result of charge
      attraction and gravitational balance. Accordingly, charged metal
      balls would achieve their own balancing positions as long as the
      field was operating.<br>
      <br>
      Piggot stated that tiny blue spots could be seen running all over
      the suspended metal marbles, evidence of electrical discharging
      into the air. This being the case, no net attractive charge could
      ever develop, simply leaking away with every second into the
      surrounding air. Considering that the intense field was "grounded"
      to a concave electrode plate, no consistent charge condition could
      develop in such a space. Obvious similarities are noted when
      considering all these cases, the electrogravitic action being
      stimulated by intense electrostatic fields. Effects developed by
      Piggot were entirely similar to those observed by Nikola Tesla,
      who employed high voltage electrostatic impulses.<br>
      <br>
      The Piggot device certainly discharged its tremendous charge in a
      rapid staccato-like fashion to the ground plate. The rate of this
      disruptive unidirectional field would be determined by considering
      the parameters of the sphere and the concave ground plate. Judging
      from the actual capacities involved, and the sizable free air
      space, certainly it was a very rapid impulse rate. <br>

      1911-10-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      To all whom it may concern:<br>
      <br>
      Be it known that I, George S. Piggott, a citizen of the United
      States, and a resident of Chicago, county of Cook, and State of 5
      Illinois, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in
      Space Telegraphy, of which the following is declared to be a full,
      clear, and exact description.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to signaling systems 10 in which radiant
      electric energy transmitted from suitable sparking apparatus, is
      employed to effect suitable detectors at the receiving stations.<br>
      <br>
      The present improvement employs sparking or discharge terminals
      connected to the poles of a static electric machine and seeks to
      provide an effective form of that type of machine, together with
      signaling means for controlling the discharge between the sparking
      terminals.<br>
      <br>
      Other objects of the invention are to provide an effective form of
      detecting or receiving apparatus for use in connection with such a
      transmitting device. To provide 25 means whereby the transmitting
      and receiving apparatus may be synchronized and to provide an
      effective system of space, telegraphy which will be certain and
      rapid in operation which may be readily syntonized and 30 with
      which aerial wires or ground connections are not necessary,
      although both may be employed with the present improved system if
      desired.<br>
      <br>
      With these objects in view, the invention 35 consists in the
      improved arrangements and combinations set forth in the following
      description, illustrated in the accompanying drawings and more
      particularly pointed out in the appended claims.<br>

      <b> Fig. 13 is a detail view of parts shown in Fig. 12. </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The radiant electrical generator or transmitter preferably
      comprises a suitable inclosing casing 15, which is made of
      insulating material and is preferably shellacked inside and
      outside and which is mounted upon insulating blocks 16 of hard
      rubber or other suitable substance. Within the casing 15 are
      mounted a pair of uprights 17 of hard rubber or other suitable
      insulating material which are secured rigidly to the bottom of the
      casing. Between the upper ends of uprights or standards 17 is
      fixed a 70 shaft 18, preferably of steel upon which are mounted
      the revoluble disks 19. Disks 19 are arranged, as shown in pairs,
      any number of which may be employed in accordance with the desired
      capacity of the machine and 75 the separate disks of each pair are
      driven by suitable gearing in opposite directions. Each disk is
      preferably mounted (see Fig. 3) upon a hub 20 of hard rubber
      having a tubular brass core and is clamped in position 80 thereon
      between disks 21 of hard rubber which are securely fastened to the
      hubs 20 by right and left hand screw threads. Upon the outer end
      of each hub is threaded a beveled gear 22 which is preferably
      formed 85 of raw hide and, as shown, the gears connected to each
      pair of disks 19 face in opposite directions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br>
      <br>
      The disks 19 are rotated from a main drive shaft 23 suitably
      journaled between 90 the lower ends of the uprights 17. This shaft
      is preferably driven through gears 24 by a small electric motor 24
      mounted inside and upon the base of the casing 15 and the metallic
      parts of which are well insulated. Main drive beveled gears 25
      fixed upon shaft 23 mesh with beveled pinions 26 fixed upon the
      lower ends of vertically disposed counter-shafts 27, and beveled
      pinions 28 and the upper ends of the counter-shafts 27 engage the
      beveled, pinions 22 connected, as above described, to the disks
      19. Gears 25, 26, 28 and 22 are, for the sake of perfect
      insulation, preferably made of raw hide. Counter-shafts 27 are
      preferably formed of 105 hard brass and are journaled in hard
      brass bearings 29 fixed to the end uprights 17 and to an
      intermediate upright or uprights 30 (see Fig. 1).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      of which may be employed in accordance with the desired capacity
      of the machine and 75 the separate disks of each pair are driven
      by suitable gearing in opposite directions. Each disk is
      preferably mounted (see Fig. 3) upon a hub 20 of hard rubber
      having a tubular brass core and is clamped in position 80 thereon
      between disks 21 of hard rubber which are securely fastened to the
      hubs 20 by right and left hand screw threads. Upon the outer end
      of each hub is threaded a beveled gear 22 which is preferably
      formed 85 of raw hide and, as shown, the gears connected to each
      pair of disks 19 face in opposite directions.<br>
      <br>
      The disks 19 are rotated from a main drive shaft 23 suitably
      journaled between 90 the lower ends of the uprights 17. This shaft
      is preferably driven through gears 24 by a small electric motor 24
      mounted inside and upon the base of the casing 15 and the metallic
      parts of which are well insulated. 95 Main drive beveled gears 25
      fixed upon shaft 23 mesh with beveled pinions 26 fixed upon the
      lower ends of vertically disposed counter-shafts 27, and beveled
      pinions 28 and the upper ends of the counter-shafts 27 engage the
      beveled, pinions 22 connected, as above described, to the disks
      19. Gears 25, 26, 28 and 22 are, for the sake of perfect
      insulation, preferably made of raw hide.&nbsp; Counter-shafts 27
      are preferably formed of 105 hard brass and are journaled in hard
      brass bearings 29 fixed to the end uprights 17 and to an
      intermediate upright or uprights 30 (see Fig. 1).<br>
      <br>
      As above stated, any number or pairs of disks 19 may be employed
      (two sets being shown in the drawings) and by the gearing
      described, the disks of each pair or set will be driven in
      opposite directions. The disks 19 are formed of suitable
      dielectric material, such as glass or hard rubber, but preferably
      of the former and these disks are preferably provided with a
      coating of shellac. Thin metal contact plates or sectors 31 are
      cemented to the outer faces of each set of disks 19 by shellac or
      other suitable adhesive. These contact plates are preferably
      formed of aluminum and are preferably divided into two or more
      parts, the sectors shown in 15 the drawings being divided into two
      parts.<br>
      <br>
      Separate sets of contact brush holders 32 extend through the top
      and bottom of the casing and outside of each set of disks 19.
      These brush holders are, as shown in Figs. 1 20, and 2, arranged
      at diametrically opposite points and extend radially toward the
      center of the disks 19 and at an angle of about 70 degrees to the
      horizontal. Each holder 32 is provided with two or more contact
      brushes 33 of aluminum wire which are adapted to contact with the
      faces of disks 19 and with the sections of the divided contact
      plates 31. The brush holders 32 are formed of brass or aluminum
      rods and are held in 30 place by soft rubber plugs. 34 inserted in
      openings in the top and bottom of the casing 15 and snugly fitted
      in such openings to prevent leakage of air.<br>
      <br>
      It is desirable to maintain dry air under 35 pressure within the
      casing 15 and for that reason the brush holders 32 and other parts
      which extend through the casing, are suitably sealed so. that the
      casing may be substantially air tight Brush holders 32 are 40
      provided at their outer ends with slotted metal balls so that the
      upper and lower sets may be electrically connected by a metal rod
      35 set within the slotted balls and held in place by screws 3 6.
      The upper and lower 45 rods 35, connected respectively to the
      upper and lower sets of contact brush holders, are electrically
      connected by coiled insulating conductors 37. To hold the brush
      holders 32 securely in place against the outward pressure of the
      air within the casing 15, the soft rubber plugs 34 are preferably
      provided with flanges 34 which engage the inner face of the top
      and bottom of the casing.<br>
      <br>
      Condenser brush holders 38 are arranged. 55 in a horizontal plane
      extending through the center of the disks 19 and at diametrically
      opposite points. These holders are formed of aluminum or brass
      tubing and at each side are threaded into a common metal support
      39 having a central shouldered projection 40 which extends through
      the end of the casing and which is firmly held in place by a ball
      41, preferably of brass, which is threaded upon the end of the
      projection 40. 65 A Washer 42 between the ball 41 and the casing
      renders the joint practically air tight. The brush holders 38 are
      arranged in pairs on the outside of each pair of oppositely
      rotating disks 19 and are provided with brushes 38a of fine
      aluminum wire which extend toward, but do not contact with the
      disks.<br>
      <br>
      To each support 39 for the condenser brushes, is threaded or
      otherwise suitably fixed, a tubular rod 43 of aluminum which 75
      extends upwardly through the top of the casing. The upper end of
      the tubular rod is plugged to prevent leakage of air and is
      connected by a short piece of metal tubing with a brass ball 45. A
      hard rubber so thimble 46 and a washer'47 between the ball and the
      top of the casing seals this joint. A metal rod or tube 49 is
      mounted to slide horizontally through a bore in the ball 45 and
      may be held firmly in any adjusted position therein by a screw 50.
      A similar rod 49 is connected in a similar manner to the other
      side of the machine and the inner ends of these rods are provided
      with sparking or discharge terminals or balls 51, while the 90
      outer ends of the rods are provided with handles 52 which may be
      grasped to adjust the position, of the sparking terminals and
      which are of hard rubber, preferably corrugated as shown. Between
      the sparking terminals or balls 51 and in line therewith, is
      preferably located a large metal discharge ball 53 preferably of
      brass which is secured to the top of the casing.<br>
      <br>
      A short circuit connects the opposite sides 100 or poles of the
      machine and consists of bent pieces 54 (see Fig, 3) of brass or
      aluminum which are secured to the balls 41 at the ends of the
      machine. The bent pieces 54 are preferably covered with insulating
      material 105 and the end balls or terminals 55 of the shunt
      circuit are inclosed in receptacles 56 of hard rubber or other
      suitable material. The receptacles 56 are mounted upon a bracket
      57, preferably of insulating material secured to the casing 15,
      and the opposing faces of the receptacles 56 are provided with
      small openings 58 in line with which normally extends a shiftable
      conductor con-nected to the signaling key.<br>
      <br>
      The signaling key 59, preferably formed of brass, is pivoted
      between a pair of bearing pins 60 and is normally held in uplifted
      position with its inner end against an adjustable stop 62 by a
      cushion spring 63 120 which is interposed between the outer end of
      the key and the shelf or support 57. The inner end 64 of the key
      is connected to the main body thereof by an insulating section 65.
      The shiftable conductor is formed of of separate pieces of brass
      or aluminum tubing 66 fitted to adjustably slide one within the
      other and adjustably held in place upon the end of the key by a
      screw 67. Each of the tubular sections 66 is fitted at its end
      with a pointed steel plug 68 and, in normal position, the
      conducting sections 66 and points 68 extend in line with the
      openings 58 in the receptacles 56.<br>
      <br>
      When the electric generator described, is operated the condenser
      brushes and sparking terminal upon one side or pole of the
      ma-chine will become charged with positive and those upon the
      other side or'pole of the machine will become charged with
      negative electricity! A part of the charge however will leak
      across from the short circuit terminals 55 through the shiftable
      conductor or switch 66, the points of which are in line 15 with
      the openings 58 in the receptacles 56 which inclose the short
      circuit terminals. A sufficient amount of the charge will thus,
      leak from one side or pole of the machine to the other to prevent
      any disruptive discharge 20 or spark between the discharge
      terminals 51. When however, the sparking terminals are properly
      adjusted and the key is depressed, a disruptive discharge or
      single spark at once occurs between'the discharge terminals, 25
      since the conductor or switch 66 is by the depression of the key
      moved out of line of the openings 58 in the receptacles 56. The
      leakage of current between the poles of the machine is thus
      interrupted so that a heavy 30 spark at once takes place between
      the discharge terminals.<br>
      <br>
      Numerous advantages are incident to the employment of such a
      static machine as a transmitter for space telegraphy. At each 35
      quick depression of the signal key a single strong heavy spark
      having little heat occurs between the positive and negative
      terminals instead of a series of sparks having considerable heat
      such as occur at the spark gap 40 when a coil is employed for the
      production of a high tension current. Moreover, the sparking
      terminals are always ready to discharge at the instant the signal
      key is depressed and there is no magnetic lag to overcome as is
      the case with a sparking coil, thereby increasing the speed of
      transmission. With the present improved transmitter a single spark
      or discharge is employed to represent a " dot" while two sparks or
      discharges 50 in quick succession represent a "'dash" so that
      signals may be rapidly and accurately transmitted. The machine
      moreover, can be readily, adjusted for selective signaling as
      hereinafter explained and does not require 55 the employment of an
      aerial wire or ground connection, although either or both may be
      employed if desired for transmission of signals over long
      distances.<br>
      <br>
      The discharge balls 51 and 53 may be of 60 any suitable size, but
      good results have been obtained with the discharge terminals 51 of
      about an inch and a half in diameter and with the intermediate
      discharge ball of three to four inches in diameter. When a signal
      is to be transmitted the negative terminal 51 is preferably
      adjusted to a position quite close to the intermediate discharge
      ball 58 while the positive discharge terminal 51 is placed about
      an inch away from the center discharge ball so that a heavy strong
      spark yo occurs between the positive sparking terminal and the
      center discharge ball. The sections of the shifting conductor or
      switch 66 may be readily adjusted to correct position to prevent a
      discharge between the terminals 75 until the signal key 59 is
      depressed.<br>
      <br>
      To prevent leakage between the condenser brushes and the central
      steel shaft of the machine, the ends of the brush holders 38 are
      preferably provided with blocks 38b of g® insulating material.<br>
      <br>
      The efficiency of the machine is found to be considerably
      increased by maintaining air under pressure within the
      substantially air-tight casing 15 which incloses the generator
      disks, plates and brushes and preferably the air within the casing
      is maintained as dry and as free from moisture as possible. For
      this purpose a small air pump 69. (see Fig. 6, the oscillating
      type of pump being illustrated in the drawings) is driven from a
      suitable electric or other motor 70 and supplies air under
      pressure to the upper end of a casing 71 through a flexible pipe
      72. The casing 71, which is preferably upwardly flaring is shown,
      is provided with a grating 73 at its lower end upon which is
      superposed a layer 74 of cotton wool which serves to filter the
      air. Above the layer of cotton wool is placed a layer 75 of
      anhydrous 100 calcium chloride which removes all moisture from the
      air. The lower end of the casing 71 is provided with a drain cock
      76. A valved outlet nozzle 77 near the lower end of the casing is
      provided with a screen and 105 is connected by a flexible pipe 78
      with an inlet valve 79 (see Fig. 2) on one side of the machine
      casing 15. An outlet valve 80 is provided on the opposite side of
      the casing and is set to maintain a pressure of about 110 thirty
      pounds within the same. By thus maintaining dry air under pressure
      within the machine, the efficiency of the latter is found to be
      considerably increased and the machine is not atfected by the
      varying atmospheric conditions. The sides 81 (see Fig. 2) of the
      casing 15 are preferably removably held in place by screws 82,
      rubber packing being provided between the sides and the edges of
      the casing to produce a 120 tight joint.<br>
      <br>
      The transmitter may be readily syntonized for selectively
      signaling a series of stations by providing a series of discharge
      terminals 51a, 51b, 51c, etc. (see Diagram Fig. 7) and 125 by
      providing a series of intermediate dis-charge balls 53a, 53b,
      '53c, etc., the size of which terminals and balls is varied to
      vary the capacity and thus vary the intensity, length and
      thickness of the sparks transmitted. The signals are transmitted
      from the desired set of terminals by properly adjusting that set
      while the others are withdrawn as indicated in Fig. 7. The
      efficiency of the transmitter is increased and it may be further
      syntonized by providing condensers of varying capacity on one or
      both sides of the machine. In Fig. these condensers are indicated
      in the form 10 of Leyden jars 88 having their poles 84 arranged
      adjacent the balls 41 on opposite sides from the machine. A series
      of such condensers may be employed if desired. Moreover, if
      desired for transmitting, signals over long distances, the
      positive side of the machine may be connected to an aerial wire 85
      and too, if desirable, the condenser, or capacity arranged
      adjacent the positive side of the machine may be Connected to the
      20 ground by a wire 86.<br>
      <br>
      The detector or receiving device at the receiving stations
      comprises a suitable inclosing casing 87 preferably of wood,
      thoroughly shellacked and mounted upon insulating feet 88. A plate
      89 of hard rubber or other suitable insulating material upon the
      upper face of the casing, carries an upright 90 also of hard
      rubber, to which is fixed the lower section of a hinged clamp 91
      the members of which are also formed of hard rubber. The curved
      open ends of the clamp embrace and rigidly support in horizontal
      position the coherer or variable resistance apparatus, the latter
      being securely held in 35 place by a thumb screw 92 extending
      between the hinged members of the clamp.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      The coherer or variable resistance apparatus comprises a tubular
      casing 93 preferably of hard rubber within opposite ends 40 of
      which are threaded hollow plugs 94 also of hard rubber. The inner
      ends of the plugs 94 abut, as shown within the casing 93 and they
      are securely, held and clamped in position by lock nuts 95 of hard
      rubber. The 45 conducting plugs 96 are adjustably threaded through
      the hollow plugs 94 and are provided on their ends with thumb nuts
      97 by which suitable conductors may be connected thereto. The
      conducting plugs 96 are preferably formed of silver 500 to 600
      fine and partly of nickel. The inner end of one of the plugs is
      provided with a cylindrical extension 98, while the inner, end of
      the opposite plug is provided with a cylindrical depression or
      recess 99 slightly larger in diameter than the extension 98. The
      filings 100 intermediate the ends of the conducting plugs are
      preferably of soft iron, medium fine, mixed with about two per
      cent, of platinum filings. Preferably, to increase the
      sensitiveness of the coherer, the soft iron filings are first
      placed under magnetic influence or tension before they are put
      into position between the conducting plugs 96.<br>
      <br>
      The arrangement described has been found extremely sensitive in
      operation. The hollow supporting plugs 94 of hard rubber and the
      conducting plugs 96 carried thereby may be removed and threaded
      back into position without disturbing the adjustment between the
      ends of the conducting plugs. By forming the parts of hard rubber
      they are bound very tightly together and the adjustment of the
      conducting plugs is not readily displaced. The hard rubber 75
      parts are preferably shellacked and highly polished so that the
      filings will not become tarnished by the sulfur or other component
      parts of the rubber.<br>
      <br>
      The coils 101 of a polarized relay, are in 80 circuit with the
      coherer, as indicated in Fig. 11. In order that the operation of
      the relay may not interfere with the operation of the coherer and
      in order that the relay contacts may be kept free from dust, such
      85 relay is preferably mounted within the casing 87 and preferably
      upon a series of insulating blocks 102. The relay coils 101 are
      mounted upon one pole of a permanent horse shoe magnet 103, the
      cores of the coils being 90 in electrical connection with such
      pole of the permanent magnet. A metal upright 104, fixed to the
      other pole of the permanent magnet 103, pivotally supports the
      horizontally disposed armature 105 which is arranged to vibrate
      between the poles of the relay. A binding post 106 is fixed to the
      upper end of upright 104 and a leaf spring 107 is connected to the
      binding post and its free end engages the vibrating armature 105
      in line with its pivot, thus maintaining a secure electric contact
      therewith. The circuit tnrough the relay, armature and contact may
      be traced in Fig. 11 from battery 108. to binding post 106,
      contact spring 107, 105 armature 105, relay contact 109, tapper
      actuating magnet 110 and through oppositely wound coils 111 upon
      the members of the permanent magnet 103 and fro m thence back to
      battery. By thus directing the circuit 110 from battery 108
      through oppositely wound coils on the members of the permanent
      magnet 103, any loss of magnetism in the latter is compensated for
      and the full strength of the magnet maintained.<br>
      <br>
      To adjust the sensitiveness of the relay, an armature 112 (see
      Fig. 11) is provided in line with the poles of the magnet 103 and
      is adjustable to and from such poles. A screw threaded extension
      113 upon the armature extends through guides upon a suitable
      support 114 and lock nuts 115 threaded on the extension serve to
      hold the armature in adjusted position at any desired distance
      from the poles of magnet 103.<br>
      <br>
      The tapper actuating magnet 110 is mounted, upon a suitable
      support 116 upon the upper portion of the casing with its poles
      facing upwardly. Its armature 117 is pivoted to a suitable upright
      118 on the top of the casing and its outer end extends in
      substantially horizontal direction over the upwardly facing poles
      of the magnet 110. A leaf spring 119 is fixed to the outer end of
      the armature and extends inwardly over its pivot. The inner
      upwardly bent free end of spring 119 is engaged by an adjusting
      screw 120 threaded through a suitable projection upon the support
      118 and 10 normally holds the inner end of the armature against an
      adjusting screw 121 also threaded through an extension fixed to
      the support 118. The tapper 122 fixed to the inner end of the
      armature extends downwardly and inwardly beneath the end of the
      coherer supporting clamp 91 in position to strike the clamp when
      the magnet 110 is energized. Since the signals are transmitted
      from the improved generator by single or individual disruptive
      discharges or sparks instead of a series of such discharges or
      sparks, the tapper actuating magnet 110 is non-self-interrupting,
      that is, the operating circuit therefor extends directly through
      its 25 coil and not through an intermediate contact controlled bv
      the vibration of its armature. In operation a single blow of the
      tapper against the coherer clamp represents a dot and two blows in
      quick succession reprsent a dash. Other similar codes could of
      course be employed if desired. When the tapper strikes the coherer
      clamp a clear resonant sound is emitted and the signal may be
      easily read. Other means may of 35 course be employed for reading
      the signal as for example, a telephone interposed in the coherer
      circuit. By properly adjusting the screws 120 and 121, the
      operation of the tapper magnet may be rendered extremely 40
      sensitive.<br>
      <br>
      The coherer circuit (see Fig. 11) derives current from a small
      battery 123 and in this circuit is also interposed a variable
      resistance or rheostat 124 for regulating the 45 amount of
      current. This rheostat is convenient mounted, as shown, upon one
      end of the casing. An intensifier 125 of improved construction, is
      also interposed in the coherer circuit as indicated in Fig. 11. 50
      The intensifier (see Figs. 12 and 13) comprises a suitable casing
      provided with bind-ing posts 126 to which the conductors of the
      coherer circuit are conveniently attached. Binding posts 126 are
      in turn connected to 55 a pair of binding posts 127 by conductors
      128. A contact disk 129 is rotatably mounted between the binding
      posts 127 and a pair of brush holders 130, upon the outer ends of
      the binding posts, are each provided with 39 a series of line wire
      brushes 131 One of which upon each brush holder is bent to contact
      with the rotating disk. 129. If one of the fine brushes is injured
      or burned another may he employed. Coiled springs 132 extend
      between shoulders on the binding posts 127 and the brush holders
      130 and adjusting nuts 133 threaded upon the outer ends of the
      binding posts engage the outer faces of the brush holders 130 and
      serve to accurately adjust the same in desired position.<br>
      <br>
      In operation the contact disk 129 is driven by a spring actuated
      clock train 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e and 134f. A suitable
      escapement mechanism 135a, 135b and 135c is employed to maintain
      the speed of the rotating disk uniform. Any suitable form of motor
      and any suitable form of escapement mechanism may be employed in
      connection with the rotating contact disk 129. That illustrated is
      an ordinary form of clock 80 train and need not be more fully
      described. A spring-held plunger 136 extends through the casing of
      the intensifier adjacent the escapement mechanism so that the
      rotation of the contact disk may be started and stopped 85 as
      desired.<br>
      <br>
      The employment of the rotatable contact intensifier in the coherer
      circuit materially increases the sensitiveness of the latter and
      renders the transmission of the signals accurate and certain.<br>
      <br>
      In order to properly adjust the detectors or receiving instruments
      at various stations the intensifiers at such stations are set to
      rotate at different speeds and a condenser 95 137 (see Fig. 11) or
      other suitable capacity which may be varied, is connected to the
      coherer circuit and the opposite side of the condenser or capacity
      may be, if desired, connected to ground. The ground connection
      however has not been found necessary over short distances. This
      form of receiver having the peculiar intensifier, as described is
      specially and peculiarly applicable for use in connection with an
      influence machine transmitter. It has been found in practice that
      by changing the length and thickness of the sparks generated by
      the static machine transmitter, by varying the speed of the
      intensifying disk at different stations and by 110 properly
      arranging the capacity areas at the transmission station and at
      the different receiving stations, the selective transmission of
      signals may be accurately effected. By running the disk of the
      intensifier at high 115 speed and using a small capacity area, the
      receiver will respond only to heavy discharges of the influence
      machine transmitter and by running the disk at low speed and
      increasing the capacity area the receiver 120 will respond only to
      light sparks sent out by the transmitter.<br>
      <br>
      It is obvious that numerous changes may be made in the details of
      structure and arrangement of parts without departure from 125 the
      essentials of the invention.<br>
