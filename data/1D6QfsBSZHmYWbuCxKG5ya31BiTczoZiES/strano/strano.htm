      </b><b>Why It Matters</b><br>
      <br>
      Most generators waste large amounts of energy.<br>
      <br>
      About four years ago, researchers in Michael Strano’s chemical
      engineering lab at MIT coated a short piece of yarn made of carbon
      nanotubes with TNT and lit one end with a laser. It sparkled and
      burned like a fuse, demonstrating a new way to generate
      electricity that produces phenomenal amounts of power.<br>
      <br>
      At the time, no one understood how it worked, and it was so
      inefficient that it was little more than a “laboratory curiosity,”
      Strano says.<br>
      <br>
      Now, Strano has figured out the underlying physics, which has
      helped his team improve efficiencies dramatically — by 10,000
      times — and charted a path for continued rapid improvements. One
      day, generators that use the phenomenon could make portable
      electronics last longer, and make electric cars as convenient as
      conventional ones, both extending their range and allowing fast
      refueling in minutes.<br>
      <br>
      The efficiencies of the lab devices made so far are still low
      compared to conventional generators. Strano’s latest device is a
      little over 0.1 percent efficiency, whereas conventional
      generators are 25 to 60 percent efficient.<br>
      <br>
      But Strano says they could be useful in some niche applications,
      where a sudden burst of power is needed. And Strano says that the
      further improvements in efficiency mean broader applications could
      soon be feasible.<br>
      <br>
      The new generators exploit a phenomenon that Strano calls a
      thermopower wave. The conventional way to generate electricity by
      burning a fuel is to use heat to cause expanding gases to drive a
      turbine or a piston. In Strano’s system, as the fuel burns along
      the length of his nanotubes, the wave of combustion drives
      electrons ahead of it, creating an electrical current. It’s a much
      more direct and efficient way to generate electricity, since no
      turbines or conventional generators are required.<br>
      <br>
      Since the nanogenerator runs on liquid fuels—which store far more
      energy than batteries—there’s hope that they could allow electric
      cars to go much farther than they do now.<br>
      <br>
      It’s a setup not unlike the one in an internal combustion engine,
      in which bursts of fuel are sprayed into combustion chambers to
      drive pistons. Power electronic circuits could take the bursts of
      power from several nanotube generators and smooth it out, using it
      to drive electric motors in a car, for example. The fuel tank
      could be refilled like one in a conventional car. And because the
      carbon nanotubes aren’t consumed in the process, they can be used
      over and over again.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, Strano discovered that switching from nanotubes to flat
      sheets of nanomaterials—such as single-atom-thick
      graphene—improves efficiency. Shaping the sheets to direct the
      energy of the thermopower wave also boosts performance.<br>

      In one aspect, the present invention provides nanosized systems
      for generating electrical energy based on the use of a chemically
      reactive composition to generate a thermoelectric wave. For
      example, the system can include at least one nanostructure (e.g.,
      a carbon nanotube) extending along an axial direction between a
      proximal end and a distal end. A chemically reactive composition
      is dispersed along at least a portion of the nanostructure, e.g.,
      along its axial direction, so as to provide thermal coupling with
      the nanostructure. The chemical composition can undergo an
      exothermic chemical reaction to generate heat. The system can
      further include an ignition mechanism adapted to activate the
      chemical composition so as to generate a thermal wave that
      propagates along the axial direction of the nanostructure, where
      the thermal wave is accompanied by an electrical energy wave
      propagating along the axial direction.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      [0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of co-pending
      International Application No. PCT/US10/53798, entitled "Nanoscale
      Thermoelectric Wave Generators" and filed Oct. 22, 2010, which
      International Application designates the United States and which
      claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/253,905,
      entitled "Nanoscale Thermoelectric Wave Generators" and filed on
      Oct. 22, 2009. These applications are hereby incorporated by
      reference in their entireties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates generally to systems and
      methods for generating electrical and/or pressure pulses, and more
      particularly, to such systems and methods that generate electrical
      and pressure pulses by utilizing thermal waves propagating along
      nanostructures, such as carbon nanotubes.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Portable energy storage and delivery is a key requirement
      of modern transportation systems and facilitates the proliferation
      of portable electronic devices. This rapidly growing field already
      represents a multi-billion dollar per year market across the
      globe. The miniaturization of electronic devices, network nodes
      for communications, and remote sensors is driven in part by the
      favorable scaling of energy requirements for many applications.
      That is, the reduced energy demand can offset the reduced energy
      storage capacity. Some critical applications, however, do not
      scale favorably with reductions in size. For example, radio
      frequency (RF) communication over a practical distance imposes a
      fixed power demand. In addition, development of the next
      generation of autonomous and mobile sensors, robots, and off-grid
      wireless networks, particularly devices at the micro- and
      nano-scale, is often hampered by the lack of high power density
      energy systems of similar size.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Conventional approaches for solving these problems have
      significant disadvantages. For example, harvesting ambient
      thermal, solar, or acoustic/mechanical energy is appealing because
      of the small sizes of such devices and their ability to work with
      otherwise wasted energy. However, the power generated tends to be
      too small for applications such as long-distance communication
      (where the coverage radius scales with the square root of power)
      or acceleration. Harvesters can collect energy slowly over time
      and subsequently discharge it rapidly, but this requires
      additional energy storage systems that impose limits on the
      systems and/or devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Batteries are one of the most familiar forms of energy
      storage for electricity, but electrochemical energy density is
      fundamentally limited compared to storing energy in the chemical
      bonds of fuels. For example, ethanol has a specific energy storage
      of 26.8 MJ/kg, whereas lithium-ion batteries can only store 0.720
      MJ/kg, about 2.7% of the capacity of ethanol. Further, ethanol's
      energy density is about 20 times larger in volume terms (i.e.,
      energy per unit volume). Batteries also rely on internal mass
      transport to develop charge and therefore require large electrode
      surface areas. This means that even small batteries are formed as
      thin films, which are not ideal for compact devices. Still
      further, batteries slowly lose their charge over years, making
      them less ideal for long-term energy storage. For example,
      batteries with a two-year half-life will lose 31% of their charge
      in one year. Supercapacitors can exhibit substantially higher
      power densities (in weight and volume terms), but at the expense
      of energy density. Moreover, supercapacitors cannot hold their
      charge as long as batteries.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Fuel cells and engines utilize the large energy density of
      chemical fuels, but are more complicated to fabricate at small
      scale. However, their power density has been limited so far.
      Accordingly, there is a need for improved systems, devices and
      methods for generating electrical energy, and particularly for
      generating electrical pulses having high peak powers for use in
      miniaturized devices.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0007] The present invention generally provides systems, devices
      and methods that utilize thermopower waves to overcome the
      problems of traditional batteries and fuel cells. These systems
      allow for the rapid release of energy from stable storage in
      chemical fuels. In various embodiments of the systems and devices
      described herein, high-conductivity scaffolds, such as carbon
      nanotubes (CNTs), direct a hot chemical reaction wave along their
      length. Without being limited to any particular theory, the
      thermal wave also pushes charge carriers to create a high-power
      pulse of electricity. Thermopower wave devices can provide
      superior performance over conventional thermoelectric materials
      (e.g., Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3) that utilize static thermal gradients, both
      in terms of power density and efficiency (e.g., devices described
      herein can have a power density up to 20 W/2, about ten times
      larger than lithium-ion batteries). Further, the materials and
      architectures described herein can be scaled to sizes less than
      about 1 mm&lt;3 &gt;(millimeter cubed), making them suitable for
      use with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and other micro and
      nano-scale devices, among others.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] in one aspect, the present invention provides nanosized
      systems for generating electrical energy based on the use of a
      chemically reactive composition to generate thermoelectric wave.
      For example, the system can include at least one nanostructure
      extending along an axial direction between a proximal end and a
      distal end. The nanostructure can exhibit a thermal conductivity
      equal to or greater than about 500 W/m/K and an electrical
      conductivity equal to or greater than about 10&lt;5
      &gt;siemens/meter (S/m) along the axial direction. A chemically
      reactive composition is dispersed along at least a portion of the
      nanostructure, e.g., along its axial direction, so as to provide
      thermal coupling with the nanostructure (that is, there is a
      thermal path, e.g., via contact or otherwise, between the chemical
      composition and the nanostructure). The chemical composition can
      undergo an exothermic chemical reaction to generate heat. The
      system can further include an ignition mechanism adapted to
      activate the chemical composition so as to generate a thermal wave
      that propagates along the axial direction of the nanostructure,
      where the thermal wave is accompanied by an electrical energy wave
      propagating along the axial direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] A variety of chemically reactive compositions (compounds)
      can be utilized in the above system. In some cases, the chemical
      composition undergoes a decomposition reaction in response to
      activation so as to generate heat. In some embodiments, the
      chemical composition can be a solid fuel, a liquid fuel, or a
      combination thereof. By way of example, the chemical composition
      can be cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (TNA), picric acid,
      picramide, nitrocellulose, trinitrotoluene, JP-8 jet fuel,
      gasoline, ethanol, isopropanol, or formic acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In some implementations, the ignition mechanism is adapted
      to activate the reactive composition in proximity of a proximal
      end of the nanostructure(s) to undergo a chemical reaction to
      generate a thermal wave. As the thermal wave propagates axially
      along the nanostructure it causes the activation of the other
      portions of the chemical composition, which in turn generates
      thermal energy that sustains the thermal wave, and a concomitant
      electrical energy wave, propagating along the nanostructure
      towards its distal end.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In some cases, the generated electrical energy wave (pulse)
      can exhibit a peak power as large as about 20 W/g or greater.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The ignition mechanism can be implemented in a variety of
      different ways. For example, the ignition mechanism can include a
      laser source, e.g., a laser diode that can generate 400 mW at a
      wavelength of 785 nm. Alternatively, the ignition mechanism can
      generate a high voltage electrical discharge spark, e.g., 3 kV DC
      and 5 milliamps, for activating the chemical composition. As
      another alternative, the ignition mechanism can locally heat the
      source, e.g., with a wire used as an electrical resistance heater
      operating at about 1-3 V DC and about 1.5 amps (the voltage and
      current depend on the resistance of the wire). As another
      alternative, the ignition mechanism can also include a small flame
      source, such as a torch or burner.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In one embodiment, the system can include an elongated
      nanostructure such as a carbon nanotube. In some cases,
      multi-walled or single-walled carbon nanotube(s) can be employed
      as the elongated nanostructure. These carbon nanotubes can be
      employed, for example, in the form of a bundle, aligned array,
      mat, fiber, or yarn. In other implementations, the elongated
      nanostructure can be a nanowire formed, for example, of silicon,
      boron nitride, nickel silicide, or lead sulfide.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In another embodiment, the system can include a sheet of a
      material, such as graphene, characterized by two opposed surfaces
      separated by a thickness of the material forming the sheet (e.g.,
      a thickness less than about 25 nm), where the sheet extends along
      a longitudinal direction from a proximal end to a distal end. In
      some implementations, the sheet can exhibit a thermal conductivity
      equal to or greater than about 2000 W/m/K and an electrical
      conductivity equal or greater than about 10&lt;7 &gt;S/m at least
      along the longitudinal direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] A chemically reactive composition is disposed on at least a
      portion of at least one of said surfaces (e.g., it coats the
      surface) so as to be in thermal coupling with at least that
      surface. The reactive composition is capable of undergoing a
      chemical reaction in response to activation to generate heat. The
      system can further include an ignition mechanism adapted to
      activate the chemical composition so as to generate a thermal wave
      propagating longitudinally along the sheet, where the thermal wave
      is accompanied by a co-propagating wave of electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In certain embodiments, the system can include a catalyst
      to lower the activation energy required from the ignition
      mechanism to ignite the chemically reactive composition. For
      example, in some embodiments, the system can include a
      nanostructure having metal nanoparticles disposed thereon in
      combination with a liquid chemically reactive composition. The
      nanoparticles can aid the reaction of the liquid fuel to create
      thermopower waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In another aspect, the present invention provides a method
      of generating electrical energy, which comprises providing a
      nanostructure (e.g., a carbon nanotube or a sheet having a
      nanosized thickness) extending along an axial direction with a
      chemically reactive compound disposed (e.g., dispersed) on at
      least a portion thereof (e.g., in the form of a coating), where
      the compound is in thermal contact with the nanostructure. The
      nanostructure can exhibit a thermal conductivity equal to or
      greater than about 500 W/m/K and an electrical conductivity equal
      to or greater than about 10&lt;5 &gt;S/m along the axial
      direction. A chemical reaction can be initiated in a portion of
      the chemically reactive compound at a location along the axial
      direction so as to generate a thermal wave propagating along the
      nanostructure to cause a chemical reaction in other portions of
      the reactive compound, thereby generating and sustaining a thermal
      wave propagating along the axial direction. The thermal wave is
      accompanied by an electrical pulse propagating along the axial
      direction.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0049] In some aspects, the present invention provides systems and
      methods for converting chemical energy into electrical and/or
      mechanical energy propagating along nanoscale conduits, such as
      nanotubes or nanowires. By way of example, in some cases, a
      nanostructure can be coated, at least partially, with a chemically
      reactive compound that can be activated at a location along the
      nanostructure to undergo a chemical reaction, e.g., an exothermic
      reaction, that generates thermal energy. The nanostructure can
      provide a conduit for anisotropic propagation of this thermal
      energy that can in turn initiate an exothermic reaction in other
      portions of the coating so as to sustain a thermal wave moving
      along the nanostructure conduit. The thermal wave is accompanied
      by a pulse of electrical energy that propagates along the conduit
      as well. The term "nanostructure," as used herein, refers to a
      material structure having a size less than about 1 micrometer, in
      at least one dimension (e.g., in one of x, y, or z dimensions).
      Similarly, the term "nanosized" is used herein to indicate a size
      in at least one dimension that is about 1 micrometer, and in some
      cases less than about 500 nanometers (am), or less than about 200
      nm or less than about 100 nm. In many embodiments, the
      nanostructure can have an aspect ratio (ratio of length to
      cross-sectional diameter) that is greater than about 1,000,000. In
      the embodiments discussed below, various salient features of
      invention are discussed in connection with carbon nanotubes. It
      should, however, be understood that the teachings of the invention
      can also be practiced by employing other types of nanostructures,
      such as nanowires. The term "carbon nanotube(s)" is known in the
      art and generally refers to allotropes of carbon exhibiting a
      nanostructure with a length-to-diameter ratio greater than about
      1,000 e.g., in some cases up to about 28,000,000.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] FIG. 1 schematically depicts a system 10 according to an
      embodiment of the invention for generating an electrical pulse,
      which includes a multi-walled carbon nanotube 12 (MWNT) that
      extends along an axial direction (A) between a proximal end 14 and
      a distal end 16. In this implementation, the number of walls of
      the multi-walled carbon nanotube ranges from two to about 10,
      though in other implementations multi-walled carbon nanotubes with
      a different number of walls can be employed. The exemplary carbon
      nanotube 12 exhibits a thermal conductivity equal or greater than
      about 500 W/m/K and an electrical conductivity equal or greater
      than about 10&lt;5 &gt;S/m along the axial direction (A). By way
      of example, the carbon nanotube can exhibit such a high thermal
      conductivity at a temperature equal or greater than about 2000 K.
      In this exemplary implementation, the ratio of the diameter (D) of
      the carbon nanotube 12 to its length (L), which is herein referred
      to as the aspect ratio of the nanotube, is less than about
      70,000,000, e.g., in a range of about 100,000 to about 50,000,000.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] A shell 18 formed of a chemically reactive compound
      peripherally surrounds the carbon nanotube 10 along the axial
      direction to form an annular coating around the nanotube. By way
      of example, the shell can have a thickness in a range of about 4
      to about 20 nanometers. While in this implementation the shell
      extends axially from the proximal end 14 to the distal end 16 to
      coat the entire axial extent of the carbon nanotube, in other
      implementations it can extend axially along only a portion of the
      carbon nanotube. The chemically reactive compound forming the
      shell is in thermal coupling with the carbon nanotube 12, e.g.,
      via contact with an outer surface of the carbon nanotube in this
      implementation. The chemically reactive compound can be activated
      to undergo an exothermic chemical reaction, e.g., a decomposition
      reaction, to generate heat. By way of example, the chemically
      reactive compound can exhibit a thermal conductivity less than
      about 5 W/m/K.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] With reference to FIGS. 2A-2C, in this implementation, the
      shell 18 is formed of cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (TNA) and has
      a thickness in a range of about 6 nm to about 9 nm (e.g., about 7
      nm). The TNA can be activated (ignited) to undergo is
      decomposition reaction that generates heat together with rapidly
      expanding gaseous decomposition products.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] More specifically, referring again to FIG. 1, the exemplary
      system 10 includes an ignition mechanism 20 that can activate the
      reactive compound (e.g., TNA in this implementation) at a selected
      location along the nanotube, e.g., close to the proximal end in
      this implementation, to cause its decomposition. In this
      implementation, the ignition mechanism includes a laser light
      source that generates radiation capable of igniting the TNA. By
      way of example, the ignition mechanism can include a laser diode
      that can generate 400 mW of radiation at a wavelength of 785 nm.
      In some implementations, a single pulse of such a laser directed,
      e.g., via focusing, to a location along the TNA coating can ignite
      the INA at that location. As discussed in detail below, such
      initial ignition can result in an axially propagating chain
      reaction along the TNA annular coating to ignite the other
      portions of the TNA.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Alternatively, the ignition mechanism can include a
      mechanism for generating a high voltage electrical discharge. For
      example, FIG. 3 schematically depicts such a mechanism 22 that
      includes a wire 24 formed, e.g., of tungsten, that is suspended
      over a conductive plate 26, e.g., formed of tungsten, with a gap
      between the wire's tip and the tungsten plate. A high voltage
      power supply 28 can apply a high voltage, e.g., up to about 3 kV,
      across the wire tip and the plate to initiate a discharge within
      the gap. As shown schematically in FIG. 3, the coated nanotube (in
      this case TNA coated multi-walled carbon nanotube) can be attached
      to the wire's tip at a selected location to be suspended over the
      plate 26. The power supply can apply a high voltage to the wire to
      cause an electrical discharge between the coated nanotube and the
      tungsten plate. The electrical discharge can in turn initiate the
      chemical reaction in the reactive coating, e.g., a decomposition
      reaction in the TNA coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] With reference to FIG. 4, in some implementations, a heater
      32 operating under the control of a temperature controller 34 can
      be utilized to preheat the coated nanotube, e.g., up to a
      temperature of about 423 K, prior to initiating an exothermic
      chemical reaction in the reactive coating. Alternatively, the
      chemical reaction can be initiated without preheating the carbon
      nanotube, e.g., it can be initiated at a temperature of about 300
      K.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Referring again to FIG. 1, in use, the initiation of a
      chemical reaction in the coating, e.g., in the vicinity of the
      proximal end 14 in this exemplary implementation, can generate
      heat that will propagate as a thermal wave axially along the
      carbon nanotube. The heat wave in turn causes the initiation of
      the chemical reaction in other portions of the chemical coating (a
      chain reaction), to sustain a reaction wave and an associated heat
      wave. As each portion of the chemical coating undergoes the
      chemical reaction it generates heat, which sustains the heat wave
      as it propagates from the proximal end to the distal end. In some
      cases, such a sustained reaction wave can move axially along the
      nanotube at a velocity that can be more than two orders of
      magnitude greater than the bulk combustion rate of the reactive
      material forming the coating. For example, a steadily propagating
      wave with a velocity of 1.2+/-0.4 m/sec was observed in a
      prototype multi-walled carbon nanotube that was coated with a TNA
      with a thickness of about 7 nm. The speed of a reaction wave in
      bulk TNA alone is between 0.2 and 0.5 mm/sec.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Applicants have discovered that this directional thermal
      wave evolves a corresponding electrical energy wave (herein
      referred to as a "thermopower wave") along the same direction as
      the thermal wave, e.g., in the form of a high specific power
      electrical pulse of constant polarity. With reference to FIG. 5,
      such an electrical pulse can be observed, e.g., by electrically
      contacting an oscilloscope 36 across a carbon nanotube coated with
      a chemically reactive material (or an array of carbon nanotubes
      coated with a chemically reactive material as discussed below).<br>
      <br>
      [0058] By way of example, as shown schematically in FIG. 6, the
      laser initiation of the exothermic reaction at one end of an array
      of coated carbon nanotubes can result in a voltage peak of the
      same duration as the reactive wave. The voltage wave is positive
      thr waves emanating from the positive electrode, indicating that
      the wave is generated by a pulse of majority electronic carriers
      traveling toward the negative electrode. This thermopower wave is
      distinct from conventional, static thermopower because of its
      anisotropic propagation. If a temperature pulse were travelling
      across the medium generating thermopower, the voltage pulse would
      change sign, showing an inflection midway and would integrate to
      zero over the nanotubes length. Further, in such a case, if the
      reaction were initiated at the middle of the nanotube, the current
      would reverse. In contrast, the chemically driven thermopower
      waves generated according to the teachings of the invention
      exhibit constant polarity in the direction of the reaction.
      Without being limited to any particular theory, these observations
      indicate that in the systems according to the teachings of the
      invention, the majority electrical carriers (e.g., electrons) are
      entrained in the thermal wave, thereby producing a high electrical
      power pulse. The electrical pulse can exhibit, for example, a
      specific power as large as 20 W/g.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Carbon nanotubes have a relatively low Seebeck coefficient
      (e.g., about 80 [mu]V/K) compared with many conventional
      thermoelectric materials such as bismuth telluride (exhibiting a
      Seebeck coefficient of about 287 [mu]V/K) or Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3
      superlattices (Seebeck coefficient of about 244 [mu]V/K), although
      modest increases are observed over the temperature range between
      about 300 K and about 930 K. Thermopower waves generated according
      to the teachings of the invention, however, do not necessarily
      require low phonon and high electron transport rates as the
      thermal gradient is preserved in the propagation of the wave
      front.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In some implementations, rather that utilizing a single
      nanotube that is at least partially coated with a chemically
      reactive material, an array of nanostructures, e.g., an array of
      aligned carbon nanotubes, coated with a chemically reactive
      material can be employed. By way of example, FIG. 7 schematically
      depicts an exemplary implementation of such a system 38 that
      includes an array 40 of carbon nanotubes 42 (e.g., multi-walled
      carbon nanotubes) that are substantially aligned along an axial
      direction (AD). A large fraction of the individual nanotubes, and
      preferably all of the nanotubes of the array, are at least
      partially coated with a chemically reactive compound 44, such as
      TNA discussed above, to form, e.g., a reactive shell that extends
      axially along the nanotubes. By way of example, in some cases,
      more than about 70%, or more than about 80%, or more than about
      90%, and preferably 100%, of the individual nanotube strands of
      the array are at least partially coated with the chemically
      reactive material. In some implementations, the coating extends
      along the entire length of many, and preferably all, of the
      individual strands. The number of the carbon nanotubes in the
      array can vary from one implementation to another. By way of
      example, the number of the carbon nanotubes in the array can range
      from about 50,000 to about 50,000,000.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Similar to the previous embodiment, an ignition mechanism
      46, e.g., a pulsed laser source, can initiate an exothermic
      chemical reaction in the chemically reactive shells surrounding
      the nanotubes, e.g., at a proximal end (P) of the nanotubes. The
      heat generated by the chemical reaction, e.g., a decomposition
      reaction of the chemically reactive material, can give rise to a
      thermal wave and a concomitant electrical pulse propagating along
      the array of carbon nanotubes.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The electrical pulse can exhibit a high specific power,
      e.g., about 2.0 W/g or higher. As discussed in more detail below,
      the high specific power can exhibit an inverse scaling
      relationship relative to the mass of the array of the coated
      carbon nanotubes. In other words, the specific power can increase
      as the mass of the array of the coated carbon nanotube decreases,
      e.g., over a mass range of about 10&lt;-2 &gt;mg to about 10 mg.
      This unusual scaling trend can be favorable for powering micro and
      nano-scaled devices. Without being limited by any particular
      theory, the reduction of the specific power as the mass of the
      array increases can be due to increase in orthogonal heat transfer
      in the array, which can degraded the axial heat transfer.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Without being limited to any particular theory, the theory
      of conventional combustion waves can be adapted to describe the
      nanotube coupled thermal wave. Consider a first order reactive
      annulus at dimensionless temperature u surrounding a nanotube or
      nanowire at temperature u2 where both are thermally coupled via a
      dimensionless interfacial conductance, [gamma]. The Fourier
      description of this system is:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where [eta] is the extent of chemical conversion of the
      reactive annulus, [alpha]0 is the dimensionless thermal
      diffusivity of the nanotube (normalized by that of the annulus),
      [beta] is the dimensionless inverse adiabatic temperature of the
      reactive annulus, [tau] and [xi] are dimensionless time and
      distance. (Here, [gamma] and [gamma]2 are [gamma] scaled by
      material properties of the annulus and nanotube, respectively.) A
      system initially at room temperature (u=0.0124 for TNA) will
      produce a reactive wave solution if one end is heated to ignition.
      Numerical solution of (1-3) demonstrates that, since the thermal
      conductance in the nanotube exceeds that of the reactive annulus,
      the reaction velocity along the nanotube component is increased
      substantially, directing the energy along its length. The
      non-linear nature of the source term causes the reaction velocity
      to increase disproportionately with an increase in nanotube
      thermal diffusivity above that of the reactive annulus, creating
      an amplified thermal wave. The numerical solution can be used in
      conjunction with the measured reaction velocities to estimate the
      effective thermal conductance of the MWNT (multi-walled nanotube).<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The systems according to the teachings of the invention can
      have a variety of applications. By way of example, the above
      systems 10 and 38 can be employed as power sources in a variety of
      devices, especially in miniaturized electronic devices. For
      example, the system 38 can be utilized to provide high peak power
      density for intermittent but high load operations, such as
      emission of modulated radio frequency (RF) signals. By way of
      example, FIG. 8 schematically depicts an electronic device 48 in
      which the above system 38 is incorporated as a power source to
      supply intermittent electrical pulses to radio frequency (RF)
      transmitter 50. The RF transmitter 50 converts the received
      electrical energy to RF energy (e.g., in the form of RF pulses),
      which is transmitted to a receiver 52.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The teachings of the invention can be applied to create
      energy storage devices having a variety of sizes. For example,
      thermopower wave generators can be scaled up using nanotube
      microstructures, such as nanotube yarns, which can be spun to
      meters in length. Furthermore, thermopower fuel cells can be
      operated to generate power continuously, and can utilize renewable
      fuel sources such as formic acid, methanol, etc. An exemplary
      closed-cycle, low-carbon fuel cell system is illustrated in FIG.
      10, which is discussed in more detail below.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The teachings of the invention can be implemented in a
      variety of ways, and are not limited to the above embodiments. By
      way of example, FIG. 9 schematically depicts a system 54 according
      to another embodiment of the invention for generating pulsed
      electrical energy that includes an array 56 of aligned
      multi-walled carbon nanotubes 58 extending from a proximal end 60
      to a distal end 62 along an axial direction. Rather than coating
      individual carbon nanotubes of the array with a chemically
      reactive material, in this embodiment, a coating of a chemically
      reactive material is applied to an outer surface of the array with
      the inner carbon nanotubes remaining substantially, or entirely,
      uncoated. Similar to the previous embodiment, an ignition
      mechanism 64, e.g., a pulsed laser source, can initiate a chemical
      reaction in the reactive coating, e.g., at the proximal end, which
      results in a propagating thermal wave and a concomitant electrical
      pulse traveling along the nanotubes in the axial direction, in a
      manner discussed above.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In some embodiments of the invention, the ignition
      mechanism and the reactive coating are configured such that
      initiating a chemical reaction at a location along the coating
      results in generating a pulse without completely depleting the
      reactive coating. The remainder of the coating can then be
      utilized to generate one or more additional pulses. Alternatively,
      a mechanism for replenishing the coating, e.g. in situ, can be
      employed to allow utilizing the same carbon nanotube (or an array
      of nanotubes) multiple times for generating electrical pulses.
      Indeed, Example 4 below demonstrates that CNTs can survive a pulse
      generation reaction with no detectable damage. This performance
      characteristic can allow a thermopower wave generator to be
      continually replenished and reused over time.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] By way of example, FIG. 10 schematically depicts such a
      system 66 that includes an array 68 of multi-walled carbon
      nanotubes 70 extending axially between two electrodes 72 and 74.
      The carbon nanotubes are circumferentially coated with a
      hydrocarbon fuel, such as ethanol, isopropanol, formic acid,
      benzene, gasoline, or JP-8 jet fuel, which can undergo an
      exothermic reaction in response to activation. An ignition
      mechanism (not shown) can initiate a chemical reaction in the
      coating, e.g., at the end in proximity of the electrode 72, in a
      manner discussed above to generate a thermal wave and a
      concomitant electrical pulse propagating along the carbon
      nanotube. By way of example, the ignition mechanism can include a
      pulsed laser that applies a pulse of radiation to the reactive
      material to initiate a chemical reaction therein. In this
      implementation, the system can include a fuel reservoir 76 that
      can replenish the consumed coating to allow generating additional
      electrical pulses via subsequent activation of the coating. By the
      way of example, the fuel from the reservoir can be sprayed onto
      the carbon nanotubes via a spray mechanism 78 to replenish the
      coating, thereby allowing the generation of the subsequent
      electrical pulses.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In some implementations, the coating of the chemically
      reactive material is not completely consumed via generation of the
      first pulse, thus allowing the remainder of the coating to be
      utilized for generating the subsequent pulses. By way of example,
      the energy of the first laser pulse as well as the type and the
      thickness of the coating can be configured such that the initiated
      chemical reaction consumes only a portion of the reactive coating.
      Subsequently, a second laser pulse can initiate the chemical
      reaction in the remainder of the coating. This process can be
      repeated until the entire coating of the chemically reactive
      material is consumed. Alternatively, the system can also include a
      replenishment mechanism, such as sprayer 78, to reapply a fuel or
      other reactive composition to the nanotube(s) following the
      generation of a pulse. For example, in some embodiments, the
      system can include a syringe filled with a fuel solution, such as
      formic acid, and a syringe pump configured to apply the solution
      to the tubes.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The chemical reaction initiated in the chemically reactive
      compound can also generate a pressure wave of high energy density.
      By way of example, the rapidly expanding, gaseous decomposition
      products from the thermal wave can create a strong pressure pulse
      that is highly anisotropic. In other words, the pressure pulse
      provides a thrust along the axial direction of the carbon
      nanotube(s). Such an anisotropic pressure wave can be utilized in
      a variety of systems, such as microthrusters, microactuators,
      chemical synthesis for micro-nano size, micropyro valve or
      explosive bolts or other connectors.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] By way of example, with reference to FIGS. 11A and 11B, a
      plurality of multi-walled carbon nanotubes can be coated with a
      chemically reactive compound, e.g., in a manner discussed above.
      The initiation of a reaction in the compound at one end of the
      carbon nanotubes can initiate an exothermic chain reaction in the
      coating of each coated carbon nanotube, which in turn results in a
      reaction wave propagating along the nanotube, as shown
      schematically in FIG. 11B. The rapidly expanding gas generated as
      a result of the exothermic reaction generates a pressure wave that
      propels that carbon nanotube along a direction opposite to the
      direction of the propagating reaction. As discussed above, this
      propulsion force can be utilized in a variety of systems, such as
      microthrusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In some embodiments, a thermopower wave generator according
      to the teachings of the present invention can employ a catalyst to
      aid in the reaction of a fuel, such as a liquid fuel, and the
      creation of thermopower waves. The catalyst can have a variety of
      forms, but in some embodiments can be metal nanoparticles added to
      the CNT thermoelectric conduits. In some embodiments, the metal
      nanoparticles or other catalyst(s) can lower the activation energy
      of the reactive composition or fuel, thereby lowering the energy
      required for igniting the fuel. For example, Applicants have
      demonstrated that the addition of a catalyst, such as Au metal
      nanoparticles, to a liquid fuel, such as formic acid, ethanol,
      hexane, and toluene, can greatly facilitate ignition of the fuel
      to generate a self-propagating thermopower wave. In some cases,
      the ignition of such fuels in the absence of the catalyst(s) may
      render generation of a self-propagating thermopower wave
      impractical (e.g., due to the high activation energies required
      for ignition). This discovery can allow thermopower wave
      generators to be used as an entirely new type of fuel cell with
      traditional liquid fuel sources, e.g., gasoline, while providing
      some of the highest energy and power densities attainable. In some
      embodiments, the energy density can be above 40 W/g and the power
      density can be above 2.2 MJ/kg.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] A number of materials can be employed as catalysts. For
      example, Applicants have demonstrated successful thermopower wave
      generation using formic acid and methanol as a reactive
      composition in combination with Au nanoparticles as catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Nanoparticles of noble metals such as Au, Ag, Pt, or Pd can
      be grown on CNTs by electrodeposition or synthesized separately in
      solution and subsequently deposited on a nanotube, as described in
      Example 5 below.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Catalyst(s) can be chosen to optimize the activation
      energy; too low and the fuel will react spontaneously without
      being controlled by the nanotubes, too high and the required
      initiation energy will be too large, sapping the efficiency.
      Additionally, although metals like Pt, Ru, and Pd are the most
      active, they are also quite rare and therefore expensive. Thus,
      for liquid-fueled-generators to be practical, the use of more
      common metals like Au, Fe, or Cu can be preferable so long as
      their activity is sufficient. These methods favor the formation of
      formate species on the catalyst surface, generally the
      rate-limiting step of the fuel decomposition, thereby lowering
      ignition energy and accelerating reaction to promote thermopower
      waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] In some embodiments, the activation energy of a fuel can be
      determined not only by the composition of catalyst nanoparticles,
      but also by their form and their amount relative to the mass of
      CNTs and of the fuel. Some suitable exemplary shapes of the
      nanoparticle crystalline structure include tetrahedral, spheres,
      cubes and octahedral shapes. The amount of catalyst could be a
      limiting factor if fuel molecules must diffuse too far to reach a
      catalyst particle. Finally, different catalysts could be
      deposited, together or subsequently, to obtain mixtures with
      precisely tuned average properties. In some embodiments, the
      catalyst mass can be, e.g., about 1% to about 20% of the mass of
      carbon nanotubes.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Although the above exemplary embodiments are implemented by
      employing carbon nanotubes coated with a chemically reactive
      compound, in other embodiments a sheet of a material exhibiting
      the requisite thermal and electrical conductivities can be coated
      with a reactive compound to convert the chemical energy stored in
      the coating into one or more electrical pulses. By way of example,
      with reference to FIGS. 12A, 12B, and 12C, such a system 78 can
      include a sheet of graphene 80 that is coated with fuel layer 82
      formed of a chemically reactive material, such as TNA. The coated
      sheet extends longitudinally between two electrodes 84 and 86. The
      sheet can have a thickness in a range of, e.g., about 0.5 nm to
      about 25 nm. The lateral dimensions of the sheet can be selected
      for a specific application. By way of example, the sheet can have
      a length in a range of about 10 nm to about 1 cm and a width in a
      range of about 10 nm to about 1 cm. An ignition mechanism 86,
      e.g., a pulsed laser in this implementation, can initiate a
      chemical reaction in the coating at one end of the sheet in
      proximity of one of the electrodes, which results in generation of
      a thermal wave and a concomitant electrical pulse propagating
      along the length of the sheet to other electrode. Although in this
      implementation a graphene sheet is utilized, more generally, a
      sheet of a material exhibiting a thermal conductivity equal to or
      greater than about 1000 W/m/K and an electrical conductivity equal
      to or greater than about 10&lt;7 &gt;S/m in the plane of the
      sheet, or at least along one dimension of the plane (e.g., the
      longitudinal direction in this case), can be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Systems and devices according to the teachings of the
      present invention can have unique voltage-generating capabilities
      not seen in other types of fuel cells or generators. To date, the
      extent to which the electrical properties of thermopower waves can
      be explained conventionally by the thermoelectric Seebeck
      coefficient, [Gamma] (which is generally measured as the ratio of
      voltage generated per steady-state temperature difference), has
      been unclear. One indication that thermopower wave voltage is
      generated by more than the temperature difference between two
      contacts is that the magnitudes of voltage peaks can be quite
      large, e.g., up to 220 mV for cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine on a
      multiwalled carbon nanotube, and up to 150 mV for nitrocellulose
      on Bi2Te3. In addition, for rapid waves initiated at one end of a
      macrostructure collection (i.e. an array, fiber, or yarn) of
      carbon nanotubes, the voltage profile is typically of the form of
      a single-polarity pulse. Furthermore, thermopower waves can
      exhibit voltage oscillations with frequency spectra closely
      matching those of wave velocity oscillations modeled by thermal
      transport equations.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Despite their large electrical conductivities, single
      walled nanotubes (SWNTs) can have useful Seebeck coefficients at
      room temperature (about 40 [mu]V/K). In SWNT macrostructures, the
      larger Seebeck coefficients have been attributed to loose contacts
      between individual nanotubes and bundles, that is, junction
      resistance can play a significant role. In individual SWNTs,
      however, phonon drag effects are important to thermoelectricity
      beyond carrier diffusion processes alone. Quantum-confined
      materials such as nanotubes can enhance phonon drag because the
      motion of phonons and charge carriers is more aligned, so phonon
      momentum can be efficiently transferred to charge carriers.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Other experiments have demonstrated additional unusual
      thermoelectric properties in carbon nanotubes. For example,
      interactions with metal catalyst nanoparticles left over from the
      growth process can contribute to what is known as the Kondo
      effect, which is a large peak in the Seebeck coefficient. However,
      the temperature range of this peak, from about 70 to 100 K, is far
      below the reaction temperatures of thermopower waves (&gt;1000 K).
      Without being limited to any particular theory, the difference
      between the temperature ranges of the Kondo effect and thermopower
      waves indicates that the Kondo effect does not explain the
      behavior observed with thermopower waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] However, thermopower in nanotubes can be environmentally
      sensitive. For example, the sign of the Seebeck coefficient can
      reverse when nanotubes are depressurized or thermally annealed.
      This effect can be attributed to the removal of ambient oxygen,
      which can p-dope the SWNTs. Other adsorbed molecules, particularly
      aromatic hydrocarbons, can shift the Seebeck coefficient of SWNTs
      by as much as $ [mu]V/K with only monolayer coverage. It has been
      theorized that the adsorbates create a new scattering channel for
      carriers. The carriers in SWNTs can couple strongly ton states in
      adsorbed molecules, thereby enhancing their effects. Example 6
      provides a more detailed analysis of the unique electrical
      properties of thermopower waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The following Examples are provided to further illustrate
      the salient features of the invention and are not intended to
      necessarily indicate the optimal ways of practicing the invention
      or optimal results that can be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Synthesis of Vertically Aligned Multi-Walled Carbon
        Nanotubes</b><br>
      <br>
      [0083] Vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (VAMWNT)
      were synthesized, in a horizontal quartz tube furnace with an
      inner diameter of 29 mm, by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
      method. Catalyst layers, 0.5-1 nm Fe and 10 nm Al2O3, were
      deposited on a silicon wafer by electron beam evaporation.
      Ethylene (C2H4) was the carbon source. Hydrogen (H2) and argon
      (Ar) were used as catalytic and carrier gas. The gases were
      preheated by a tungsten filament (12~14 amps) to induce the
      decomposition of the hydrocarbon. The key steps in this
      fabrication process are described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] a. For 28 minutes, the furnace temperature was increased
      from 25 to 750[deg.] C. with Ar gas flow (400 sccm).<br>
      <br>
      [0085] b. Next, the temperature was maintained at 750[deg.] C. for
      10 minutes while H2 (100 seem) and Ar (400 sccm) were injected.
      During this process, the Fe layer changed form to Fe
      nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] e. C2H4 (147 sccm), H2 (100 sccm) and Ar (400 sccm) were
      introduced into the furnace at 750[deg.] C. and 1 atm. Bubbling
      water (50 sccm) was injected for 1 minute every 15 minutes or
      continuously to decrease amorphous carbon production and increase
      the length of MWNT (S1). Scanning Electron Microscopy confirmed
      that the final lengths of MWNT were similar and that pulsed water
      injection resulted in well aligned VAMWNT.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] d. At the end of the CVD process, the Ar flow rate was
      decreased to 50-100 seem in order to weaken bonding between the
      MWNT array and substrate and create a free standing aligned MWNT
      array. The resulting films were 3 to 5 mm tall on a silicon wafer
      approximately 5*5 mm in cross-section. The MWNT were either
      dispersed as individual nanotubes for characterization or kept in
      an array form for further reaction testing. We calculated the
      porosity of the VAMWNT using a previously published protocol. The
      mass and volume of the VAMWNT were measured directly. The
      information about tube diameter and number of walls was obtained
      from TEM images. The 22 nm-MWNT had an average of ten walls, an
      inner radius of 7.6 nm, and an outer radius of 11 nm, giving them
      a cross-sectional area of 197.6 nm&lt;2&gt;. The porosity was
      estimated as 99%. Alternative growth conditions (Furnace tube
      diameter: 29 mm, Fe:0.5 nm, Al2O3:20 nm, C2H4:30 sccm, H2:55 sccm,
      Ar:150 sccm) produced 13 nm-diameter MWNT with an average of nine
      walls. The inner radius was 3.4 nm and outer radius was 6.5 nm.
      The cross-sectional area was 96.4 nm2 and the porosity was 97%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Synthesis and Characterization of TNA-MWNT</b><br>
      <br>
      [0088] TNA was received in a sand mixture. The mixture was washed
      with acetonitrile dissolved TNA. The solution was filtered to
      eliminate impurities, resulting in pure TNA solution. In
      particular, 0.2 grams of TNA was dissolved in 10 mL of
      acetonitrile. The solution was added to VAMWNT. When liquids are
      introduced into sparse VAMWNT and evaporated, the cross-section of
      the VAMWNT significantly shrinks due to the surface tension of the
      liquid and strong van der Waals interactions between nanotubes.
      Thus, TNA was trapped among the MWNT and coated their walls. The
      aligned structure of TNA-MWNT was maintained after wet
      impregnation. The TNA shows up as a bright coating compared to the
      nanotubes, as shown in FIG. 22. 5 [mu]L, of NaN3 in aqueous
      solution with a concentration of 50 mg/mL, was then added to serve
      as a primary igniter, since NaN3 has a much lower activation
      energy (40 kJ/mol) than TNA (140-180 kJ/mol). The VAMWNT were
      dried under atmospheric conditions (300 K, 1 atm) for 24 hours.
      The mass of the array was measured with a microbalance, before and
      after impregnation, to determine the mass ratio of TNA to MWNT.
      The mass ratio can be controlled by the concentration and amount
      of TNA solution added to the VAMWNT.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><br>
      <br>
      [0089] To illustrate the feasibility of generating multiple
      electrical pulses by utilizing the same set of carbon nanotubes, a
      prototype system was fabricated that included a plurality of
      multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) coated with TNA. TNA was
      coated on several separate positions on MWNT discontinuously, and
      each ignition caused the chemical reaction only in a specific
      region of MWNT. After an ignition at one position, TNA coating at
      other positions was not ignited due to the discontinuity in
      coating. Hence, the reaction can be initiated multiple times,
      creating a voltage pulse each time.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] By applying successive pulses from a laser operating at a
      wavelength of 785 nm and a pulse power of 400 mW to the one end of
      the coated carbon nanotubes, a plurality of electrical pulses were
      generated as shown in FIGS. 13A and 13B. More specifically, after
      the first reaction, the carbon nanotube array survived with a
      portion of the fuel coating remaining on the array. By repetitive
      initiation of the chemical reaction in the coating, the remainder
      of the fuel coating was consumed to generate multiple electrical
      pulses. As shown in FIGS. 13A and 13B, both negative and positive
      voltage peaks were generated repeatedly without the change of the
      carbon nanotube array. The system can be modified to allow supply
      of fuel to the carbon nanotubes, e.g., to extend the number of
      electrical pulses that can be generated by utilizing the array.<br>
      <br>
      Example 4<br>
      <br>
      [0091] To illustrate the effect of thermopower wave pulse
      generation on carbon nanotubes, Raman spectroscopy can be
      utilized. Specifically, the vibrational D mode can be measured,
      which is a characteristic of defects in graphene lattice
      structures like CNTs, and can be compared to the vibrational G
      mode, which is a characteristic of in-plane stretching of carbon
      bonds in the lattice (i.e., along the length of a CNT). As shown
      in FIG. 14, the DIG ratio changes very little after one
      thermopower wave, even though CNTs are expected to oxidize at
      least somewhat at the measured reaction temperature of ~800[deg.]
      C. in air. While not being bound to any particular theory, one
      explanation may be that the expanding wave of gases produced by
      the thermopower reaction displaces the air, creating an O2-poor
      local environment. Alternatively, secondary reactions with these
      product gases may rapidly consume O2 in the vicinity of the CNTs.<br>
      <br>
      Example 5<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The electron microscope images in FIG. 15 show Au
      nanoparticles electrodeposited on SWNTs (imaging potential of 200
      kV). Deposition was conducted at 12V for 30 minutes, resulting in
      particles with an average diameter of 13 nm having triangular
      facing. The nanotubes appear as dispersed bundles due to the
      suspension process used to prepare samples for electron
      microscopy. As mentioned above, thermopower wave generators can be
      formed from SWNTs (single-walled nanotubes), MWNTs (multi-walled
      nanotubes), as well as from yarns, fibers, or vertically aligned
      arrays of any of these tubes.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] When the thermopower waves propagate on Au-SWNTs, the gases
      evolved from fuel decomposition push apart the SWNT bundles,
      resulting in expansion of the generator. FIG. 16 shows a series of
      images from a reacting formic acid generator where this expansion
      occurs. The time between each image in the series is I second. By
      rearranging the SWNTs inside the generator and breaking and
      forming junctions, the reaction changes the SWNT fiber's
      electrical conductivity, which can affect the reaction efficiency.
      As shown especially in the bottom series of figures, the generator
      undergoes a physical expansion as the SWNT fibers are pushed
      apart. Appropriate device designs can harness the observed
      expansion force as useful work.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Initial demonstrations using formic acid in combination
      with Au-SWNTs, as shown in FIG. 17A, have measured peak power
      generation of 0.1-0.3 mW, which can be refueled and repeated over
      at least 13 cycles (see FIG. 17B). The wave front velocity, as
      measured by a high-speed camera, along the generator's length
      averages 0.6 mm/s (see FIG. 17C) fairly consistently over the
      cycles (only three cycles-5, 8, and 9-are shown in the graph for
      clarity). The reaction temperature, measured by an optical
      pyrometer, reached 550-650[deg.] C. (see FIG. 17D), which can vary
      between cycles (note that the pyrometer does not measure
      temperatures below 540[deg.] C., so the rises and falls below
      540[deg.] appear much steeper than they actually are). The optical
      measurement method is preferable due to the difficulty of

      wave generator.<br>

      [0095] Silver paste that was applied to form strong, highly
      conductive electrical connections to the copper tape electrodes
      often flows around and among the CNTs before drying (see FIG. 16).
      A digital oscilloscope measured voltage generated during the
      thermopower wave reaction. Current and power can be calculated
      based on the known resistances of the thermopower wave generator
      and the oscilloscope circuit load. Thermopower waves can be
      initiated with a precisely focused laser (300 mW, 785 nm emission)
      or a fine-tip butane torch (~100 W).<br>
      <br>
      [0096] In an exemplary embodiment, formic acid can be used as the
      reactive composition. Overall, formic acid decomposition proceeds
      by one of two pathways: dehydrogenation (producing H2 and CO2,
      [Delta]G=-48.4 kJ/mol) or dehydration (products H2O and CO,
      [Delta]G=-28.5 kJ/mol). The dehydrogenation reaction is more
      thermodynamically favorable but is endothermic at 300 K (+32
      kJ/mol). Only when oxygen is available to react with the H2 is the
      overall reaction (dehydrogenation plus combustion) exothermic:
      -210 kJ/mol, or -4570 J/g. Thus, for the most efficient reaction,
      oxygen must be supplied in excess, but the catalyst must also be
      carefully selected such that dehydrogenation is kinetically
      favored (since the decomposition is essentially irreversible).<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Calculations from studies of thermopower wave generators
      have yielded an initiation threshold of 170 [mu]g for wave
      propagation. This value is 4% of the aerobic reaction enthalpy of
      formic acid, so system efficiency must be larger than this
      threshold for a generator to operate continuously and
      indefinitely. For reaction cycle times of about 4 seconds, this
      efficiency corresponds to a power density of 43 W/g. While
      thermopower wave generators have produced impressive power
      densities to date, the solid fuels used react at very high
      temperatures, often around 800[deg.] C. Liquid fuels enable
      thermopower wave generators to spread into a much wider variety of
      applications through relatively lower temperature operation.
      Formic acid and methanol decomposing over metal nanoparticle
      catalysts on activated carbon supports, react at around 300[deg.]
      C., although the temperature depends on the activation energy as
      determined by the catalyst. Additionally, the secondary combustion
      of hydrogen may influence reaction temperature. These
      considerations may explain the higher reaction temperatures
      measured so far with pyrometers (see FIG. 17D).<br>
      <br>
      [0098] From thermodynamics, the Carnot limit bounds the efficiency
      for processes generating electricity (i.e., work) from a
      temperature difference. A reaction temperature of 300[deg.] C.
      yields a Carnot efficiency of 48% (assuming 25[deg.] C. ambient
      temperature), which is actually on par with the efficiency of
      molten carbonate or solid oxide fuel cells operating at much
      higher temperatures (500 to 750[deg.] C.). At this efficiency, the
      maximum energy density of formic acid (in the limit of negligible
      generator system mass) is 2.2 MJ/kg, which is three times larger
      than lithium ion.<br>

      <br>
      [0099] Small and large thermal losses, and predictions of
      characteristic voltage pulse shapes for generators, can be modeled
      using the energy balance for thermopower waves. In particular,
      using end-point temperature measurements during thermopower wave
      reactions, the expected voltage from several temperature-dependent
      Seebeck coefficient models can be compared to actual measurements
      to demonstrate that they sometimes miss the presence of secondary
      peaks of opposite sign, as well as misjudge the magnitude of the
      primary voltage peak. By introducing to the model doping-related
      shifts in the sign of the Seebeck coefficient, which can be caused
      by oxygen removal from the SWNTs behind the reaction front, a
      better prediction of observed experimental voltages can be
      achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] To begin, the charge transport (sometimes called
      drift-diffusion) equation can be used to predict voltage from
      temperature models:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where J is current, [sigma] is electrical conductivity, E
      is electric field, [mu] is chemical potential, e is the elementary
      charge, L12 is an Onsager coupling coefficient, and T is
      temperature. Properties are written in terms of holes being the
      majority carrier, as is the case for SWNTs in ambient conditions,
      although it is possible to write an additional equation for
      electrons as the majority carrier by changing the sign before
      [sigma]. These quantities can be expressed as multi-dimensional
      vectors and tensors, but in a large-aspect-ratio (&gt;10) system
      of carbon nanotubes, a one-dimensional representation is
      reasonable. When current is small enough to be neglected (often
      the case for oscilloscope measurements), one can solve for E and
      integrate between two contacts (e.g., positioned at end points xL
      and xR of a nanotube) to obtain an equation for voltage.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The Seebeck coefficient is defined as
      [Gamma]=+-L12/[sigma], with the sign the opposite of the majority
      charge carrier. It is the ratio of V to [Delta]T with no other
      gradients present. Introducing a chemical potential gradient,
      e.g., through doping, can also affect charge transport. Thus,
      experimental measurements of voltage can include effects besides
      those of the temperature gradient. By applying a change of
      variables, one can simplify the previous integral.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0102] In a real circuit, a counter-voltage develops through the
      electrodes and wires in response to the opposite [Delta]T in that
      direction. However, for thermal wave generator (TWG) contact
      materials at room temperature (e.g., see FIG. 10), the Seebeck
      coefficient of each electrode is negligible, so the
      counter-voltage can be neglected. Silver has [Gamma]=1.51 [mu]V/K,
      and copper has [Gamma]=1.83 [mu]V/K.50. If the same materials are
      used on both sides, [Delta][mu]=0 in this way as well.
      Furthermore, SWNT-silver contacts do not exhibit rectification
      (i.e., they are Ohmic contacts) because the work function of
      randomly oriented silver particles (4.26 eV) is less than that of
      SWNTs (4.5 eV). Voltage and current measurements of thermopower
      wave generators confirm this fact.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] For a fiber of mixed semiconducting and metal SWNTs, the
      Seebeck coefficient will have a form described by the following
      equation:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      [Gamma]=aT+bT&lt;1/2&gt;exp[-(T1/T)&lt;1/(1+d)&gt;] (7)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where a and b are coefficients defining the weight of
      metallic and semiconducting contributions, respectively. T1 is a
      constant related to the energy barrier for carrier hopping between
      SWNTs, and d is the dimensionality factor (equal to 2 for SWNT
      macrostructures with this level of connectivity).<br>
      <br>
      [0104] Describing the evolution of the temperature profile over
      time allows one to predict, using the Seebeck effect, the general
      shape of the voltage profile in time. In the case of an adiabatic,
      steadily propagating reaction wave, during the time of reaction,
      TR and TL are constant. Thus, a perfectly square voltage pulse
      would result from an adiabatic reaction wave according to equation
      (3). However, real reaction waves have thermal losses from
      radiation, convection, and conduction, and therefore will diverge
      from the logistic adiabatic wave temperature and voltage profiles.
      In particular, radiation should be the most significant factor
      because of its fourth-order temperature dependence and the
      reaction temperatures exceeding 1000 K.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] The enemy balance for the reacting fuel, including
      radiation, is described by the following equation:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where is time, x is distance, c is thermal conductivity, r
      is density, [Delta]H is the enthalpy of reaction, Cp is the
      specific heat (mass basis), Y is the concentration of fuel (mass
      basis), k0 is the Arrhenius prefactor, R is the universal gas
      constant, Ea is the activation energy, S/V is the exterior
      surface-area-to-volume ratio, E is the emissivity, [sigma]B is the
      Stephan-Boltzmann constant, and Latm is the temperature of the
      surroundings.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The corresponding first-order reaction kinetics equation
      for solid fuel (no mass diffusion) is:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] These equations can be non-dimensionalized by expressing
      temperature as<br>

      [0107] For thermopower waves, the inclusion of highly thermally
      conductive nano-conduits with large aspect ratios (such as carbon
      nanotubes) accelerates the reaction wave along their lengths. The
      heat transfer between fuel annuli and the conduits around which
      they are wrapped is not limiting, so both can attain the same
      temperature profile moving with a velocity determined by the
      thermal diffusivity of the conduit. This effect can be
      incorporated in Equation (6) above by multiplying the thermal
      diffusion term by the ratio of conduit to fuel thermal
      diffusivities, [alpha]2/[alpha]. For this case, w should still use
      the exterior S/V for the whole composite in order to avoid the
      complications of representing radiation within the structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Equations (10) and (11) can be solved numerically with
      computer software, such as the COMSOL 4.1 package. Using adiabatic
      boundary conditions and a sufficiently large initial Gaussian
      temperature pulse<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] can ensure self-sustaining wave propagation. Experiments
      have demonstrated that preheating also helps, so in one experiment
      the system was initialized at 350 K with un-reacted fuel (y=1)
      everywhere. Reaction and thermal parameter values were taken from
      picramide, the fuel used in the experiment, except for thermal
      diffusivity ([alpha]2/[alpha]), which was set by the SWNT thermal
      conduits as described above; Cr=2424 J/kg/K, [rho]=1762
      kg/m&lt;3&gt;, E=121 kJ/mol, k0 (Arrhenius prefactor)=1.6*107
      [alpha]2/[alpha]=25,000. Other parameters related to radiation
      were defined based on values typical to SWNT fibers used in the
      experiment: [epsilon]=S/V=2900 m&lt;-1&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] One goal in a thermopower wave generator is the development
      of a fast-moving wave with relatively low thermal losses. Reaction
      wave speeds decrease exponentially with increasing [beta], the
      inverse dimensionless adiabatic reaction temperature rise, but
      below [beta]=2, they become unstable. Thus, an initial value of
      [beta]=4 with w (dimensionless radiation coefficient) 2.7*10&lt;-5
      &gt;was used. FIG. 18A shows the propagation of this wave in the
      form of temperature profiles. Each profile shown represents the
      theoretically calculated temperature as a function of length at a
      different time. The wave achieves steady velocity after
      [beta]=400, and differs from the adiabatic logistic form by
      cooling behind the front. Careful examination shows that the
      temperature at the left boundary monotonically increases towards
      the 1/[beta] limit as the wave moves out of the initiation regime,
      and the extent of cooling decreases over time. Thus, radiation
      actually affects the wave little at these values, and this cooling
      stems from conduction to the (initially) cooler left boundary
      region.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] The computational software package used employs adaptive
      time-stepping to improve the stability of its calculations, and
      convergence can be confirmed by comparing results at several
      spatial mesh sizes. FIG. 18A was created with mesh size
      [Delta][xi]=1, and convergence was confirmed for three other mesh
      sizes as well. Wave shape and speed do not change over
      0.5&lt;[Delta][xi]&lt;4. The simulation initiation parameters for
      FIG. 18 were g (initial Gaussian amplitude)=2.1 and wi (Gaussian
      peak width parameter)=5000.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] Applying a linear extrapolation of the Seebeck model
      described earlier to the temperature profiles of FIG. 18A produces
      an upper bound for expected voltage peak shape and magnitude
      (assuming [Delta][mu]=0 between the two ends), FIG. 18B shows this
      predicted voltage peak, measured between the dashed lines in FIG.
      18A to minimize specious effects of the boundary conditions. The
      peak is an impressive 110 my, but it still falls short of the
      record thermopower wave voltage from SWNTs (220 mV). This
      difference is magnified by the fact that the peak temperature of
      FIG. 18A, u=0.28, corresponds to 4000 K, which is about twice the
      maximum temperature measured in thermopower waves. Nevertheless,
      the shape of the pulse, which is almost entirely unipolar,
      generally matches that of thermopower wave pulses, with an
      important difference-the maximum magnitude occurs when the wave is
      at the left end of the zone rather than after it has finished
      propagating. FIG. 18C shows this clearly by delineating wave
      positions for the same time range of the voltage pulse of FIG. 18B
      (the voltage measurement points are indicated by the dashed
      lines).<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Thermal conduction to the electrodes is another likely
      major thermal loss mode. In thermopower wave experiments, silver
      paste forms contacts between the SWNTs and copper tape electrodes.
      These contacts have high interfacial surface area and are
      generally quite massive compared to the fuel-coated nanotubes
      (about fitly times larger), so they can serve as large thermal
      reservoirs. Mathematically, such reservoirs can be represented as
      a Neumann boundary condition:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where q will be termed the thermal flux coefficient,
      scaling the rate of heat loss through the boundary, which is
      proportional to the temperature difference between the SWNTs and
      the reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] With conduction to the contacts and a slower moving wave,
      thermal losses more significantly affect the shape of the wave
      temperature profile. FIGS. 19A and 19B show temperature and
      voltage profiles (similar to FIGS. 18A and 18B) for a wave with
      [beta]=8 and q 0.34, which requires g=7 to initiate propagation.
      The velocity is about 6% of the 8=4 wave, and for this value of
      [beta],w=5.3*10&lt;-5&gt;. FIG. 19A shows the wave start-up period
      as the ignition pulse dies down and the front spreads forward
      (from left to right) before accelerating and attaining the
      adiabatic reaction temperature at the front (while still cooling
      behind it). The wave cools to about 75% of the adiabatic reaction
      temperature behind the front, leading to a proportional decrease
      in voltage from the peak (see FIG. 19B) before the wave reaches
      the right contact ([xi]=35,000). When the right contact quickly
      reaches reaction temperature, the thermal gradient reverses,
      creating the second voltage peak of opposite polarity. Note that
      the first voltage peak (of larger magnitude) still occurs when the
      wave passes the left contact. From this example, one can see that
      thermopower waves can exhibit bipolar voltage pulses with large
      thermal losses.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] In the experimental setup, picramide (PA) and sodium azide
      together formed a fuel mixture for thermopower waves, and the
      mixture provided a high-temperature reaction and reliable
      ignition. SWNT fibers with lengths of about 5-20 mm and widths of
      about 0.5-2 mm were used as nanostructures. Each fiber thus
      contained millions of SWNTs (individuals or small bundles) with
      diameters of about 1.0-1.3 nm and lengths of about 5-50 [mu]m. The
      fuel compounds physically adsorb to the SWNTs after deposition
      from their respective solutions (PA: 20 g/L in acetonitrile; NaN3:
      20 or 50 g/L in water). The solvents evaporate for about 1 and 4
      hours, respectively, after addition of each solution. The
      resulting masses of PA and of NaN3 can be at least as much as the
      mass of SWNTs for successful reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] A digital oscilloscope (Yokogawa DL 1735E or 2000) was used
      to measure voltage from thermopower waves. A high-speed camera
      (Canadian Photonic Labs, CPL-MS70KS2B90) recorded the wave
      propagation at 1000-4000 frames/second with a Nikon, AF
      Micro-NIKKOR60 mm f/2.8D macro lens. Two pyrometers (Raytek MM1MH
      and Omega OS4000) measured temperature at the left and right ends,
      respectively, of each SWNT fiber. The Raytek measures spectral
      response at 1 um with a semiconductor photodetector and calculates
      temperature assuming (emissivity-adjusted) blackbody emission
      (accuracy: +-0.3%+1 K, range: 540[deg.] C.&lt;T&lt;3000[deg.] C.).
      The Omega uses an InGaAs photo detector (spectral response: 1.2 to
      2.6 [mu]m, accuracy: +-1%, 350[deg.] C.&lt;T&lt;1500[deg.] C.).
      Since carbon nanotubes are nearly blackbody emitters with little
      wavelength dependence in their emission, this approach is valid.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] A 785-nm, 100-ms laser pulse (300 mW, spot size &lt;1
      mm&lt;2&gt;) initiated thermopower waves after preheating to about
      100[deg.] C. with a small 10-W resistance heater (which was
      silicone-covered to avoid current leakage into thermopower
      measurement circuit). Control samples with no reaction (only laser
      and preheating) showed voltage changes less than about 3 mV.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] A 5 V TTL pulse from a custom control circuit board
      triggered the instruments to start with the laser pulse and stop
      synchronously. Synchronization was checked by comparing the timing
      of temperature peaks at the left and right sides to the timing of
      brightest reaction at each side observed with the camera. FIG. 20A
      depicts this method graphically for an example thermopower wave
      (the two pyrometers described above have different spectral
      ranges, so their lower measurement bounds, indicated by the dashed
      lines in FIG. 20A, differ). The significant cooling after the wave
      passes demonstrates that the system is far from adiabatic, so the
      Seebeck effect would predict a bipolar voltage pulse like in FIG.
      19B. Note the very high maximum temperature during the reaction of
      about 1000[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] However, as is often the case for thermopower waves, the
      voltage pulse is unipolar, with a sizeable peak of -50 mV. FIG.
      20B compares the measured voltage for this example to three
      different voltage models based on the temperature recorded in FIG.
      20A. The pyrometers record more slowly than the oscilloscope,
      leading to a coarser curve of predicted voltage. Although the
      linear Seebeck model used in FIG. 18 and FIG. 19 generally follows
      the shape of the experimental voltage, it still predicts periods
      of opposite voltage at the beginning and end of the reaction.
      Moreover, it under-predicts the peak voltage by more than 20 mV.
      The mixed SWNTs model of Equation (7), with different temperature
      dependencies for semiconducting and metallic SWNTs (a=-0.022
      [mu]V/K&lt;2&gt;, b=2.0, T1=20 K), is more plausible based on the
      heterogeneous nature of the SWNT fibers but falls shorter still.
      The sudden change in voltage in those models after 200 ms is an
      artifact resulting from TR dropping below the measurement
      threshold of 540[deg.] C.; if one extrapolates TR with a simple
      exponential cooling model, one sees that V is smaller in this
      period and begins to approach zero. Although the system is not
      adiabatic, the voltage pulse shape does not agree with predictions
      for a reaction wave with significant thermal losses.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] Previous discussion of the large voltages of thermopower
      waves focused on the large wave velocities (up to 2 m/s) observed.
      Effects termed "electron [or hole] entrainment" were posited,
      phenomenologically describing charge carriers caught up in and
      accelerated by the rapidly moving reaction front. This description
      is quite similar to that of phonon drag, known to be a strong
      contributor to thermoelectricity in carbon nanotubes. However,
      FIG. 20C shows no strong correlation between ¦V¦ and instantaneous
      wave velocities measured synchronously. While the velocity
      fluctuates between 0.09 and 0.36 m/s (a factor four difference)
      the amplitude of voltage oscillations is at most 10 mV.
      Nevertheless, the average velocity is 0.16 m/s, a factor of 10
      smaller than the record for thermopower waves, so it may be that
      only faster waves exhibit a boost in voltage from wave velocity.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] Applying the Seebeck models to temperature measurements
      from six other thermopower wave generators confirmed that the
      Seebeck coefficient alone is insufficient to predict voltage pulse
      shape for most thermopower waves. FIG. 21 shows four selected
      voltage graphs along with possible models. The models utilized
      include a non-monotonic function of temperature with a peak around
      800 K, a prior art model for mixed-type SWNTs, and a variation on
      the prior art model where the Seebeck coefficient at each contact
      changes sign from positive to negative while the fuel is reacting
      there (predicated on electronic doping by fuel adsorbed on the
      SWNTs). Interestingly, for these reactions the linear Seebeck
      model voltage far exceeded the measurements (and thus it is
      excluded from the graphs for clarity), although all had smaller
      peak voltage than FIG. 20B. FIG. 21A shows the greatest ¦V¦, 27
      mV. Thus, individual SWNT fibers may be different enough in
      composition that metallic and semiconducting contributions may
      vary between fibers.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] The model for mixed SWNT fibers matches peak voltage
      magnitudes in FIG. 21 somewhat better, although it can still be
      off by more than 10 mV. Moreover, it is insufficient to describe
      bipolar peaks, which all of these reactions exhibit to some
      extent, either overestimating their magnitude (FIG. 21B) or
      missing their timing (FIG. 21C). In FIG. 21A, the mixed SWNT model
      misses the negative voltage entirely. Thus, it seems reasonable
      that a different [Gamma]=f(T) could better describe these
      reactions, which, after all, occur on SWNT fibers that are made
      quite differently than SWNT films. While the general form for
      mixed contributions may be correct, one need not expect that the
      parameter values should be the same. Conceptually, this new
      function should be greater than the prior model for T&lt;400[deg.]
      C., which corresponds to the later portions of the graphs where
      the divergence is greater, and it should be equal to or less than
      the prior model at reaction temperatures, T&gt;800[deg.] C., to
      bring down the predicted peak voltage.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] However, one cannot create such a function by varying the
      parameters of the mixed SWNT model. The result of iterating a, b,
      and T1 in Equation (7) is the non-monotonic model in FIG. 21
      (a=-0.035, b=2.5, T1=55 K). One might expect that a Seebeck
      coefficient that peaks as temperature increases (at 930 K) would
      create significantly different shapes of voltage pulses, but the
      shapes are quiet similar, with only the magnitude greatly
      differing. This can be explained by the function's mathematical
      constraint to pass through the origin, which restricts its
      variability. It is not possible to create a function in the form
      of Equation (7) that also meets the conceptual criteria of the
      previous paragraph.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] Since the models diverge most from measured V during the
      earliest and latest periods of the reaction, the data suggest that
      an aspect of the chemical reaction of the fuel could account for
      differences between thermopower waves and Seebeck
      thermoelectricity. As mentioned earlier, the presence/absence of
      adsorbed O2 can go so far as to reverse the sign of the Seebeck
      coefficient by changing the doping of the SWNTs. The desorption
      time constant has been measured to be about 5 ruin under
      equilibrating conditions at 350 K. Further, adsorption/desorption
      has been found to be very strongly thermally activated, so even at
      500 K the time constant (extrapolated) drops to a mere 3 ms.
      Moreover, the extreme, non-equilibrium environment of the
      exothermic decomposition of picramide and the many intermediate
      radical species it can produce could conceivably consume O2
      through reaction much faster than desorption.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] Thus, the third model of FIG. 21 hypothesizes a linear
      shift of the Seebeck coefficient from positive to negative at each
      end over the time the reaction is observed (with the camera) to be
      greatest at that location. These periods are framed on the graphs
      by red (R1 and R2) and green (G1 and G2) dashed lines for the
      beginning and end, respectively, of wave propagation. After the
      red lines (R1 and R2) the ignition-side [Gamma] is negative; after
      the green lines (G1 and G2), [Gamma] on the opposite side has
      likewise inverted. In accordance with previously documented
      measurements, which showed a smaller ¦[Gamma]¦ when negative, a
      ratio of -44/65 is assigned to the negative Seebeck coefficient in
      this model, while otherwise preserving the form of the temperature
      dependence. This approach is equivalent to an effective Seebeck
      coefficient using separate values for hole and electronic
      properties, weighted by their individual conductivities, a good
      tack for materials such as SWNTs (and graphene) with ambipolar
      conduction.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] The predictions of this doping-induced Seebeck shift model
      more closely match the shape of the experimental voltage pulses
      than the models that do not account for O2 doping. The doping
      model shows steeper voltage rises compared to the temperature
      models; for example, in FIG. 21B the first two models have a flat
      initial voltage from zero time through the peak. The magnitudes of
      the primary peaks are not necessarily as close to the measurements
      because it is difficult to quantify the extent of O2 doping
      (positive and negative) for thermopower wave reactions, which are
      not as tightly controlled as those of prior experiments.
      Conceivably, adjusting the ratio of [Gamma]-/[Gamma]+ could better
      fit the peaks. FIG. 21A benefits the most from the doping model,
      whereas the other two models miss the second, negative voltage
      peak. All three models offer about the same predictions for
      secondary peaks in FIG. 21B-D, but these occur relatively later,
      after the reaction has finished, hence their difference with FIG.
      21A.<br>

      [0126] The experiments described above represent the first
      synchronous measurements of temperature, voltage, and velocity of
      thermopower waves, and they have yielded insights into the physics
      underlying the power generation of these waves. Simulation of
      thermopower waves with thermal losses from radiation and
      conduction to large contacts showed that non-adiabatic waves can
      produce bipolar voltage pulses. However, modeling of Seebeck
      voltage from the measured temperature differences does not
      reproduce the shape of thermopower wave voltage pulses, even
      accounting for temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient.
      A model including a doping-related shift in the Seebeck
      coefficient to negative values as oxygen desorbs and reacts at and
      behind the wave front better fits the measured voltages.<br>
