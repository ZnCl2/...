      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      As the level of interest in aging research increases, there is a
      growing number of geroprotectors, or therapeutic interventions
      that aim to extend the healthy lifespan and repair or reduce
      aging-related damage in model organisms and, eventually, in
      humans. There is a clear need for a manually-curated database of
      geroprotectors to compile and index their effects on aging and
      age-related diseases and link these effects to relevant studies
      and multiple biochemical and drug databases. Here, we introduce
      the first such resource, Geroprotectors
      (http://geroprotectors.org). Geroprotectors is a public, rapidly
      explorable database that catalogs over 250 experiments involving
      over 200 known or candidate geroprotectors that extend lifespan in
      model organisms. Each compound has a comprehensive profile
      complete with biochemistry, mechanisms, and lifespan effects in
      various model organisms, along with information ranging from
      chemical structure, side effects, and toxicity to FDA drug status.
      These are presented in a visually intuitive, efficient framework
      fit for casual browsing or in-depth research alike. Data are
      linked to the source studies or databases, providing quick and
      convenient access to original data. The Geroprotectors database
      facilitates cross-study, cross-organism, and cross-discipline
      analysis and saves countless hours of inefficient literature and
      web searching. Geroprotectors is a one-stop, knowledge-sharing,
      time-saving resource for researchers seeking healthy aging
      solutions. <br>

      <div align="center"><b>Scientists have isolated 6 natural
          compounds that could help us slow down ageing</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The fountain of youth might only exist as a mythical concept, but
      that's not stopping scientists from trying to find its molecular
      equivalent. Right now, there are huge levels of interest in drugs
      such as rapamycin and metformin, for example, thanks to their
      impressive life-extending and disease-fighting properties.<br>
      <br>
      But a new study suggests that the anti-ageing effects of these
      medications might have now been outdone: certain plant extracts
      have been found to contain the most effective anti-ageing
      molecules ever seen.<br>
      <br>
      In conjunction with Quebec-based biotech company Idunn
      Technologies, a team from Concordia University in Canada has
      conducted more than 10,000 trials screening for plant extracts
      that could increase the chronological lifespan of yeast.<br>
      <br>
      While you might not think it, yeast is one of the most common
      organisms studied in longevity research, due to similarities in
      the ways that yeast and humans age at the cellular level.<br>
      <br>
      "In total, we found six new groups of molecules that decelerate
      the chronological ageing of yeast," said biologist Vladimir
      Titorenko from Concordia University.<br>
      <br>
      As the authors report in Oncotarget, one of these compounds – a
      specific extract of willow bark (Salix alba) – is the most potent
      longevity-extending pharmacological intervention ever described in
      scientific literature. In testing, the willow bark extract
      increased the average chronological lifespan of yeast by 475
      percent and the maximum chronological lifespan by 369 percent. <br>
      <br>
      If these findings can be replicated in something other than yeast,
      it's a major discovery, outperforming the anti-ageing effects of
      both rapamycin and metformin. And in addition to slowing ageing,
      the compounds may also have beneficial effects on cellular
      processes when it comes to preventing related diseases, such as
      cancer, the researchers say. The other extracts come from
      Cimicifuga racemosa, Valeriana officinalis L., Passiflora
      incarnata L., Ginkgo biloba, and Apium graveolens L..<br>
      <br>
      "Rather than focus on curing the individual disease, interventions
      on the molecular processes of ageing can simultaneously delay the
      onset and progression of most age-related disorders," said Idunn
      Technologies founder, Éric Simard. "This kind of intervention is
      predicted to have a much larger effect on healthy ageing and life
      expectancy than can be attained by treating individual diseases."<br>
      <br>
      The researchers say they'll be furthering their study of the
      molecular compounds, with Idunn Technologies collaborating with
      four other universities on six separate research programs. The
      goal is to study the plant extracts in an animal model of ageing,
      in addition to two cancer models. We can't wait to hear the
      results.<br>

      </b><b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
      <br>
      We discovered six plant extracts that increase yeast chronological
      lifespan to a significantly greater extent than any of the
      presently known longevity-extending chemical compounds. One of
      these extracts is the most potent longevity-extending
      pharmacological intervention yet described. We show that each of
      the six plant extracts is a geroprotector which delays the onset
      and decreases the rate of yeast chronological aging by eliciting a
      hormetic stress response. We also show that each of these extracts
      has different effects on cellular processes that define longevity
      in organisms across phyla. These effects include the following: 1)
      increased mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential; 2)
      augmented or reduced concentrations of reactive oxygen species; 3)
      decreased oxidative damage to cellular proteins, membrane lipids,
      and mitochondrial and nuclear genomes; 4) enhanced cell resistance
      to oxidative and thermal stresses; and 5) accelerated degradation
      of neutral lipids deposited in lipid droplets. Our findings
      provide new insights into mechanisms through which chemicals
      extracted from certain plants can slow biological aging.<br>

      </b><b>Plant extraction method and extract</b><br>
      A plant extract from a medical plant, preferably from Cimicifuga

      extraction liquid containing the extract dissolved in said
      extraction agent; separating said extraction liquid from said
      solid plant material; and concentrating said extraction liquid by
      at least partially removing said extraction agent to produce a
      concentrated extract. According to the invention, concentrating
      the extraction liquid is effected in the presence of an effective
      amount of a pharmacologically acceptable and physiologically inert
      solution mediator. This yields a novel extract and avoids loss of
      constituents of the extract liquid upon concentration thereof. The
      extract obtained is can be used as a medication capable of binding

      </b><b>SUB-CRITICAL WATER EXTRACTION OF MEDICINAL PLANTS</b><br>
      The patent describes the application of Sub-Critical Water
      Extraction (SWE) to a range of medicinal plants traditionally used
      in Europe or Asia to produce pharmaceutical extracts. The
      extraction of the following plants is covered by the scope of this
      patent: Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) and related species
      Matricaria recutita (German chamomile) and related species Cassia
      angustifolia (senna) and related species Valeriana officinalis
      (valerian) and related species Scutellaria baicalensis (Baikal
      skullcap) and related species Schisandra chinensis (Wuweizu) and
      related species. Zingiber officinale (ginger) and related species.
      Astragalus Membranaceus and related species.; It is demonstrated
      that SWE can produce materials essentially similar, as indicated
      by chromatographic fingerprint, to extracts produced using
      conventional solvents with polarity in the range approximately
      represented by 50% aqueous ethanol through to methanol. Thus as
      the subcritical water extracts of the herbs as described in this
      invention are demonstrated to exhibit a composition essentially
      similar to that of the corresponding methanol or aqueous alcohol
      extract, then it can be expected that these extracts will exhibit
      comparable pharmacological activities to these and to the
      compounds contained therein. In addition to the above claims
      relating to the extraction of the plant material, as the water
      solubility of many of the active compounds is low, both oral
      formulations and topical formulations which improve the
      bioavailability and hence efficacy of the extracts are included.<br>

      Calorie restriction diets have previously been shown to slow down
      the ageing process, and strangely enough, a common ingredient in
      face creams appears to mimic these life-extending effects – and
      all without the pain of going hungry.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers in the UK have found that <b>allantoin,</b> a
      chemical compound found in botanical extracts of the comfrey plant
      and an ingredient in many anti-ageing skin creams, can increase
      the lifespan of certain worms by more than 20 percent – comparable
      to the manner in which calorie restriction achieves the same
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      If drugs developed for humans could reproduce this, it's possible
      that we could help slow down the clock when it comes to genetic
      ageing – and 20 percent extra lifespan is a pretty amazing boost
      to try to replicate.<br>
      <br>
      "Calorie restriction has been shown to have health benefits in
      humans and, while more work is necessary, our findings could
      potentially result in human therapies for age-related diseases,"
      said João Pedro de Magalhães, a researcher in ageing genomics at
      the University of Liverpool.<br>
      <br>
      To identify what kinds of compounds might mimic the effects of
      calorie restriction in humans, the team sourced data from the
      Connectivity Map, a comprehensive database of molecular signatures
      from human cells treated with a variety of small-molecule drug
      candidates.<br>
      <br>
      Using pattern-matching algorithms to find links between drug
      compounds and the effects of calorie restriction, the researchers
      found 11 potential matches, and tested five of the compounds on
      nematode worms.<br>
      <br>
      What they found was that allantoin, and three of the other
      compounds – rapamycin, trichostatin A, and LY–294002 – made the
      treated worms live healthy lives for longer. Three of the
      compounds, including allantoin, also extended the lifespan in a
      strain of mutant worms via anti-ageing mechanisms similar to the
      way in which calorie restriction works.<br>
      <br>
      "We have shown so far that our compounds work in worms, but
      studies in mammalian models are now necessary," said one of the
      team, Shaun Calvert. "The next step for us is to understand the
      mechanisms by which allantoin extends lifespan, as this could
      reveal new longevity pathways."<br>
      <br>
      If those same pathways can be effected in humans – although
      there's no guarantee they will be, as many results from
      experiments on animals are not replicated in people – it may well
      mean we can find ways to live longer, and do so without the pain,
      inconvenience, and risks of committing to so-called starvation
      diets.<br>
      <br>
      "We have known for many years that caloric restriction diets
      increase lifespan in all manner of organisms," said Stephen
      Simpson from the University of Sydney in Australia), in reference
      to separate research he published earlier in the year. "However,
      except for the fanatical few, no one can maintain a 40 percent
      caloric reduction in the long term, and doing so can risk loss of
      bone mass, libido and fertility." <br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Screening a library of drugs with known safety profiles in humans
      yielded 30 drugs that reliably protected mammalian neurons against
      glucose toxicity. Subsequent screening demonstrated that 6 of
      these 30 drugs increase lifespan in C. elegans: caffeine,
      ciclopirox olamine, tannic acid, acetaminophen, bacitracin, and
      baicalein. Every drug significantly reduced the age-dependent
      acceleration of mortality rate. These protective effects were
      blocked by RNAi inhibition of cbp-1 in adults only, which also
      blocks protective effects of dietary restriction. Only 2 drugs,
      caffeine and tannic acid, exhibited a similar dependency on
      DAF-16. Caffeine, tannic acid, and bacitracin also reduced
      pathology in a transgenic model of proteotoxicity associated with
      Alzheimer's disease. These results further support a key role for
      glucose toxicity in driving age-related pathologies and for CBP-1
      in protection against age-related pathologies. These results also
      provide novel lead compounds with known safety profiles in human
      for treatment of age-related diseases, including Alzheimer's
      disease and diabetic complications.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Baicalein is a major compound of extracts derived from Scutellaria
      baicalensis Lamiaceae, which are used as food supplements.
      Baicalein possesses a high radical scavenging activity and
      decreases intracellular reactive oxygen species in Hct116 human
      colon carcinoma cells and in Caenorhabditis elegans . It activates
      Nrf2, a key transcription factor that binds to the antioxidant
      responsive element (ARE): Baicalein causes a nuclear accumulation
      of Nrf2, increases ARE-dependent luciferase activity, and enhances
      the expression of heme oxygenase-1 in Hct116 cells. Additionally,
      accumulation of the Nrf2 homologue SKN-1 in nuclei of intestinal
      cells of C. elegans was observed. Lifespan analysis revealed that
      baicalein extends the mean, median, and maximum lifespans of the
      nematode by 45, 57 and 24%, respectively. Because SKN-1 activation
      is associated with prolongation of lifespan, the results suggest
      that baicalein increases the lifespan of C. elegans by activation
      of the Nrf2/SKN-1 signaling pathway.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Increasing cellular glucose uptake is a fundamental concept in
      treatment of type 2 diabetes, whereas nutritive calorie
      restriction increases life expectancy. We show here that increased
      glucose availability decreases Caenorhabditis elegans life span,
      while impaired glucose metabolism extends life expectancy by
      inducing mitochondrial respiration. The histone deacetylase Sir2.1
      is found here to be dispensable for this phenotype, whereas
      disruption of aak-2, a homolog of AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK),
      abolishes extension of life span due to impaired glycolysis.
      Reduced glucose availability promotes formation of reactive oxygen
      species (ROS), induces catalase activity, and increases oxidative
      stress resistance and survival rates, altogether providing direct
      evidence for a hitherto hypothetical concept named mitochondrial
      hormesis or "mitohormesis." Accordingly, treatment of nematodes
      with different antioxidants and vitamins prevents extension of
      life span. In summary, these data indicate that glucose
      restriction promotes mitochondrial metabolism, causing increased
      ROS formation and cumulating in hormetic extension of life span,
      questioning current treatments of type 2 diabetes as well as the
      widespread use of antioxidant supplements.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The age-related decline in immune function, which is thought to be
      responsible for the increased incidence with age of certain
      diseases, including cancer, has been attributed primarily to a
      loss of T-lymphocyte function. As free radical reactions may
      contribute to cellular deterioration and loss of cell function
      with age, we investigated the effect of adding an
      immunopotentiating antioxidant, 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), to the
      diet of BC3F1 mice in a longitudinal study. For the study, young
      mice were divided into two groups, one of which received the
      2-ME-supplemented diet. Approximately every 3 months for 2.5
      years, mice from each group were sacrificed and the spleen
      lymphocytes assessed for immune function (proliferative response
      to concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and lipopolysaccharide and
      the humoral response to sheep red blood cells). The accumulation
      of fluorescent products indicative of free radical damage was
      measured in the spleen lymphocytes and the cytochrome P-450
      content and activity assessed in the liver. The effect of the
      2-ME-supplemented diet on the mean and maximum life span and tumor
      incidence was also determined. The results showed that the animals
      fed the 2-ME diet had an increased mean and maximum life span and
      a postponed onset and decreased incidence of tumors. In general
      the T-cell-dependent immune responses were higher in the 2-ME-fed
      mice compared to the controls when the animals were young. No
      difference was observed between the two groups during mid-life.
      The responses declined in both groups during the latter half of
      the life span, but the responses of the 2-ME-fed animals declined
      to a lesser extent. The accumulation of fluorescent products of
      lipid peroxidation damage was also delayed in the lymphocytes of
      the 2-ME-fed mice. Cytochrome P-450 content and activity in the
      liver was not different in the two groups. The results suggest
      that the antioxidant activity of 2-ME delayed the accumulation of
      free radical damage in spleen lymphocytes, which resulted in a
      delay in the decline of immune function and was associated with
      the decreased tumor incidence and increased life span.<b><br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Genetic studies have elucidated mechanisms that regulate aging,
      but there has been little progress in identifying drugs that delay
      aging. Here, we report that ethosuximide, trimethadione, and
      3,3-diethyl-2-pyrrolidinone increase mean and maximum life-span of
      Caenorhabditis elegans and delay age-related declines of
      physiological processes, indicating that these compounds retard
      the aging process. These compounds, two of which are approved for
      human use, are anticonvulsants that modulate neural activity.
      These compounds also regulated neuromuscular activity in
      nematodes. These findings suggest that the life-span-extending
      activity of these compounds is related to the anticonvulsant
      activity and implicate neural activity in the regulation of aging.<br>

      </b><b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
      <br>
      Drosophila melanogaster mutants with deficient kynurenine (KYN)
      formation from tryptophan (TRP) have longer life span than wild
      type flies. Administration of alpha-methyl-TRP and 5-methyl-TRY,
      the inhibitors of TRP-KYN metabolism, prolonged life span in
      wild-type flies. Both inhibitors are not available for human use.
      Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from berberis
      aristata is known as the herb widely used in traditional Chinese
      and Indian medicine. Berberin is a strong inhibitor of the enzyme
      catalyzing TRP conversion into KYN. Considering this particular
      feature we investigated the effect of berberine on life-and
      health-span in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster. The results of
      our study showed that Berberine extended mean, median and maximum
      life span of female flies. Berberine did not affect the number of
      pupae of filial generation and decreased their lethality.
      Berberine increased locomotor activity (vertical climbing). The
      results of the study suggest that berberine prolongs life- and
      improves health-span of Drosophila melanogaster. Berberine might
      be a candidate drug for prevention and treatment of aging and
      aging-associated medical and psychiatric disorders.<br>

      The results of previous experimental studies of effects of
      antidiabetic biguanides (phenformin and buformin) on life span and
      spontaneous tumor incidence in mice and rats were recalculated and
      reanalyzed using standard demographic models of mortality. The
      chronic treatment of female C3H/Sn mice with phenformin prolonged
      the mean life span by 21.1% (P &lt; 0.05), the mean life span of
      the last 10% survivors by 28.4% and the maximum life span by 5.5
      months (by 26%) in comparison with the control. The demographic
      aging rate represented by the estimate of respective Gompertz's
      parameter decreased by 31.2% and MRDT increased 1.45-fold. The
      treatment significantly inhibited (4.0-fold, P &lt; 0.01) the
      incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in mice. Administration of
      phenformin to female LIO rats failed to influence the mean life
      span. At the same time, the mean life span of the last 10%
      survivors increased by 10.1% (P &lt; 0.05), and maximum life span
      increased by 3 months (+9.8%). Phenformin attenuated the
      development of spontaneous tumors in comparison to the control.
      The treatment of female rats with another antidiabetic biguanide,
      buformin, slightly increased their mean life span (by 7.3%; P &gt;
      0.05). The mean life span of the last 10% survivors increased by
      12% (P &lt; 0.05) and the maximum life span increased by 2 months
      (+5.5%) as compared with controls. The population aging rate
      decreased by 18.1% (P &lt; 0.05) and MRDT increased 1.22-fold
      under the influence of buformin (P &lt; 0.05). The total tumor
      incidence decreased by 49.5% in buformin-treated rats. Both
      antidiabetic biguanides slightly decreased the body weight, slowed
      down the age-related decline of the reproductive function in
      female rats. The results of our experiments provide evidence that
      antidiabetic biguanides are promising geroprotectors as well as
      drugs which can be used in the prevention of cancer.<br>

      Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was given in the feed to determine
      its effect on life span in genetically well-defined,
      barrier-derived BALB/c mice. Both sexes received 0.75% BHT for
      three different treatment periods: (A) 8 to 11 weeks of age; (B)
      for life, beginning at 11 weeks; (C) for life, beginning at 8
      weeks of age. The control group (D) was untreated. All BHT
      treatment groups had mean survival times which exceeded that of
      controls. The order of survival was B greater than C greater than
      A greater than D (Males: 890, 832, 726, 684 days; Females: 875,
      798, 759, 701 days). Most of the increases in mean survival time
      were related to a reduction in early deaths (350--600 days) in
      BHT-treated mice. The reason for the life-lengthening effect on
      BHT was not identified, but it may relate to alterations in

      <br>
      Many late-onset proteotoxic diseases are accompanied by a
      disruption in homeostasis of metals (metallostasis) including
      iron, copper and zinc. Although aging is the most prominent risk
      factor for these disorders, the impact of aging on metallostasis
      and its role in proteotoxic disease remain poorly understood.
      Moreover, it is not clear whether a loss of metallostasis
      influences normal aging. We have investigated the role of
      metallostasis in longevity ofCaenorhabditis elegans. We found that
      calcium, copper, iron, and manganese levels increase as a function
      of age, while potassium and phosphorus levels tend to decrease.
      Increased dietary iron significantly accelerated the age-related
      accumulation of insoluble protein, a molecular pathology of aging.
      Proteomic analysis revealed widespread effects of dietary iron in
      multiple organelles and tissues. Pharmacological interventions to
      block accumulation of specific metals attenuated many models of
      proteotoxicity and extended normal lifespan. Collectively, these
      results suggest that a loss of metallostasis with aging
      contributes to age-related protein aggregation. <br>

      We report that feeding Drosophila throughout adulthood with
      4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) can significantly increase lifespan,
      without diminution of locomotor vigor, resistance to stress, or
      reproductive ability. Treatment for a limited period, either early
      or late in adult life, is also effective. Flies fed PBA show a
      global increase in histone acetylation as well as a dramatically
      altered pattern of gene expression, including induction or
      repression of numerous genes. The delay in aging may result from
      the altered physiological state.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Catechins are major polyphenols in many plant foods that have been
      related to health promotion. In the human organism they are
      largely metabolized to different conjugates such as methylated
      derivatives, which may contribute to the effects associated to the
      intake of the parent compounds. In this study the effects of
      catechin, epicatechin, 3′-O-methylepicatechin and
      4′-O-methylepicatechin have been evaluated using C. elegans as a
      model organism. It was found that the methylated epicatechin
      derivatives (200 μM) increased the mean lifespan of the nematode
      by 6–12%, whereas catechin and epicatechin did not have influence
      on its life duration. All the assayed catechins enhanced the
      resistance of the worm against thermal and oxidative stress,
      producing an increase in the survival rates up to 44% in relation
      to untreated animals. However, no significant effects of these
      compounds were observed in the reproductive output or size of the
      worms. The uptake of epicatechin by C. elegans and its complete
      biotransformation to different metabolites, namely glycoside
      conjugates, was confirmed by LC–MS analyses. Nevertheless, the
      extent of epicatechin uptake was very low as suggested by the low
      levels of metabolites determined.<br>

      <br>
      Four agents--acarbose (ACA), 17-α-estradiol (EST),
      nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), and methylene blue (MB)--were
      evaluated for lifespan effects in genetically heterogeneous mice
      tested at three sites. Acarbose increased male median lifespan by
      22% (P &lt; 0.0001), but increased female median lifespan by only
      5% (P = 0.01). This sexual dimorphism in ACA lifespan effect could
      not be explained by differences in effects on weight. Maximum
      lifespan (90th percentile) increased 11% (P &lt; 0.001) in males
      and 9% (P = 0.001) in females. EST increased male median lifespan
      by 12% (P = 0.002), but did not lead to a significant effect on
      maximum lifespan. The benefits of EST were much stronger at one
      test site than at the other two and were not explained by effects
      on body weight. EST did not alter female lifespan. NDGA increased
      male median lifespan by 8-10% at three different doses, with
      P-values ranging from 0.04 to 0.005. Females did not show a
      lifespan benefit from NDGA, even at a dose that produced blood
      levels similar to those in males, which did show a strong lifespan
      benefit. MB did not alter median lifespan of males or females, but
      did produce a small, statistically significant (6%, P = 0.004)
      increase in female maximum lifespan. These results provide new
      pharmacological models for exploring processes that regulate the
      timing of aging and late-life diseases, and in particular for
      testing hypotheses about sexual dimorphism in aging and health.<br>

      We tested the theory that reactive oxygen species cause aging. We

      <br>
      Compounds that delay aging in model organisms may be of
      significant interest to anti-aging medicine, since these
      substances potentially provide pharmaceutical approaches to
      promote healthy lifespan in humans. We here aimed to test whether
      pharmaceutical concentrations of three fibrates, pharmacologically
      established serum lipid-lowering drugs and ligands of the nuclear
      receptor PPARalpha in mammals, are capable of extending lifespan
      in a nematodal model organism for aging processes, the roundworm
      Caenorhabditis elegans. Adult C. elegans (wild-type N2 as well as
      two nhr-49-deficient strains, RB1716 and VC870) were maintained on
      agar plates and were fed E. coli strain OP50 bacteria.
      Bezafibrate, clofibrate, and fenofibrate were applied to the agar,
      respectively, to test whether they may promote longevity by
      quantifying survival in the presence and absence of the respective
      compounds. All three fibrates extended C. elegans N2 lifespan when
      applied at a concentration of 10 micromolar. Bezafibrate
      additionally extended C. elegans N2 lifespan at concentrations of
      1 micromolar and 0.1 micromolar. In strains deficient for nhr-49,
      a functional orthologue of the mammalian peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), all three
      compounds were incapable of extending lifespan. Taken together,
      fibrates promote C. elegans longevity in an NHR-49-dependent
      manner possibly by promoting mitohormesis and suggesting that
      these compounds may promote lifespan also in mammals.<br>

      </b><br>
      This group has invented a novel deuterohemin containing peptide
      deuterohemin-AlaHisThrValGluLys (DhHP-6), which has various
      biological activities including protection of murine ischemia
      reperfusion injury, improving cell survival and preventing
      apoptosis. It was hypothesized that DhHP-6 is beneficial on the
      lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and increases
      their resistance to heat and oxidative stress. C. elegans were
      treated with different concentrations of DhHP-6. Survival time and
      sensitivity to heat and paraquat were investigated. The data
      demonstrated that the mean survival time of C. elegans was
      significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) in the DhHP-6 treated group
      compared with the control group. The maximum lifespan was not
      affected by DhHP-6 treatment. DhHP-6 improved the survival rate of
      C. elegans in the acute heat stress (35 degrees C) and rescued the
      C. elegans' sensitivity to paraquat in acute oxidative stress.
      Superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD-3) protein was up-regulated by DhHP-6
      treatment. It was further demonstrated that stress resistance
      genes such as hsp-16.1, hsp-16.49 and sir-2.1 were regulated by
      DhHP-6. DAF-16 and SIR-2.1 genes are essential for the beneficial
      effect of DhHP-6. Therefore, the investigation into the beneficial
      effect of DhHP-6 on C. elegans' lifespan has the potential to
      develop novel drugs to prevent ageing.<br>

      Aging is associated with increased vulnerability to chronic,
      degenerative diseases and death. Strategies for promoting
      healthspan without necessarily affecting lifespan or aging rate
      have gained much interest. The mitochondrial free radical theory
      of aging suggests that mitochondria and, in particular,
      age-dependent mitochondrial decline play a central role in aging,
      making compounds that affect mitochondrial function a possible
      strategy for the modulation of healthspan and possibly the aging
      rate. Here we tested such a "metabolic tuning" approach in
      nematodes using the mitochondrial modulator dichloroacetate (DCA).
      We explored DCA as a proof-of-principle compound to alter
      mitochondrial parameters in wild-type animals and tested whether
      this approach is suitable for reducing reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) production and for improving organismal health- and
      lifespan. In parallel, we addressed the potential problem of
      operator bias by running both unblinded and blinded lifespan
      studies. We found that DCA treatment (1) increased ATP levels
      without elevating oxidative protein damage and (2) reduced ROS
      production in adult C. elegans. DCA treatment also significantly
      prolonged nematode health- and lifespan, but did not strongly
      impact mortality doubling time. Operator blinding resulted in
      considerably smaller lifespan-extending effects of DCA. Our data
      illustrate the promise of a "metabolic tuning" intervention
      strategy, emphasize the importance of mitochondria in nematode
      aging and highlight operator bias as a potential confounder in
      lifespan studies.<br>

      The biguanide drug metformin is widely prescribed to treat type 2
      diabetes and metabolic syndrome, but its mode of action remains
      uncertain. Metformin also increases lifespan in Caenorhabditis
      elegans cocultured with Escherichia coli. This bacterium exerts
      complex nutritional and pathogenic effects on its nematode
      predator/host that impact health and aging. We report that
      metformin increases lifespan by altering microbial folate and
      methionine metabolism. Alterations in metformin-induced longevity
      by mutation of worm methionine synthase (metr-1) and
      S-adenosylmethionine synthase (sams-1) imply metformin-induced
      methionine restriction in the host, consistent with action of this
      drug as a dietary restriction mimetic. Metformin increases or
      decreases worm lifespan, depending on E. coli strain metformin
      sensitivity and glucose concentration. In mammals, the intestinal
      microbiome influences host metabolism, including development of
      metabolic disease. Thus, metformin-induced alteration of microbial
      metabolism could contribute to therapeutic efficacy-and also to
      its side effects, which include folate deficiency and
      gastrointestinal upset.<br>

      <br>
      Aging is an important biological phenomenon and a major
      contributor to human disease and disability, but no drugs have
      been demonstrated to delay human aging. Caenorhabditis elegans is
      a valuable model for studies of animal aging, and the analysis of
      drugs that extend the lifespan of this animal can elucidate
      mechanisms of aging and might lead to treatments for age-related
      disease. By testing drugs that are Food and Drug Administration
      approved for human use, we discovered that the mood stabilizer and
      anticonvulsant valproic acid (VA) extended C. elegans lifespan. VA
      also delayed age-related declines of body movement, indicating
      that VA delays aging. Valproic acid is a small carboxylic acid
      that is the most frequently prescribed anticonvulsant drug in
      humans. A structure-activity analysis demonstrated that the
      related compound valpromide also extends lifespan. Valproic acid
      treatment may modulate the insulin/IGF-1 growth factor signaling
      pathway, because VA promoted dauer larvae formation and DAF-16
      nuclear localization. To investigate the mechanism of action of VA
      in delaying aging, we analyzed the effects of combining VA with
      other compounds that extend the lifespan of C. elegans. Combined
      treatment of animals with VA and the heterocyclic anticonvulsant
      trimethadione caused a lifespan extension that was significantly
      greater than treatment with either of these drugs alone. These
      data suggest that the mechanism of action of VA is distinct from
      that of trimethadione, and demonstrate that lifespan-extending
      drugs can be combined to produce additive effects.<br>

      </b><br>
      The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of
      Minocycline in the life span, motor activity, and lipid
      peroxidation of Drosophila melanogaster treated with manganese.
      Two days after emerging from the pupa male wild-type D.
      melanogaster were fed for 13 days with corn media containing 15 mM
      manganese. Then, they were divided in six groups of 300 flies
      each: group (a) remained treated with manganese (Mn group); group
      (b) began treatment with Minocycline (0.05 mM) (Mn-Minocycline
      group); group (c) received no additional treatment (Mn-no
      treatment group); group (d) simultaneously fed with manganese and
      Minocycline (Mn+Minocycline group). Additionally, a control (group
      e) with no treatment and another group (f) fed only with
      Minocycline after emerging from the pupa were added. All the
      manganese treated flies (group a) were dead on the 25th day. The
      life span in group f (101.66±1.33 days, mean S.E.M.) and of group
      b (97.00±3.46 days) were similar, but in both cases it was
      significantly higher than in group e (68.33±1.76 days), group c
      (67.05±2.30 days) and in those of group d (37.33±0.88). Manganese
      (groups a and d) decreased motor activity in D. melanogaster. In
      the Minocycline fed flies (groups b and f) a higher motor activity
      was detected. In Mn-Minocycline and Mn+Minocycline treated flies a
      significant decrease of MDA levels was detected when compared to
      the Minocycline group indicating that Minocycline and Mn appear to
      have a synergistic effect. In conclusion, Minocycline increased
      the life span and motor activity and decreased MDA formation of
      manganese treated D. melanogaster, probably by an inhibition of
      the production of reactive oxygen species. Manganese also exerted
      an antioxidant effect as shown by the significant decrease of MDA
      levels when compared to control flies.<br>

      <br>
      Reduced dietary intake increases lifespan in a wide variety of
      organisms. It also retards disease progression. We tested whether
      dietary supplementation of citric acid cycle metabolites could
      mimic this lifespan effect. We report that oxaloacetate
      supplementation increased lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. The
      increase was dependent on the transcription factor, FOXO/DAF-16,
      and the energy sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase, indicating
      involvement of a pathway that is also required for lifespan
      extension through dietary restriction. These results demonstrate
      that supplementation of the citric acid cycle metabolite,
      oxaloacetate, influences a longevity pathway, and suggest a
      tractable means of introducing the health-related benefits of
      dietary restriction.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The level of acetylation of histones in nucleosomes is related to
      the longevity of yeast and animals. However, the mechanisms by
      which acetylation and deacetylation affect longevity remain
      unclear. In present study, we investigated the influence of
      histone acetylation modification on the expression of hsp22 gene
      and the lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster using histone
      deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA). The results
      showed that TSA could extend the lifespan of Drosophila
      melanogaster. Furthermore, TSA significantly promoted the hsp22
      gene transcription, and affected the chromatin morphology at the
      locus of hsp22 gene along the polytene chromosome. Present data
      implicate that TSA may affect the lifespan of Drosophila through
      changing the level of histone acetylation and influencing the
      expression of hsp22 gene that is related to aging.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) consumption has been traditionally
      related to a higher longevity in the human population. EVOO
      effects on health are often attributed to its unique mixture of
      phenolic compounds with tyrosol and hydroxityrosol being the most
      biologically active. Although these compounds have been
      extensively studied in terms of their antioxidant potential and
      its role in different pathologies, their actual connection with
      longevity remains unexplored. This study utilized the nematode
      Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the possible effects of
      tyrosol in metazoan longevity. Significant lifespan extension was
      observed at one specific tyrosol concentration, which also induced
      a higher resistance to thermal and oxidative stress and delayed
      the appearance of a biomarker of ageing. We also report that,
      although tyrosol was efficiently taken up by these nematodes, it
      did not induce changes in development, body length or
      reproduction. In addition, lifespan experiments with several
      mutant strains revealed that components of the heat shock response
      (HSF-1) and the insulin pathway (DAF-2 and DAF-16) might be
      implicated in mediating tyrosol effects in lifespan, while caloric
      restriction and sirtuins do not seem to mediate its effects.
      Together, our results point to hormesis as a possible mechanism to
      explain the effects of tyrosol on longevity in C. elegans.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      We have previously shown (Vaiserman A. M. et al., 2012) that the
      dietary supplementation with histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium
      butyrate (SB) throughout adult stage or both pre-adult and adult
      stages results in increase of life span (LS) in Drosophila
      melanogaster. It was suggested that because of the impact of SB on
      epigenetic control of gene function and therefore possibility of
      long-term effects, SB supplementation during the larval stage of
      development only may also increase adult LS. The present study was
      carried out to verify that assumption. The nutritional
      supplementation with SB during the larval stage at the
      concentration of 20 mmol/l resulted in a significant increase in
      the male mean LS; maximum LS was significantly increased in males
      treated with SB at concentrations of 10, 20 and 40 mmol/l. Female
      mean LS was unchanged following the SB administration; maximum LS
      was significantly increased in female group treated with SB at
      concentration of 10 mmol/l only. Female reproductive activity was
      the same in all groups. To test the hypothesis that the observed
      long-term effect of SB exposure on the flies' longevity could be
      caused by the induction of persistent epigenetic changes, the
      levels of expression of the longevity-associated genes (hsp70,
      sir2 and InR) were determined. The expression level of sir2 gene,
      known to mediate longevity in the fly through a pathway related to
      calorie restriction, in the group treated at the larval stage with
      20 mmol/l SB was significantly higher after the stress
      (starvation) than in the control group.<br>

      Rapamycin was found to increase (11% to 16%) the lifespan of male
      and female C57BL/6J mice most likely by reducing the increase in
      the hazard for mortality (i.e., the rate of aging) term in the
      Gompertz mortality analysis. To identify the pathways that could
      be responsible for rapamycin's longevity effect, we analyzed the
      transcriptome of liver from 25-month-old male and female mice fed
      rapamycin starting at 4 months of age. Few changes (&lt;300
      transcripts) were observed in transcriptome of rapamycin-fed
      males; however, a large number of transcripts (&gt;4,500) changed
      significantly in females. Using multidimensional scaling and
      heatmap analyses, the male mice fed rapamycin were found to
      segregate into two groups: one group that is almost identical to
      control males (Rapa-1) and a second group (Rapa-2) that shows a
      change in gene expression (&gt;4,000 transcripts) with more than
      60% of the genes shared with female mice fed Rapa. Using ingenuity
      pathway analysis, 13 pathways were significantly altered in both
      Rapa-2 males and rapamycin-fed females with mitochondrial function
      as the most significantly changed pathway. Our findings show that
      rapamycin has a major effect on the transcriptome and point to
      several pathways that would likely impact the longevity. <br>

      </b><br>
      Recent advances in aging research have uncovered genes and genetic
      pathways that influence lifespan in such diverse organisms as
      yeast, nematodes, flies, and mice. The discovery of genes and
      drugs that affect lifespan has been delayed by the absence of a
      phenotype other than survivorship, which depends on the
      measurement of age at death of individuals in a population. The
      use of survivorship to identify genetic and pharmacological
      interventions that prolong life is time-consuming and requires a
      large number of homogeneous animals. Here, we report the
      development of an assay in Drosophila melanogaster using the
      expression of molecular biomarkers that accelerates the ability to
      evaluate potential lifespan-altering interventions. Coupling the
      expression of an age-dependent molecular biomarker to a lethal
      toxin reduces the time needed to perform lifespan studies by 80%.
      The assay recapitulates the effect of the three best known
      environmental life-span-extending interventions in the fly:
      ambient temperature, reproductive status, and calorie reduction.
      Single gene mutations known to extend lifespan in the fly such as
      Indy and rpd3 also extend lifespan in this assay. We used this
      assay as a screen to identify drugs that extend lifespan in flies.
      Lipoic acid and resveratrol were identified as being beneficial in
      our assay and shown to extend lifespan under normal laboratory
      conditions. We propose that this assay can be used to screen
      pharmacological as well as genetic interventions more rapidly for
      positive effects on lifespan.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Recent progress in our understanding of genetic mechanisms of
      aging and longevity provides an opportunity to select some enzymes
      as targets for pharmacological correction. The phosphoinositide
      3-kinase (PI3K) and TOR-kinase cascades are affected in some
      long-lived mutants of different animals, such as nematodes and
      mice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
      geroprotector efficiency of the inhibitors of enzymes that are
      known to be affected in long-lived mutants. Experimental animals
      were exposed to low dozes of LY-294002 (5 microM), wortmannin (0.5
      microM), and rapamycin (0.5 microM) separately during their
      lifetimes. We have shown that the specific PI3K inhibitors
      (LY-294002 and wortmannin) and the TOR-kinase inhibitor rapamycin
      slightly increase the median and maximal lifespan of the fruit
      fly, Drosophila melanogaster.<br>

      </b><br>
      We used a heterogeneous stock of mice-UM-HET3, the first
      generation offspring of CByB6F1/J and C3D2F1/J parents-to test
      effects of six antiaging treatments on life span. In the first
      report of diet restriction in a structured, segregating
      heterogeneous population, we observed essentially the same
      increases in mean and maximum life span as found in CByB6F1/J
      hybrid positive controls. We also report results of treatment with
      N-acetyl-L-cysteine started at 7 months, and aspirin,
      nitroflurbiprofen, 4-hydroxy phenyl N-tert-butyl nitrone, and
      nordihydroguaiaretic acid, all started at 16-18 months. Only male
      UM-HET3 mice receiving N-acetyl-L-cysteine had significantly
      increased life span, and this may have been due to
      treatment-related inadvertent diet restriction. The other agents
      had no significant effects on life span. The use of UM-HET3 mice
      helps assure that these results are not the result of
      unresponsiveness of a single genotype but that they more broadly
      represent laboratory mice.<br>

      FIELD: pharmaceutical chemistry. <br>
      SUBSTANCE: group of inventions relate to isolation of biologically
      active substance from animal epiphysis and preparation of
      therapeutical agent for parenteral administration, which can be
      used in medicine as agent exhibiting geroprotector activity. This
      agent is made in the form of therapeutical agent for parenteral
      administration and represents peptide complex containing
      low-molecular weight polypeptide fraction between 70 and 90% with
      molecular weights of included peptide components within a range of
      70 to 212 Da and concentration of polypeptides 2.5-2.9 mg/mL. Such
      substance is obtained from epiphysis of calves at age no more than
      12 months and of porcine epiphysis via extraction with acetic acid
      in presence of zinc chloride. Preparation procedure involves in
      freezing epiphysis of calves at age no more than 12 months or
      porcine epiphysis at temperature not higher than -40 DEG C, kept
      at temperature from -20 to -22 DEG C over a period not less than
      two months, then ground, after which 3% acetic acid is added at
      volume ratio 1:5 at 20+-5 DEG C. Subsequent extraction is
      performed at continuous stirring until homogenous slurry is
      formed, to which 1% zinc chloride solution is added at volume
      ratio 50:1. Resulting mixture is cooled at continuous stirring to
      7-16 DEG C, then stirred for 48 h at a regime of 1 h stirring
      followed by 4 h settling. Extract is separated from ballast
      materials in separator, supplemented by acetone at volume ratio
      1:5, kept at 3-5 DEG C for 4 h to form homogenized precipitate,
      which is re-precipitated with acetone at least 2 times. Thus
      obtained precipitate containing active substance is rinsed on
      nutsch filter with two volumes of acetone cooled to 7-16 DEG C
      until light gray precipitate is obtained, which is forced through
      metallic riddle, dried, and dissolved in distilled water at
      ambient temperature and continuous stirring to concentration of
      polypeptides 2.5-2.9 mg/mL. Solution is centrifuged, filtered,
      subjected to ultrafiltration purification at back pressure no
      higher than 1 kg/cm2 through materials with retention capacity
      15000 Da. Ultrafiltrate is supplemented by glycin to its final
      concentration 10-20 mg/mL at pH=5.6-6.6, solution is subjected to
      sterilizing filtration under pressure at most 2.0 kg/cm2, poured
      into 2-mL ampoules and autoclaved for 8 min at 120 DEG C and
      atmospheric pressure 1.1 kg/cm2. Thus, impurities-free aqueous
      solution of extract with polypeptide concentration 2.5-2.9 mg/mL
      is obtained. Isolated substance differs from previously obtained
      substances isolated from animal epiphysis by molecular weight of
      peptide components. Substance is not toxic and manifests no
      antipyrogenic effects. <br>
      EFFECT: optimized isolation technology allowing not only
      preparation of impurities-free product but also increased yield
      thereof.<br>
