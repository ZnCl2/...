        The m-state spectral emissions signature was a broad, flat band
        rather than discrete lines.&nbsp; The test also showed a
        significant amount of calcium and magnesium, but no toxins were
        evident in well-washed material made from unpolluted ocean
        water.</blockquote>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Some people have ingested the
        m-state materials made by these methods. They suggest that
        benefits are most likely when dosage is kept small.</div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Three methods of making ORMUS are
        described in this document: the WET method, the DRY method, and
        the BOILING GOLD method. For the materials extracted by the wet
        and dry procedures, one teaspoon of material, morning and
        evening, has been found by them to be not harmful over several
        weeks' time. A much smaller dose, on the order of a few drops a
        day, would be more appropriate for the material produced by the
        boiling gold method. We believe that the m-state may be
        homeopathic, so a much smaller dose may be the safest -- such as
        1/64 teaspoon diluted in one quart of pure water, taken two or
        three ounces once or twice a day.</div>

    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">All three methods use a chemical
        lab technique called "measuring pH."&nbsp; The pH of a solution
        is a measure of its acid/base ratio. You may remember testing pH
        with litmus paper in high school. pH values less than pH 7
        indicate an acid, like distilled white vinegar.&nbsp; pH 7 is
        neutral, like pure water.&nbsp; Greater than pH 7 is alkaline,
        like lye.</div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">ORMUS precipitates between pH 8.5
        and 10.78.</div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The WET method produces the least
        "effective" material but is relatively simple to perform.</div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Here is the basic WET method in

        Red Devil Lye, is not as pure and uncontaminated as laboratory
        or food-grade lye.&nbsp; We strongly recommend that laboratory
        or food grade sodium hydroxide be used if the m-state is
        intended for ingestion since grocery store lye may contain
        dangerous contaminants.&nbsp; Note: Virtually no lye will be
        present in the final product so it will be safe to ingest.&nbsp;
        In any case, lye is not toxic, and it is not caustic when
        sufficiently diluted (as in these methods).</div>

        acid).&nbsp; We will use the term "HCl" in this document rather
        than "hydrochloric acid" or "muriatic acid" since it is
        shorter.&nbsp; You can use muriatic acid (31% HCl) from a
        hardware store, but laboratory, electronic or food-grade HCl is
        less likely to be contaminated.&nbsp; We strongly recommend that
        laboratory, electronic or food grade hydrocholoric acid be used
        if the m-state is intended for ingestion since muriatic acid
        from a hardware store may contain dangerous contaminants.&nbsp;

    </blockquote>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <blockquote>Some experimenters say not to rely on a pH meter
        because its readings vary with temperature and ionization.&nbsp;
        Also, a meter costs much more than pH paper.&nbsp; Many pH meter
        probes can be damaged by very strong acids or alkalis.&nbsp; But
        some say that a pH meter is essential, for these reasons:
        <p>pH paper cannot track rapid changes in pH. <br>
          pH paper does not resolve pH readings finely enough.&nbsp;
          It's hard to tell the difference between pH 9.5, 10.0, and
          11.5. <br>
          pH meters are best used to get accurate readings between pH
          8.5 and 10.78, which is the main range of concern in these
          methods. <br>
          pH meters can spot check any reading with a standard buffer

    <blockquote>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The following problems have been
        encountered by some folks who have made m-state for consumption:</div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Some people have gotten quite sick
        from consuming m-state made from sea water collected at a
        marina.&nbsp; This water contained high levels of lead and other
        contaminants.</div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Other people have gotten quite
        sick from consuming m-state materials which were made
        improperly.&nbsp; These materials were made without the use of
        pH test paper or meters and the resulting material contained
        toxic metals.&nbsp; Please remember that old pH paper can become
        inaccurate. People have gotten sick from consuming m-state
        materials which contained bacteria because they were not
        sterilized or stored properly.</div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">It is possible to bring the pH of
        your source material up too quickly, especially if you use lye
        in too high a concentration.&nbsp; This could result in local
        areas of very high pH within your solution.&nbsp; These high pH
        areas could allow toxic metals to precipitate and mix with your
        desired precipitate. M-state platinum might be considered toxic
        by some since it makes you quite ill if you consume
        alcohol.&nbsp; No one has reported this effect from consuming
        m-state from sea water.</div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Some people have used
        Teflon-coated aluminum sauce pans for heating lye or lye
        water.&nbsp; The Teflon got scratched and the aluminum started
        dissolving in the lye water producing hydrogen gas which could
        have exploded.&nbsp; The liquid was contaminated with aluminum
        which is a poison.</div>
      <br>
      &nbsp;
      <center>
        <h4 style="text-align: center; margin-left: 40px;">AVOIDING
          PROBLEMS</h4>
      </center>
      <div style="font-weight: normal; margin-left: 40px;">Use sea
        water, reconstituted sea water made from sea salt or Dead Sea
        salt, or salt lake water.&nbsp; In general, start with a clean
        and deep source of water.&nbsp; Some people have gone out to sea
        in boats to collect sea water from 100 feet deep.</div>
      <div style="font-weight: normal; margin-left: 40px;">Generally
        avoid water that has lead, arsenic or other toxic elements in
        it.&nbsp; Start with water that is drinkable except for salt
        content. Conduct an elemental and toxic analysis of questionable
        starting-material sources (such as seawater collected close to
        the shore, or near sources of industrial waste runoff).</div>
      <div style="font-weight: normal; margin-left: 40px;">Boiling in
        lye water kills bacteria but it does not destroy toxic metals or
        chemicals in your source water. Follow these instructions and
        slowly change the pH of your solution.</div>
      <div style="font-weight: normal; margin-left: 40px;">Avoid water
        with sulfur or sulfates in it because such water produces little
        or no m-state precipitate.</div>
      <div style="font-weight: normal; margin-left: 40px;">Never use
        aluminum containers or utensils because aluminum will react with
        acids like HCl and alkalis like lye, and could poison you.</div>

      <blockquote>Please read CAUTION!! and WARNING!! before proceeding.
        <p>First you need to prepare a dilute lye solution.&nbsp; Label
          an eyedropper bottle or squirt bottle "Lye-poison" so the
          bottle will not confused with something else.&nbsp; Work in a
          sink so that any spills will be contained.&nbsp; Lye gives off
          eye-stinging fumes when mixed with water.&nbsp; To avoid
          inhaling fumes, hold your breath and wear goggles while doing
          the following procedure. </p>
        <p>Working over a sink, put 8 teaspoons of distilled water in a
          sturdy glass then stir in 1 teaspoon of lye.&nbsp; Stir until
          the lye is dissolved.&nbsp; Heat will be generated as the lye
          dissolves and the glass may get fairly hot.&nbsp; You may want
          to close your eyes to avoid eye-stinging fumes, taking a peek
          periodically. </p>
        <p>Pour the lye solution into a labeled eyedropper bottle or
          squirt bottle. </p>
        <p>If you are using pH paper, tear off several 1/4" pieces and
          put them on a piece of white paper on a plate. </p>
        <p>For the best accuracy, recalibrate the pH paper throughout
          the day with changes in temperature and humidity, as well as
          day-to-day.&nbsp; Buffer solutions of pH 4, 7 and 10 will help
          with this.&nbsp; Sources of pH buffer solutions are listed
          near the end of this document under LAB SUPPLIES. </p>
        <p>If you are using dried sea minerals, mix 1/2 cup of dry
          material with 2 cups of distilled water.&nbsp; This makes sea
          water.&nbsp; Now proceed as described below:</p>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <ul>
      1. First, you might want to pour the sea water through a coffee
      filter to remove any scum.
      <p>2. If the starting material does not contain magnesium
        hydroxide (sea water does contain magnesium hydroxide), add
        some, or add a teaspoon of Epsom salts per gallon of water. </p>
      <p>3. Pour the sea water into a stainless steel pot. Slowly,
        drop-by-drop, add the lye solution WHILE STIRRING. Every ten
        drops or so, test the pH. You might want to take at least 3 to 5
        samples from different regions of the liquid. If you are using
        pH paper, the goal is to bring the pH up to 9.5, then stop to be
        on the safe side. If you are using a pH meter, stop just before
        you get to pH 10.78. </p>
      <p>A white precipitate which includes m-state elements will form.
      </p>
      <p>CAUTION: You must proceed slowly and patiently so that you do
        not exceed pH 10.78 with a meter or pH 9.5 with pH paper. If you
        go higher than pH 10.78, you might get a "Gilcrest precipitate"
        of toxic heavy metals. It is alleged that the Dead Sea salt
        water does not produce any Gilcrest precipitate. This has not
        been proven and should not be assumed. </p>
      <p>4. Once you are at the correct pH, stop. </p>
      <p>5. Pour the solution into a clean glass jar or test tube. </p>
      <p>6. The white precipitate (slurry) slowly settles on the bottom
        of the jar. Let the slurry settle overnight. If metals or other
        toxins have been ruled out by prior testing of your starting
        material, the slurry is probably mostly calcium hydroxide,
        Mg(OH)2, lye, and a small amount of m-state. </p>
      <p>You can speed this settling process with a centrifuge, which
        forces the precipitate to settle rapidly. Inexpensive
        second-hand centrifuges may be found at American Science and
        Surplus, http://www.sciplus.com/. </p>
      <p>7. Using a large syringe (or siphon), remove the liquid above
        the slurry. </p>
      <p>8. Add distilled water to the precipitate (filling the jar),
        stir thoroughly, and let it settle again for at least 4 to 5
        hours, preferably overnight. </p>
      <p>9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 at least three times to thoroughly wash
        the precipitate. This should remove almost all of the lye. The
        remaining lye can be neutralized with HCl or distilled white
        vinegar as well. Washing three times is intended to reduce the
        dissolved "impurities" (like salt, for example) by 87.5%. Four
        washes would provide a 93.75% reduction, five washes a 96.875%
        reduction, and so on. </p>
      <p>At this point, the precipitate is likely to contain some
        m-state, milk of magnesia Mg(OH)2, calcium, and perhaps some
        impurities. </p>
      <p>Pour the precipitate and water into a stainless steel pot on a
        stove burner. A gas burner is preferred over electric because
        any magnetic fields from the electric burner may drive off some
        of the m-state material. Cover the pot with a lid to contain the
        m-state, and boil the solution for 5 minutes to sterilize it. Be
        careful not to spill the hot solution! Let it cool back to room
        temperature and recheck the pH to make sure it hasn't exceeded
        pH 9. <br>

        <h4>DISCUSSION: WHEN TO BOIL THE SOLUTION</h4>
      </center>
      In this document, we suggested that you not boil the solution
      until you have made the washed precipitate. However, boiling can
      be done earlier in the procedure with certain advantages. Here are
      four times that boiling could be done, with a discussion of the
      pros and cons of each:
      <p>1. Boil before adding lye solution. </p>
      <p>PROS: Faster reaction, faster precipitation. CONS: You may
        spill the hot lye solution. You may inhale fumes. </p>
      <p>2. Boil while adding lye solution. </p>
      <p>PROS: Faster reaction, faster precipitation. CONS: You may
        spill the hot lye solution. You may inhale fumes. Danger of lye
        spurting out of pot. Not recommended. </p>
      <p>3. Boil and cool after adding lye solution. </p>
      <p>PROS: No danger of inhaling fumes. Little danger of spilling
        hot lye solution. CONS: Slower reaction, slower precipitation. </p>
      <p>4. Boil the washed precipitate (recommended). </p>
      <p>PROS: No danger of inhaling fumes. No danger of spilling hot
        lye solution. pH is unlikely to change after boiling because the
        reaction has already taken place. CONS: Slower reaction, slower
        precipitation. If safety is the main issue, this seems to be the
        best method. </p>
      <p><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">Caution:</font></font> If
        you boil the solution on an electric burner, the magnetic field
        in the burner may "blow off" some of the m-state materials,
        resulting in a small yield. This can be minimized by adding a
        source of sodium (such as sodium hydroxide or salt) to the
        solution before boiling. </p>
      <p>Since sea water contains sodium in salt, none of the boiling
        methods will be a problem with sea water. However, if you are
        starting with low-sodium fresh water, add a sodium source (such
        as table salt or lye solution) before boiling. </p>
      <p>Once the precipitate and water have been sterilized, the next
        step is required to concentrate the m-state. </p>

      </center>
      The precipitate made from sea water contains milk of magnesia
      (Mg(OH)2), which precipitates approximately around the same pH
      range that m-state does.
      <p>Here are four methods to separate Mg(OH)2 from m-state:</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <center>
        <h4><a name="METHOD 1"></a>METHOD 1</h4>
      </center>
      1. Suppose you just made a precipitate by adding lye solution to
      sea water.&nbsp; The precipitate is m-state mixed with Mg(OH)2.
      <p>2. Use a syringe to remove the liquid over the precipitate, and
        discard the liquid.&nbsp; This leaves only the m-state/Mg(OH)2
        precipitate. </p>
      <p>3. To the wet precipitate, add hydrochloric acid (HCl) until
        you reduce the pH to 1.0 - 3.5.&nbsp; You can use muriatic acid
        (31% HCl) from a hardware store, but lab-grade HCl is less
        likely to be contaminated. A safe alternative to HCl is
        distilled white vinegar. </p>
      <p>4. The white colloidal precipitate should dissolve, leaving a
        clear solution. </p>
      <p>5. Add lye solution VERY SLOWLY drop-by-drop to bring the pH
        back up to 8.5 - 8.7.&nbsp; The precipitate that forms should be
        m-state mostly free of Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> (because m-state
        precipitates in this pH range, and Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> does not
        precipitate until pH 9.) </p>
      <p>Note that your total yield may be diminished because you are
        not going past pH 8.7. </p>
      <p>6. Remove the liquid above the precipitate, and wash the
        precipitate.&nbsp; It should be mostly m-state. </p>
      <center>
        <h4><a name="METHOD 2"></a>METHOD 2</h4>
      </center>
      This procedure removes the Mg(OH)2 by dissolving it below pH 9.
      First get some HCl (or muriatic acid) and coffee filters. A safer
      alternative to HCl is distilled white vinegar.
      <p>1. Dry the precipitate in a dark oven at about 275 degrees F
        for one or two hours.&nbsp; This forms a dry powder. </p>
      <p>2. Take the dry powder and pulverize out any clumps. </p>
      <p>3. In a glass container, cover the powder with some distilled
        water.&nbsp; For example, one liter of water for one cup of
        powder. </p>
      <p>4. Add HCl or distilled white vinegar drop-by-drop to bring the
        pH to 5 or 6. </p>
      <p>5. Shake the bottle and let it sit overnight.&nbsp; The dried
        m-state should not dissolve at that pH, but the Mg(OH)2 should
        dissolve. </p>
      <p>6. The next day, after all the Mg(OH)2 has dissolved, pour
        everything into filter paper. </p>
      <p>7. Wash the powder collected in the filter paper several times
        with distilled water to remove any residual traces of HCl or
        vinegar. </p>
      <p>8. The washed powder may be oven-dried again at about 275
        degrees F, and you should have m-state powder free of Mg(OH)2. </p>
      <center>
        <h4><a name="METHOD 3"></a>METHOD 3</h4>
      </center>
      1. Dry the original precipitate at about 200 degrees F.
      <p>2. Mix the resulting powder with distilled white vinegar or 30%
        HCl. Everything which does not dissolve in m-state. This will be
        quite a small amount if you start with sea water. (If you mix
        pure HCl with distilled water, remember: ADD ACID TO WATER,
        NEVER ADD WATER TO ACID). </p>
      <p>3. Measure the amount of HCl/m-state solution (or
        vinegar/m-state solution). </p>
      <p>4. Add distilled water to the HCl/m-state solution. Add an
        amount of water that is at least ten times the amount of
        HCl/m-state solution. (You may substitute distilled white
        vinegar for HCl). </p>
      <p>5. Filter the solution through 5 layers of coffee filters. </p>
      <p>6. Wash the powder at least three times in a large amount of
        distilled water. </p>
      <center>
        <h4><a name="METHOD 4"></a>METHOD 4</h4>
      </center>
      1. Starting with clean wet precipitate, add lye to bring the pH up
      to 12.&nbsp; The m-state precipitate will dissolve, but magnesium
      hydroxide and the Gilcrest precipitate will not.
      <p>2. Filter out the precipitate. </p>
      <p>3. To the remaining liquid containing only m-state, add HCl or
        distilled white vinegar drop-by-drop until the pH reaches 8.5. </p>
      <p>4. Add lye solution drop-by-drop to bring the pH back up to
        10.78.&nbsp; The resulting precipitate should be only m-state. </p>
      <p>5. Wash the precipitate as described earlier. </p>
      <p>6. To be safe, check the pH of the precipitate slurry. It
        should be 9 or less before ingesting.</p>

      Please read CAUTION!! and WARNING!! before proceeding.
      <p>This method takes longer than the WET method. In some cases, it
        involves boiling lye for several hours, which may spray some
        caustic solution around your work area.&nbsp; Please wear
        neoprene gloves, a PVC lab apron, and eye goggles when you use
        this method.&nbsp; Sources for this safety clothing are listed

      <p>Some people have reported adverse reactions to the WET method
        precipitate or powder. This may be due to the Gilcrest
        precipitates which occur above pH 11.5. The DRY method removes

      1. Start with a pint and a quart container for cottage cheese.
      Make sure the pint container will fit into the quart container.
      The pint container should hang inside the lip of the quart

        <h4><a name="DRY-METHOD PROCEDURE"></a>DRY-METHOD PROCEDURE</h4>
      </center>
      Please read CAUTION!! and WARNING!! before proceeding.
      <p>First you need to prepare a dilute lye solution.&nbsp; Label an
        eyedropper bottle or squirt bottle "Lye-poison" so the bottle
        will not confused with something else.&nbsp; Work in a sink so
        that any spills will be contained.&nbsp; Lye gives off
        eye-stinging fumes when mixed with water.&nbsp; To avoid
        inhaling fumes, hold your breath and wear goggles while doing
        the following procedure. </p>
      <p>Working over a sink, put 8 teaspoons of distilled water in a
        sturdy glass then stir in 1 teaspoon of lye.&nbsp; Stir until
        the lye is dissolved.&nbsp; Heat will be generated as the lye
        dissolves and the glass may get fairly hot.&nbsp; You may want
        to close your eyes to avoid eye-stinging fumes, taking a peek
        periodically. </p>
      <p>Pour the lye solution into a labeled eyedropper bottle or
        squirt bottle. </p>
      <p>If you are using pH paper, tear off several 1/4" pieces and put
        them on a piece of white paper on a plate (as illustrated
        above).&nbsp; Now proceed as described below:</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      1. Grind the starting material to a fine powder.
      <p>2. Add 1:4 lye solution to cover the dry material with a thin
        layer. </p>
      <p>3. Stir in some distilled water to cover the powder and lye by
        2 inches. </p>
      <p>4. Bring to a boil (this is best done outdoors or in an exhaust
        hood).&nbsp; The pH should be at or slightly above 12.&nbsp; The
        lye brings the m-state elements into solution while leaving the
        Gilcrest precipitates as solids. </p>
      <p>NOTE: If you start with sea salt, you can omit the boiling step
        with its noxious fumes, and simply let the solution sit for
        three days. Then go directly to Step 7. (Some other starting
        materials might also react without boiling). </p>
      <p>5. If you are boiling the solution, replace water as needed to
        maintain sufficient reactant volume. </p>
      <p>6. Boil for several hours -- the longer the better -- in a
        closed container.&nbsp; The container may be open if you add
        liquid as needed.&nbsp; Four hours should be sufficient for
        Etherium/Isis material. </p>
      <p>7. Strain the slurry through 3 to 5 layers of coffee filters.
        You are removing the toxic elements (Gilcrest precipitate) that
        precipitate above pH 11.5. </p>
      <p>Save the liquid that passes through the filters.&nbsp; Most
        m-state present will be in solution in the liquid. </p>
      <p>8. While stirring the liquid, slowly add HCl or distilled white
        vinegar to bring the pH down to 8.5.&nbsp; A white precipitate
        forms which is partly m-state. </p>
      <p>If you go too far, the pH will abruptly shift, and you will
        have to start over.&nbsp; If this happens you must add lye
        quickly and bring the pH back up to 12. </p>
      <p>9. Let the precipitate settle overnight. </p>
      <p>10. Using a large syringe (or a siphon), remove the liquid
        above the slurry. </p>
      <p>11. Add distilled water to the precipitate (filling the jar),
        stir thoroughly, and let it settle again for at least 4 to 5
        hours, preferably overnight. </p>
      <p>12. Repeat steps 10 and 11 at least three times to thoroughly
        wash the precipitate.&nbsp; This removes most traces of lye and
        HCl (or vinegar). </p>
      <p>You'll get a wet, white precipitate (slurry) containing m-state
        elements.&nbsp; Check that the pH is 9 or less before
        ingesting.&nbsp; Some of the precipitate may be milk of magnesia
        or calcium.&nbsp; If you wish, you can remove them using the
        precipitate purification procedures described above.</p>

      Coffee filters from a grocery store.
      <p>Hydrochloric acid (HCl).&nbsp; You can use muriatic acid (31%
        HCl) from a hardware store, but lab-grade HCl is less likely to
        be contaminated. Instead of HCl, you might prefer to use
        distilled white vinegar (acetic acid). Distilled white vinegar
        is weaker than HCl but is safer to use. </p>
      <p>A stainless steel pot or glass pot will work, but stainless
        steel and glass are attacked by NaOH. Glass is preferred over
        stainless steel. </p>
      <p>A preferred container is a sealed Teflon® or HDPE bottle in a
        water bath in a crock pot.&nbsp; Please note that a Teflon®
        bottle is NOT the same as a Teflon® coated aluminum
        container.&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">Never use aluminum or
          Teflon® coated aluminum containers and utensils because
          aluminum will react with acids like HCl and alkalis like lye,
          and will poison you.</font> </p>
      <p>If you use a sealed Teflon® or HDPE bottle in a water bath fill
        it only half full with your lye and gold then squeeze the bottle
        to eliminate most of the air above the liquid before you tighten
        the cap.&nbsp; This will allow the bottle to expand as the
        liquid is heated.</p>

        <h4><a name="M-STATE STORAGE"></a>M-STATE STORAGE</h4>
      </center>
      Store m-state materials in
      <p>* Glass mason jars with wire-clamped glass lids and rubber
        gaskets <br>
        * Glass jars with plastic lids, or <br>
        * HDPE containers, which are stable in acid and alkali </p>
      <p>Store m-state materials in the dark away from sunlight or
        ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet&nbsp; light seems to move some
        m-state materials toward a metallic state. </p>
      <p>Because m-state materials are superconductors, they should be
        stored in glass or HDPE containers inside of steel containers
        and away from moving magnetic fields. Put the glass or HDPE
        container (containing m-state) inside a steel tin such as those
        used for Christmas cookies, gourmet popcorn or potato chips. If
        you intend to transport m-state materials, it is best to nest
        three or four steel containers, one inside the other with
        insulating material between, and place the glass or HDPE
        container inside the inmost steel container. </p>
      <p>You may notice that your m-state materials have bubbles rising
        from them for a period of time after they are made.&nbsp; We
        believe that these bubbles are m-state gas escaping.&nbsp; Some
        people have reported that the m-state precipitate loses some of
        its effect as these bubbles leave.&nbsp; This off-gassing seems
        to be reduced if the m-state is stored between room temperature
        and body temperature in a magnetically shielded container.&nbsp;
        It is advisable not to refrigerate m-state materials.&nbsp; At
        least one researcher reports that refrigerated m-state materials
        are likely to move toward a warmer place. </p>
      <p>Since bacteria and mold can easily grow in m-state precipitate,
        it is best to sterilize any material which you wish to store for
        long periods of time and to store it using water bath canning
        methods.</p>

            invention entitled <i>Non-Metallic, Monoatomic Forms of
              Transitional Elements. (Document No. AU-A-36624/89). </i>This




            document is based on a US patent application numbered
            209,297, dated 21st June 1988 and 7th June 1988. The US
            application was not granted, and thus the inventor did not

          <p><font size="-0">The procedure as published in the patent is
              said to convert the element gold from its normal metallic
              state to a newly discovered state, described by its
              inventor, David R. Hudson of Laveen Arizona, as an
              orbitally re-arranged monoatomic state, in which the
              element assumes various new properties. These are
              described as catalytic activity, special magnetic
              properties, resistance to sintering at high temperatures,
              and resistance to cyanide and aqua regia attack.</font> </p>
          <p><font size="-0">Hudson appears to have first discussed his
              work in a public scientific forum at the 1st Conference on
              Low-Energy Transmutation, Texas A&amp;M University, June
              19, 1995. This presentation was reported in <i>Infinite

            <br>
            <font size="-0">Hudson has been doing intensive experiments
              with gold, nickel, and copper. He has been able to
              demonstrate that some elements can be made "invisible" to
              most chemical measurements and then restored so that the
              elements are measurable. Huson showed copies of several
              articles, mainly from peer-reviewed literature and
              textbooks to indicate that there are some strange results
              that differ markedly from from standard accepted
              chemistry. For example, Hudson shows that when certain
              elements are reduced from metals (large arrays of atoms)
              to states where only a few atoms are clustered, then the
              normal metallic behavior of these elements is drastically
              changed. These experimental results are being investigated
              by other researchers working in the nano-materials area.
              Hudson says to get a metal out of the metallic cluster
              give the element something that it wants more than it
              wants itself. Two such separation elements are lithium and
              sodium."</font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <center><b><font size="-0">ORME Experiments (1996-1998)</font></b></center>
        <p>The process consists of dissolving an amount of metallic gold
          in aqua regia (a mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric
          acid), performing a number of boildowns to dry salts, plus two
          neutralisation procedures using sodium hydroxide. The
          neutralisation procedure at step 9 is described as taking
          anything up to 3 days. A peristaltic pump head was fitted with
          a stepper motor controller, allowing this process to be
          automated by a program which takes information from the pH
          meter and operates the pump as required. </p>
        <p>The outcome of experiments conducted during 1997 and 1998 was
          that black precipitate invariably forms at step 10, an
          indication that the prior steps are not being carried out
          correctly. A reading of the patent suggests that two
          prerequisites (at least) are required for the process to
          succeed. The gold must be properly dissolved to as small a
          particle size as possible, and the neutralisation procedure at
          step 9 must be done extremely carefully. The major difference
          to these experiments, and those carried out by Parrish
          Chamberlain, is that (apart from the ineptitude of the
          experimenter) the gold used is refined gold obtained from a
          commercial source. Whether this has any effect on the process
          is not known. </p>
        <p>Step 1 of the process states that the metallic gold is to be
          dispersed in aqua regia. An informant suggested that the gold
          is required to be initially left in solution for at least a
          month in order to effect a greater reduction in particle size.
          This procedure was therefore carried out, however black
          precipitates were again obtained at step 10. </p>
        <p>It was noticed that when left for a long period, the gold
          chloride in solution tends to concentrate at the bottom of the
          bottle, perhaps hindering further dissolution of the
          particles. The suggestion was put forward that keeping the
          solution hot would help aid digestion. A flask and condenser
          were therefore obtained and the solution left at approximately
          90 degrees centigrade for several weeks This procedure however
          met with failure. The hot aqua regia solution was found to
          severely etch the glassware. Solutions taken from the flask
          produced a white insoluble precipitate at the bottom of the
          beaker upon boildown. This precipitate is assumed to be a
          silicate material formed by a reaction between the aqua regia
          and the glassware. The flask and solutions were therefore
          discarded and attempts to carry out hot digestion abandoned. <br>
          <font size="-2">&lt;&gt;</font>In order to carry out what is
          surmised to be the proper digestion the current method is to
          place the flasks containing the solutions on magnetic
          stirrers. Each flask contains two litres of aqua regia with
          500 mg of gold. An FEP tube attached to the top of the flask
          allows ventilation to prevent pressure buildup in the flask.
          After one month on the stirrer, the contents of the flask are
          reduced to a dry salt as per step 1, fresh aqua regia added,
          and placed on the stirrer for another month. Whether this
          procedure is excessive or not is unknown, however&nbsp; the
          salts obtained after boildowns using these solutions are
          noticably less clumpy in appearance. </p>

        <p>The above record indicates the most serious problem in
          manually performing these experiments on a part-time basis.
          That is, it is difficult to keep watch on the process
          sufficiently in order to avoid boiling the solutions dry at
          the critical moment. The boildown operations are numerous,
          slow, tedious and prone to failure caused by the the tendency
          of the experimenter to fall asleep. It was therefore felt
          necessary to automate this part of this process. </p>
        <p>Prior to Expt #21, an error was discovered in the make-up of
          the 6N HCl used in prior experiments. This was previously
          assumed to be 3 parts H<sub>2</sub>O to 1 part 37% HCl. This
          is incorrect, the value now used is 4 parts H<sub>2</sub>O to
          6 parts 37% HCl. </p>

        <p><font size="-0">The following is a description of experiments
            carried out during May-June 1996 by a student food analyst
            at a commercial analytical laboratory. The firm prefers not
            to have its name associated with the subject. The procedure
            was carried out twice, and reported to the moderated
            internet forum (http://zz.com/WhiteGoldWeb/wgfaq.htm)</font>
        </p>
        <p><font size="-0">1. Using a Sartorious electronic balance
            exactly 0.0500 g (50 mg) of pure metallic gold were weighed
            into a 400 ml tall beaker.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">2. 50 ml of aqua regia were added and the
            beaker placed on a hot plate to start the reaction. Once the
            reaction started the beaker was removed and the gold allowed
            to dissolve. (50 ml of acid only were added because this is
            sufficient enough to dissolve the small amount of gold).</font>
        </p>
        <p><font size="-0">3. The solution was boiled down to approx 5
            ml and some saturated gold chloride crystals</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">began to form. 60 ml of hydrochloric acid
            were added, then the solution boiled down to 5ml.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">4. Steps three was repeated twice more. This
            time the acids were allowed to evaporate off until a dry
            solid was obtained (being careful not to scorch). Steps 2, 3
            and 4 were repeated once more.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">5. To this solid 150 ml of 6M HCl were added
            and allowed to boil down to 10ml, then two more lots of 6 M
            HCl were added and boiled down to 10 ml. (If brown fumes are
            still visible when boiling it may be necessary to continue
            adding the 6M acid, this drives of any NO2 fumes and excess
            nitric acid). The last treatment was allowed to boil dry and
            at this stage an orange-red coloured crystal was acquired
            with a tinge of luminescent green. (This indicated to be
            gold chloride or chloroauric acid)</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">6. A solution of sodium chloride in distilled
            water was then prepared. 0.3 g AR NaCl was used in 300 ml of
            water. (0.3g NaCl = 20 mole of Na to 1 mole Au). This
            solution was added to the dried crystals and allowed to sit
            for about two hours so that the reaction from gold chloride
            to sodium aurochloride could be completed. (This reaction is
            not noticable).</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">7. The solution is evaporated down to dry
            salts and then 200 ml of distilled water is added, the
            solution was then boiled down again and 150 ml of 6 M HCl is
            added and boiled down again to dry solids.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">8. 300 ml of distilled water is added to the
            solids and allowed to sit for 30 minutes so that hydration
            of the salt can occur.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">9. Using an ORION 720A electrode junction pH
            meter and a stirring plate the pH of the solution was
            adjusted slowly using 0.5 N NaOH until it reached exactly pH
            7.000 and allowed to continue stirring. The pH gradually
            drops due to molecular displacement. When the pH was
            stabilised 0.5 NaOH was again added drop by drop until the
            pH of the solution was at 7.000. This process was continued
            until the pH was stable at 7.000. This entire process takes
            about 6 hours and then the solution is left overnight.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font size="-0">10. The solution was then boiled down to
            approx. 10 ml and 10 ml of AR HNO<sub>3</sub> was</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">added, the result was clustered luminescent
            white crystals thus the production of sodium auro nitrate.
            The solution is allowed to boil until the crystals are dry.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font size="-0">11. Step 10 was repeated.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">12. 10 ml of distilled water was added to
            remove excess HNO<sub>3</sub> from the crystals, this was
            repeated until no brown fumes were evident.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">13. Again the pH is adjusted to pH 7.00 and
            NaAu should result as NO<sub>3</sub> dissociates to form HNO<sub>3</sub>
            in the solution. After about 10 mins a cloudy white
            precipitate forms in the solution.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">14. A 45 micron bacteriological filter was
            used to filter off the solution, no dark precipitates were
            noticable.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">15. The filter paper was transferred into a
            vacuum oven with a 25 kpa(g) at 120 degrees Centigrade for
            two hours. The result was a light/medium grey coloured
            solid.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">16. A device was constructed to anneal the
            solid. This consisted of a piece of 4" dia. mild steel tube
            x 5" long. A plate was welded across one end to form a base,
            and an inlet tube welded to the base. Another plate, with a
            1/8" bleeder hole, was used to form the top, held in place
            with a weight. A bottle of standard welding argon was
            connected to the inlet tube and turned on. The device was
            placed on a gas camping stove and heated until a temperature
            over 300 degrees Centigrade was indicated by the melting of
            a lead mass. The solid was placed inside on a crucible and
            heated with constantly flowing argon for two hours. The
            solid was then dark grey in color.</font> </p>

        <p><font size="-0">The sample was placed into aqua regia and did

            becomes white thus indicating that the HAu is in the grey
            form attracting oxygen from the air and bonding to the
            hydrogen, the addition of the acid removes the oxygen and
            changes the solids property.</font> </p>

        <p><font size="-0">I would like to thank James for posting the
            following. Here is where one can find mistakes that are
            common in laboratory procedures. This is not to be negative
            to Mr. Chamberlain, but two fundimental errors challenge the
            hours of work that he put into this experiment. In an
            attempt not to bore the members of the forum(s), I will
            attempt to explain in a non-technical script.&nbsp; When one
            attempts an experiment, they must consider all possible
            errors. It is quite obvious when you examine the detailed
            work of Mr. Chamberlain he failed to account for standard
            contamication of acids and distilled water. Yes, he had a
            material that was present, it was converted to a white
            material that would not dissolve in aqua regia. This
            material could be numerous things, but not gold.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">Where is the gold? The gold was in the
            solution that was filtered off in step 14. The problem with
            such tests is you must establish a baseline. That is
            accomplish the entire procedure by heating, adding, boiling
            without the gold. Record these results and you have a basis
            for contamination of chemicals. Then accomplish the
            experiment. Also, if you look at the total quanitity of
            liquids and the fact that he only started with 50 milligrams
            of gold, all types of errors could be present. The white
            powder was probably a calcium compound. By the exactness of
            his report, this would be the most logical. Also, calcium is
            a normal contaminate of many acids and distilled water. I
            ran this buy a couple of mr cronies and they agree, that
            even though enormous efforts were spent on this experiment,
            there is nothing that would indicate anything out of the
            realm.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">Now if Mr. Chamberlain would of distilled the
            remaining liquid that he discarded and there was nothing but
            NaOH, it would be a different ball game. But he didn't.
            Yelp, it's the old adage of the gold goes down the drain.</font>

              to Joe Champion from Anti-sceptic Society:</font></b> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">Further to the comment from Joe Champion that
            our sample obtained from Hudsons patent method may have
            consisted of contaminants, I provide specifications for the
            nitric acid and sodium chloride used. These are analytical
            grade reagents, and as can be seen from the specifications,
            the level of impurities is very low. I was not able to
            obtain specifications for other materials used in the
            experiment, but these were of the same grade.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">The filtrate remaining from the process was
            boiled down to 25 ml to see if any precipitates were formed.
            None were observed. The concentrated filtrate was then sent
            for analysis at Sharp &amp; Howells Pty Ltd, a firm of
            analytical, consulting and industrial chemists in Port
            Melbourne.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">According to the assay received, the gold
            content was 760 ppm, using an atomic absorption
            spectrophotometer. Thus there are 760 / 1000 x 25 = 19 mg of
            gold in the filtrate. This appears consistent with Hudsons
            process leaving half the original amount of gold ie. 25 mg
            in solution.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="-0">To summarize the results, no gold or sodium
            was found present in the sample produced, and approximately
            the expected amount of gold was found in the residual
            filtrate.</font> </p>

        <p>03-JUL-98 --- The gold used in the above experiments was
          taken from a piece of gold nugget found by Parrish while on
          holiday in the Kimberley Ranges. Since this was only non-AR
          grade ingredient used, this presumably would have been the
          main source of any contamination. Parrish states that the gold
          he used seemed to be quite pure, but did not do an assay of
          it. Therefore, the "<font size="-0">white crystals in the
            acid.. (that) appear to be double pointed longish clear
            crystals similar to quartz", may have looked like quartz
            because they were quartz.</font> </p>
        <p>Against this interpretation, however, it should be noted that
          any insoluble material (of the quantity amounting to the final
          product) is quite noticable in the bottom of the beaker during
          the many boildowns that are required. The amount of product
          obtained, if it in fact was due entirely to impurities in the
          gold, would have amounted to over 50-80% of the original 50
          mg. The gold in this case would have been noticeably impure to
          the naked eye. Any calcium from the water etc, could not have
          formed an insoluble product. A major defect of the experiments
          were that the product was not weighed, which could have
          provided more useful information. </p>
        <p>It was concluded that while the above experiments were not
          proof that the process worked, they seemed promising enough
          for further research. </p>
