    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Ah, I want to thank Cheyenne for the
      introduction. I have learned now that you just don't tell her
      everything, because she repeats everything. Ah, in her newsletter
      I teased her because it looked like she was telling the whole
      story in the newsletter and it's much more enjoyable to hear if
      you, if you hear it as I learned it. I think it has much more
      meaning and now she's kind of given away a lot of what it's all
      about. But, ah....</div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      Basically this is the story of my quest for this material. To get
      an understanding of it, to be able to explain what it is. And my
      work began in this area for all the wrong reasons. I did not
      understand what I was doing. And I don't need it. Ah, I didn't
      understand what the material was and it's only in the last four or
      five years that I've really come to an understanding,
      understanding truly of what the material really is. But basically
      the work began about 1975-76, and my primary interest for getting
      into this area is, was, like I say, for all the wrong reasons.</div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      I am from Phoenix, Arizona. My father is the ex-commissioner of
      agriculture in the state of Arizona. My mother is the, was the
      state Republican's woman chairman. We're ultra-ultra right-wing
      conservative. Very, very ultra conservative people. All of my
      farming was done on a handshake basis. I even farmed 2,500 acres
      on a handshake with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and that's the
      federal government and no one farms with the federal government on
      a handshake and a verbal agreement but I did.</div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      Our family is very, very conservative, very highly regarded in the
      community. All my vehicles have the keys in the vehicles right
      now. I'm here and they're there. Ah, we just... it's a very small
      community just outside of Phoenix where, you know, everyone knows
      everybody. Everybody knows the people going down the road. There
      just is no theft. There is no break-ins because we'll hunt you
      down, find out who did it, and we'll get it back.</div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      Anyway, when I became involved in this my thinking was to mine and
      process gold and silver to create a hard currency. I was very
      disillusioned with the federal government's approach to our
      currency. They were devaluing the dollar, issuing this funny
      money, what they called federal reserve notes which I'm sure most
      of you people are aware of. They were not backed by gold and
      silver and as you make more and more of these dollars they
      continue to devalue these dollars and you think you are making
      more money, but in fact all you are doing is moving into a higher
      tax bracket and paying more and more income tax. And so you have
      less and less even though you are making more and more. And you
      come home and tell your wife, "well I got this 20 percent raise"
      or 10 percent raise and she says, "I got a 5 percent raise", but
      in fact you are making less money and not living as well as your
      parents lived. And they can tell us we're all living better and
      that we're getting all these wonderful figures but the numbers
      lie. We are not really living better. All of us are living worse
      than our parents lived as a people. There are exceptions to that
      in Dallas, but most of the country it's true.</div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      Anyway, I began buying gold and silver in the Phoenix area as
      bullion from refiners. Most of it was being refined from sterling
      silver scrap or electronic scrap. But, ah, a lot of the gold was
      coming from miners who were processing it by a process called
      "heap leach cyanide recovery". And they were heap leaching, um,
      these old tailings on these mining operations. I became very
      intrigued with this because we were very interested, in
      agriculture, in metal salts in our soils. I don't know, I think
      that here in Dallas it's much the same or further on west in the
      state, it's much the same as Arizona. We have a sodium problem in
      our soil. It's called "black alkali" and as the black alkali
      builds up in your soil you can put sulfuric acid on the soil and
      the sodium, which makes up the black alkali, becomes sodium
      sulfate, which is a white alkali. And then is water soluble and
      will leach out of your soil then. If you don't do this your soil
      is very oily and the water just won't penetrate and be retained by
      the soil and it's not very good for your crops.</div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      And so we had been doing soils analysis and this concept of, of
      literally piling ore up on a piece of plastic and spraying it with
      a cyanide solution, which dissolves selectively the gold out of
      the ore. It trickles down through the ore until it hits the
      plastic and then runs out the plastic and into the settling pond.
      It's pumped up through activated charcoal where the gold adheres
      to the charcoal and then the solution is returned back to the
      stack. And the concept seemed pretty simple, and I decided, you
      know, a lot of farmers have airplanes, a lot of farmers have race
      horses, a lot farmers have race cars... I decided I was going to
      have a gold mine. And, I had earth movers and water trucks and
      road graders and backhoes and caterpillars and these kind of
      things on the farm and I had equipment operators, and so I decided
      I was going to set up one of these heap leach cyanide systems.</div>
    <blockquote>I traveled all over the state of Arizona, took about a
      year and a half, and I finally settled on a piece of property.
      And, ah, did some analysis and all and decided that this was the
      property that had the gold in it that I wanted to recover. I set
      up a heap leach cyanide system, began spraying the ore, and sure
      enough within a matter of a couple days, we hooked it up to the
      activated charcoal. And we analyzed the solution going in the
      charcoal. We analyzed the solution coming out of the charcoal and
      we were loading gold on the charcoal. And, you know, everything is
      just rosy. We're having a high old time. And I figured I could
      lose 50 percent per year mining gold and be as well off as buying
      the gold and paying taxes at 50 percent on the, on the profit with
      buying the gold. So, if other people had to mine gold and make a
      living, I could mine gold and lose 50 percent, and be as well off
      as making the money, paying income tax and buying gold with it. So
      I figured, hey, I ought to be able to do that. <br>
      <br>
      So, what happened is, ah, we began recovering the gold and silver
      and we would take the charcoal down to our farm. We'd strip it
      with hot cyanide and sodium hydroxide. We'd run it through
      "electro winning cell". We'd get the gold out on the "electro
      winning cell". And then we would do what's called a "fire assay"
      where you run it through a crucible reduction, cupelling, and get
      this gold and silver "xxxx" bead. Now I am not going to elaborate
      on all this because I am not trying to teach anybody "fire
      assaying". I am just trying to explain the procedures here. This
      is the time honored procedure for recovering gold and silver and
      basically, its been performed for 250-300 years. It's the accepted
      standard in the industry. <br>
      <br>
      [11:24] Ah, after we recovered this gold and silver for a couple
      of weeks, we began to recover something else. And the something
      else was recovering as if it's gold and silver but it wasn't gold
      and silver. Our beads of gold and silver were actually getting to
      the point that you could hit them with a hammer and they would
      shatter. Now there's no alloy of gold and silver that will become
      that brittle. Gold and silver are both very soft metals and they
      don't alloy in any proportion that would cause them to become hard
      or brittle. Yet this became very hard and brittle. When we sent it
      to the standard laboratories for analysis, all they could detect
      was gold and silver with traces, and just traces, of copper.
      Something was recovering with the gold and silver. We couldn't
      explain. And eventually it got so much of this in our recovery
      system that actually we were losing gold and silver when we
      recovered this other material. And so, you know, it wasn't
      supposed to be profitable, it's just supposed to be something that
      was interesting. <br>
      <br>
      And so I said, "Shut the system down. You know, let's find out
      what the problem material really is". And chemically we were able
      to separate the "problem material" from the gold and silver and I
      had this sample of pure problem stuff, whatever it was. And you
      have to understand my background is cotton farming. I did take
      pre-law, decided to go into agriculture but I hated chemistry, I
      hated physics, like most of you. And ah, I decided, well heck, you
      know if you just pay enough money to the right experts, you can
      hire enough Ph.D's, you'll be able to figure this problem out. So
      I went to Cornell University, where a man had written these papers
      on doing x-ray analysis and he took the sample of the problem
      material, which wouldn't dissolve in any acids or bases, as
      separated. It was cobalt blue in color. And he did an analysis on
      it and he told me it was iron silica and aluminum. I said it's not
      iron silica and aluminum. He said, "Well sorry that's what the
      analysis says it is". So, working within Cornell, we removed all
      of the iron, all the silica and all the aluminum from the sample.
      We still had over 98 percent of the sample. <br>
      <br>
      At this point he said, "Dave, it analyzes to be nothing".
      (audience laughter) <br>
      <br>
      He said, "Mr. Hudson, if you'll give us a $350,000 grant, we'll
      put graduate students to working on it". Well I had paid him about
      $12,000 thus far. He told me he could analyze anything down to
      parts per billion and now he's telling me I had pure nothing. He
      didn't offer to refund any of my money and so I said, "No thank
      you, I think for $350,000 I can get more information than you
      can". That was about 1981 and basically I embarked on a research
      program of my own. Most of the information that directed me
      initially was just hearsay. The old time miners, the people who's
      dads had mined in Arizona, who's grandfather's had mined said,
      "Dave, what you're working with is the platinum group elements".
      There's been hundreds of people who believe the platinum group
      elements are there. Many of them are incarcerated in jail right
      now. Ah, they go out, they believe the elements are there, and so
      they go to investors and they say, you know, "We think they're
      there, so put this money in", and the people put the money in. A
      couple years later they don't have any salable commercial product
      and so the investment collapses and the investor sues them. And
      eventually they are convicted or exonerated but it always ends up
      in bitter feelings. <br>
      <br>
      [15:30] And so I said, you know, "I am not going to allow this to
      happen with this project. I'm going to fund the thing myself and I
      am going to get the answers to it". I mean this is 1981-82. We had
      instrumentation and machines that will analyzes down to parts per
      billion. You know, this has to have some explanation to it. Ah,
      the man at Cornell, he could show me the atoms, he could tell me
      how far apart they were, but he said the emission and absorption
      spectra does not agree with any spectra that we have programmed
      into our machine. There are no specific lines emitting or
      absorbing that we can identify. I mean, had about 8 different
      x-ray heads on, and the control panel looked like a 747 control
      panel. It's huge and you just sit in this big swivel chair and
      runs all these buttons and it was pretty impressive but it didn't
      give me any of the answers. <br>
      <br>
      So, I was handed a book called 'The Analytical Chemistry of the
      Platinum Group Elements' by Ginsberg. It was written in 1975. It
      was translated into English by the Israeli Program For Scientific
      Translation. And this book, it's probably about 2 1/2 inches
      thick, it's a hard bound technical book, put out by the Soviet
      Academy of Sciences. Now when you realize that Johnson Matthey and
      Englehard are the two miners and refiners of the Platinum group
      elements in South Africa. The other miners and refiners are the
      Russian government. The Russians basically got into this after
      1918 when they threw, the, Johnson Matthey, out of their country,
      because they were, the British were married to their royal family,
      and they had a deal going where royalties were being paid to them
      for the mining of their platinum group elements. And so, the
      Russian government in 1918 committed to develop this separation
      chemistry for these elements. <br>
      <br>
      Basically these elements were not all that important until about
      world war two and then they became very strategically important.
      Right now they're classified as strategic elements and any
      important government contracts that are issued, they're classified
      under strategic classification. So you don't use them unless you
      absolutely have to because they are so valuable and so rare. They
      use them like.... iridium is used on the nose-cone of the re-entry
      vehicle on the space shuttle. It's used on the hydrogen rocket
      shields that deflect the heat shield on the hydrogen because it's
      a very high temperature ceramic. It's used in the breaker
      circuitry on the nuclear power plants where they have to
      disconnect the power, reconnect it, and they needs something that
      can stand tremendous arcs and not deteriorate. You know, these
      kinds of uses where nothing else will work. <br>
      <br>
      And so basically, what happened is, according to the Soviet
      Academy of Sciences, they said that to analyze for these elements
      by emission spectroscopy, you'd have to do a procedure called
      fractional vaporization where you literally put the powders to be
      analyzed on the carbon electrode and you burn it for 300 seconds.
      Well, to do this you have to put an inert gas, a shielding gas,
      around the carbon electrode so that the air doesn't get to it,
      otherwise in 15-20 seconds the carbon electrode oxidizes away. And
      so we put this sheathing gas under it and did these long burn
      times. Now according to the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the
      scientific group in the Soviet Union, during the first 15-20
      seconds, all of the junk, or all of the iron, silica and aluminum
      would read, but it wouldn't be until 70 seconds that the palladium
      begins to read. After another 15-20 seconds, depending on how much
      palladium, then the, I believe it's, ah, I believe it's platinum
      will read, then after the platinum, then ruthenium, then after
      ruthenium, then rhodium, then after rhodium, then iridium, then
      after iridium, then osmium. I'm not absolutely sure that's exactly
      the order, I may have a couple of them reversed, but the concept
      was that they come off in the sequence of their boiling
      temperatures. <br>
      <br>
      Now this seemed pretty simple to me to understand. Because if you
      want to boil alcohol out of water, you know, you just warm it to
      the boiling temperature of alcohol, the water stays there and the
      alcohol is distilled out. And it's not until all the alcohol is
      out that then the heat begins to build up in the water. And so,
      when you begin to understand that the boiling temperature of iron,
      the actual boiling temperature of iron, is to water like the
      boiling temperature of iron .... there's as much differential
      between the boiling temperature of iron and water, as there is
      between the boiling temperature of iron and the boiling
      temperature of these elements. <br>
      <br>
      These elements boil at about 5,200-5,300 degrees Centigrade. Iron
      boils at about 3,700 degrees Centigrade and water, of course,
      boils at 100 degrees Centigrade. So, if you have water in your
      sample, the sample doesn't get any hotter than the boiling
      temperature of the water, until all the water is gone. And then
      the temperature really goes up, until you hit the next boiling
      temperature, which would be iron basically, and until all that
      iron is gone, the heat isn't going to go higher than the boiling
      temperature of iron. The maximum temperature of the DC arc is
      about 5,400-5,500 degrees Centigrade and we require about 5,300
      degrees Centigrade to boil these elements. And so as you can see,
      it isn't until all the impurities are out of the sample and the
      arc is sitting here, and burn, burn, burn, burn and build up heat,
      and build up heat, and build up heat on this material that you're
      going to finally achieve the temperature where you really can read
      these elements. <br>
      And sure enough, exactly in the sequence, and exactly as the
      Soviet Academy of Sciences said, these elements began to read.
      They came off in the sequence, exactly in the order and exactly as
      they were supposed to come off. There's palladium, platinum,
      ruthenium, rhodium, iridium and osmium. And at the time I didn't
      even know what iridium was. I didn't know what rhodium was. I
      mean, gosh, I'm just a dirt farmer. But, come to find out
      rhodium's a very valuable material. Rhodium is, is a, been up as
      high as $13,000 an ounce in the last couple years. It's the stuff
      that's in your catalytic converter, that if it isn't there your
      catalytic converter can't work. You're all told that you have
      platinum in there but there has to be at least 13 percent rhodium
      or it can't work. Because the platinum poisons with carbon
      monoxide and it's the rhodium that prevents it from poisoning. And
      when the South Africans were having the trouble with their mines
      down there, rhodium went to $13,000 per ounce because the
      automobile manufacturer's cannot sell their cars without a
      catalytic converters. And so the orders went, buy some rhodium,
      whatever it takes. We can't have our cars coming off the assembly
      lines and not be able to sell them because they don't have
      catalytic converters on them. <br>
      <br>
      [22:39] Okay, it's a material that nothing else will do what it
      does. The only thing is, the numbers we were reading, and we did
      these studies for 2 1/2 years, the numbers were 4-6 ounces per ton
      of palladium, 12-13 ounces per ton of platinum, 150 ounces per ton
      of osmium, 250 ounces per ton of ruthenium, I mean, yeah,
      ruthenium, 800 ounces per ton of iridium, and 1,200 ounces per ton
      of rhodium. Now when you understand that the best known deposit in
      the world, to date, is approximately 1/3 of one ounce per ton in
      South Africa, and they have to go 1/2 mile underground to mine a
      30 inch seam that contains this 1/3 of one ounce of all the
      platinum group elements. And we have over 2,400 ounces per ton of
      platinum group elements. Now if this had just been 5 or 6 ounces
      per ton I probably would have laid it down and walked away from
      it. But because the numbers were so preposterous, so ridiculous,
      so unbelievable, I said, you know, "Let's go for it. Let's find
      out what really is going on". <br>
      <br>
      We're talking about 12-14 percent of this rock was these elements.
      I said, you know, "This, this has to have an explanation. There
      has to be a reason why nobody's ever found this material. Nobody's
      ever understood it." <br>
      <br>
      So I went to a Ph.D. analytical chemist in Phoenix who was
      supposedly the best that Arizona had. He was a Ph.D. analytical
      chemist, a graduate of Iowa State University, with a specialty in
      metal separation systems. He had worked for Sperry and Motorola
      and all these electronic firms doing waste water treatment. I told
      him the story about the spectroscopy work that we did for these
      three years and he said, "You know Mr. Hudson, I've heard the
      story about the platinum group elements all of my life. I'm a
      native Arizonan also." But he said, "All I have to sell is my
      reputation and this makes me very nervous because of the frauds
      and the promotions and all". And he said, "Tell you what I'll do,
      I'll work for you at no charge. I won't charge you like everybody
      else has, until I can tell you where you're wrong. And at that
      point I'll submit you a bill at $60 an hour for my time." He said,
      "If I bill you up front I have to issue reports and if I issue a
      report I have to sign my name, and I'm not comfortable signing my
      name until I totally understand this". <br>
      <br>
      [25:25] Two years later this Ph.D. said, "Dave, I can, without
      equivalence, I can tell you that it is not any of the other
      elements on the Periodic Table." He said, "I have physically
      separated, in the past, every element on that Periodic Table. All
      the rare earths, many of the Actinides, the man-made elements. He
      said, "I've done them all. I've worked with niobium, strontium,
      niobium, titanium, all the electronics materials." He said, "I've
      done all these studies for all these companies, but there are four
      elements that I have never worked with, and that's four of the six
      that you brought me. When I do the separation systems that you
      brought to me, everything says that it's 4-6 ounces per ton of
      palladium, 12-14 ounces per ton of platinum, 150 ounces per ton of
      osmium, 250 ounces per ton of ruthenium, 800 ounces per ton of
      iridium, and 1,200 ounces per ton of rhodium". Now, keeping in
      mind, here's 1,200 ounces of one element and here's 4-6 ounces per
      ton of another element. Now these are very divergent numbers here
      and yet the numbers exactly agree with the spectroscopy numbers.
      Okay, exactly. The only thing is, when he separates the pure
      rhodium from the blood red chloride solutions of rhodium, which
      for you people who know anything about chemistry there aren't many
      materials that form blood red chlorides, when he does the
      hydroxide neutralization, they precipitate out of solution as a
      hydroxide. He filters and dries it. We put that into a tube
      furnace where we have atmospheric control. We oxidize it at 800
      degrees Centigrade which is red heat. We hydrogen reduce it and
      then we get this hydrogen reduced gray powder. <br>
      <br>
      What he did, is he would take it in and oxidize it and get a
      red-brown oxide, which is the correct color of rhodium dioxide. He
      would cool it and take 1/3 of that sample and put it in a sealed
      vial. He then would take two thirds of the remaining sample, put
      it back in the tube furnace, re-oxidize it and hydrogen reduce it.
      He would then cool it down, take it out of the tube furnace, take
      half of the sample and put it in another sealed vial. And then he
      would take the remaining third and put it back in the tube furnace
      and anneal it at 1,400 degrees Centigrade and it turns snow white.
      <br>
      So we have three fractions here. We have a red brown dioxide. We
      have the dioxide reduced under hydrogen to the elemental material.
      And then we have an annealed material under an inert gas. Now one
      should be an oxide, one should the element and I don't know what
      the third material might be, but it still supposed to be the same
      stuff. When we sent them over to Pacific Spectrachem in
      California, which is one of the better, older spectroscopic firms
      in California, the red brown dioxide was iron. The only element
      detectable was iron. I mean, look at it, hell, it's a red brown
      dioxide just like iron. The hydrogen reduced material, now the
      iron disappeared, no more iron in this sample. Now it's been
      hydrogen reduced and it's become silica and aluminum. No iron, and
      yet the first sample had no silicon aluminum in it and now the
      second sample is silicon aluminum. And then the third sample,
      which now should be silicon aluminum, right, it's just annealed
      under argon, now becomes calcium and silica. No aluminum. <br>
      <br>
      Now this Ph.D. says, "Dave, in all my years working with Pacific
      Spectrachem, I have never had any problems with these people.
      Never. Until I met you." And he said, "What we have here is
      something that I know is pure rhodium and yet none of these
      spectroscopic analyzes are saying it's rhodium." Iron could be a
      reddish brown chloride, but silica and aluminum and calcium do not
      form colored salts at all. And yet if you take the material that
      they claim is silica and calcium and re-dissolve it through a
      fusion and hydrochloric acid, and you got the red brown chloride
      again. Now where did it come from? And he says, "Dave, this makes
      absolutely no sense at all. This is defying everything I have been
      taught in college, everything I have been taught in graduate
      school". So, what he did, he said, "I'm going to send this back to
      my graduate professors at Iowa State." So we took these red brown
      chloride solutions in hydrochloric acid. We evaporated down the
      salts and they were these blood red chloride salts, okay, and we
      sent these to Iowa State University and we said, "What is the
      metal that's present in this salt?" <br>
      <br>
      And Iowa State University came back, "There's chlorine present".
      Well, chlorine's a gas. Well, fine, there's chlorine, but what is
      the chlorine reacting with that makes it a crystalline material?
      And they said, "There's chlorine present". And we said, "Yes, but
      what's the metal that holding the chlorine?" They couldn't tell
      us. <br>
      <br>
      [30:45] So we decided that we were really going to get
      sophisticated, so we took... When we did the spectroscopy, I told
      you at 70 seconds these elements begin to burn, well at 68 seconds
      we stopped the burn. Okay? Now there shouldn't be anything there
      other than these elements and carbon and the electrode. We dug the
      metal bead out with a little knife and we sent it off to Harwell
      Laboratories over in London, which is the government, you know,
      the government labs over in London, and they did neutron
      activation. <br>
      <br>
      Now neutron activation does not care what state the electron
      orbitals are in, it actually analyzes the nucleus itself, of the
      element. The results come back, "No precious elements detected".
      They did see some carbon, but no precious elements detected. You
      know, this is really getting serious here. I probably got the best
      credentials money can buy. I got a man that worked, now, a total
      of 9 1/2 years, he's a Ph.D. analytical chemist, he physically can
      separate and quantify everything known to man. And he says, "Dave
      I can't explain this. This is not explainable." <br>
      <br>
      So we finally order from Johnson Matthey, pure standard materials
      of rhodium and iridium, platinum, palladium, ruthenium and osmium
      and we learn how to make them disappear. We could take pure
      rhodium chloride and analyze it to be pure rhodium, and through a
      process of repeated evaporation with salt, we could make the
      rhodium disappear from the instrumental analyzes. It still is a
      blood red chloride, you still can perform all the chemistry, it
      still was in solution but it didn't analyze to contain any
      rhodium. And this was pure rhodium standard. <br>
      <br>
      The way it disappeared was a process of disaggregation. So when we
      became comfortable that, you know, I don't what this is or what
      form it is, but I know what it is. We actually took pure standards
      of metal, put them in our separation system and they separated
      right where they were supposed to be, as these elements. I went
      back to General Electric, and General Electric is one of the big
      names in instrumentation as well as high technology work, and they
      had people back there who were building what they call fuel cells
      using rhodium and iridium in the fuel cell technology. And
      particularly rhodium is very important in fuel cells, particularly
      their fuel cell technology, which was the solid polymer
      electrolyte fuel cell, because it doesn't poison with carbon
      monoxide. And so all your standard fuels that are hydrocarbons,
      which most of you Texans are familiar with, they, in the
      combustion, or the removal of hydrogen from the hydrocarbon, you
      get carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and this poisons platinum.
      And so platinum, after a week or two, begins to die and quits
      functioning. Where rhodium does not poison with carbon monoxide,
      and so you don't have to have pure hydrogen, you can use the
      hydrocarbon fuels and it works just fine. <br>
      <br>
      When I went back and talked to them, I met with about 7 people
      back there, and they turned me over to their senior catalytic
      chemist, his name was Tony LaConti. He said, "Dave, we know that
      when we buy the commercial standards from Johnson Matthey that
      they analyze very well, but we do know that when we convert
      through a fusion process to disaggregate them to a finer particle
      size, that they do not analyze as well as they used to." So, his
      suggestion to me was, "Dave, I don't care whether it analyzes or
      not. Your credentials behind you are as good as we have anyplace
      at GE. Just send us the material and we'll mount it in our fuel
      cells and if it does what it's supposed to do, who cares what you
      call it". Now, here's a ...., this guy might have been a farmer,
      this is, ah, pretty good thinking! (audience laughter). <br>
      <br>
      So, you know, we separated the rhodium, and he wanted about 3
      ounces of it which, we were making it milligrams at a time, so it
      took us about 4 or 5 months, and then John wanted to, the Ph.D.
      wanted to re-refine it, and so we went back and re-refined it all
      again. Anyway, by the time we got it to them, GE had sold their
      fuel cell technology to United Technologies, who has another type
      of fuel cell. And they wanted the solid polymer technology of GE
      for their breathing systems on submarines and everything. And what
      happened is, the GE people had to go over and work for 6 months
      and then they were allowed to quit. And so, Jose Giner, the head
      of the fuel cell technology at United Technologies actually went
      and formed his own company in Waltham, Massachusetts [Giner Inc.,
      14 Spring Street, Waltham Ma., 02154-4413], and most of the GE
      people went with him. And so at the time our material is ready to
      work with, the people weren't at GE anymore, they were at Waltham,
      Massachusetts, so we contracted with these people to do the fuel
      cell testing. <br>
      <br>
      Our material as delivered to Giner analyzed and contained, the
      rhodium didn't contain any rhodium, the iridium didn't contain any
      iridium. But when it was mounted on carbon and put into a fuel <br>
      cell, it did what only rhodium would do. It was a hydrogen
      evolving catalyst and it was carbon monoxide stable. Okay? It does
      what only, at that time, about $10,000 an ounce rhodium would do.
      Now I understand rhodium is down probably a thousand an ounce now.
      But it did what only rhodium would do. We ran the fuel cells for
      about three weeks doing time studies on it, and at the end of the
      three weeks they tore down the fuel cells and sent the carbon off
      for analyzes, and now we have 6 percent rhodium on the electrodes.
      Mysteriously appeared from some place, 6 percent. <br>
      <br>
      [36:47] They said, "Dave, to our knowledge no one knows that
      rhodium can exist in this state. No one knows that iridium can
      exist in this state. In fact, if you want, you can patent this. If
      you can explain it, if you can tell how to make it from a known
      commercial material, you can put a patent on this." So I went to
      their patent attorney in Washington, D.C., and in 1988 I filed
      U.S. and worldwide patents on 11 elements in their orbitally
      rearranged monatomic state. Okay? That's where the name comes
      from, and we just made it up on an airplane one day. Orbitally
      Rearranged Monatomic Element. We knew that the chemistry changed.
      We knew that the material became totally inert and did not act
      like a metal. We knew that it did not have any valence electrons
      available for chemical bonding, and we knew that there was a
      change in the nuclear configuration. We didn't understand it yet
      but we knew it was the case. <br>
      <br>
      And so, this material was, went to the U.S. patent office. In
      addition we filed another 11 patents on another phenomena. And
      this phenomena becomes very interesting. If you take a gram of
      gold and you convert it, through a disaggregation process to the
      monatomic form, the last product you have before it goes to pure
      monatomic material, is hydrogen oride or hydrogen rhodide or
      hydrogen iridide. Which if you know this is a minus one state.
      Coincidentally. Hydrogen is more electropositive than these
      elements. So it's not gold hydride, it's hydrogen oride. Which is
      in the literature if you are curious. Anyway, when we anneal away
      the proton, the material goes snow white. All of these elements in
      their pure monatomic form are snow white. They look just like
      cooking flour. You know, you ladies who do cooking, just look for
      that white bleached flour that you pour out in a little measuring
      cup. Doesn't look like a metal at all. The hydrogen oride is gray,
      but the pure dehydrogenated material is snow white. It is very
      fluffy. It has a density of about 2 1/2 yet the metal has a
      density of about 19. Okay? <br>
      <br>
      This is not at all like it's supposed to be, but it's there and
      it's these elements. The amazing thing about it is the weight of
      the material was very difficult to weigh. We were having all this
      crazy weights on it, so in trying to quantify this on paper for
      the patent office, and they want things very precise at the patent
      office, we couldn't get consistent results with the material. It
      kept gaining weight and gaining weight and gaining weight and
      gaining weight and gaining weight, you know, and so what's the
      correct weight, you know? <br>
      <br>
      So we got a machine called thermo-gravimetric analysis. And how
      many of you know what thermo-gravimetric analysis is? Not many,
      there's a few back there. It's basically a machine that has
      controlled atmosphere and it has a micro-balance, that you can
      weigh the sample in a controlled atmosphere, and then the sample
      can be heated and weighed all at the same time. And it's made to
      .... you put metals in there and oxidize them and see the weight
      gain of the oxide and hydrogen reduce, and see the loss of the
      oxide. Or you can heat it up to high temperatures and when it
      thermally decomposes, you can tell that the weight's going because
      the weight's coming down on the scale. So I figured here we have
      complete control, no variables like absorbed gases or, you know,
      whatever from the atmosphere. We're gonna really control this
      stuff. <br>
      <br>
      [40:54] After about 9 or 10 months of doing these studies by
      computer control, day and night, everyday, month after month, what
      we found is when the material goes snow white, it weighs 56
      percent of the true weight. Now that should bother you, I hope.
      You say, where's the mass going? Why isn't it weigh-able anymore?
      And by repeated annealing we could make the material weigh less
      than the pan weighed it was sitting in, which was less than
      nothing, or we could make it weigh 300-400 times what it's
      beginning weight was, depending on whether we were heating or
      cooling it. Yet the machine is built with magnetic standards, that
      you could actually put in the machine, and the materials are
      non-magnetic, then at a certain temperature they become magnetic,
      then at another temperature they lose their magnetism, to check
      the machine and see if there's any effect of it's magnetic field
      from the heating coil that's effecting the weight of the material.
      And yet the magnetic materials have no effect at all. Yet when you
      put this material in and literally take it quantitatively to the
      white form, the material only weighs 56 percent of the true
      weight. <br>
      Yet if you take this white powder and put it on a quartz boat, and
      heat it up to the point where it fuses with the quartz, it becomes
      black and it regains all it's weight again. This makes no sense,
      it's impossible, it can't happen. But there it was. <br>
      <br>
      So, we became interested in the area of why this material was
      changing it's weight. We went to Varian Corporation over in
      Stanford, we showed them the data, and they said, "Mr. Hudson, if
      you were cooling a sample, we would say it 's a superconductor". <br>
      <br>
      A superconductor is material that responds to tiny, tiny, tiny
      magnetic fields, and even though the heating element on this
      thermo-gravimetric analysis machinery is "bifilar" wound, which
      means power goes in one way in one wire, it comes back the other
      way in the other wire, so they cancel each other's magnetic field.
      There's no way the two wires can completely cancel each other.
      There's always this tiny little bit of residual because the wires
      are not on top of each other, they're actually parallel to each
      other. So there is this tiny little bit of residual field. <br>
      <br>
      It's not the kind of field an ordinary magnet would respond to,
      but it is the kind of field that a superconductor could respond
      to. A superconductor is a material that can respond to a magnetic
      field of 2 times 10 to the minus 15th Erg. I say, what's an Erg?
      They said, there is 10 to the 18 power ergs in a Gauss. And the
      Earth's magnetic field that a compass aligns with is about .7
      Gauss. So the Earth's magnetic field is almost a Gauss. And
      there's 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10
      times 10...., 18 times, there's that many Ergs in a Gauss. <br>
      <br>
      And a superconductor responds to a magnetic field of 2 times 10 to
      the minus 15th Ergs, or .00000000..., 15 times, with a 2 of 1 Erg.
      [typist note: .000000000000002]. <br>
      <br>
      [44:40] You've seen in these science magazines where they've got a
      picture of the brain and they show part of the brain lit up when
      you eat something sour or you see another part light up when you
      eat something sweet or that's electric seizure where the brain
      just lights up all over. How do they see these thought patterns in
      your brain? With superconductors. Superconductors can sense any
      disturbance in a magnetic field. They're unbelievably sensitive.
      And, so if this material is a superconductor, even this tiny
      little bit of magnetic field that was still around the heating
      coil, the material could levitate or it could sink, because a
      superconductor will not break lines of magnetic force when they're
      superconducting. They resist moving in the field and so they would
      tend to levitate or they couldn't be weighed. If you pick the
      scale up they're gonna weigh more, or if you put the scale down
      they're gonna weigh less, because they're not moving. So if it's a
      superconductor this is not really a good thing to be doing. It
      doesn't really mean anything. <br>
      <br>
      When I began to do the literature studies, I found out that in a
      macro-metal, the temperature of the atoms is actually being
      measured now over in Europe. And the temperature is about 350
      degrees Kelvin, depending on the metal, I mean, more or less.
      About 350 degrees. As you disaggregate the clusters in that metal
      down smaller and smaller, the temperature of the atom goes down
      and down. A three atom cluster is about 23 degrees Kelvin, a two
      atom cluster is about 12 degrees Kelvin, and a 1 atom, they don't
      know what it really is because they can't read it, they can't find
      it. But theoretically it's about 2 to 3 degrees Kelvin. The
      internal temperature inside a single atom is, in fact, almost
      absolute zero. It has nothing to do with temperature of the room
      it's sitting in, and actually what we were doing is, we were
      heating and cooling a monatomic system, and the monatomic system
      was giving up energy. And so we set up to do differential thermal
      analyzes and we found out there was a lot more heat coming out
      than we were putting in when we heated it. <br>
      <br>
      We have that chart too in graph. Then actually by heating it, we
      were cooling the atoms, because the temperature had nothing to do
      with the internal temperature of the atom. The only way it could
      hold energy is through chemical binding or through crystalline
      binding and there was none of that going on because it 's a
      monatomic system. We actually found that these atoms, in the
      literature, since we filed our patent, and we filed 11 more
      patents on the superconducting state of a mini-atom system of the
      high-spin state. We found in the published literature in 1989,
      1990 and 1991, that the Niels Bohr Institute, that Argonne
      National Laboratories, that Oak Ridge National Laboratories,
      indeed had confirmed that the very elements that I had filed in my
      patents do exist in this high-spin state, in the monatomic form.
      And that they do inherently go to that state when they're in the
      monatomic form. They will not go to this state when they're in the
      diatomic state, but they will go to this state in the monatomic
      form. And the words that they have developed in the scientific
      community to explain this is the asymmetrical deformed high-spin
      nuclei. They have even published papers on the asymmetrically
      deformed high-spin nuclei, and found that they theoretically
      should be superconductors. Because high-spin atoms can pass energy
      from one high-spin atom to the next with no net loss of energy.
      Okay? <br>
      <br>
      [48:32] Tomorrow in our workshop, we will, I have all of the
      published papers, I have the Scientific American articles, I have
      all the published papers on all of these elements. You'll get to
      see Niels Bohr Laboratories, Argonne National Laboratories, Oak
      Ridge National Laboratories credentials and these specific
      elements, and in the asymmetrically deformed high-spin state, and
      they are stable in that state, and they are not radioactive
      isotopes in that state. But it is a state that will only occur in
      the monatomic form. When they are in this state they do not want
      to go back to metal. They repulse each other. They will not go to
      a metallic state until you get the spin state back to the low spin
      state. <br>
      <br>
      You think my life was complicated. Here I am a dirt farmer. I have
      to learn chemistry, I have to learn physics, I have to learn about
      superconductivity. And now my uncle comes up to me with a paper,
      and he says, "Dave, read this book. I think you'll enjoy it." And
      I looked at it and it's called 'Secrets of the Alchemist'", it's a
      Time-Life series book. And I says, "What are you talking about,
      Caleb, I don't need to read that, that's about Alchemy. That's the
      occult." He says, "No, Dave, you need to read this book. It talks
      about a white powder of gold". Ohhhh!? <br>
      So I start reading the book. The Philosopher Stone was a white
      powder of gold. The Philosopher Stone was said to be the container
      of the light of life. <br>
      <br>
      We took some calves brains and some pigs brains, and we did a
      destruction of the organic material and a metals analysis and over
      5 percent, by dry matter weight, of the calves brains and the pigs
      brains, were rhodium and iridium in the high-spin state. And
      nobody in medical research knows that. <br>
      <br>
      I found in the literature, and I'll show you those tomorrow, the
      U.S. Naval Research Facility has confirmed superconductivity is
      the communication vehicle between cells in our body, but they
      don't know where the superconductivity comes from. It's like it's
      a stealth atom that no one can figure out what it is. (audience
      laughter) It's there but no one can read it, just like this stuff.
      <br>
      When you realize that the Philosopher Stone is the white powder of
      gold, then, of course, I have to find out does it work? Does it
      really have the properties they attribute to it? Which they claim
      that not only it will cure every disease known to man, they claim
      that it is capable of changing the nature of man, making him into
      a different person. <br>
      <br>
      And so, do we want to have a little break here? For everybody to
      stretch a little bit and I think that our hostess over here has
      tapes and all sorts of information that she's willing to sell. And
      after this we'll go into the philosophy, what it really is, and
      what it really means in our lives, and what we can do with it.
      Okay? <br>
      (audience break - lecture then continues)
      <hr width="62%"><br>
      [52:17] Okay before I start on the second half, I would like to
      request of all of you, um, Cheyenne was very adamant that she had
      to tape these proceedings. She said I've always done that with my
      speakers. I have been very disappointed in that when I spoke at
      Global Sciences twice, they taped it both times, and I said, "This
      tape is only for the people who attend the conference". And these
      people have copied and copied and copied. I have had phone calls
      from Germany, I had phone calls from South America. I will please
      ask you people, please do not recopy these tapes. These tapes are
      for the people that attended the conference, who want to refer
      back to them. It's fine to play them for other people, but please
      don't make copies of them for other people to have. Some of the
      people who have ended up with copies of these are not the kind of
      people that I would just as soon that they didn't hear about this.
      And so, please.... You ask yourself why we never heard about this
      on the radio, why we never heard about this on the newspapers, and
      it's because I refuse. I've been asked to speak at NASA and I've
      turned it down, on superconductivity. I've been asked to come
      before the open radio stations, and what you have to understand is
      that all people are not ready for this. <br>
      <br>
      Okay? The people who came here basically, I'd say, 90-95 percent
      of you hear this and understand what it is and why it's here now.
      But most people on the street do not understand it at all. And I
      can tell you it's just like you're speaking a foreign language
      when you try to repeat this to people. They're just going to say,
      "Gosh, what are they talking about. You're out in left field."
      And, ah, all I can tell you is it seems to be a built in
      protection. It seems to be for a reason, that's all I can tell
      you. And so, please don't recopy the tapes, okay? I'm asking you
      here on tape, please don't recopy the tapes. <br>
      <br>
      Okay, back to the alchemical substance. When I became interested
      in this alchemy, because the white powder of gold was the
      alchemical substance supposedly, I began to do all sorts of
      reading, and one of the things I came across immediately was the
      Melchizedek priesthood and the white powder of gold associated
      with the Melchizedek priesthood. So I went to Rabbi Plotkin at
      Temple Beth Israel in Phoenix, and I asked the Rabbi, who is one
      of the most knowledgeable rabbis in Arizona, I said, "Rabbi, have
      you ever of the white powder of gold?", and he said, "Oh yes Mr.
      Hudson, but to our knowledge no one's known how to make it since
      the destruction of the first temple". He said, "The white powder
      of gold is the magic. It can be used for white magic or black
      magic". <br>
      <br>
      And when you really find out what the white powder of gold is, you
      begin to really appreciate that statement. So, anyway, as I began
      to research this further, I found out about the history of it, I
      found out that it has been associated with the ancient peoples
      over in the Tigris-Euphrates valley. It was knowledge that was
      given to them by, they claimed, the gods. It is always depicted in
      the literature as a triangular shaped stone, but it's about twice
      as tall as it is wide, kind of an elongated pyramidal shape, like
      this. I think Zecharia Sitchin refers to it as the "athinder?
      stone". Ah, but all of their sacred text always began with it.
      Curious enough, in the ancient Egyptian text it was always
      referred to as the "What is it?", and if you read in the papyrus
      of Ani that was found in the tomb of Pepe the 2nd in old kingdom
      Egypt, it says, "I am purified of all imperfections, what is it, I
      ascend like the golden hawk of Horus, what is it, I come by the
      immortals without dying, what is it, I come before my father's
      throne, what is it, and she goes on and on, page after page,
      talking about all these attributes that you acquire as you ascend,
      but they always stop and ask the question, "What is it"? <br>
      <br>
      Well, this was written about 28-29 hundred B.C., and they're
      asking this question "What is it"? Well when I found the Hebrew
      dictionary, I found out that the Hebrew word for "What is it?" is
      Ma-Na. Manna literally means the same thing, "What is it?" And
      when you understand that the Hebrew people were actually, lived in
      Egypt for generations, they were the artisans, they were the
      metallurgists, they were the craftsman. And when they left out of
      Egypt they took this knowledge with them. We find in the
      literature that, and this is particularly in Velikovsky's writing,
      'Ages in Chaos', that he says, that, eh, when the Egyptian...,
      when the Hebrew people left Egypt that the Egyptians decided that
      they wanted to go after them and they find the writings in Egypt
      where the Pharaoh and his army drown in a whirlpool of water. Now
      this right at the end of old kingdom Egypt. <br>
      <br>
      Remember in the Bible, that it says that the Hebrews encountered
      these mean, warring like peoples called the Amalekites out on the
      Sinai peninsula as they were exiting Egypt, and they, Moses wanted
      to fight them, and the Hebrew people said "naw, these guys are
      fierce tribesmen, there's hundreds of thousands of them, we don't
      want to fight these people". And so they avoided fighting them.
      Well, Velikovsky found out that at the very same time they were
      having all the plagues in Egypt they were also having plagues over
      in the Tigris-Euphrates valley, and the ruling tribe, the
      Amalekites, exited the Tigris-Euphrates valley at the same time
      the Hebrews were exiting Egypt. And they literally passed each
      other on the Sinai with the Amalekites coming west as the Hebrews
      were going east. They arrived in Egypt and there was no Pharaoh
      and there was no army, and literally, these Arabs, destroyed and
      killed everyone. All they left were the lesser people, who they
      kept as slaves for themselves, but they hacked and killed and
      slaughtered everyone. They destroyed the temples, they wiped out a
      very high culture at the end of old kingdom Egypt. By the time
      they woke up to the fact of what they had destroyed, the knowledge
      that was gone, it was too late. The only people that knew how to
      make it, who were still alive, were the Hebrews, and they were out
      on the Sinai. <br>
      <br>
      They began in ancient Egypt to do the opening of the mouth
      ceremonies, they begin to mummify their leaders, waiting for this
      knowledge to come back so that the leaders could be brought back
      to life, but in fact the knowledge was gone. And so, if you look
      in old kingdom Egypt, did you know that they've never found the
      body of a pharaoh or a high priest from old kingdom Egypt? Never.
      And they claim in their literature that they never died, that they
      ascended the stairway to heaven. And when you read about what they
      did and where they went, it totally agrees, they were going to the
      very same place that the people in the Tigris-Euphrates valley
      went to, to ascend the stairway to heaven. And that was to an
      island called Bahrain, it's just off the Sinai peninsula. There
      was a city by the name of 'Kilmun' or 'Dilmun' and do you know
      that they have excavated the city and found that it does exist,
      and it's supposedly the land of the crossing, where the fresh
      water and the sea water mix. And they have found the fault, right
      underneath the island where fresh water exits under the ocean and
      mixes with the sea water. <br>
      <br>
      All of this goes back to writings about the first mortal king in
      the Tigris-Euphrates valley, Gilgamesh, and his quest for
      immortality. It goes back to he was told to travel to the land
      where the sun sets, or the sun rises, which in fact was the name
      for Arabia. And he traveled down the Tigris-Euphrates river, and
      into the ocean and across the ocean, they came to this island, and
      it was at that island where the man who survived the flood lived,
      and that's the man we know as Noah, that he was looking for. The
      man who lived 900-1,000 years, and has three sons who lived over
      900 years, who had this knowledge. <br>
      <br>
      Okay, now we come back to the Hebrews who exited Egypt. All of the
      Egyptians that had this knowledge were slaughtered, and no one was
      there to bring them back to life. But the Hebrews had this
      knowledge, and Bezaleel, the goldsmith, was commanded by Moses to
      prepare the "What is it?", the manna, or the "bread of the
      presence of God", which was another name, they knew it in old
      kingdom Egypt. In old kingdom Egypt they had three other names for
      it, it was called "the golden tear from the eye of Horus", it was
      called "that which issues from the mouth of the Creator", the
      spittle, or it was called "the semen of the Father in Heaven". And
      if you take the white powder gold and you mix it with water, it
      forms a gelatinous white suspension, that, as a farmer I can
      attest, it does look just like semen, which we use to, for the
      cattle and all. Ah, that would be a good description of it, if I
      was trying to convey to someone what it looks like. <br>
      Basically this is the basis of all religions of the world. How
      many times have you heard "cleanse yourself", "purify yourself",
      "prepare yourself like a bride in the bridal chamber", "for the
      coming of the father". What they don't go on and tell you is what
      happens in the bridal chamber, you become inseminated in the
      bridal chamber. But you receive the semen of the father in Heaven.
      And you. . . over. . . this is done over a 40 day period during a
      40 day fast. It was called the Egyptian rite of passage. It went 9
      days with no food to totally cleanse the digestive system, and
      they took this material, or the "semen of the Father in Heaven",
      for the next 30 days. Okay, it was called "the Bread of Life" and
      the "Bread of Life" was mixed with the water and was called the
      "Living Water". Okay? This material is what Moses commanded
      Bezaleel, the goldsmith. It wasn't a baker, it wasn't a woman, it
      was a goldsmith who was told to prepare the "Bread of the presence
      of God", and this "Bread of the presence of God" was set out on a
      golden table in front of the Ark of the covenant. You remember the
      ark of the covenant, they also placed the stones, through which
      God spoke to Moses, and gave him the ten commandments. <br>
      <br>
      And the Bible says, up on Mt. Sinai, that the Hebrew people said
      there was fire and there was smoke. It was if a forge was going up
      on Mt. Sinai. But when you recall that Moses had been there
      previously and in the area of Sinai is where copper was being
      mined and smelted. And in fact, I believe there was a forge going
      on Mt. Sinai, because at 1,160 degrees the white powder of gold
      can be melted to a transparent glass of gold. It literally becomes
      a glass as clear as window glass, and yet it is pure gold, it's
      not a gold compound, it's pure gold. You can take it in a mortar
      and pestle and grind it right back to the white powder, but it is,
      it looks absolutely like glass. <br>
      <br>
      The neat thing about gold, as compared to the other elements, is
      that gold can be purified by distillation. At 450 degrees
      elemental gold will resonance disconnect from itself and will go
      over as a gas and be re-condensed over here and be caught as white
      powder again. And so you can purify it, back and forth, by
      repeated distillation, and get a very high purity substance. It's
      called the "white dew", the "white condensate", "the white dove"
      or it's depicted as a white feather in the alchemical texts.
      Because that's the way it was purified as a volatile material.
      Okay? All of the symbols of being fed by a dove, or receiving the
      white dove, is always an alchemical symbol. When we find, as the
      rabbi told me, that this knowledge was kept by the Hebrews until
      the destruction of the first temple. <br>
      <br>
      What happened when they destroyed the first temple? And what
      happened right before the temple was destroyed? We find that
      Solomon got a woman pregnant who came from Egypt and she, in fact,
      was the Pharaoh of Egypt. What was her name, Hatshepsut? How do
      you pronounce it? Hatshepsut? Anyway, it was in fact the Pharaoh
      of Egypt that came to Solomon's temple, and she became pregnant,
      she returned back to Egypt, and she gave birth to a son, and the
      son's name was Menelik. Menelik returned to Jerusalem when he was
      twenty one to be acknowledged by Solomon as being his son. And
      Solomon, of course, acknowledged Menelik, "Yes, you are my son".
      And of course, the Levites, the high priests, just went bonkers.
      Here was a half breed. And they had all this racial purity, and
      here was a half breed as the eldest son of Solomon, to be the next
      king of Jerusalem. And so the Levites said, "You must send your
      son away, he must be sent away". And Solomon, in his infinite
      wisdom, said, "Fine, if I must send my son away, all of you
      Levites must send your eldest sons away also". So all of the
      eldest sons of the Levites left with Menelik, but when they left
      they took the Ark of the Covenant. <br>
      <br>
      And that's where the Ark of the Covenant went; to Egypt. When the
      Hebrews realized that the Ark of the Covenant had left, these men
      who took it were the ones who by blood right were the correct ones
      to care for it. They were the eldest sons of the Levites and the
      king. But because they were sent away they took the Ark of the
      Covenant. And the Hebrew people haven't really wanted to talk
      about this that much, because it really was their doings that they
      lost it. And so, the Aaronic priesthood or the rabbinical
      priesthood does not want to talk about the high priesthood leaving
      Jerusalem, but it went to Egypt. And it was kept in Egypt out on
      the island of Elephantine, where they built an exact duplicate of
      the Temple of Solomon, and you'll read, and find out about that,
      if you read Graham Hancock's book, 'The Sign and the Seal'. This
      is all in there and it is absolutely correct. They have excavated.
      The excavators have found, on the island of Elephantine, the exact
      dimensions of the Temple of Solomon, where the foundation was and
      where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. In the temple of Luxor
      they recorded all of the loot and all of the plunder that was
      taken from the Temple of Solomon by Thutmose II, was then returned
      when he became pharaoh and looted the temple. But there's no Ark
      of the Covenant because they already had that. And in that plunder
      they list all of the items that they got, and they're all
      identified as being golden, and then silver and then copper. But
      under the golden items, under the shewbread, here is this
      elongated pyramidal shape that is "The Bread of the presence of
      God". It's the very same symbol, that I told you earlier, that is
      always shown as depicted in the sacred ceremony, with the king
      offering the "bread", the "white bread", to the symbol of the Ark
      of the Covenant, with the black Anubis sitting on top of it. Well
      the Anubis represented the digestive system, and here's the king
      offering, and it says "keeper of the secret", but it's the white
      powder of gold being offered to the digestive system, which is the
      transformational process you go through. <br>
      <br>
      Now, what does it do? I'm not a doctor so I can't practice
      medicine. Anything that is administered to someone for the purpose
      of curing a disease is medicine. So therefore I can't tell you on
      tape what's been done with it, what the doctors who have giving it
      have done with it, but I can tell you that at 2 mg. it totally has
      gotten rid of Karposi Sarcomas on AIDS patients, at 2 mg. per day.
      2 mg. per day. There's 32,000 milligrams in an ounce, 2 mg. is
      nothing. And it gets rid of "KS". I can tell you that people who
      have taken it, at 2 mg. injections, within 2 hours, their white
      blood cell count goes from 2,500 to 6,500 white blood cells. I can
      tell you that stage 4 cancer patients have taken it orally, and
      after 45 days have no cancer anyplace in the body. We're not gonna
      go into any more specifics than that. I will talk to you about it
      later when the cameras aren't running. <br>
      <br>
      I am not a doctor. My purpose in this was not to cure diseases and
      illness, but I did want to know "does it work"? It's been used on
      Lou Gehrig's disease, it's been used on MS, it's been used on MD,
      it's been used on arthritis, it's been used on, ah, what else,
      that's all that's coming to mind right now, and it just does some
      very remarkable things in the body. The most important thing that
      it does and the real reason this is here is not as a medicine. <br>
      <br>
      The reason this material is here is to enlighten and raise the
      consciousness of mankind. Now if people don't understand that, I
      apologize, but that really is it's purpose. And what we have done
      is we have given it in the high amounts to some people who have
      had nothing wrong with them medically. We didn't know what to
      expect. So the very first man, he did a 42 day food fast, which is
      pretty severe food fast. He went for 9 days with only water, he
      had a high colonic, and on the 10th day we began to give him 500
      mg a day of this material. Now this was not gold. This was rhodium
      and iridium. And the reason we chose rhodium and iridium is
      because it naturally was in his body. It's in Aloe Vera gel. It's
      in Ace Mannan. It's in "Man aloe". It's in carrot juice, it's in
      grape juice, it's in grape seed extract, it's in slippery elm
      bark, it's in sheep sorrel, it's in many, many materials. And so
      it's totally natural, it's not a compound, it's not a drug. It's
      an elemental material. It's like taking an iron pill. But these
      are the atoms that flow the light of life in your body. <br>
      <br>
      And according to ancient Egyptians, they said, "You have a
      physical body, you have to feed physical foods to so it can grow
      and become all that it's meant to be. If you don't feed your
      material body, you die or you're very stunted. You don't grow and
      develop." You also have a light body, they said, you also must
      feed so it can grow and become what it's meant to be. And we
      haven't been feeding our light body, because we haven't known what
      to feed it with. <br>
      <br>
      500 mg. a day for 30 days, was called the Egyptian rite of
      passage, and so we had to find out what does this do. After 5 or 6
      days of taking this material, this fellow began to hear this very
      high frequency sound, and every day the sound gets louder, and
      louder, and louder, and louder, and louder and louder. By the time
      he finished his fast, he said it's like loudspeakers in my brain,
      literally roaring this sound. It's the same sound that many of the
      meditators have heard, that your told to listen for when you
      meditate, to find this sound, but when you think about it most
      people don't hear it anymore. Well this sound is roaring in this
      man's head, it's roaring day and night, it's roaring when he's
      talking on the phone, it's roaring when he's working. And I said,
      "Doesn't this disturb you? Isn't this an irritating sound? " and
      he said, "Not at all. It's just like nectar", because it doesn't
      come through the ears. He said, "It's inside the brain." <br>
      <br>
      Now it's hard for me to understand. It's hard for probably most of
      you to understand. He says, "David, it's just nectar. It's
      something that you literally want to go within the sound and just
      let it exclude everything out of your life". Basically at the end
      of the 42 day fast, he went back, he took a body brush to get rid
      of the toxins in his body, and he went back eating normally. And
      he was eating meat, white meat and vegetables. Well he figured the
      sound would die down and go away. It doesn't. The sound is still
      growing and getting louder and louder. After 60 more days, the
      dreams begin, the revelations begin, and then the visions begin.
      And this is going to sound a little far fetched to some of you,
      but there are light beings that come to this man and teach him.
      They never open their mouth but they telepathically are
      communicating with him. And with the hope that I'm not going to
      offend anyone, there actually is a female being that comes to him
      and has sex with him. <br>
      <br>
      And I didn't understand this until I found in the ancient Vedic
      texts that it talks about this, having sex with the angels. 2000
      B.C. After about 7 months, he begins to have orgasms. And this is
      an adult group basically so I better explain to you, he has no
      erection, he has no seminal emission, but it's an orgasm. I says,
      "Is it nice?" and he said, "It's just like the real thing". He's
      now having about 7-8 a day. <br>
      <br>
      He said, "Dave, the sound seems to originate about 8 inches above
      my head, it comes down into my brain, it's like a hat band around
      my head, and it just roars here in my head. I can feel the
      vibration all through my body". But after 7 months these orgasms
      started and they just got more frequent and more frequent, and
      it's not something he controls. It's something that just comes on.
      Well, he only sleeps about an hour and a half to two hours now, he
      doesn't need 7-8 hours like most of us, and so he decided one
      morning about 4 o'clock in the morning, he's gonna go outside and
      just let this orgasm go. See what happens. He said it began down
      the pelvis, and it literally, he just let it move, and he said he
      could feel it, it came up over his stomach, up over his chest, up
      over his head, and he said, "My whole body was involved in this
      orgasm". And he said, "I felt hot. I felt like if someone came up
      and touched me they would burn their hand. The all of a sudden,
      out of the top of my head, goes this column of energy". He feels
      it just going right out the top of his head. <br>
      <br>
      Ah, I was, about three weeks ago, I was handed a book, called
      "Secrets of the Golden Flower" by Richard Wilhelm with an
      introduction by Carl Jung. Richard Wilhelm did the eastern
      translations for Jung. This book was written in 1931, and it's
      been translated and been reproduced, and published several times
      since then, I guess it's now in paperback because some people are
      getting paperback copies now. Anyway, it verbatim describes this
      sound. And it says in the book it seems to all be about this
      sound, the "hu". Well we are the hu-man. The man who can hear the
      sound. <br>
      Okay? This is about the "hu", the sound. And that it says in there
      that you get this energy in your pelvis, and that it can be
      developed where it literally will take your whole body up over
      your head and everything. And when it finally is at a state of
      perfection that it will feel like there is a column of light
      coming right out the top of your head. <br>
      <br>
      I think the word that most people use for it is the kundalini. But
      that's what it is. This man can cut cards now, and hold them up,
      and tell you what the suit is and what the number is, and he's
      right 10 out of 10 times. He can tell you who's going to come to
      see him tomorrow, he knows what they're going to want to talk
      about before they get there, who it's going to be, what they are
      going to want to talk about. He says there's this complete feeling
      of oneness with all living things, all animals, all humans. It's
      just this total unity of oneness with all life. <br>
      <br>
      According to the "Secrets of the Golden Flower", it takes 10 lunar
      months, which happens to be the same as the Egyptian's said, 9
      solar months, same time frame, but at the end of this, at the
      ninth month, he literally becomes a light being. It's the breaking
      through of the cosmic egg, and he literally becomes a light being,
      capable of levitating and capable of bio-locating. To literally
      disappear here and reappear someplace else. <br>
      <br>
      Now this sounds pretty preposterous, except if he's a perfect
      superconductor, he can levitate, he can walk on water. And
      tomorrow I will share with you some of the papers by Harold
      Puthoff, down in Austin, Texas, who worked on the government
      contracts on psychic, telepathy, mental connections between
      people, and he's now working with levitation, time travel and all
      that. He's published some papers developing Sakharov's theory
      about gravity, in which he says, that gravity is not a
      gravitational field. <br>
      <br>
      That gravity, is in fact, the inter-reaction of matter, the
      protons, and the neutrons and the electrons, with the zero point,
      or vacuum energy. <br>
      <br>
      And what we experience as gravity is, in fact, the inter-reaction
      of the matter with the zero point energy. <br>
      <br>
      That there is no gravitational field per se. And in his
      calculations and in his mathematics, he calculates that when
      matter is resonance connected in two dimensions, it no longer
      interacts in three dimensions, but it's only interacting in two
      dimension s, by what he calls the jitterbug motion, that it loses
      4/9s of it's gravitational weight. Or it only weighs 56 percent,
      which if you all recall is exactly what our material weighed. 56
      percent, or 5/9s of it's true weight. Which means that the
      material is a resonance connected, quantum oscillator, resonating
      in two dimensions, which just happens to be the definition of
      superconductor. <br>
      <br>
      But when I met Hal Puthoff, he said, "Dave, you know what this
      means, it means, when you can control space-time, if you control
      gravity, and you control gravity, you are controlling space-time.
      And so literally what these atoms are doing is they are bending
      space-time to weigh 5/9s. He says, "There are theories in the
      published journals, credible journals, about moving faster than
      the speed of light, from one place to another. But to do it you
      must have what's called exotic matter, matter that has no
      gravitational attraction at all." Do you know that iridium at 70
      degrees Centigrade, I mean 70 degrees Fahrenheit, has no
      gravitational attraction at all, and that 70 degrees Fahrenheit is
      the temperature of your body, or above, or that your body's above
      that. And so literally if our body becomes filled with the light,
      we literally eat this until our light body exceeding our physical
      body, then we supposedly become light beings. <br>
      <br>
      And our physical body no longer controls our light body, our light
      body now controls our physical body. And anywhere we can think we
      would like to go, we can travel there not only spiritually, but
      physically, and take our physical body with us. Now
      coincidentally, in the Bible, this is referred to as the rapture.
      It says, two will be working in the field and one will be gone,
      two will be laying in bed and one will be gone. It will be a
      physical taking up and disappearing from where you're at. It says
      in Revelations, 'Blessed be the man who will overcome for he shall
      be given the hidden manna, the white stone of purest kind, up on
      which will be written a new name." [Rev. 2:17] You will not be the
      same person you were before you took the material. <br>
      <br>
      It actually says you will have a new name, you will be a different
      person. When you become filled with the spirit, when you become
      filled with the chrism, you are not the same person you were
      before. All of that DNA that these biomedical people can't figure
      out what it's it in your body for, it's actually there to
      function, it just isn't working right now. <br>
      <br>
      Right now we only use 8-10 percent of our brain. What's the other
      90 percent there for? Did we evolve a brain that we don't use? I
      don't think so. It's like at some ancient time we used that brain,
      and we used that DNA, and we were a different perso n. Well that
      sure sounds awfully philosophical, doesn't it. The Bible says that
      at one time we were the Adam Kadmon, we were the angelic being,
      and we have fallen to this animalistic state. But in the Bible, it
      says, that the day will come when the ancient of days returns here
      to Earth. Who is the ancient of days? The ancient of days is the
      Adam Kadmon, the original man And when this man returns here and
      he literally can read your thoughts in your mind without you
      opening your mouth, how much more could you ever be judged? No
      more skeletons in the closet, no more hidden agendas. Everything's
      known. In the Bible they call it the opening of the book of life.
      <br>
      <br>
      It's the time that everything gets judged, everything gets
      revealed. <br>
      <br>
      And then, and only then, will you see Christ again. That's when he
      returns. Okay? In Revelations, it says, the streets of the new
      Jerusalem, will be paved with gold so pure as like unto
      transparent glass. [Rev. 21:21] Gold so pure as like unto
      transparent glass, and the foundations are made of gold like unto
      transparent glass. [Rev. 21:18] <br>
      <br>
      Now if that isn't heavy enough for you, when I found out that the
      name for the golden tree of life was the ORME, ormus or ormes. And
      the name of my patent is Orbitally Rearranged Monatomic Elements.
      In the Book of Isaiah, it says a latter day David, a descendant of
      the Davidic blood line, my cousin, bless her soul joined the
      Mormon Church, and they had her do her genealogy, and my
      great-great-great grandmother, was Hanna de Guise, daughter of
      Christopher de Guise, brother of Charles or Claude de Guise, who
      if you got a copy of "Holy Blood Holy Grail" there, Charles or
      Claude de Guise is in the book. Nostradamus worked for the de
      Guise family and Nostradamus prophesied by 1999 the occult gold
      will be known to science. Very specific prophecy, very exact
      dates, very precise. And a descendent of this family, a latter day
      David, is the one who's to plant the Golden Tree of Life. <br>
      <br>
      And I didn't know any of this when I filed my patent. And so when
      you realize what this is, and you realize what it does, and you
      realize why it's here, then you realize why my job is not to make
      money with it. I can't make money with it. My job is to tell those
      people who are ready for it what the state of things are and when
      it's going to be available. I can't sell it, I will solicit
      donations to cover our costs in producing it. But it has to be
      made available for those people who are ready for it. <br>
      And this is called the Lesser Keys of Solomon, the Keys to the
      Kingdom. <br>
      <br>
      Remember the Petra, the Rock, held the keys to the Kingdom, Peter,
      the Keeper of the Keys? And this is called the Keys to the
      Kingdom. <br>
      <br>
      It's not the answer, but it's the door that unlock, it's the key
      that unlocks the door to the answer. You no longer have to die to
      literally come face to face with the angels, to experience what
      most of these people call, when they died and came back to life,
      it's an unbelievable feeling of oneness. The closest most of you
      will ever be to another person is during the moment of sex. Think
      about it? And yet this is even more than that. Because you're one
      heart and one mind with everyone. Somebody said it would make a
      great title for a book, "Better Than Sex". <br>
      <br>
      Well, it is all about love, total oneness with everyone. It's
      perfect telepathy, perfect communication, it's total love and
      total oneness. <br>
      <br>
      When you understand that superconductors don't have to touch,
      okay, we're back to the science again. In electricity, the wires
      have to touch before electricity can flow from one wire to another
      wire, but superconductors can sit at a distance, and as long as
      they are in resonant harmony, and their Meissner fields touch,
      they are one. Because they flow light between them. So they act as
      one superconductor. So when you are a perfect superconductor, and
      she is a perfect superconductor, you are one with her heart and
      her mind. You know all things about her. Perfect telepathy. <br>
      And that is the Judgment. That is the Oneness. <br>
      <br>
      Now what does it do in the body? It literally corrects the DNA, by
      a process the equivalent of a denaturing solution, the DNA relaxes
      and recombines corrected. So all diseases that originate <br>
      with a problem with the DNA can be corrected, but your reason for
      taking it cannot be to correct a disease. Your reason for taking
      it has to be a philosophical reason. It has to be to enlighten and
      to raise the nature of mankind. If in doing that, it happens to
      cure the diseases, so be it. Anyway I don't want to give all of
      the lecture tomorrow, ah, tomorrow in the workshop, what I want to
      do is we're gonna present transparencies of the history of the
      alchemy, the philosopher's stone. We're going to give you the, a
      bunch of the, the books that I found that are very excellent
      books. We're going to read from some of those and put them up on
      the board, we're going to read from, ah, in addition to the
      science. And so, I hope the workshop will have something for about
      everybody. Ah, I think you all know, most of know what this stuff
      is and why it is here now. Most of you had known it was coming.
      It, eventually, was going to be here. <br>
      <br>
      And, ah, this is an ultra-conservative, right wing, John Birch
      type guy here, and, ah, you know, one who believes that the
      free-enterprise system is the best system given the nature of man
      like he is. He's selfish and he's greedy, and he's to be, tempted
      with money and wealth, and when you understand what this is, this
      changes the nature of man, that literally all of the things we
      value now are no longer important. When you no longer need to eat,
      when you literally can be fed on the resonance fields of the
      universe. All you need is water. When you no longer need energy,
      you can travel anywhere you want just by thinking where you'd like
      to be and be there. When you can live 800-1,000 years with perfect
      body, literally every cell in your body perfected and corrected.
      And then your metabolism speeds up about 45 or 50 percent, you
      return to the state you were when you were a teenager and you can
      stay in that state. This is what the material is. <br>
      <br>
      We don't have all the answers yet. There's a tremendous amount of
      research study that needs to be done by the medical people on it.
      We have an awful lot of doctors already working on it. AIDS,
      cancer all working on it. We have National Institute of Health
      licensing and permitting to do it. And, ah, all I can tell you is
      it's here, it ain't going to go away if you don't believe it, and,
      ah, it will change the world more than anything in the last 2,000
      years. <br>
      <br>
      Okay? [end of lecture]

        <p><b><font size="+1">Questions and Answers</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <br>
      (Question - I'd like to know if you are consuming the substance
      yourself, right now.) <br>
      <br>
      Because I was the discoverer I felt that I should take the
      material first. I started fasting and we didn't know how much to
      take. I was taking the gold in very low amounts. My wife, on about
      the third day, became aware I was taking it and she just went
      ballistic. Ah, you have to meet my wife, she's a very special
      lady, but she had been reading all the alchemical texts from St.
      Germain and all about people's hair falling out, their teeth
      falling out, their skin pealing off, and she just said, "You will
      not take this material without my permission". And out of respect
      to my wife I stopped taking the material, she literally made me
      eat to break the fast. And, ah, since that time we have now five
      people, one in Texas, who are taking it in the high amounts. They
      are people who basically had no wife or children, and no prior
      commitment, and therefore were not afraid of it. So, but, no I
      have not taken it but just very, very low amounts. <br>
      <br>
      (Well can't you take her with you?) <br>
      <br>
      Ah, yep, she's not ready yet. She's getting pretty close, she's
      watched this progress. And she's much more comfortable with it.
      She's, you have to understand I live in a very small agricultural
      community and I cannot speak anything about this to anybody in my
      community. I mean it just goes over their heads completely. <br>
      <br>
      And so, I was really pleased when I went to Global Sciences in the
      Spring of last year and spoke for the first time. I told Dean
      Stonier, don't advertise this, don't tell anyone what I am going
      to talk about. And I really was pleased to see how many people had
      read the books I was referring to, knew about it, were prepared
      for it, and they just were in awe over it. And so, you know, that
      was so well received, I spoke in the Fall once again to Global
      Sciences on this side of the country. I've been over to Hawaii and
      am now speaking here. I, I only have so much material being
      produced. Most of it's going for medical studies and philosophical
      studies and there isn't that much available. You know, we're not
      charging for it for most people, it's being given for free. And
      so, ah, you know, there isn't enough that I can play with it, just
      do what I want with it, so..... <br>
      <br>
      (I'm also interested in the lighter side of sex. When you were
      talking about how when he became a light being that he was
      actually having sex with light beings and I was interested in how
      that might relate to immaculate conception.) <br>
      <br>
      Ah, I'd like to save the subject of the immaculate conception for
      tomorrow's workshop. I will specifically address that, ah,
      because, you know, who the Essenes were, who Mary was, who the
      disciples were, and what it all means, I think is quite
      significant. Um, the literature says that when a person becomes
      the whole light being, that they become the androgynous being,
      because you're immortal you don't have to have children. And so
      sex as most men know it no longer is important. It comes down to
      true and total love with all mankind. And so that, that is more
      than enough for most people's inclinations, I believe, at that
      point. Now, I'll tell you in a month or so how it is, but right
      now that's what it appears like. Any other questions? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - How long then has been the longest person, you're
      saying, that's been on it?) <br>
      <br>
      Well, the first person to take it is 8 1/2 months right now. <br>
      <br>
      (Do they continue to take it everyday?) <br>
      <br>
      No, they took it for the 40 days, actually it's 30 days of taking
      it. <br>
      <br>
      At the end of that they stoped. And it's just, it's called the
      Semen of the God in Heaven. Once you sleep with the guy and the
      semen's in you, and you're pregnant, that's it, you're on your way
      fella and there's no turning back. You're going to have this baby
      in 9 months, so just brace yourself, here it comes. So this is why
      I don't want someone to get on this path and then say, "I change
      my mind". Because you can't undo this, once it's done it's done. <br>
      <br>
      (Can't you have a divorce?) <br>
      <br>
      I don't know how. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - You mentioned that some of these other products had
      this iridium and others in it. Is there some relationship between
      this product that you have and these other products.) <br>
      Oh, certainly, I alluded to in the presentation. That these
      elements are not rare. Diamonds are rare, carbon is everywhere,
      but diamond and carbon are the same element. You know our
      analytical method looks for metals, not for elements. And so, the
      metals are rare because the conditions to make them metallic were
      very unusual, but the elements are everywhere. And, I say
      everywhere, they should be located in, ah .... well, if you talk
      to a nuclear physicist he can tell you exactly in the big bang, in
      the creation, how much of which elements should be here on Earth,
      and for some reason they don't know where the rhodium and iridium
      are. They just don't find it here on Earth. And so they assume
      it's out there in space someplace, in some meteorite, and they
      find this unusual amount of iridium at about 65 million years ago.
      Well the geology that this material is in is exactly 65 million
      years old. And so, coincidentally, it agrees with the volcanic
      activity about 65 million years ago. The elements are quite
      plentiful particularly in volcanic areas or volcanic soil. <br>
      <br>
      Now I will mention, when we analyze the carrot juice, there's a
      high amount of rhodium in carrot juice. I've heard of people
      drinking macro amounts of carrot juice and curing cancer. Well
      rhodium is the cancer cure. The Acemannan is 90 percent rhodium,
      the product that's made here in Texas, the Acemannan. I believe
      Mr. McDaniels who was driving me around today, I plug his product
      because it's probably the best source of rhodium you can buy. And
      if you have cancer you need rhodium in your body. It's the cancer
      cure. And that is one of the best natural sources that we know of
      right now, is the Acemannan. Other than our material which is pure
      rhodium, but I, you know, I can't administer for cancer. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - What plans could you talk about, say, that your plans
      are for the next year?) <br>
      <br>
      Ah, basically, I've expended 5.3 million dollars, out of pocket
      has been expended thus far on the project. I've done everything I
      financially can do at this time. On December 31st, I shut down my
      farming operation. <br>
      <br>
      So, I am operating under faith that there is someone out there who
      will understand this. I'm looking for the money to build a
      production plant. To do exactly what I'm doing in the laboratories
      but do it on a scale up. We're going to process one ton a day of
      the ore, which will give us a bout one million five hundred
      thousand dollars worth of precious elements per day at metals
      prices. It takes about a half an ounce or about, um, what we're
      figuring about $500 worth of precious elements to cure AIDS. Okay?
      Our cost will be about $10,0 00 a day or about $3.50 for enough to
      cure AIDS. Will be our cost. <br>

      (Question - What's the cost of the plant?) <br>
      <br>
      I've got all the budget and everything worked up. If someone's
      interested I can show it to them, it's a business plan and
      everything. I've turned down the money from two different sources
      already that have offered it, but they were Boards of Directors,
      and they were totally profit oriented, and that's not what this is
      going to be done, I mean, ah, um, this is going to make immense of
      amounts of money.... (audience claps) Well, you can't.... If
      Mother Theresa presents herself and she's given everything she
      owns to the poor and she says, "I need it", you gotta give it to
      her. She has no money, you still have to give it to her. So, if
      someone says, "Nope, we're going to make this the highest and
      greatest amount of money we can out of it", no. If you want to
      think about it as a business plan, you can put the stuff into fuel
      cell electrodes, you can deliver it to the Japanese, tell them
      that you their partners now. You're going to furnish electrodes
      for their fuel cells. You don't sell precious metals, you sell
      electricity. Okay, and you still own the precious metals. <br>
      <br>
      Everyday you're making a million and a half dollars worth of
      precious elements and they're going into fuel cells. In a year's
      time you've made 500 million dollars worth of precious elements
      and you now are making the income, everyday, off of those precious
      elements. Which should be around 20-25 percent income off of the
      sale of the electricity. And you still own the precious elements.
      <br>
      <br>
      After 10 years you own more precious elements than anybody else in
      the world. You become the international bankers that are totally,
      100 percent precious metal backed, and you have the income. It's
      not sitting at some bank, it's sitting out there in the world
      working for a living. That's the worst case scenario. <br>
      <br>
      Now the best case scenario is what it does. You know, we have
      given this to HIV patients who could not even speak. They were
      days away from death. They were being fed by IVs. And four or five
      weeks later they were feeding themselves, getting dressed on their
      own and attending family weddings, and flying on airplanes across
      the United States. There's no better feeling. There's no better
      feeling than to help these people that have no hope. <br>
      <br>
      And I can give you the names of the people you can call in the
      Phoenix area who are on this stuff right now, and they'll tell
      you, "We're alive today because of this material". You can call
      them up and talk to them personally. I just can't put it on tape,
      that's all. Any other questions? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - I'm sure you probably have all the volunteers you can
      use?) <br>
      <br>
      How about 8,732? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Okay. Want another one? When is this substance going
      to be available for folks like us?) <br>
      <br>
      It's going to take about a year and a half from the time that I
      get the funding, and I thought I would have the funding before
      now. I have probably 8 different people who have the money, who
      said they want to do it, but no one's written the check yet, and
      until that time, you know, it's....... I just, I make about 2,000
      milligrams every two days in the laboratory right now, and, ah,
      but more importantly, I think it's the...., you know, what I'm
      doing right now is I'm out telling people about it. I'm going to
      speak in Florida, I'm going to be up in New England, I'm going to
      be in the Midwest, and basically, I've been up in Seattle, and
      it's going to be just seeding information. And then that's about
      enough. I'll depend on you to tell your friends ab out it. <br>
      <br>
      When it's available, you know, you'll know about it, I guarantee
      it, you'll hear about it. It's going to be heavy. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - You're looking for just one investor, or.......?) <br>
      <br>
      I'm looking to deal with private individuals not corporations. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - So, it could be like more than one individual?) <br>
      <br>
      Sure. Certainly. It's just, I have to meet them and be
      comfortable, they know what they're getting involved in, before I
      can accept their money though. Anybody else? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Yeah, I wanted to ask you a question. You said the
      gentleman that was taking this that was basically healthy, and had
      taking it, what, 30 or 40 days. And then heard the sounds and
      things like that, okay? Apparently could know people that were
      coming before they arrived. The people that were ill and took it
      and then became well, did they have the same experiences as the
      healthy man who took it?) <br>
      <br>
      Okay, do understand that .... the question was, "Do the people who
      take it for the medicinal purposes have the same things happen to
      them as the people who took it for philosophical reasons?" First
      of all, the fellow who took it for philosophical reaso ns fasted
      for 40 days and took 500 mg. per day, the people who took it for
      medicine took 50 mg. a day. So, you know, there's a big..... <br>
      <br>
      (Question - They didn't have any of the side benefits?) <br>
      <br>
      They didn't.....no one has commented on the sound, however it is
      coincidental to me that the lady who had the stage 4 cancer now is
      a Sikh, wears the white robes and everything. The two AIDS
      patients say that they have never been religious, but they just
      feel more one with their Creator. They just feel like there's a
      oneness. <br>
      <br>
      And I've never solicited this information. They don't know
      anything about the other people. It's curious that, of what they
      are telling me. So it is changing the way they see themselves in
      the life process. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Thank-you.) <br>
      <br>
      Okay. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Are you going to write a book?) <br>
      <br>
      Ah, yes. I'm supposed to meet with a lady on Sunday afternoon here
      in Dallas. She's one of the top people that handle these things,
      and, ah, I had a contract with a fellow but he never signed the
      contract with his people. And so I wrote him a letter saying, ya
      know, if you don't get all the signatures, I'm canceling out. <br>
      <br>
      And it took me awhile for all the legal processes to occur, and
      now, it's supposed to be, Kathy Lee Crosby is, is, her book was
      done by a lady here in Dallas, and she's wanting me to meet this
      lady. The lady's seen the tapes and very interested in the story.
      It's basically my quest for the Holy Grail and my achievement of
      it. <br>
      <br>
      In the last chapter, is this man taking it in the high amounts and
      what happens to him. It's the Celestine prophecy except it's not
      fiction. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Mm-mm, I have read that and am studying it presently.
      Thank-you.) <br>
      <br>
      Okay. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Yes, my question to you David is, ah, I think it's
      nothing short of a miracle that, ah, the medical profession wants
      to, ah, work with you, and secondly, ah, I'm amazed that the
      pharmaceutical cartels don't have a, have you on their hit lists ,
      and how you are going to deal with that?) <br>
      <br>
      That's a good question, my..... I don't understand why so many
      people have so many problems because I've never been confronted or
      never had any problems with anyone to date, other than the
      military. The military wanted to know about the superconductivity
      and all. <br>
      <br>
      But, when you understand what this is, why it's here. As long as I
      am not charging money for it, as long as it's being administered
      for philosophical reasons. When you understand this is the Manna,
      this is something other people haven't figured out yet, but this
      is the Manna. And after tomorrow's workshop you'll agree it's the
      Manna. There won't be any question in your mind, you will know
      that's what it is. <br>
      <br>
      [1:47:10] And what judge and jury, what administrator in the
      government would dare take the Manna from a church? Now I know
      they try, I know they will try, but we do have this basic concept
      of separation of church and state, and this isn't peyote, this is
      the Manna. And this is a Christian nation as a whole, you know,
      it's generally a Christian nation. To take the Manna from someone
      for philosophical reasons, to take it away from you, I just, I
      just don't think they got "you know what" enough to do that. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Well, continued safe journey.) <br>
      <br>
      We'll try. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - I want to thank you for being here tonight. In your
      presence is my alchemical mentor, my instructor, I'm an apprentice
      alchemist. <br>
      <br>
      And Hans is sitting back there with some of my fellow students. <br>
      <br>
      Um, but the subject that's on my mind, the so und in the head or
      above the head that they're experiencing. When I was rather young,
      in my twenties, on several occasions I heard what's called the
      "music of the spheres", which the founder of the Sufi order, Haza
      Renya Kahn, relates somehow to the "Na da". And I don't know
      exactly how that sound relates to the "music of the spheres",
      which I have heard...) <br>
      <br>
      It is the same sound. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - That sound is with me continuously and I once asked a
      swami what it was and he defined it as the "Nada", and I suspected
      that it related to the Kundalini, but I don't know that much about
      the Kundalini.) <br>
      <br>
      How many of you are aware of "The Book of Knowledge: The Keys of
      Enoch". <br>
      <br>
      Look on page 497, on page 497, in the "Keys of Enoch", written in
      1975 before nuclear physicists knew any of this, he said that
      scientists will learn how the nucleus can change it's symmetry,
      which is what this does. How the electron orbitals reconfigure
      themselves and the electron-positron pairs will form, which are
      light. <br>
      <br>
      The Nobel prize hasn't been given for the BCS theory of
      superconductivity. Here is a man who is a profess or of ancient
      languages, writing 10 years before it was discovered by science,
      that this discovery would be made. He also talks on page 486 about
      the high frequency sound, that will be the frequency over which
      the paranormal gifts will be granted to man kind. And of course,
      all through the book he talks about the ore ion energy, the gold
      atom energy, the highest light energy. Go back and read the "Keys
      of Enoch" now and see if it doesn't mean a whole lot more to you.
      Okay. <br>
      <br>
      "The Book of Knowledge: Keys of Enoch", by J.J. Hertach. It's a
      large, white, hard-bound book, says "Yahweh" on the front of it,
      Y-H-W-H. I don't know who asked that. I can't see, I got bright
      lights over here. Yes ma'am? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - You mentioned that there are people that are in jail
      now that had been talking about the platinum group elements, and,
      were any of those people sincere and is there any action that you
      might be able to take to help them?) <br>
      <br>
      Yeah, I don't consider them frauds the way most people do. I think
      that most of the people were sincere in that they believed the
      elements really were there. I believe they were sincere in
      representing they were there in raising money. What they, the
      mistake that most of them made is they represented they would
      recover them and have a business in a couple of years. And they
      weren't in a position they really could make those
      representations. It took me 18 years and 5.3 million dollars and I
      don't ha ve all the answers yet. <br>
      <br>
      I mean, we're on the learning curve right now. We're learning
      everyday about this. So, for the average person, if you want to
      get involved in this subject, I tell you, brace yourself, you've
      got a long, hard, tedious journey. My wife gets upset because I go
      and talk to people, she says, "You're laying all this out for
      people", but it's like me writing a book on playing concert piano.
      You could read a book on playing concert piano, but that doesn't
      mean you sit down and play the concert piano. It would take years
      and years and years of practice. And as simple as this might sound
      on paper, it still, there's still an awful lot of art involved.
      And so, I feel comfortable talking to people about it, even though
      I'm telling you everything about it, there's still a lot of work
      involved in it. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Can I ask one other question?) <br>
      <br>
      Sure. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Did you mention what kind of budget you're looking at
      to set up the operation. The operation you want to set up?) <br>
      I haven't given the amount because most people aren't interested
      in it, but if you know somebody who's specifically interested and
      they have the capability of funding or funding some aspect, I'll
      be happy to lay all of the specifics out for you. Okay? Yes sir? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - There's something that happened here recently, David,
      that I wanted to bring to your attention. Ah, after we listened to
      your audio tape, and what you were into, the Manna, and
      everything, and we're taking, right now, a course in sacred
      geometry, where we're studying the ancient pyramids, and what the
      king's chamber was actually used for in the Great Pyramid, which
      I'm sure you're aware of. Because it was like the, where the Rite
      of Passage was administered. Ah, we have some friends that wrote
      the book, "The Pyramid Energy", by Marion and Dean Hardy, and
      they're in the Socratronics Association....) <br>
      <br>
      She was in Phoenix about three days ago with me. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Well, what happened is, is we called Marion and Dean
      and said since you have this 24 foot square pyramid out in your
      back yard, why don't you take a piece of pure gold and hang it at
      the king's chamber exact location in your pyramid and see what
      happens to the gold. So Dean went out and said, "Well we're not
      using the pyramid right now for anything", so they took a glass of
      distilled water and they hung the little piece of gold, they
      actually took a gold Krugerrand coin, and hung it over the glass
      of distilled water, and left it for three days, and when Dean went
      back out there, it had this honey dew on the Krugerrand. So he
      dunked the Krugerrand in this glass of distilled water and drank
      it. Well he actually overdosed on it as you well know. It gave him
      a thorough cleansing, but Dean says now he feels like he's about
      18 years old. And they're actually treating some people, friends
      of theirs who are ill, and they're having good results from it.
      I'm sure that they may have related this to you.) <br>
      <br>
      Now that's what she shared with me also. I can tell you, if she's
      getting results, I can give you a thousand times those results. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - But it was interesting though that at the exact
      location of the sarcophagus in the king's chamber, hanging this
      piece of gold in a pyramid, does form the dew, or the unrefined
      version, I guess, of the .......) <br>
      <br>
      I don't know if, you maybe read about the Great Pyramid, but when
      they opened the Great Pyramid, in the king's chamber they found it
      totally empty except for this white powder all over the king's
      chamber. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Yeah, and the white powder, there was, ah, so much of
      it in the sarcophagus, that they figured there had to been,
      thousands of people have, have, ah, have reclined in this, and
      went through this rite, for there to be that much powder in there.
      Because, isn't there a secretion that comes out on the forehead,
      here, that causes the accumulation of the white powder?) <br>
      I don't think so, I think this is just the material that was being
      used in there that was spilled. Um, you know, the Great Pyramid,
      of course, is quite a scientific mystery to most people, why it
      was built, why it's the way it is. But, ah, the white powder, I
      would give anything to have just a few milligrams of the white
      powder that actually we know came out of the Great Pyramid.
      Because it will analyze to be alumina or silica, it's the only
      thing it will analyze to be, and so you'll assume there's nothing
      to it, and you just dispose of it. But it's not alumina or
      silica.... <br>
      <br>
      (Question - It's really your Manna.) <br>
      <br>
      I think so. Anyway, that's my opinion. I haven't got any to
      analyze, but I can tell you that the Vibuti, the Sai Baba
      manifest, in fact is iridium in the high-spin state. That we have
      analyzed, and he does ingest this material. Iridium polymerizes
      with hydrochloric acid, in the stomach you have hydrochloric acid
      and so when you take it in high amounts in your stomach and then
      he regurgitates this, and they call it, this plastic looking
      material they call Lingam. The word Lingam actually means semen.
      Well this Lingam he regurgitates and they worship it as the holy
      material, and he literally eats it in macro amounts. His body is
      totally saturated, and they claim he can bio-locate.
      Coincidentally. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Who is this?) <br>
      <br>
      Sai Baba. Who asked the question? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - I am so excited with what you're doing. I've been
      working with pyramids and different sacred geometry structures for
      the last eight years or so. And as you were talking they were
      given me little visions of the different geometric configurations
      as that transmutational process goes on. And it's like confirming
      stuff that I've been seeing for a long time. This is tremendously
      exciting to me to feel that, hey, I'm not as nuts as you knew you
      were at times.) <br>
      <br>
      The thing that I try to impress on people is when you are in this
      enlightened state, you no longer have to read books, you no longer
      have to study, because you just know things. And there's no
      scientific explanation how you can know these things. You just
      know things. Sacred geometry will be totally and completely
      obvious to us, what it means, how it functions, when you are in
      this state. We're wrestling with it, trying to understand it,
      trying to figure it out, but when you're in this state it's all
      obvious. It's just simple as it can be. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - In terms of the pitch of that note that their hearing
      through the Chad or the Bod or whatever word you want to call it,
      have you documented that pitch?) <br>
      <br>
      Ah, no we haven't and the reason for that is, the frequency
      actually is resonating at the Planckian vibrations frequency. The
      brain perceives it as a high pitch sound, but it really isn't a
      high pitch sound, it's only that the brain perceives it as a high
      pitch sound. Now, can that sound be inputted into the person and
      conversely affect this material? I don't know. I don't know.
      There's been some.... there's people work with sound, and sound
      energies and all, who are playing with this right now, but, ah,
      you know, what I am working on is consuming all of my time, and I
      feel, that priority-wise, I have to work where I am working now. <br>
      <br>
      But, ah, what's going on right now, if this guy reaches a state
      where he can levitate and bio-locate, I don't mean be in 2 or 3
      places at one time. I mean disappear here and reappear over here.
      This is going to be heavy duty. Because that means anyone can do
      it. It doesn't require faith, it doesn't require belief, it's just
      a procedural thing you have to go through. <br>
      <br>
      And if this occurs, and maybe it's going to take me another month
      or two or three or four or five before we get there. But it's
      going to be serious, because that means anyone can do it with that
      amount of material. And this man had no philosophical beliefs or
      anything, he just wanted the truth, he just wanted to know what
      was happening. So, it's going to be heavy. Okay? Yes sir? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - I was wondering, when the gentleman mentioned about
      the pyramid, if you took that white powder and put it in the
      king's chamber, and has anybody done that yet, and would it make,
      do think it would make it anymore purified or not? Or, its just a
      thought?) <br>
      <br>
      Ah, I'll give you my opinion of what I think, how I think the
      king, the Great Pyramid... You know that the Great Pyramid was,
      had an overlay of the white limestone, and was painted in rainbow
      colors as they went up the side of it. But the capstone of the
      Great Pyramid was gold glass, was a superconductor. Literally the
      Great Pyramid was actually dug down and built on solid bedrock
      because the Earth vibrates the Om vibration, the low frequency
      vibration, then transfers up through the pyramid into the
      superconducting material and literally is the vibration that
      charges the superconductor. And I believe that when the gold glass
      capstone was on the Great Pyramid, that literally at night, it
      glowed. And can you imagine what a sight it had to be to be coming
      across the desert and see this huge white, rainbow colored pyramid
      with this huge glow of light on the top of it. You know? <br>
      <br>
      I think that when you understand that there is no distance through
      the zero point energy, and that when the pharaoh or the high
      priest became the light being, they became the son of god. You
      know, you are born again as the son of god, which is what the
      pharaoh claimed to be, a son of god. That literally this is the
      communication device, this is the way that you're able to project
      your thoughts through this huge superconducting pyramid, that you
      now are within that field, and can project your thoughts using
      that, which makes you much more powerful than you would be as an
      individual. <br>
      <br>
      And so, ah, the whole concept of the way the society was at old
      kingdom Egypt, and the way it operated. When you literally have a
      king that is like a god, who knows all lies, all truths, you know
      everything. This is completely different from anything we've ever
      known. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - I also wanted to make a comment that there's a, you
      mentioned the "hu", there's several groups that sing the "hu" is a
      love song of the gods, and there's some spiritual chemistry that
      seems to go on with that, so I thought that was interesting.
      Thank-you.) <br>
      <br>
      Okay. Well I think......... <br>
      <br>
      (Question - I mentioned in the newsletter a couple of things that
      I found very fascinating when you and I were having our
      conversation. One was about the fact that there was a Meissner
      field that enabled the priest to approach the Ark of the Covenant
      without being killed. And I'd like if you would if you could tell
      us a little about that. And also about the air lift of the Black
      Jesus and what you think that was about?) <br>
      <br>
      Well, ah, I felt I talked enough about science, so I didn't want
      to go anymore in that way, I wanted to get to the philosophy
      because that's what everyone wanted to hear anyway. You got to
      talk about the science so that the reality of it all is there.
      But, in fact, when you understand that superconductivity is not
      electricity, superconductivity is like a world of it's own. A
      material that is a superconductor literally, a superconductor
      contains one vibrational frequency within the superconductor. One
      vibrational frequency, a lot like a laser. That this light flows
      perpetually within the system. That no where in the system is
      there any voltage. So you can't hook up a wire here and a wire
      here to the superconductor and get current to flow in and out of
      the superconductor, because to get current to get off of the wire,
      you've got to have a voltage to get current on the wire, you got
      to have a little voltage and yet by definition a superconductor
      won't allow any voltage. So the material's a perfect insulator not
      a superconductor. But if you resonance frequency tune the wire so
      that the electrons vibrate at the same frequency as the
      superconductor, then the electrons will flow on as light, as
      electron pairs. They will pair up and flow on, because they're
      seeking the path of least resistance which is the superconductor.
      Okay? <br>
      <br>
      So, it is different than an ordinary conductor and shouldn't be
      thought of as electricity, it's light. All right, now, the amazing
      thing is, if you resonance frequency tune this conductor to the
      frequency of the superconductor then energy starts flowing on, but
      it's flowing on as light. Any amount of light can exist in the
      same space-time. There's only so much electricity can flow on the
      conductor, but light can flow on forever. And so it just flows on
      and flows on and flows on and flows on, but you don't have to take
      it off... Now around the superconductor it forms a Meissner field.
      The Meissner field has no north or south pole, it's just a field,
      but it's unique in that it has no north or south pole. The
      largeness of that magnetic field is proportional to the amount of
      light that is flowing within the superconductor. <br>
      <br>
      Okay, so, in the Ark of the Covenant was the pot of the Manna, and
      the stone through which god spoke to Moses. Now when Moses was up
      on Mt. Sinai, he was smelting the Manna to the gold glass. And why
      do I say that? Well, when you understand that in old kingdom Egypt
      these were called bushes not eyelashes. These were bushes, check
      you're Egyptian literature. The burning bush was the enlightened
      Third Eye. <br>
      <br>
      And so Moses on Mt. Sinai, when he looked upon the burning bush,
      was just a mistranslation, it was the third eye was open and god
      communicated to him through this stone. God didn't write on the
      stone, if he wrote on the stone why would he put it in a box, seal
      it up and then let no one look at it? If god wrote on it he would
      put it up on the wall where everybody could read it. And when you
      realize that in old kingdom Egypt, that on the holiest day in old
      kingdom of Egypt, in the "Sign of the Seal" you read this, that
      they carried around an Ark on two poles, and in the Ark was a
      stone. Coincidentally what was in the Ark of the Covenant? A
      stone. The pot of Manna and the stone. The gold glass. <br>
      <br>
      And I'm saying that around the Ark of the Covenant was the
      Meissner field. Now, the strange thing about a Meissner field is
      other Meissner fields, that oscillates at the same frequency, can
      enter that field and not perturb it. And so if you are a high
      priest, a Melchizedek priest, and you eat this Bread of the
      Presence of God every week, you are a light being, and you can
      enter into that field and approach the Ark of the Covenant and not
      perturb it because you're in resonance with it. But if you're an
      ordinary soldier or a person who thinks bad things, ha-ha-ha, you
      know, they have to tie a rope around your legs because as you
      approach it, it may have a flux collapse. Now if you can imagine
      several hundred thousand amps and now you have volts, it's like a
      bolt of lightning. It literally is energy that is of unbelievable
      magnitude. <br>
      <br>
      So as long as there is no volts, you could touch it, you could
      feel it, it's hundreds of thousands of amps, but no tickle, no
      tingle, because there's no volts. So as long as you're in
      resonance with it you can approach it, you could touch it, you
      could hold it, you could feel it, nothing. But if you're not in
      resonance with it, you enter the field, you perturb the resonance,
      and it's a flux collapse, and now you've got voltage, and it'll
      kill you. <br>
      <br>
      Remember they said in the Bible that the Ark of the Covenant
      actually levitated and floated along and actually carried some of
      the people who were carrying it. The only thing to do that's a
      superconductor. <br>
      <br>
      Okay, what was the other thing you wanted me to talk about? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - The airlift, the airlift of the Jews.) <br>
      <br>
      Oh. Yeah, you'll find after Graham Hancock's, if you read his
      book, that you'll find out that the Ark of the Covenant went to
      Ethiopia eventually, was out on a lake and all, and ended being in
      one of the cities of Ethiopia, it's my opinion, and this is
      strictly my opinion, but if you look at the chain of events. I
      believe that Jerusalem, that the people in, the Hebrew people that
      are in Israel right now made an agreement to bring the Falasha
      Jews out of Ethiopia. They brought the black Jews out, with all
      their AIDS and all the problems they had and everything, they
      brought them into Israel. Remember that big airlift where they
      airlifted everyone in, but the reason they did it is because they
      were offered the Ark of the Covenant. And I believe they got the
      Ark of the Covenant in exchange for bringing those Jews in. That's
      my personal opinion. <br>
      <br>
      And I've been offered laboratory facilities, money, everything, if
      I'll take this to Jerusalem and work with it, and I just know I'll
      never get out of Jerusalem, if I ended up going over there. And
      so, I'm not going to Jerusalem with it. But, ah, they, the
      government knows about this. Any other questions? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - I wanted to mention that you've referred to Graham
      Hancock and the "Sign and the Seal" several times. He will be our
      speaker probably the end of April or the first of May, so you all
      can hear him.) <br>
      <br>
      Okay, it is a super book and I strongly recommend it for you
      people to read. If you read "Holy Blood Holy Grail", you'll find
      out all about my family and the de Guises and the de Lorraines,
      and the family that's supposed to be the one that does this, and
      then of course, "The Sign and the Seal", it adds another dimension
      to why the Templars were arrested. They actually were caretakers
      for the Ark of the Covenant. They met the leader in Jerusalem and
      went back to Ethiopia with him and put him back on the throne, and
      they were the ones that cared for the Ark of the Covenant. And
      when the Pope found out about it, mm-mm, you don't do that,
      everything comes to Rome, and so he had them killed. You'll hear
      all about that in Graham Hancock, a very good book. It's just a
      story about it that is documented in Ethiopia. Basically they have
      had no contact with Rome for a thousand, thousands of years, and
      so their society is still like, like society was about 1,500 B.C.
      Their Jewish customs and everything and so. I think it's very
      interesting to read it and see the information he's dug up and put
      in this book. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - And we do have copies of "The Holy Blood Holy Grail".
      Some of you said that you couldn't find it, so we've got some
      paperbacks.) <br>
      <br>
      It's a little tough to read because it's got so many names in it.
      But, ah, what that book's all about is, is the people who wrote of
      Michael Vigen, his emphasis was on Christ having children by Mary
      Magdalene. And that's of no consequence, it means nothing. The
      significance of that family and what's going on is that there's a
      Davidic blood line. And there, God made a covenant with David that
      he and his descendants would be kings forever. God didn't make
      many covenants. And that particular covenant is why Christ had to
      be of the Davidic blood line and it is a prophecy that a
      descendant of that family will do this work. <br>
      <br>
      Yes? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Since you're a farmer and we know that a lot of things
      like the cell structure of plants and so forth like that grow on
      this kind of electrical type energy. Is it possible then to take a
      piece of this, treat it like a homeopathic preparation, spray it
      on the fields like bio-dynamic type farming and so forth, and have
      just absolute abundance of food crops available in very small
      pieces of land?) <br>
      <br>
      I know that iridium can control the vibrational frequency of 56
      molecules of water. But I don't think it goes much further than
      that, and so I don't think that it is like mostly homeopathic
      preparations where you can dilute, dilute, dilute, dilute and get
      stronger and stronger and stronger. Ah, the interesting thing is
      though that when you distill water, you assume you have purified
      water, the oroides, the iridides, the rhodides act more like
      iodide than they do like metals and they actually will distill
      along with the water. And so what you think is high purity, what
      you're observing and studying as water may in fact not be pure
      water. Something to think about anyway. Another question? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Could you discuss for just a minute, about, ah, you
      were discussing, talking about DNA and since DNA is like a
      caduceus. If you could talk a minute the characteristics of this
      life force, as you understand it. The "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" [context
      seems to indicate two words that apply to caduceus "idha? and
      pengala?"], the, ah, as it is seen in the caduceus.) <br>
      <br>
      Ah, I'm really not trained in that area and I feel a little bit
      uncomfortable talking about it. In the workshop tomorrow I will
      present the papers and the references and the people's names who
      are doing the work. And you can read the papers yourself and see
      what your opinion of it is. You know, this isn't really so much my
      work, it's my understanding of these elements, but the effect that
      these elements have on the body are other people's work. So it
      really wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on their work.
      But I, I think it's, all I need to do is show you their papers,
      say, read it, what does it say here, you know, you read along with
      me, see what your opinion of it is. They say it's a denatured
      relaxation of the DNA and a recombination corrected, and I
      strongly encourage you to read "The Keys of Enoch" because he
      describes this also, what is going on. <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Well because I was interested in, this is, ah, a
      wisdom of the ancients, that it was, this caduceus, you know,
      spinning one way of female energy and the other spinning the other
      way, was the male energy. This...) <br>
      <br>
      I think you'll find what they mean by that is it's the
      electromagnetic null, and whether you're talking about Tesla
      coils, in the center of the coil is an electromagnetic null. The
      Yin and the Yang is the two opposites, but in the center is the
      null. <br>
      <br>
      (The balance.) <br>
      <br>
      The balance. The nothing that's everything. <br>
      <br>
      (The Void.) <br>
      <br>
      The Void, the vacuum, the zero point energy. And the physicist
      will tell you that in the vacuum, if you take all the matter in
      the universe and totally convert it to nuclear energy, there is
      more energy in the void or vacuum than there is in all the
      material universe converted to nuclear energy. <br>
      <br>
      So, that's where everything is. And it's my opinion that is where
      you will meet your god, face to face, is right there, where it all
      began, where it all came from, the vacuum. <br>
      <br>
      Okay? Another one? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - I'm a farm boy so let's go back to farming. Ah, in
      relationship to how this might be of benefit to the farmer, have
      you heard of Dr. Heironimus' "cosmic tide"?) <br>
      <br>
      Have I heard it? <br>
      <br>
      (Have you heard of it?) <br>
      <br>
      Oh, yes, yes. yeah. <br>
      <br>
      (Okay.) <br>
      <br>
      You know the whole concept of, what do they call it, radionics? <br>
      <br>
      (Eloptic energy is his patent.) <br>
      <br>
      Yeah, the concept of the resonance vibrations of the Earth, the
      concepts of magnetic fields, the concepts of time, all of these
      all are predicated based on there being an underlying
      communication network that has no distance, no time. <br>
      <br>
      For those of you who are interested, did you know that NASA has
      learned that you can scrape tissue out of the checks of the
      astronauts, and put the equivalent of a lie detector instrument on
      the tissue and that when the astronaut is out there, you know,
      millions of light years away, that when he's subjected to stress,
      that the cells instantaneously experience stress here on Earth
      even though they're not in his body. <br>
      <br>
      And they've actually done this and proven it and so, because it
      takes hours for the radio transmission to come back, then to sort
      through, send it back, what to do, but the very instant he
      experiences stress they know it, even though his radio
      transmission hasn't come. They know that there is a communication
      capable instantaneous between these body parts from that person
      and that person. It isn't broken when it's taken out of his body.
      They know that. They're working with radionics. They know about
      this. <br>
      <br>
      (I knew that NASA was using this technology, some.....) <br>
      <br>
      I know that they're very intrigued and interested in it, let's put
      it that way. <br>
      <br>
      (But, from you, have you found some specific correlation's for the
      farmer?) <br>
      <br>
      No. Nothing of consequence, other than, then when these elements
      are present you have extremely great agricultural production. And
      you'll see that over in Hawaii, and places where there is volcanic
      ash and soil, um, the production is just unbelievably dense.
      Everything grows lush and so, I know that these elements are
      critical for there to be proper life. I know these elements must
      be present. And if you mix all of, you know, they, they, how many
      times have you heard, if you analyze the human body, you find out
      exactly what's supposed to be in the body and you mix all of these
      elements together in those proportions, and you add water and all
      gases to it, and everything, but it doesn't come to life. Because
      you know, if you take these elements and put them into pure water
      and subject it to the air, that literally they begin to assimilate
      and grow these long chain polymers that you actually can see, and
      they respond to sunlight and they're actually catalysts that take
      nitrogen out of the air and carbon monoxide out of the air, and
      assimilate it in these long chain polymers. <br>
      <br>
      Did you know that this man up in Canada called Gaston Naessens,
      who has this material called somatids, which means "little bitty
      things", but their .6 to 1.8 angstroms in dimensions. You know
      that rhodium is .6 and iridium is 1.8 angstroms in dimensions. And
      that they're in your blood naturally and they are literally what
      grows the structures of life. <br>
      <br>
      Did you know that this man, Merkle, in El Paso, Texas, has the
      "life crystals", you know, that is pure gold, and he doesn't know
      it, he calls it ATP. Once you know this, I mean, you begin to see
      the science in all of this and the explanations for it, and it
      begins to make total sense what's going on out there. There is
      real science behind these herbs, there is real science behind
      these medicines, there is stuff in the herbal materials that do
      cure AIDS and cancer. And if, ah, I took it to the Mayo Clinic and
      presented to the Head of Research there, and you know what he said
      to me, he didn't say, "Dave, I think you're crazy", he didn't say,
      "Dave I think you're out of left field", he didn't say, "Dave if
      you'll pay for it we'll try to evaluate it", he said, "Dave, this
      is illegal". <br>
      Now when you really realize that the Mayo Clinic is about nothing
      but making money. I mean, it's that simple. They have a Board of
      Directors, their job is to make money. If they don't make money,
      they don't stay in business. They don't care about curing cancer,
      their job is to treat cancer not to cure cancer. And that's what
      they want. And, you know, if that's on tape, so be it, that's what
      the man said to me. And then he wanted me to give him the names of
      the doctors who were working with me, and he said, "I'll see to it
      that they're turned over to the proper authorities". Yeah, yeah. I
      said, "Thank-you very much, this dumb farmer has got to go home".
      I walked out. Yes sir? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - Thank-you very much for what you have presented. I
      find the very, extraordinary phenomena that you have talked about
      very believable because of experiences that I and friends have had
      in the past, and one I wanted to tell you about, is a very close
      personal friend at one point had an instantaneous teleportation in
      a situation of great need to save the life of her child. And she
      has spent her entire life dedicated to her own spiritual
      development and to healing other people through prayer. <br>
      <br>
      She was at one end of the house in the kitchen and she just saw
      clearly that her little child on the tricycle was behind a car
      backing out of the neighbor's garage, and she turned to run
      through the house and was right there by the window and stopped
      the car. <br>
      <br>
      Another friend of hers was scaling a rock, doing some rock
      climbing one time, alone with no rope, no help, anything, and she
      got totally stuck. And she prayed very.... and this lady also
      spent her life devoted to spiritual development, and she prayed
      very deeply to God at that point, and she heard a voice that said,
      "Take off the cape and throw it to the ground", and when she did
      that she was instantaneously standing on the ground with the cape.
      So I fully accept that these things that you are talking about can
      happen.) <br>
      <br>
      Well most people don't. I mean, they don't. And you know, what we
      need to do, is get to the point where it isn't an issue of faith,
      it isn't an issue of belief, it is a scientifically reproducible
      understandable phenomenon. And that is what my job is, is to bring
      scientific credibility and understanding to things that otherwise
      have had no scientific understanding behind them. And so, you
      know, this will go to the world of science. It will not go to the
      world of philosophy and religion, because science can take it in
      three or four years, and religion has been trying to do it for
      2,000 years and has failed miserably. <br>
      <br>
      And, you know, the churches are not going to receive this very
      well. But if you remember in the Bible, you can sin against God
      and you can sin against Christ, and you can be forgiven, but
      there's one sin you never can commit and that's to sin against the
      Holy Ghost or the light body. Because when you have the light
      body, when you're a "high priest", when you know all things and
      then you sin, it's an unforgivable sin. And so, in the Bible it
      says, in the end times, that we, that there will be a nation of
      high priests, not an elect high priesthood, and that's why it has
      to be given to everyone who seeks it for the proper reasons. And
      literally everyone who's ready to open that door and step through,
      I have to hand them the key. That doesn't mean they're going to go
      through, but I have to hand it to them because at the time they're
      ready, it has to be available to them. <br>
      <br>
      And you know, it's probably the most serious decision you're every
      going to make in your life. Because something shouldn't be taken
      very lightly, a lot of people go, "I'm next, I'm next". No, think
      about it, convince me you know what we're talking about and you're
      ready to do that. If you're the wealthiest man in the world,
      you're 95 year of age and you're on your death bed and dying, and
      someone tells you can live 800 years, he'll give you everything
      he's got. What good is to him if he dies? In the next 800 years he
      can make it many times over. And yet if we all have to wait until
      we're right there at our death bed before we understand what this
      is all about. It is literally changing the nature of mankind. Very
      serious decision. It's a very serious decision. You will not be
      the same person you are now. It deserves some real serious thought
      and contemplation. <br>
      <br>
      Okay, so we wrap it up and then the workshop...... oh, we got one
      more. Yes ma'am? <br>
      <br>
      (Question - All right, I was curious about, ah, how it came about
      that you found out about Sai Baba's Vibuti containing rhodium?) <br>
      <br>
      A lady in Phoenix just had some of it in a bag. She had been over
      there and seen him and she said here's the Vibuti, you know, can
      you find out what it is. And so, it was the cinder material and
      apparently it was made by a burning process, it wasn't that that
      came out of his hands. Because we looked at it under our
      microscope and there was carbon ash in it, so there was some
      carbon ash, but the rest of the material was pure iridium. <br>
      <br>
      And I believe that there's certain plants that they pick over in
      India that they put on the sacred pyres, that burn always and
      never go out, and I believe that this, they are burning all of the
      carbon out of this. And then they take that ash and water wash it,
      which gets rid of the alkali salts, the alkaline metals, and these
      plants just happen to be very high in iridium. <br>
      <br>
      And that's how I think they come up with it. That's my opinion.
      Now I know Sai Baba claims, everybody claims he manifests it out
      of the air, well if so, his body is so saturated with it that it
      literally is coming out of his hands. That's the only explanation
      I have for it. Because I am, believe it or not, as philosophical
      as I sound, I really am my own worst enemy. I'm a very severe
      critic myself. <br>
      <br>
      (I've made two trips to India and it's been awhile since I've been
      there. I spent 3 months in 1978 with Sai Baba, in two main
      ashrams, and I was very close to him on several occasions, and I
      saw him manifest other things besides the Vibuti....) <br>
      <br>
      That's what I told you, he manifests jewelry, gold objects.... <br>
      <br>
      (It affects you spiritually. I saw people change spiritually,
      mentally, physically. A man got out of a wheelchair and walked and
      never went back to it while I was there.) <br>
      <br>
      But did you know him before, know that he hadn't been brought in
      by him, you know, that he didn't walk before? <br>
      <br>
      (No, I didn't know that man personally myself.) <br>
      <br>
      You see, this, this, I'm a skeptic, I always have to ask these
      questions, you know, but...... <br>
      <br>
      (But when people that I knew at the beginning of the trip in one
      ashram and then we go to another one, and they tell me I have
      changed. And I knew I had but I didn't know that other people
      could see it. I think it really affects your life. But after I did
      see him manifest the Vibuti you do begin to believe in miracles if
      you hadn't before. So I believe in, what you have discovered, for
      this reason.....) <br>
      <br>
      Well, for those people who are not physicists and don't understand
      what I am talking about, the John Hagland who is the head of
      physics at MIU back in Iowa, who ran for president. Some of you
      remember him, he ran for president on the Natural Law Party. Ah,
      he's right behind Ross Perot's advertisements when he ran, you
      know, anyway, a very good looking fellow. I met with him for about
      three days back at MIU and went over all the physics and
      everything with it. He went over and told the Maharishi Mahesh
      Yogi who has a degree in physics. The Maharishi said, "This is the
      stuff that will allow us to live a thousand years". The Maharishi
      has never ever endorsed a western technology ever until he heard
      about this. He said, "This is the stuff". <br>
      You know, I have to go through all the testing. I have to see it
      myself. I have to get it to where it's independently confirmable
      by other people. But, ah, I've seen enough right now. It's really
      concerning me that all of it is correct, because everything fits
      this far. So, you know, we got about another month or two before
      we get through with this with the first guy, but it sure looks
      serious to me. <br>
      <br>
      Anyway, that's it for right now. Tomorrow we'll get into the
      specifics of it.

      <p><b>Introduction by Cheyenne Turner:</b> </p>
      <p>Good afternoon. I'm Cheyenne Turner and I want to welcome you
        to Eclectic Viewpoint, and a workshop with David Hudson. David
        is an Arizona farmer who has made some remarkable discoveries.
        He's filed patents on 11 different forms of elements that were
        not known to exist before. And he started this by getting
        involved with extracting gold and silver from the tailings from
        gold mines. And had this powdery substance that was interfering
        with his extraction process, and this started him on a whole new
        adventure. Which led him into Alchemy and lots of other
        fascinating things, which he's going to tell you about this
        afternoon. So welcome David Hudson. </p>
      <p>(applause) </p>
      <p>[Well, the way they got this arranged.... Does everyone hear me
        when I'm walking around with this all right? Is it clear enough?
        Okay. I'll be able to do it then, I think, by myself. We'll just
        put the papers up on here.] </p>
      <p>Anybody here have a tape recorder running? There were several
        of them running last night. Does anybody have a tape recorder?
        Everybody's got their tape recorders turned off or put away,
        right? Right? Everybody agreed? All right. I will ask again that
        everybody respect that this is being video taped. There will be
        a portion of it at the end that we are not going to video tape.
        Um, but ah, and I will ask that everything be turned off at that
        time. </p>
      <p>But ah, what's going to be put on tape is basically the second
        time that this presentation has ever been video taped. It's been
        audio taped but it's never been video taped and I've always felt
        like well you've got to do some work yourself. If you're really
        that interested I'll give you the references, the page numbers
        and all and you can do your own research. But if I put it up
        here and video tape it then you go home and read it cause it's
        all there in black and white and you don't have to go to the
        library. I feel like that is going to be awfully beneficial to
        you people. </p>
      <p>What we don't want is we don't want the wrong mentalities to
        get this material just yet. And so, once again I'm going to ask
        you not to duplicate these tapes. If there's someone who needs
        to hear this and you know they're prepared for it, then you can
        share it with them but I ask you not to duplicate these tapes. </p>
      <p>Okay, it's very important to myself. It's very important to
        Cheyenne. If someone needs a copy of it, you can buy them from
        Cheyenne, but I ask you not to duplicate the tapes. </p>
      <p>[6:00] Okay, as you all know, last night we were talking about
        this mysterious white powder that we had developed. Remember
        that this is not just gold, that there actually are 11 elements
        that were in our patents. Since that time we found out there's
        one more, so there's a total of 12 elements that can exist in
        this white powder state. Now, one of them happens to be gold.
        Most of our work, because we have 2,000 ounces of rhodium and
        iridium per ton, we have about 12-13 ounces of gold. So in
        processing this material I got a lot of rhodium and iridium, I
        have very small amounts of gold. So our work tends to be with
        rhodium and iridium. </p>
      <p>Basically this morning, or this afternoon, what we're going to
        talk about, it seems like morning because we just got up.... I
        find that Cheyenne stays up all night. We're actually going to
        be actually presenting to you the Scientific American articles
        and the published papers, in Physical Review "C" predominantly,
        which show the discovery of this form of matter. Now when a man
        stands up here, particularly a cotton farmer, and tells you he's
        got patents on this new form of matter, you're going to be just
        like the U.S. patent office. When I filed for a patent on gold,
        they said, "What? You mean gold oxide or gold chloride or a gold
        compound?", and I said, "No. This is gold. Elemental gold". And
        they said, "Well, that's not patentable. Everyone knows about
        gold". And I said, "No, they don't know about this form of
        gold". And of course that's quite a hurdle for... And they say,
        "What's your credentials?", well, "I'm a cotton farmer". Ah-hah.
        Oh, now I see what the problem is. You go back and plant the
        fields and let us handle the high technology materials. </p>
      <p>And so, if you want to turn on the overhead projector now. I
        think, it comes on immediately, and you may close my briefcase
        lid so that it doesn't interfere. No it doesn't interfere
        anyway. </p>
      <p>Okay, basically I just use this piece of paper, this is, ah, if
        you'll raise it up just a little bit further where we can read
        the bottom of it. This is out of Scientific American, December
        of 1989 [p. 110,- Microclusters by Michael A. Duncan and Dennis
        H. Rouvray], and this is just an article on micro clusters. And
        basically it describes very accurately the aspects that we're
        going to be dealing with. The problem is I can't read it that
        well from right here, so I'm going to have to walk over with the
        pointer. If I go out of focus, fine. Start reading up here. </p>
      <p>"Divide and subdivide a solid and the traits of its solidity
        fade away one by one, like the features of the Cheshire Cat, to
        be replaced by characteristics that are not those of liquids or
        gases. They belong instead to a new phase of matter, the micro
        cluster. Micro clusters consist of tiny aggregates comprising
        from two" (key word "two", because it's clusters) "two to
        several hundred atoms. They pose questions that lie at the heart
        of solid state physics and chemistry, and the related field of
        material science. How small must an aggregate of particles
        become before the character of the substance they once formed is
        lost? How might the atoms reconfigure themselves?" Very specific
        right here. "How might the atoms reconfigure themselves if freed
        from the influence of the matter that surrounds them? If the
        substance is a metal, how small must this cluster of atoms be to
        avoid the characteristic sharing of free electrons that
        underlies conductivity?" </p>
      <p>That basically is the introduction, that's the introduction for
        the subject that I am dealing with. And what we found is that
        every element has a minimum cluster size where it has metallic
        character, and once the cluster goes beyond or below that
        critical minimum size, it totally breaks up on it's own. And
        every element is different. </p>
      <p>For example, for iridium, it's a 9 atom cluster, for platinum
        it's a 5 atom cluster, for palladium it's a 7 atom cluster, for
        gold it's a 2 atom cluster. Anything larger than that, stays
        metallic, and will aggregate and become more metallic. Anything
        less than that will literally break up on its own. It literally
        comes apart on its own. </p>
      <p>This makes for a very interesting situation. If you send
        platinum or iridium to Englehard or Johnson Matthey, which are
        the two big precious metal refineries in London, they will
        guarantee you a 99.9% recovery on gold. If you send them
        platinum they will guarantee you about 98 and a half percent
        recovery on platinum, but if you send them iridium they will not
        guarantee you over an 86% recovery on the iridium. Now most
        precious metal people believe that they're being cheated out of
        their precious metal, that the refinery is keeping that precious
        metal. That's not true, they actually lose it in the processing
        of it, and that's because iridium isn't stable below 9 atom
        clusters and in the dissolution of the iridium, about 14% of it
        actually gets below 9 atom clusters and will not recover as
        metal compounds. And so it's quote unquote lost in the system.
        And this is why, and the precious metal community is not aware
        of this. They know they have loses, but they don't understand
        why. And this is why. Okay, we go to the next slide. </p>
      <p>[12:00] This is an article from Scientific American, if you'll
        just raise that far enough so we can read the very bottom. This
        is March of 1990, Scientific American magazine. [pp. 58-67, New
        Radioactivities by Walter Greiner and Aurel Sandulescu] Now this
        article basically is describing new radioactivities, and that's
        the title of the article. And the example they give here is
        Uranium 232. Now this happens to be a radioactive isotope, but
        don't let that fool you. This is a phenomena that relates to all
        elements. Now, if you'll put up the next page, and you put the 2
        pages there, actually that is the first page of the article,
        this is the second page. If you'll notice, the first Uranium
        232, it actually is showing the proton and neutron orbitals.
        Now, if you get the original article, it's in color, and my
        copier doesn't copy color, it just copies black and white, so
        what you're getting is a black and white version. But the
        alternating black and white orbitals are, in fact, the nuclear
        orbitals. Now, most of us never have heard about nuclear
        orbitals, we've heard about electron orbitals, you remember back
        in chemistry class you had 2, 8, 8, 16, 32, these are the
        sequences that the electron orbitals fill. Well the nucleus
        fills the same way, that the proton and neutron orbitals
        actually fill in harmonic sequences. And what they found is that
        these big heavy nuclei, that are called the actinide group, and
        I'll ask you to, we'll go back to this slide, but just take the
        slide down for a second and put the next one up, I believe the
        next one is the Periodic table? Yes. The actinide group is the
        elements that begin with Actinium, and they're the heavy ones
        down here at the bottom of the Periodic Table, if you slide over
        to the right just a hair. Right. Okay, for those of you now...
        Here is Actinium, then there's two other elements here behind
        it, but actually Actinium is 89. It goes then to 90, 91, 92, 93,
        94, 95, 96, 97 all the way up to 103, and then we go to 104 and
        105. So they're actually out of sequence here. So this is called
        the Actinide group, it has a big "A". These are called the
        Actinide group, and this is the Actinide group right here. Now
        basically the Actinide group are the heavy elements. And what
        happened about 1985-86, is these physicists, these nuclear
        physicists were watching these elements that were Actinide group
        elements, and all of a sudden this atom blew apart, it literally
        came apart all on it's own. And there was no gamma emissions,
        there was no alpha emissions, there was no beta emissions. There
        was heat emissions, tremendous heat, but it literally.., one
        element became two elements, just bang, it happened. </p>
      <p>And it really took the physicists back, because this was not an
        element that they expected to come apart. This was a stable
        element. And as they begin to investigate it, they found out
        that all of the Actinide group basically would do this. But
        this, you know, these are kind of heavy nuclei, they're big fat,
        they're lots of protons and lots of neutrons, and they said,
        "Well maybe it's just because they're big cumbersome nuclei.
        They're not that stable anyway". But within a couple of years,
        these same researchers begin to find that the rare earths would
        do this, the lanthanide group. Okay, now for those of you who
        aren't chemists, the lanthanide group, number 57 is lanthanum,
        and all of these elements right here are called the lanthanide
        group or the rare earth group. Now the place down here by
        themselves on the Periodic Table, because they, ah, supposedly
        you're not going to run into them that often in your normal
        chemistry you're performing, and so they stick them also down
        here, like the Actinides, at the bottom of the periodic Table.
        But they found that Samarium through Dysprosium, Samarium
        through Dysprosium would do the very same thing. They literally,
        as a single atom, could come apart all on they're own, and
        they're not radioactive isotopes. </p>
      <p>Now this is very serious stuff here, because these nuclear
        physicists, you know, we've been taught that the nucleus is a
        very stable thing, it takes tremendous energies to blow it
        apart. It takes energies up about 1 million electron-volts to
        knock a nucleus apart, and yet they found that Samarium through
        Dysprosium would do this. Samarium, Europium, Gadolinium,
        Terbium, and Dysprosium would do this. </p>
      <p>Now if we go back to the other slide we just had on there.
        Okay. So basically what they learned, and there's a lot of, lot
        of research here, it's all in the published literature. But what
        they learned is the nucleus is a very snobbish thing. That
        basically as the electron orbitals fill, so do the nuclear
        orbitals fill, and what happens is the elements that are
        half-filled or half-empty, the ones in the middle of the
        Periodic Table, keeping in mind that Samarium through Dysprosium
        are in the middle of the rare earths, they found that what
        happens is the filled orbitals, these harmonically complete
        orbitals actually say "you unfilled orbitals get out of here".
        "You can't be next to us filled orbitals, we're the good guys,
        you're the bad guys. You get off away from here and you come
        back when you're filled, and then you can be part of us, but in
        the meantime get the heck out of here". </p>
      <p>And so what happens is those partially filled orbitals are
        excluded away from the filled orbitals, and this is inherent in
        a monatomic system. Now this will not happen if you have
        diatomic systems or larger, because this phenomena in physics,
        called dipole-dipole connection between nuclei, where the nuclei
        actually interreact with each other. It's kind of like a two
        cylinder motor, in a two cylinder motor, the pistons run
        opposite each other, and so even thought there's a vibration,
        they compensate, they kind of neutralize each other, and so the
        motor is pretty still. But what happens when you take one
        cylinder away and you have a one cylinder motor, it's an
        inherent vibration, you can't help it. And so here there's one
        little naked atom who is, got this out of balanced phenomena in
        the nucleus, and it's spinning, it literally is like a tire with
        a knot on it, it is, klunk-klunk-klunk, and what it does, it
        excludes these unfilled orbitals, these protons and neutrons
        that are not filled get pushed away from it, and it creates this
        figure eight or coke bottle shaped nuclei. </p>
      <p>Okay now this is new stuff people. You're not going to find it
        in universities, you're not going to find it, you know, being
        taught, because it's new. It's just 1985-86 when it was first
        discovered. It's in the published literature up to 1990-91, and
        that's what you're going to see today. It's probably, 50-60% of
        the physics papers in Physical Review C are on this area right
        now. It is a hot topic. But very few college professors ever
        heard of it because it wasn't in their curriculum when they
        studied. It's not in the books yet either. </p>
      <p>Anyway, if you'll move it down where we can read together,
        we're going to read some portions of this that are really
        important to understand. Move it on down a little further where
        I can point at it. Okay. Let's read this here, beginning right
        here. "It is now known that the atomic nucleus is a more or less
        spherical object, whose diameter is about a few fermis, a unit
        of measure equal to one quadrillionth of a meter, or simply
        10-15 meter." Now that's tiny, okay? "Electrons orbit the
        nucleus at a distance of about 100,000 fermis. (For comparison,
        the radius of the moon's orbit is only about 30 times greater
        than the diameter of the earth.)" So we think the moon's a long
        ways out there, but relative to the earth, it's very close. You
        take an atom, the electrons are way the heck and gone away from
        the nucleus. "Packed in this fermi-size nucleus is nearly all of
        the mass of an atom and all it's positive electric charge. The
        mass of the nucleus comes mainly from nucleons. Protons carry
        the positive charge. The structure of the nucleus arises from
        two types of interactions: strong and electromagnetic. As a
        result of the strong interaction, or nuclear force, protons bind
        to neutrons and to each other. The nuclear force binds nucleons
        very tightly [but acts over a very short range]". Okay, now,
        this is old hat for you people who took physics, but this is
        very important, to most of you. "To separate two neutrons that
        are one fermi apart, for instance, requires an energy of about
        one million electron volts". Now this is the standard thinking
        that you were taught in school. Now, "On the other hand, only
        about 10 electron volts is needed to disassociate two nucleons
        that are 10 fermis apart". So, the strong force only works over
        very short distances, okay? And once those nuclei start coming
        the least little bit apart, now the glue no longer adheres. </p>
      <p>"As a result of the electromagnetic interaction, or Coulomb
        force," now this is the repulsive force, the "protons repel
        other protons, although the Coulomb force is weaker than the
        nuclear force, it acts over a much longer range". So "If two
        protons are one fermi apart, the Coulomb force is about 100
        times weaker than the nuclear force. Yet at a distance of 10
        fermis the coulomb force is about 10 times stronger than the
        nuclear force." </p>
      <p>Now, you begin to understand what's happening here? These
        foreign nuclei no longer are glued together like they are
        supposed to be glued together. They actually want to come apart
        on their own. The force that's inside that nucleus that is
        pushing apart is very weak compared to the force that's holding
        them together, but when they become deformed all the rules break
        down. </p>
      <p>And so we're taught in school that the nucleus takes a million
        electron-volts to push it apart, but in fact, this phenomena is
        not, doesn't hold true when you're talking about deformed
        nuclei. Okay? Now here it is in Scientific American, okay, it's
        very serious. Now that's the basis of what we're dealing with.
        Let's go to the next paper. </p>
      <p>[23:45] Yeah, just skip the periodic table, oh you can just put
        it up for a little clarification here. And so physicists found
        that all the Actinide group, basically the actinium and all of
        these would do it, which most of these are man-made elements,
        but then they found that samarium through dysprosium would do
        it. And they said, you know, if it's a configuration of the
        nuclei, if you take number 58, which is Cerium, and you take it
        up, and plug it in right here, you got 1-2-3-4-5. 1-2-3-4-5. So
        right here is where it would really end up being and this row
        would be pushed down. So here would be samarium, europium,
        gadolinium, terbium and dysprosium. That's where it should be if
        it was in the periodic table correctly. And so, when they found
        that these rare earths would do it, these rare earths are not
        that big, they're not that fat. They realized that it had to do
        with the harmonics in the nucleus, and it was actually the
        nucleus itself, deforms itself, and in doing so it no longer is
        stable. It literally can just blow apart on it's own. </p>
      <p>That sounds like alchemy, doesn't it. Anyway, they begin to
        look at ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, osmium, iridium,
        platinum and gold, and then mercury. Which just happen to be the
        elements I am dealing with. Okay? </p>
      <p>I filed my patents in March of 1988, and the papers we're going
        to show you were published from that time on. I didn't have a
        chance to read these papers and then write my patent, and it
        took about 6 months to write the patent. I was writing the
        patent in 1987. It was actually refiled in March of 1988. And so
        these papers we're going to show now, are the United States
        government national labs or the European national labs, and
        their work with these elements. Next page. </p>
      <p>[25:54] Okay, ah, this is "A Possible Discontinuity in the
        Optical Behavior in the Platinum Through Mercury Region"
        [Department of Nuclear Physics, Research School of Physical
        Science, Australian National University - October 1988] Why they
        just don't say platinum, gold and mercury? Because that's the
        way they are, apparently, they go platinum, gold and mercury,
        they leave gold out for some reason. But in the platinum, gold
        and mercury region, this is what they have to say, and they
        confirm what I just told you. And I am not presenting all of the
        papers on the history of these discoveries because it really
        isn't relevant. But if you'll read the second sentence here,
        "Apart from the well deformed rare earth and heavy actinide
        nuclei which would not be expected to conform to the
        parametization of this theory", because this theory is on the
        stability of the nucleus. Ah, they found that the nuclei in the
        platinum region with total proton numbers 78 to 82 and neutron
        numbers 108 to 126, were also anomalous. In other words, they
        don't conform either. They're just like the rare earths. And
        this says, "a discontinuity of this magnitude is not observed in
        any other part of the Periodic table." </p>
      <p>[27:00] Next slide. Publication is the American Physical
        Society, 1989, page 39 or, in the, in the, page 1142. Okay.
        That's a reference that confirms what I just told you, though,
        they found that the heavy Actinides would do it, then they found
        that the rare earths would do it. Then they started looking at
        these elements, above it and below it. Okay, here is "Collective
        and single particle structure of 103 Rh [Physical Review C
        Volume 37, Number 2, February 1988, pp. 621-635]". Rhodium 103
        is the stable isotope of Rhodium. It's just like gold, it only
        has one isotope that's stable. This is it. Key words that were
        developed when they begin to make these discoveries, were
        "high-spin" Rhodium 103. When the nucleus becomes deformed in a
        ratio of 2 to 1, twice as long as it is wide, like a coke
        bottle, it's spin slips to the high-spin state. It's inherent in
        the stuff. It isn't anything you do from the outside, it does it
        on it's own. Okay? And the bottom sentence in the introduction,
        Rhodium "[103 Rh] is a soft nucleus which exhibits shape
        coexistence". They go on to explain, even-even with a total
        nuclei's of approximately 100, with protons greater than or
        equal to 40 or less than or equal to 50, and neutrons greater
        than 50, are of current interest because of the nature of the
        shape transition [Even-even A~100 nuclides with 40&lt;Z&lt;50
        and N&gt;50 are of current interest because of the nature of the
        shape transitions which occur in this region.] Ah, they go on
        to, on the onset of deformation, when the neutron members equal
        60, and more importantly down here it says, It's related to the
        level structures, right here, of proton numbers equal to or
        greater than 42 and neutron numbers equal to or greater than 56,
        nuclei such as ruthenium, rhodium, palladium and silver ["In
        part, this is reflected in the level structures of the (Z &gt;
        42,N &gt; 56) nuclei such as Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ag isotopes."]
        Which just happen to be the elements in my patent application. </p>
      <p>And this is the study. So you physicists, the people of the
        technical world, you can get the paper, and you can read all
        about the deformations, you can read all about the deformations,
        the studies, the nuclei that were studied. It's a big long paper
        and you're welcome to read it. For this audience we are not
        going to try going into it. Key, key thing to understand is
        these particular nuclei, ruthenium, rhodium, silver, and
        palladium are the ones that do it. Okay? Which is..... That
        article is the American Physical Society, 1988, page 38 or page
        671, I believe, 621, 621. This is the American Physical Society.
      </p>
      <p>(Question - Does this begin to occur when the particle gets
        down to less than the cluster size?) </p>
      <p>It happens, actually it begins to occur when it gets below the
        cluster size, but it, the monatomic state is when all of this is
        observed. Keep in mind these are nuclear physicists, and, you
        know, this is the cyclotron facility at Texas A &amp; M, which
        you guys should be very familiar with. Okay? Most of these are
        the government labs, this happens to be the exception. </p>
      <p>But, you know, the key words are "prolate", "oblate",
        "asymmetric shapes", strongly suggests the nuclei's a "soft
        shape", and it goes on with the deformations they observed, you
        know, it's a really interesting paper to read, but not for the
        audience here. So I just bring the cover page and we read the
        introduction. We go to the next one. </p>
      <p>(Question - Are any of your patents issued yet?) </p>
      <p>Patents were issued . . . Well we will get into that after a
        while, ok? </p>
      <p>[30:40] This is "Superdeformation in Palladium 104 and 105
        [Superdeformation in 104, 105 Pd, Physical Review C, Volume 38,
        Number 2, August 1988 pp. 1088-1091]". The two most stable
        isotopes of Palladium. These are not radioactive isotopes.
        Palladium has several stable isotopes. This happens to be two of
        them. "Of special interest....", I'm reading right here, if he
        quits moving it, "Of special interest are those shapes known as
        'superdeformed'", they use SD, "where the nucleus acquires a
        very elongated shape that can be approximately represented by
        the ellipsoid where the ratio of the long to short axis is
        considerably larger than that of normal deformation ~ 1.3:1.
        Within the framework of the anisotropic harmonic-oscillator
        model one can expect the existence of favorable shell gaps that
        appear regularly as a function of deformation and nucleon
        number.". Anyway, "They are predicted to occur for particular
        'super deformed, magic numbers', and at deformations
        corresponding to integer ratios to the length of the axes"
        corresponding to a ratio of 2 to 1. Okay. </p>
      <p>That now is the consensus. The word is "superdeformed", and
        it's used whenever the nucleus has a 2 to 1 or greater
        deformation. Okay? This is all the semantics, the wording that
        the physics community has developed. Ah, you know, when it goes
        to this 2 to 1 deformation, the nucleus spin flips to the
        high-spin state, and so the rhodium, they're talking about
        high-spin states of rhodium 103, they're also talking about
        super deformed rhodium. They didn't use those terminologies, but
        this has become the wording that is used now in the physics
        community. And you see when discoveries are made all over the
        world, little by little, they all decide that certain
        terminologies are correct, and then everybody begins to use
        those terminologies. So, everybody had their own words
        initially, and that's why it's just a little confusing, but the
        key now is "superdeformed", "2 to 1 deformation", "high-spin
        state" and in this high-spin state the particles are no longer
        close, so they come apart very easily. Okay? </p>
      <p>The world isn't as we thought it was. Ok next paper. </p>
      <p>This one is the American Physical Society, 1988, page 38 or
        1088, and it's, ah, rapid communication, the Physical Review C,
        Volume 38, number 2, August 1988. Okay, and the source is
        Nuclear Science...., ah, nuclear, ah, Lawrence Berkeley
        Laboratory, Berkeley, California. That's your government
        laboratory. United States government laboratory. Okay, next
        paper. As you can see, this is not channeled information.
        (audience laughs) Ah, you laugh, there are some people who can
        channel, but this, you know, this is hard science folks, this is
        not a maybe. </p>
      <p>[33:44] "Structure of Osmium and Platinum isotopes [Structure
        of Os and Pt isotopes, Physical Review C, Volume 38, Number 2,
        August 1988, pp. 953-959]", they're literally studying the
        shapes, the ground state properties of rare earth nuclei,
        including Osmium and Platinum region, ah, they found that
        they're prolate-oblate, and, you know, you can read the papers,
        physicists, and understand it, but they're actually studying all
        these elements. This is Physical Review C, Volume 38, Number 2,
        August, 1988, uh, and the source here is the International
        Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy. Now these are
        very sophisticated people who are dealing with single atoms, and
        for the average person, it's even hard for us to even think
        about a single atom. It's so far beyond anything we could ever
        see or imagine, and yet these people hold single atoms, and
        study the configuration of the atom. It's really, you know,
        pretty impressive technology. Next slide. (audience question)
        Page 38, 953. Okay, next page, next one. </p>
      <p>[35:00] Okay, "Quantum size effects in rapidly rotating
        nuclei". Now they talk about high-spin, the rapidly rotating
        nuclei. This is the Niels Bohr Institute, University of
        Copenhagen. You all know who Niels Bohr was? Worked with
        Einstein? Has the electron theory, the orbitals around the atom.
        Anyway, this is his son, who is doing a lot of this work over
        there. This is Physical Review C, Volume 41, Number 4, April,
        1990. Now, a lot of you are saying, "Well, why is this high-spin
        state so important?", well, why it's important, they're
        beginning to get into here, and maybe we ought to take this one
        off and let's put the next one on first, and I'll, ah, I'll....
        This is page number 41 and 1865, they actually have two numbers.
        Okay, let's put the next one on and we'll come back to this one
        after that. </p>
      <p>[36:00] Ah, "The inertias of super deformed bands", yeah, this
        is also the Niels Bohr Institute, this is Physical Review C,
        Volume 41, Number 4, April 1990 [Inertias of superdeformed
        bands, pp. 1861-1864]. Ah, basically this is a very excellent
        paper that goes into the total physics of the phenomena, but
        this is a collective phenomena displayed by many body nuclear
        systems, in other words there are many atoms involved in the
        systems, and they're talking about the appearance of large gaps
        in the single particle system, the magic numbers, and they're
        talking about, that as nuclei become filled their nuclei are
        stable and are very spherical. But when they're half filled or
        half empty, it's when they're the most unstable. And so it's not
        the elements on the left side of the Periodic Table, it's not
        the elements on the right side, it's the elements in the middle
        that do this. </p>
      <p>Ah, "Some of these configurations [become] strongly bound by
        deforming the system. In particular, new shell gaps appear by
        introducing a quadrapole distortion in the nuclear shape, where
        the ratio of the major to minor axis is 2 to 1. Such
        deformations play an important role in the process of
        spontaneous fission," (Spontaneous fission of a non-radioactive
        isotope. A stable nuclei, non-radioactive, and it can just come
        apart all on it's own. Okay?) "where the 2 to 1 configuration is
        connected with the second minimum of the fission barrier." And
        all the rest basically have the superdeformed band of the 2 to 1
        configuration and it goes into all of the explanation of the
        physics and you can see by 1990 they were really trying to
        understand this because the world isn't as we thought it was. We
        thought these atoms were just so stable and never would come
        apart and heck, you look at these wrong and they come apart. It
        isn't like we thought it was. </p>
      <p>But more importantly for me, you know, I said, somebody had to
        have seen this. Somebody has to know about this. I can't be the
        only one who knows this. And in the literature, sure enough,
        here were the answers. They had found that certain elements,
        they just happened to be the ones that I had filed a patent on,
        will go to the high-spin state and when they go to the high-spin
        state the whole nature of the atom changes. It isn't the same
        atom that it was before. Okay, let's go back now, no, let's go
        look at the next one. </p>
      <p>(Question: What page is that?) </p>
      <p>That is page number 41, 1861, 1990, of the American Physical
        Society. Let's go to the next one. Keep the one, that we can
        come back to. </p>
      <p>Let's take that one off too. There's one more I want. Pull that
        one off. Save it, yeah. Okay. </p>
      <p>[39:00] This is a 1960's book that my Ph.D. studied at Iowa
        State University and it's actually an article about nuclear
        quadrapole moment and nuclear quadrapole moment spectroscopy.
        They actually find that by applying these 800,000 gauss magnetic
        fields that they could cause the nucleus to spin flip to the
        high-spin state. And then when they release these fields they
        read the resonance that comes out of the nucleus as the nucleus
        drops back down to the low spin state. Now this was discovered
        in the 1960's, but if you have to keep 800,000 gauss applied to
        this nucleus to keep it in the high-spin state, you know, it's a
        tremendous amount of energy. But what they found, is they found
        a phenomena, and I want you to read this. </p>
      <p>"There is another effect called spin-spin or transverse
        relaxation operative in solids. This involves transfer of energy
        from one high energy nucleus to another. There is no net loss of
        energy." There is no net loss of energy in the transfer of
        energy from one high-spin nucleus to the other high-spin
        nucleus. Now they've know this since the 1960's, but if it takes
        700,000 gauss to keep these nucleuses in the high-spin state, so
        what if energy flows from one to the next with no push. I mean
        you got more energy here than it takes to push energy all across
        the country on a wire, so, big deal. It's one of those esoteric
        things. But if they could ever get nuclei that would go in a
        high-spin state and stay in the high-spin state, then you should
        have a superconductor. </p>
      <p>Now let's go back to the first paper I had you take off, the
        first one I told you to save (talking to projector operator). </p>
      <p>[41:04] Okay, "Quantum size effects in rapidly rotating
        nuclei". April of 1990. This is the Niels Bohr Institute,
        Physical Review C, Volume 41, Number 4 [pp. 1865-1868]. Here it
        is, the whole story, they finally put it down in print and
        admitted this was what they were chasing; these high-spin
        nuclei. What they are talking about is, "In the nuclear case,"
        I'll start reading right here, "a variety of symmetries are
        spontaneously broken. In particular rotational and gauge
        invariance as testified by the occurrence of families of
        collective excitations displaying rotational relationships for
        the different observables." Skipping on down here, "It has been
        conjectured the usual Cooper instability...", now for those of
        you who don't know what Cooper instabilities means, they gave a
        Nobel Prize to Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer, who worked for
        GE. It was the theory of superconductivity. And "Cooper pairs"
        are when a time foreword electron pairs with a time reverse
        electron, it's spin 1/2 and spin 1/2. But spin 1/2 plus spin 1/2
        is spin 1, and now both particles become pure light with no
        particles. There's no particle aspect anymore, it's light. Okay?
      </p>
      <p>Here it is, right here. The "Cooper instability will not exist
        anymore in small particles containing a reduced number of
        fermions, like e.g., metallic particles. Therefore
        superconductivity should disappear for particles in the quantal
        size effects (QSE) regime, when the energy differs between two
        discrete one-electron states is comparable to the energy gap of
        the superconducting state." Anyway it goes on to describe the
        physics. That's why in 1988 when I filed my patents, I filed 11
        patents on the monatomic state and I filed another 11 patents on
        the "many-atom system" and it requires a minimum number of
        atoms, and they actually, in their paper theorize, that the, ah,
        they're coming up with a number here, 10 to the 4th to 10 to the
        5th electrons. I didn't say how many nuclei had to be there, how
        many atoms had to be there to be a superconductor, but it was a
        "many-atom system". And each atom contains many of these
        electron pairs on it, so, you know, it takes a certain minimum
        number, several hundreds of atoms, before you have a
        superconductivity. The word "superconductivity" is like the word
        "army", you can't have a one man army. It's a contradiction in
        terms. By definition the word superconductor is a many atom
        system. Just like the word metal, you can't have an atom be a
        metal. The word metal has certain characteristics, the word
        superconductivity has certain characteristics and so you can't
        have a single atom be a superconductor. It can have all the
        properties of a superconductor but it takes a certain number of
        atoms resonance coupled to become a superconductor. I hope I'm
        not losing people here in this, you know, I'm trying to make it
        as understandable as I can. Right there they're saying what it's
        all about. This is what this.... all this interest of all these
        national laboratories in this form of matter is. Because
        theoretical they should be a superconductor and they know it.
        This is the high-spin state of matter. Next paper. Let's go to
        the one, the other one you stuck off down there. (audience
        question) Yes ma'am. Any patent on superconductivity has to be
        cleared for worldwide issuance by the Department of Defense. </p>
      <p>(Question - Do you think that's what started the research in
        these papers that suddenly came out after you filed your
        patent?) </p>
      <p>No, I just think it's time. I just think there's all this
        information coming, if you haven't figured it out yet, this is
        the explanation for cold fusion. Ha-ha. It all of a sudden
        begins to dawn -- palladium, high-spin state, inter nuclear
        energy, golly, you know. Ah, Pons and Fleischmann just haven't
        been doing their physics, they've been doing too much chemistry.
      </p>
      <p>[45:18] This is a paper that is, it's Physical Review Letters,
        Volume 62, Number 10, March 1989, March 6, 1989 [Direct Mapping
        of Adatom-Adatom Interactions, pp. 1146-1149], and if you raise
        it up just a little bit, 1776 vaporizations of iridium atoms
        onto a super-cooled tungsten plate. And, you know, people study
        the darndest things, these scientists study the most esoteric
        things. But they're putting, 1776 times they vaporized atoms
        onto this tungsten plate and they measured where the atoms
        arranged themselves. Now they didn't realize the importance of
        what they were doing. But they find here, and my copying job
        isn't real good so I'm going to walk over again. All of these
        lines that run up are the light colored lines and all these that
        run down are the dark colored lines. These are the three
        dimensions, one, two and three. This is the way the graph reads.
        Now what they found is that the iridium atoms were arranging
        themselves at about two of these quadrants from each other. This
        big long black line. That basically the atoms attract from a
        long ways away up to that point and then they're repulsed, the
        lines go, they're not ever found in those locations. So what
        they found is that the iridium atoms, you see these quadrants
        are 3.17 angstroms in dimension, so there's 1, 2 quadrants here.
        So they found that the atoms were arranging themselves at about
        6.3 angstroms apart. Okay? They weren't arranging themselves
        hardly at all in this dimension, they weren't arranging
        themselves hardly at all in this dimension, they were arranging
        themselves basically in this dimension, but at specific
        distances apart. </p>
      <p>And their conclusion was that it's like there's a Coulomb wave
        that comes off of the atom. This atom is in a high-spin state,
        they didn't know that, but it's actually out of balance and
        instead of resonating in 3 dimensions it's only resonating in 2
        dimensions, and it's got a Coulomb wave, a wave that it
        produces. The next atom gets into that wave and cannot get
        closer than that last wave coming off the atom and so it's
        repulsed. But in the bottom of the wave it's attracted and so at
        about 6.3 angstroms, the next iridium atom will nestle in that
        wave and perpetuates the wave, and the next iridium atom will
        nestle in that wave and perpetuate the wave. Now what they did
        is they heated and cooled the sample. They let it go to room
        temperature and then they re-cooled it and let it go to room
        temperature and what happens is that the atoms will arrange
        themselves in this perfect, about 6.3 angstrom spacing, in two
        dimensions. Not in 3 dimensions. In two dimensions, like a long
        chain. Now in a metal the atoms bind at about 1.8 angstroms,
        that's when they're sharing electrons. This is out at 6.3
        angstroms, so there's no electrons being shared, there's no
        crystalline energy, there's no chemical energy, but the atom is
        way the heck and gone out there at about 6.3 angstroms, but it's
        bound in the resonance wave. And so these atoms literally, by
        repeated heating and cooling, will arrange themselves at
        precisely 6.3 angstroms in two dimensions, like a chain. And
        this atom makes a wave, this atom next nestles in the wave and
        perpetuates the wave, the next atom nestles in the wave and
        perpetuates the wave, the next atom nestles in the wave and
        perpetuates the wave, and literally you get a resonance coupled
        system of quantum oscillators resonating in two dimensions.
        These are bound atoms, resonance coupled, oscillating in two
        dimensions. And it's a bosonic phenomena, it has Cooper pairs. </p>
      <p>Now what happens is the individual atoms, when it goes to the
        high-spin state, and this is going to be a little technical,
        bear with me. In a normal atom, around the nucleus, there is
        what's called a positive screening potential that exists around
        the nucleus and this positive screening potential screens all of
        the inner electrons and only the valence electrons, the ones on
        the outside, are available for chemical bonding, these are not
        screened, they're called valence electrons. When the nucleus
        goes to the high-spin state that positive screening potential
        expands out and overlies all of the electron orbitals and all of
        the electrons become screened. Now some amazing things happen
        when the electrons are under the screening potential. The
        electrons are time forward electrons and time reverse electrons,
        actually get in perfect harmony and pair up, they couple, they
        become married and they literally become pure light, in the
        high-spin state. All of the valence electrons are no longer
        valence electrons, they become light. </p>
      <p>Another very important phenomena is under the screening
        potential of the nucleus the time reversed electron acts
        identical to a positron. Okay? And by definition the positron is
        the energy that originates in the nucleus, but under the
        screening potential of the nucleus the time reversed electron
        now acts like a positron. And so you have the time reversed
        electron paired with the time forward electron and they
        literally become light. They no longer have any particle aspect.
      </p>
      <p>Now the important thing to understand here is that an electron
        exists in space-time. It has a particle aspect and all of your
        instrumental analysis is based on knocking this electron from
        this space-time to that space-time and measuring the absorption
        or emission when it jumps from it or when it comes back. Right?
        It's called emission spectroscopy or absorption spectroscopy,
        x-ray emission and x-ray absorption. But we have no electrons
        now. All we have is a bunch of light. And you can't knock light
        from one space-time to another space-time because light exists
        in, doesn't have a space-time. You can put any amount of
        electron pairs on a superconductor because they can all go in
        the same space-time. So all of our instrumental analysis that's
        being used, but for standard analysis of elements, doesn't work.
      </p>
      <p>It's like stealth atoms. They're there, we just can't see them.
        So it takes some dumb farmer who doesn't know any better, to
        beat his head for 18 years, to figure out what the heck this
        stuff is that's invisible. Most people say, "Dave, you were too
        dumb to know it was impossible so you did it anyway". Even
        neutron activation, the most sophisticated analytical tool
        available to science, is based on exciting the nucleus by
        sending a neutron into the nucleus and exciting it to high-spin
        state or a high energy state and then reading the emission that
        comes out of it when it drops back down. But this is already in
        the high-spin state and it's happy in the high-spin state and it
        doesn't want to come out of the high-spin state. So the neutron
        doesn't read anything. It's invisible to neutron activation.
        This is why your illustrious scientists have never found it
        because they read everything else but they don't read this. </p>
      <p>And if you ever tried preparing high purity metals, you'll find
        that you cannot buy 100% pure. You could buy, 99.8, 99.9, 99.99,
        99.999, 99.9999 but you cannot buy 100% pure. There is always
        impurities associated with metals. Even gold, there's always one
        atom out of thousands that's an impurity. And so when you send
        50,000 quantas of energy into this sample of the high-spin
        state, every quanta of energy reads the impurity. Because all
        the other atoms "pass it on", "pass it on", "pass it on", "pass
        it on" until it finds the impurity, bang it reads. You send
        another quanta in, "pass it on", "pass it on", "hot potato",
        "hot potato", "hot potato", till one atom can't pass it on and
        it reads. So you send 50,000 quantas in the sample and it reads
        50,000 quantas of iron, and the man says, "yep, it's iron", and
        it's not. The iron is there, but the material is not iron. And
        that's why all your wonderful commercial laboratories are
        telling people it's iron, silica and aluminum and that's why it
        took me 3 1/2 years, 3 1/2 years, to get rid of all the iron,
        all the silica, and all of the aluminum, and produce pure
        nothing! And that's when I had them boxed in the corner. I said,
        "I want to know what that stuff is. It's still 98% of the
        sample. What's that stuff?" And they honest to gosh couldn't
        tell me. That's because it's a form of matter they have not set
        their machines up to analyze. It's that simple. It's not
        anything bad about the analytical instrumentation, it's not
        anything bad about the operator. It's a new form of matter that
        they're not, they don't have standards prepared for and they
        don't know how to do the analysis. It's that simple. </p>
      <p>(Question - What's the citation?) </p>
      <p>Ah, this is Physical Review Letters, Volume 62, Number 10,
        March 1989. March 6, 1989. Let's go to the next one. You begin
        to see the reality in this? All right let's go to the next one.
        Do you begin to see the reality in this? </p>
      <p>[55:19] A paper on superconductivity. This is Volume 62, [27]
        February 1989, Number 9. "Bound States, Cooper Pairing and Bose
        Condensation in Two Dimensions [pp. 981-984]". Kind of like just
        what we described, isn't it? We got a resonance coupled system,
        of bound, bosonic state, they're resonance coupled and
        oscillating in two dimensions, Curious coincidence here. Anyway,
        they go into the superconducting stability, they talk about
        superconductivity, but this specifically is the definition of a
        superconductor, which happens to be what our stuff is. It's a
        resonance coupled system of quantum oscillators resonating in
        two dimensions. It doesn't make any difference what's beside it
        in the third dimension, that has nothing to do with the system.
        It's resonating this way, not this way. Okay? </p>
      <p>The only thing is, I've heard some people say, "Well Dave, I'll
        deliver you some high energy. We'll push this stuff and make it
        into a metal". Do you know that the temperature on the outside
        has nothing to do with the temperature on the inside? Do you
        know that the temperature inside an atom, what that temperature
        really is? And what the outside temperature has nothing to do
        with the temperature on the inside of the nucleus. But did you
        know that with less than 10 electron-volts, you can cause the
        energy, the atoms to fission? And I took 30 grams of this
        powder, and I bought this brand new arc furnace. An arc furnace
        is kind of like a welding machine. It has a water cooled copper
        crucible, you put your sample you want to melt in the copper
        crucible, and you slide the lid over it and you lower it down,
        and it seals on o-rings. And then you put a controlled gas
        through the sample. Well we put argon as our plasma gas, and
        down in this crucible there's a tungsten electrode that hangs
        down in there and you can strike the arc between the tungsten
        electrode and the copper crucible. You put the powder you want
        to melt in there and you seal the thing all up, vacuum out the
        air, put in argon, and strike the arc, and you can sit here with
        a seal and watch your sample through a glass. You can actually
        stir the sample with the electrode and burn the arc on it. </p>
      <p>Now this is the way they melt these refractory ceramics like
        tungsten, tantalum, niobium, you know these high temperature
        materials. I said, "we're gonna melt this sucker, I don't care
        if it takes you two hours of burning, we're going to melt it.
        I'm gonna find out how the metal is produced". Now this is about
        1982-83 before I knew of this. What happened, we struck the arc
        and within a second it stopped. We opened up the machine and the
        tungsten electrode was gone. It's all melted in with our powder.
        Now I said, "This must be a faulty electrode. Let's get another
        electrode". So we order another electrode, put another 30 grams
        in there and here's all the tungsten all down in with our
        powder. We took that out, we did it again. It didn't even make a
        second. The heat that was being produced was like a thousand
        times greater than the D.C. arc should have been because the
        heat was coming out of the material. It was nuclear level energy
        coming out of the nuclei as we struck the arc on it. </p>
      <p>So then we took the material that had all this tungsten in it
        and we separated the tungsten, had it analyzed, and it doesn't
        analyze to be the same stuff it used to be. This is 1982. And I
        said, "you know, it looks to me like there's a nuclear level
        transition going on here and I don't want any of my employees
        working around it". And I'll tell you, we just decided the only
        way you're going to get this is you don't do it with energy, you
        do it with chemistry. So, we basically went away from the
        metallurgical processes, these high temperature refractory
        materials and we went to chemistry, and I describe these
        elements as female elements. If your wife is late going
        someplace and she's getting dressed the last thing you want to
        say is "Honey when are you going to be ready?", or you got
        another 45 minutes to wait. These elements, we call them female
        elements, because if you work with them and cooperate with them
        they give you everything you want, but if try to push them you
        get nowhere. I hope you don't take that as a sexist remark
        ladies, I.., it's just the way it is. Okay, next slide. </p>
      <p>[1:00:14] Okay, raise it up just a little bit so we can read
        the bottom. This is Scientific American, October, 1991, [Spin
        Cycle, p. 26] just to show you this is once again Scientific
        American, slide it down just a little bit now where we can read
        the article. We're talking about the spectra of super deformed
        nuclei. Now they give examples of mercury 192 and mercury 194
        which are both radioactive isotopes. And if you didn't know what
        we know now after seeing these papers, you would assume that
        this only happens in linear accelerators or nuclear facilities
        on these single atoms that they make by collision, fissioning a
        heavier element into these elements. But I just showed you that
        rhodium 103, palladium 104 and 105, platinum, gold, mercury,
        osmium, ruthenium, palladium all exist in this state as stable
        isotopes, non-radioactive isotopes. But some of the things that
        they're commenting, I think, are very interesting. "Researchers
        at the Lawrence Berkeley laboratory have been finding that
        rapidly spinning nuclei with different masses have similar--if
        not exactly the same--moments of inertia. 'Something is going
        on,' said Frank F. Stephens, a physicist at the Lawrence
        Berkeley lab, 'and for reasons we don't understand yet.'" At
        Lawrence Berkeley labs, they're saying we don't understand this,
        it doesn't make sense that every element in the high-spin state
        acts identical, like it's the same material. "A spinning nucleus
        results from an off-center collision between two nuclei that
        fuse to form a rapidly spinning, elongated body." Well that
        isn't necessarily so. It results from having a monatomic system.
        This is the way they do it. </p>
      <p>"The deformed nucleus can take the shape of an American
        football, a doorknob, or possibly even a banana depending on the
        collision energy in the nuclei. In a typically deformed nucleus
        the long axis exceeds the two short axis by about a factor of
        1.3. Nucleus whose long axis is about twice that of the short
        axis are called superdeformed." That's what we discussed
        earlier, the 2 to 1 deformation. "It is in these superdeformed
        nuclei that curious goings on have taken place. A spinning
        superdeformed nucleus slows down in discrete steps, each time
        emitting gamma rays, or highly energetic photons. The emissions
        produce a characteristic band of energy spikes all spaced
        equally apart. The surprise: the spectra of some different
        superdeformed nuclei were almost identical." Okay? </p>
      <p>They also go on to talk about Argonne National Laboratories,
        "Other factors such as the shape of the nuclei should 'make
        changes that are bigger than what we are observing.'" They're
        talking about measuring gamma spectra, in other words, what I'm
        showing this to you is, I want you to understand that this is a
        very hot topic in the National Laboratories. They're very
        intrigued and interested in this material. The high-spin nuclei
        in these superdeformed states. Their problem is they're making
        them one atom at a time, with this tremendous energy. What they
        haven't realized is that they're out there in nature, that
        Mother Nature created them in the belly of the Earth, and that
        they are here in the monatomic form in nature. They happen to be
        here in exactly the ratios they're supposed to be here. They
        happen to be here in exactly the amount that the nuclear
        physicists will tell you they should be here. They are here. </p>
      <p>The reference is Scientific American, in October of 1991. And
        what they're telling you is they're doing a bunch of things that
        they can't explain. That's basically what they're saying. There
        are some things here we just can't explain. Okay? Now these are
        the best people in the world. And they're saying there's things
        here we can't explain. </p>
      <p>But what you begin to understand is, there's a fellow by the
        name of Joe Champion down at Texas A &amp; M, some of you are
        familiar with him. He claims that in his cold fusion work that
        there are other elements being created. Of course. So what. Big
        deal. Well he's very excited about it because he doesn't know
        this is out there. And he's being criticized for it, a lot of
        people are laughing at him. Well what they don't understand is,
        when I was working with General Electric doing our fuel cell
        studies, and we were coming to understand what was going on, we
        got a copy of Pons and Fleischmann's paper before they announced
        it to the public. It was sent to GE for their review and this
        was the electro-chemical catalyst division who works with
        palladium and so they handed it to me and said, "Dave, look
        here, what's coming out here?" And Pons and Fleischmann said
        that when their palladium electrode in this lithium deuterate
        solution. They're putting it there because of the deuterate, the
        lithium is what's important though. Lithium is the third element
        on the Periodic Table. Lithium will dissolve into the palladium
        just like hydrogen. It's tiny and it goes in between the
        metal-metal bonds just like hydrogen. And it weakens the s-p
        bonding and little by little the palladium begins to
        disaggregate from the other palladium atoms and go to the
        high-spin state. Okay? What they have reported is that after
        several days there is this tremendous release of energy, and
        it's more energy than the amperage that went into the sample.
        What they haven't figured out is that it is not more energy than
        the voltage that fed it, and a superconductor feeds on the
        magnetic field not on the amperage. </p>
      <p>As so, literally, when they pull the voltage potential, if
        there's no amperage flowing, the amperage only puts the lithium
        into the palladium. That's the only purpose of the amperage is
        to put the, to electroplate the lithium onto the palladium and
        cause the metal-metal bonding of the palladium to break and form
        what Pons and Fleischmann, and this is their scientific
        technical term, "the white crud on the surface of the
        palladium". And that white crud is the superconductor. And it
        literally builds up energy, builds up energy, kind of like you
        think of a capacitor building up energy, it's flowing more and
        more light and it's feeding on the magnetic potential. More and
        more light, more and more light, until it reaches what's called
        HC2, the greatest amount of magnetic field that superconductor
        can sustain and at that point it collapses. And just like we
        were talking about last night, now you have volts. So now you
        got 150-200 thousand amps and you got volts, and so yes, there
        is a tremendous heat, but it's not more heat than the voltage
        potential the sample was subjected to, but only a superconductor
        feeds on the voltage potential and so they never considered that
        as an option. </p>
      <p>I actually have a paper, a cold fusion article, and nowhere in
        the article is this mentioned, but in big bold type in the
        middle of the page it says, "We will find that a material like
        palladium is going into a state that is much like
        superconductivity when it causes the cold fusion reaction". And
        they're figuring this out, they're seeing what I am describing,
        but they don't understand this yet. Palladium specifically can
        become superdeformed. Palladium will come apart by just looking
        at it wrong. So certainly when this flux collapse occurs you're
        going to get all sorts of elements that shouldn't have been
        there before. In that Scientific American article it actually
        tells you the elements you'll get from palladium. Listen! </p>
      <p>I'll bet you if Champion looks at the article and then goes
        back and studies his results, he'll find out exactly what he's
        getting is what he's supposed to be getting. But it sure sounds
        like alchemy doesn't it, making elements into other elements?
        It's interesting to note that the philosophical text . . . over
        in the Ayurvedic text, I was sent a copy by the Maharishi Mahesh
        Yogi who knows of this work, and he had it translated into
        English and sent it over to me. These are about 2,000 B.C. that
        this information comes from supposedly, and it says you can take
        mercury and divide mercury, and divide mercury and divide
        mercury, until you divide it into it's essence and you actually
        get a white powder of mercury. And the way you test that mercury
        to see if it's ready for ingestion, is you heat it in air and if
        it turns to gold, then it's ready for ingestion. And they knew
        this 2000 B.C. Did you know that superdeformed mercury, when all
        of its electrons are paired in the high-spin state, if you heat
        it in air in 78% Nitrogen, in air, that when you get up to
        around red heat, that the outside electron pair will annihilate
        with itself. It actually will withdraw it's screening potential
        enough that outer pair annihilates, and that electron pair
        doesn't produce 510,000 electron-volt photons like electron
        annihilation normally does, it produces a 1 million
        electron-volt photon that is always absorbed by the binding
        nucleus. </p>
      <p>So here your mercury atom now has a 1 million volt photon that
        comes flying into the nucleus, in the binding nucleus of the
        mercury, and that's the energy it takes in a high-spin state to
        knock off a proton and several neutrons. Coincidentally. Now you
        have a low spin gold, and it goes right immediately to low spin
        gold. Now low spin gold, if there's other gold atoms near it
        will aggregate as a metallic material, and once you got diatomic
        gold, you got it, you're on your way home now, you got metal. So
        you could actually take mercury to the high-spin state and the
        way you check it is heat it in air, and if it goes to gold then
        don't heat the rest of it, consume it, it's a medicine. And
        that's something that miners and metallurgists have a real hard
        time with, they say, "Why don't they want the beautiful yellow
        valuable metal?" Because the white powder is more valuable,
        that's why. </p>
      <p>And that's the test to see if you got it, and they knew that
        2,000 B.C. and we're just now figuring it out now in physics.
        Isn't that amazing? They claim that the gods taught them this.
        Okay, next slide. </p>
      <p>[1:10:58] Okay, this is a copy of a publication put out by
        Johnson Matthey. The two major chemical refiners in the world
        since 1860 has been Johnson Matthey, and then more recently they
        set up Englehard, it was a dummy company, and if you don't know
        the history behind it. Johnson Matthey are the refiners for the
        Crown of England, since 1860 they have been the refiners for the
        King of England, now the Queen of England. During the world
        wars, particularly during World War II, the United States
        government required two bidders on all issuance of contracts,
        and so Johnson Matthey had to set up a competitor to bid against
        them, and so Oppenheimer, that's who owns Johnson Matthey, set
        up Englehard. It has a different Board of Directors but it has
        the same control share holders. And so now there are two
        entities, Johnson Matthey and Englehard, but if you ever have a
        problem with Johnson Matthey, Englehard is brought in to resolve
        the problem. And if you ever have a problem with Englehard,
        Johnson Matthey is brought in to resolve the problem. And you're
        never going to win. Let me tell you, so you don't ever want to
        go head to head with these people in court. </p>
      <p>Anyway, this a publication that's put out quarterly by Johnson
        Matthey. Johnson Matthey keeps track of what's going on in the
        world on anything relating to precious metal uses, and they
        publish these. It's published quarterly in a paper called "The
        Precious Metal Review" and what I did is, I belong to the
        International Precious Metal Conference, and I get a copy of
        this quarterly, or did up until about 1992 when I couldn't
        afford it anymore so I had to drop out. But in there they have
        like temperature measurements, they have thermocouples that use
        precious elements in the thermocouples, and then they have a
        section on medical uses,. and what I am putting this up for is
        every issue has about 40 or 50 different articles under medical
        uses on the use of precious elements in curing cancer. There's
        Sys-Platinum and Carbono-Platinum that are standard materials
        being used in the medical community right now for testicular and
        ovarian cancer. </p>
      <p>But they have found that certain salts don't work very well and
        other salts do work well, and they don't understand why, the
        people that make these compounds. What it is, it's how good the
        salt is. How dis-aggregated the metallic bonds are. If it's
        below that critical cluster size, then the salt will dissolve in
        the aqueous saline system of the body. If it's above that
        critical size it doesn't dissolve. I think they're beginning to
        understand that, based on what I am seeing in the published
        literature. Anyway, I chose these two particular articles here
        because they're actually talking about how the platinum corrects
        the cancer. Now there's hundreds of articles, but they're all
        different compounds, of ways to solubilize platinum, and keep it
        soluble in the body. These articles talk about how the platinum
        cures the cancer. </p>
      <p>"The modification of DNA by sys-platinum..", which is the
        ammonia-platinum compounds, "...has been examined. Anti-tumor
        active platinum compounds induce in DNA, at low levels of
        binding, local conformational alterations which have the
        character of a non-denaturing distortion. These changes in DNA
        occur due to formation of inter-strand cause links...". Anyway,
        they give the reasons, but they actually, what they're saying is
        that it alters the DNA so that imperfection in the DNA that
        prevents the DNA from communicating with the, and what is it,
        the... Dr. McDaniels...what is it? No the material that goes
        out, finds the problem and comes back to the DNA and
        communicates to it. Messenger RNA? What I was told by John Fagan
        back at MIU is, what happens is the DNA alters ever so slightly
        and where the communication has to occur, this messenger RNA
        cannot communicate with the DNA, because of the alteration in
        the DNA. And what this does is causes the DNA to relax and to
        recombine corrected. Now the site is open for the communication
        to occur and the information about what has to be created to
        cure the problem now can be communicated from the DNA. It's like
        a little computer. And you must access those sites. </p>
      <p>This also happens to be what happens with AIDS. The affected
        virions from a milliliter of blood are measuring the DNA that's
        affected by the virions, and your immune system can't function
        where that communication has to occur. You correct that
        alteration in the DNA and now the communication occurs. Your
        body cures itself. But these elements correct the DNA that
        allows the body to begin to do what the body can normally do,
        and that's to take care of itself. Okay, complete different
        concept than the drug companies use, but this one is a natural
        system. </p>
      <p>What I am telling you, last night, is that over 5%, by dry
        matter weight, of your brain and nervous tissue, is made up of
        rhodium and iridium in the high-spin state. And, literally, you
        have light flowing in your body right now. Literally, you have a
        light body and you have a physical body, and they're totally
        independent systems. You have this liquid light, that you can't
        see the frequencies that it vibrates at, but it's flowing in
        your body right now, and it corrects the DNA and keeps the DNA
        corrected and functioning correctly. What happens is when a
        bunch of it, because you're deficient in these elements or it
        becomes pinned with the carcinogens, now the light cannot flow
        in that area. Now curiously enough, you find the aura also
        collapses in that area, because the aura is the Meissner field
        of the superconductor. And when the light cannot flow through
        that area, what you get is, you get resistance, you get heat
        build up, you get energy build up. It's like a rock in the
        stream, the water can't flow through the rock now. And now that
        DNA becomes altered, and it's getting too much energy as heat,
        and the cells begin to divide way too fast. When you put these
        elements into the cancer correctly, then the resonance
        connection can reestablish itself, where that rock used to be,
        and the rock dissolves away because the light begins to correct
        the DNA again, and that's the way it cures the cancer. </p>
      <p>But it is these elements that do it, and they are naturally in
        your body. All we're talking about is just adding more of
        something that's naturally supposed to be there. Even though
        iridium is 25% heavier than gold, in the monatomic form it's not
        a heavy metal, it's an element. It has no toxicity whatsoever.
        Pretty heavy stuff, huh? Next slide. </p>
      <p>(Question - What's the volume on that?) </p>
      <p>What's that? This one happens to be 1990, Volume 34, 4, page
        235. Okay? It's called the Platinum Metals Review. It's put out
        by Johnson Matthey and you'll either have to contact them or you
        probably can get it in .... a good science library should have
        it. 1990, I think. </p>
      <p>But you get into this area in Platinum Metals Review, you'll
        find all sorts of articles. These two I picked for brevity, you
        know, I could give you 50 pages of platinum metal being used in
        cancer treatment. But these particular articles talked about
        specifically how it's treating the cancer, not just doing it,
        but how it's doing it. And you know, this is specialized
        research that it's far beyond me to do, I mean I'm the dirt
        farmer remember, I just go out and dig out this stuff. Other
        people are doing the work, so you want to criticize it, don't
        criticize me, criticize them, they're the bad guys, you know,
        you don't like it, they're the bad guys. </p>
      <p>[1:18:57] Title. "Evidence from activation energies for
        superconducting, tunneling in biological systems at
        physiological temperatures". Who's doing the work? The
        Biochemistry Laboratory, U.S. Naval Air Development Facility,
        good old Uncle Sam. "Superconductivity has been observed. It's
        responsible for nerve and growth processes. The square of the
        activation energy is a function". . . anyway . . . "single
        electron tunneling between micro regions of superconductivity".
        They know that superconductivity is in our body. They know it's
        going on right now, they just don't know what's doing it.
        Because whatever it's doing it is like a stealth atom, it can't
        be analyzed, it can't be detected. No joke. Okay, next paper. </p>
      <p>Source? "Physiological Chemistry and Physics, III, 1971". Next
        paper. You're all welcome to go look these up, read the whole
        paper if you like. It's the concept I'm interested in today. </p>
      <p>[1:20:12] "Volume 85A, Number 6 &amp; 7, Physics Letters, the
        12th of October, 1981". "Non-linear properties of coherent
        electric vibrations in living cells". It's performed by the
        Institute of Physical Sciences, University Degli Studi, who
        knows what that is? In Milan, Italy, July, 1981. Anyway, what
        they're describing here is the resonance couple, it is a
        superconducting phenomena and I don't think on this page they
        use the word "superconductivity", but they're talking about Bose
        light condensation occurs in particular areas, they're referring
        to superconductivity, the papers say it on subsequent pages. </p>
      <p>[1:20:55] Okay, next page. Title again, is "Non-linear
        properties of coherent electric vibrations in living cells".
        That's a mouthful isn't it? Typical scientific terminology. Next
        paper. </p>
      <p>[1:21:15] "Magnetic flux quantization and Josephson behavior in
        living systems". Now, what they're talking about here is the
        Josephson junction, and that's a superconducting switch.
        Basically when you understand these are monatoms, resonance
        coupled, but if the magnetic field applied is great enough to
        break that resonance coupling then it stops the
        superconductivity, and that's called a Josephson junction. They
        gave a Nobel Prize to Brian Josephson for discovering that. But
        it's actually enough external magnetic field and instead of
        flowing more current it actually cuts between the
        superconductors, and because these are monatomic resonance
        coupled systems, any external field that breaks that resonance
        coupling stops the superconductivity. And they have found, in
        evaluating the superconductivity in living systems, that in
        fact, if you apply too much magnetic field it stops it. And that
        number is somewhere around 8-10 gauss. So, people who are
        working with these high magnets and all, it's too much magnetic
        field. If you're around power lines, it's too much magnetic
        field. Tremendous implications here if you really start thinking
        about the economics of it, what's involved and basically they
        have found superconductivity and they found that it acts like
        Josephson junctions and "its coherent excitation in the
        biological systems have already been proposed", and they go on
        to discuss their findings. And "the Josephson effects are seen,
        an anomalous, non-Ohmic current", in other words it has no
        voltage, there's no voltage at all, it's just pure amperage, and
        anyway, they said it's identical to the Josephson junction
        effect. Okay, next paper. This article is "Physica Scripta,
        Volume 40, 1989, pages 786-791". </p>
      <p>This is, "Biological sensitivity to weak magnetic fields due to
        biologically superconducting Josephson junctions". Good old big
        brother, Biological Laboratories, U.S. Naval Air Development
        Center in Westminster, Pennsylvania, and this one, they
        actually, at the very introduction here, in the summary, it
        says, "Various species of organisms can detect weak magnetic
        fields of .1 to 5 gauss", and that is in fact the field that
        this responds to. I'll tell you a very interesting phenomena,
        when we make this white powder under controlled atmosphere and
        it's sitting there in a sealed tube, you can run your hand about
        6 inches under the tube and the material flies around, in
        response to your hand 6 inches away, through the quartz tube.
        But if you take a magnet and put it under it nothing happens.
        But if you put your hand back under it, it flies around again. </p>
      <p>And because superconductivity is flowing hundreds of thousands
        of amps in response to the tiniest magnetic field, but when you
        get up to too big a magnetic field, it all stops. So it's like
        you step on it and it quits moving, but you let your foot off,
        it starts going again. It's alive. Is everybody following this?
        Are we all pretty close on this? Okay. Huh? Say it again?
        (audience question) Oh, when we make it to the monatomic state
        we hydrogen reduce it, we oxidize it, hydrogen reduce it and
        then we anneal away the hydrogen. In the annealing with the
        hydrogen it goes snow white. When it's in that snow white state,
        under an inert gas atmosphere and we cool it down, you can
        actually take your hand and run it about 6 inches under the
        tube, you know a long distance away from it, and the material
        flies around inside the tube. And yet if you take a magnet and
        run it 6 inches under the tube, nothing happens. And yet you put
        the magnet down and put your hand back and it flies around
        again. And what it is, it's the subtle magnetic field of your
        hand which your body, I don't know what..., does anybody know
        what the magnetic field of the body is about 6 inches away?
        Anybody in Kirlian photography or anything has ever read about
        that? Anyway, you are talking about very subtle fields, very
        tiny fields, but those tiny fields cause dramatic current flow,
        enough to levitate the material. Now you think about how much
        amperage has to be flowing in the sample to cause it to
        levitate? How much current has to fly down, flow down that wire
        before the wire literally suspends and has no weight? You know,
        it's got to be a tremendous amount of amperage. The books say
        about 150,000 to 200,000 amps/square foot, but no volts! </p>
      <p>So you can actually touch the stuff, feel the stuff, there's no
        sparks, there's no tingle, no tickle, but tremendous current
        flowing. Okay? Next one? </p>
      <p>This is the Biochemistry Laboratory, U.S. Naval, it's published
        in Physiological Chemistry and Physics, 1973, it's Physics V, it
        says 1973. Anyway, I'm just bringing some examples of it in here
        to show you that the phenomena is not "Dave's dream state, he's
        getting this information", that in fact the U.S. government is
        working in this area. That these materials are in your body,
        they're in your body naturally, their role is to keep your DNA
        corrected, they are very important to your function, naturally
        in your body, and nobody knows they're there. And probably one
        of the highest sources, natural sources of rhodium and iridium,
        is Aloe Vera. And one of the people who are concentrating on
        this particular material is this Emprise Corporation. And I
        don't own any of Emprise, I don't have any stock in Emprise, I
        don't make any money on Emprise, I'm just telling you that of
        the natural sources this is one of the best sources. There is a
        product called "injectable Acemannan", the original injectable
        Acemannan, that has been analyzed by us and we found that it's
        90% rhodium. 90% rhodium. They tell you it's, what,
        glucopolysaccharide? Is that right? Well, I'm telling you it's
        not. I'm contradicting them there, you know, they can sue me,
        they can do anything they want, but it does cure diseases and
        illness. Any disease that originates in the DNA it has the
        potential to correct. That's what you have to understand. </p>
      <p>They don't have all of the answers and we don't have all the
        answers yet. How much, how it should be administered, what
        dosages, how much you can stand, but it does correct the DNA.
        And you know, it's in Essiac Tea, it's in the sheep sorrel and
        slippery elm bark, it's, rhodium is in carrot juice, carrots
        that are raised in the southwestern United States, Texas,
        excellent source of rhodium, but the Aloe Vera is one of the
        highest concentrations and particularly the products being made
        by them, are excellent folks. </p>
      <p>And you know, he picked me up at the airport, wanted to talk to
        me about it, I ... he's trying to convince me of something I
        totally accept already, I know it's good, it has to be good, it
        has the stuff in it. You know, that's why it works. And so,
        because I can't treat cancer, I'm not a doctor, I send you to
        them. This is where you should be going and you should be taking
        it in mega-doses. I have not found any toxicity even in mega
        levels, so if you got somebody who's really sick that's probably
        their best chance of recovery is the high amounts of rhodium.
        Iridium seems to be the metronome. Iridium seems to play a role
        of regulating the biological activity in the body. It seems
        to... if you take high amounts of iridium your biology speeds up
        about 40 to 45 percent. </p>
      <p>Now, most people don't understand, they say, "I don't want to
        get old faster". No, life is the reverse of linear time. Linear
        time is like a river going downstream and you are like a boat on
        the river rowing upstream. When you are a young child and a
        teenager, you're rowing like mad and you're really going up the
        stream, as you get to be an adult you're lucky to hold your own,
        and as you get older, even though you're rowing, you're not
        rowing fast enough and you now are getting downstream where the
        water is slow. We're speeding up your metabolism with iridium.
        Iridium is like the Elixir of Life. Iridium is what makes your
        metabolism run faster, which in turn allows your cells to be
        corrected and to divide faster. Unfortunately iridium does speed
        up cancer growth also, and so you don't want the iridium if you
        are fighting cancer. You want the rhodium for cancer. Iridium is
        more for the healthy person who then has the cancer under
        control and then is looking for the Elixir of Life. Iridium
        works just like gold. Both of them seem to effect the, what's
        called by the acupuncturists, the meridian system. Over 80% of
        the rhodium passes directly into the urine and out each day. The
        iridium doesn't, the iridium seems to be absorbed into what they
        call the meridian system, for what that's worth. (question) Yes
        it is. </p>
      <p>That will be in what they call their "Man Aloe" product, it has
        rhodium and iridium. Emprise Corporation and the parent company
        is Carrington Laboratories. If you want to talk to somebody, Dr.
        McDaniels is over here, an MD, who's very knowledgeable about
        the material. He's one of their top researchers over there.
        Anyway, I don't want to get commercial on this so let's go on.
        Just about time for a break. I don't recommend many books, but
        this is one I strongly recommend for people, and this is not so
        technical that everybody can't read it and understand it. Danah
        Zohar, and that really is her name, Zohar, Danah Zohar has a
        Master's degree in Physics and a Ph.D. in psychology, real
        unusual combination here, but ... next slide. It's called "The
        Quantum Self" [Quantum Self : Human Nature and Consciousness
        Defined by the New Physics by Danah Zohar Published by Quill
        Publication date: May 1, 1991, ISBN: 0688107362] and Dana Zohar,
        you know, this is about her, anyway, go to the next slide. </p>
      <p>This is the credentials, you're not supposed to use their work
        unless you cite where it's from, so I give her credit. Danah
        Zohar writes very clearly and very accurately. This is chapter
        15, "The Quantum Vacuum and the God Within", as you can see
        we're kind of wrapping up our science and we're getting ready to
        go over into philosophy. It is my opinion, you got to have this
        science, you can't build a house on a weak foundation. You got
        to have the science, friend. But I don't want you to believe
        this when you leave this room; I want you to know it. Okay
        there's a difference between belief and knowing. Anyway, she
        writes very clearly, she's talking about the quantum vacuum and
        the god within. I think that's very interesting, the god, when
        you meet your god, when you have your garment of glory on and
        you come face to face with your god, he will be within the
        vacuum energy. That is the energy where it all began, where all
        matter that we know in this universe came from, is the vacuum
        where the zero point energy, the scalar energy, there's all
        sorts of names for it, but it is that underlying vibration that
        contains immense amounts of energy. And it's everywhere in the
        universe, timeless, all, every nucleus runs on it, every
        electron runs on it, and that's where you will meet your god. </p>
      <p>(audience talking &amp; questions) It's in current publication,
        you can get it at your bookstore or order it in. (more audience
        talking) Ah, William Morrow, Inc., New York. Okay? Anyway, I've
        got several pages of hers and there's just excepts that I want
        to read to you that she talks about. I've got a gentleman here
        doing our paperwork, that's really concerned about keeping
        everything in order and trying to do a very neat job. "It has
        been the argument of this book that quantum physics allied to a
        quantum mechanical model of consciousness gives us an entirely
        different perspective. That is a perspective from which we can
        see our selves and purposes fully as part of the universe and
        from which we might come to understand the meaning of human
        existence. To understand why we, conscious human beings are here
        in this material existence at all, the material universe at
        all". Okay, next page. </p>
      <p>Okay, Frhlich style Bose-Einstein condensate in the brain. This
        is the "boson". You know, Bose-Einstein, they call it bosonic
        physics. In the brain. "A coherent ordering of some bosons,
        photons or virtual photons present in neural tissue, or neuron
        cell walls. This quantum coherence makes possible the
        orchestrated firing of some or all of the 10 to the 11th neurons
        in the human brain and the integration of information to which
        their firing gives rise. Thus giving us the unity of
        consciousness and ultimately the sense of self and world.
        Without the ordered Bose-Einstein orchestration of photons or
        other boson there would be no sense of self and world, but
        equally without the material components of the neural tissue
        there would be no Bose-Einstein condensate. The two, quantum
        coherence and ground state of consciousness, and neural tissue
        matter in relationship to each other give the brain it's
        conscious functioning capacity. This capacity is linked to all
        the neural networks that process data from the environment. So
        at the level of consciousness found in ourselves and higher
        animals the creative dialogue between matter and
        consciousness..." Remember the boson being the consciousness,
        "...is obvious and crucial. Neither is reducible to the other
        and yet neither can function without the other. Equally and at a
        more basic level, this same ordered quantum coherence is thought
        to be present in all biological tissue right down to the level
        of the DNA itself. As we have seen it is linked inseparably to
        the essential creativity of life". </p>
      <p>Now, in simplistic terms we are back to talking about the very
        same things that, 3000 B.C., that the Egyptians were talking
        about. A light body and a physical body. They can't be separated
        from each other and yet the two need each other to function as
        we are now. The physical body cannot effect the light body but
        the light body can effect the physical body. The light body is
        actually what keeps the physical body corrected, so it doesn't
        become a rock, it becomes a living thing, and that's what
        corrects it. And you actually have two aspects to you. You have
        your physical body and you have your light body, and the light
        body is what is in resonance coupling with the zero point or
        vacuum energy all the time. Okay, it's like a radio frequency
        receiver that is literally resonating or quivering with that
        vacuum energy, each atom quivering with that energy and
        literally bringing that energy into our three dimensional
        existence. Okay, it manifests it up into us. So literally god,
        this infinite energy that's at the zero point, we can't tap that
        energy. We can't access that energy as our three dimensional
        being, because we can never look into the vacuum. </p>
      <p>But if we could shrink ourselves down, if we could shrink
        ourselves down to the world of the atom, if we could literally
        get inside of an atom, if it were possible in the world of the
        quanta, time goes forward and time goes reverse. Everything is
        reversible, but in our macro-three dimensional body time is not
        reversible. A superconductor, the physics of a superconductor is
        billions and billions and billions of atoms all in perfect
        harmony, perfect lockstep, all acting like one big macro-atom.
        That's why physicists are so interested in superconductors,
        because when they understand the superconductor they will
        understand the atom, because the physics are the same. But
        literally you can build a vessel, a vehicle, out of a
        superconductor, you can climb inside that vessel, and when you
        energize the superconductor, you may be there but you are not in
        this world anymore. You have created your own space-time. </p>
      <p>A superconductor's Meissner field excludes all external
        magnetic fields including gravity. So you have created your own
        space-time. Or in philosophical terms you are in this world, but
        you're not of this world. And when that occurs you have created
        your own space-time and you can move in space-time. You are not
        locked into space-time. And even better yet than that, that's an
        electromagnetic propulsion system, but better than that, when
        you become the perfect superconductor, when you become the
        atom.... ah, Adam, coincidental?... when you become the atom,
        you literally become timeless. There is no time forward as we
        know time. When you put on your Rainbow Garment, your Garment of
        Glory, your whatever you want to call it, that perfect Meissner
        field around your body, you become like an angel. You become
        timeless. You're in this world but you're not of this world.
        "Don't touch me, I don't have on my earthly garments". Where
        have we heard that before? Next page. </p>
      <p>Just a few more things that I would like to read to you. From
        the same book. "It has the same physics and through this physics
        we can trace our consciousness back to something that we share
        in some very primitive sense with any living thing and at each
        level where there is ordered quantum coherence; there is a
        creative give and take between that coherence and its material
        surroundings. But the interesting question is whether life
        itself has any antecedent. Is the living world just a random
        offshoot of brute universe processes that are themselves wholly
        alien to life or is there some early ancestor of the physics
        that becomes the physics of life. Can we trace or consciousness
        ancestry back to the non-living world? I have argued earlier in
        chapter 7 that ultimately we can trace our consciousness back to
        it's roots in the special kind of relationship that exist
        wherever two bosons meet. To their propensity to bind together,
        to overlap and to share an identity". That has to be unique to
        bosons. "Behaving as one large boson. Millions of bosons overlap
        and share an identity behaving as one large boson, but in it's
        primitive form, it is there whenever two bosons meet. Physicists
        working with photons call it the photon-bunching effect". In
        other words they tend to socialize. Next paper. </p>
      <p>Sounds kind of philosophical doesn't it? "Bosons are
        essentially particles in relationship. They are the fundamental
        building blocks of all nature's forces, the strong and the weak,
        nuclear, the electromagnetic and the gravitational. They are the
        most primary antecedents of consciousness, but they also bind
        together in the material world. The fundamental building blocks
        of the material world itself are fermions, for instance,
        electrons and protons, that those anti-social particles that
        prefer to keep to themselves". Okay, next paper. As you can see,
        she writes very clearly, she's very readable, and yet she's very
        accurate in her science. I strongly recommend her. She does
        understand this and has a very good concept. </p>
      <p>".. is that one of the fields within the vacuum is thought to
        be a coherent Bose-Einstein condensate, that it is a condensate
        and the same physics as the ground state of human
        consciousness". That is correct. "Further excitations or
        fluctuations as of coherent vacuum condensate appear to have the
        same mathematics as the excitations of our own Frhlich style
        Bose-Einstein condensate". In other words, these atoms, these
        single atoms in our body are resonating with the god force of
        the vacuum. Okay slide it on over. "With our physics of
        consciousness which mirrors the physics of the coherent vacuum
        as conceived in the image of god or as partners in god's
        creation. Like the ground state of human consciousness which is
        coherent but in itself uninteresting without features, the
        coherent quantum vacuum contains within itself all
        potentialities. It can realize that potentiality, however, only
        through the fluctuations within itself. Excitations that lead to
        the birth of particles and their relationships. In ourselves
        these excitations give birth to thought. In religious terms this
        splitting off might be equated with alienation of the Fall. Such
        a Fall is the prerequisite of all creation or knowledge, but it
        means leaving the Eden of total fusion or total Oneness with the
        Light. </p>
      <p>"It is possible to speculate that at each stage of his
        evolution this process would itself be in dialogue with the
        vacuum which we might call God". Which is why she says "Quantum
        Vacuum and the God Within". "...leading to further fluctuations
        within it. Mystical experiences are sometimes described as
        though they might be mirroring such a dialogue". Anyway she does
        this little drawing right here. The Fall... individuality...
        grace... grace..... drives towards greater coherence ....
        relationship ... people of Israel ... body of Christ ... quantum
        processes and redemption back to unity with God. So here is a
        masters physicist, but she has to be a psychologist, so she has
        both hats to wear at the same time. I think she does a very good
        job and I strongly recommend her writings to you. Okay. </p>
      <p>(audience question) Yeah. Oh yes I did. We talked about the
        Bose-Einstein condensate, the boson. See there's fermion physics
        and there's bosonic physics. Fermions are electrons that occupy
        certain space-time. When one electron spin 1/2 pairs with
        another electron spin 1/2, then it becomes a spin 1 boson. Okay,
        so when these electrons are screened by the high-spin nucleus
        all the electrons become paired as Cooper pairs or as light.
        There is no more particle aspect, it's pure light. So really we
        have a nucleus, but instead of having electrons around it now it
        has nothing but bundles of light around it. New world. Next
        slide. </p>
      <p>Now I just simply throw this in. "When you understand that a
        Cooper pair is actually two waves perfectly equal and opposite".
        Now this is very important to understand. That two waves equal
        and opposite create a null. Now you cannot measure two waves
        equal and opposite because their effects are canceled. So in our
        three dimensional existence you don't have anything that
        deflects anymore, a meter or a gauge or anything, it's a null.
        But do not ever believe that this is nothing. The two waves are
        still there, and this is a nothing that is everything. Now once
        again we'll repeat this. Two waves equal and opposite, the
        electron and the positron, the mirror image, are perfectly in
        harmonic, and they go like this, they're two waves equal and
        opposite. Or as this man puts it, this is Dan Winters, it looks
        just like this. Okay? When these two waves cancel, and you can
        see he does a real nice job, he shows them a little jerky here.
        That the wave actually has a width to it. And so when these
        waves appear to cancel what they really produce is a residuum
        wave that can be measured, and that is the Planckian frequency.
        Coincidentally, the vacuum energy. That is it and it only is
        produced with two waves. It doesn't make any difference what
        length those waves are as long as they're equal and opposite.
        When these two waves cancel they literally leave a residuum
        vibration that is very tiny and very short and that is the
        Planckian frequency. Next slide. </p>
      <p>And I just saw this. Dan Winters does such a good job of
        depicting it that I said, oh hell, I'll just use his slides. It
        just so happens that Dan Winters said that the nucleus or the
        DNA interacts with this frequency. So people in music and all
        this that play all this beautiful music, they say it calms the
        soul, it does all these things, they say, "Dave, would music
        effect the DNA itself?" I don't believe so because, I think,
        that what you're trying to effect is in fact a null, and that
        frequency that you're trying to generate is in fact a frequency
        so short that even our nuclear physicists can't produce the
        Planck frequency. But that frequency in fact is where everything
        is and that frequency just happens to interact with the DNA in
        the cell. It is the God-Force or the Creative Vibration or the
        energy that is everywhere timeless in the universe and that's
        what the electro-magnetic null produces. So what frequency is
        it? It's not important. It's two waves equal and opposite,
        that's what's important. (audience question) It's actually Dan
        Winter's book, it's a big thick book, but I don't remember the
        title of it. It's Dan Winter's book and that's what it's in.
        Anyway, next slide. </p>
      <p>And here he says, he's showing the cell again, the
        inter-reaction of the zero point energy which he shows depicted
        as the center or literally that the vibrations actually go to
        null, to nothing and that's the center. And that's the frequency
        inter-reaction of the DNA. That's one way of picturing it and so
        I'm using his slide, but that happens to be the frequency that
        does interact with the DNA, and his terminology here is,
        lightning-spun up-primal soup- all lightning is unipolar because
        of the consistent orgone electro-negative. Well he's talking
        about this as orgone energy. That I don't know if I ascribe to,
        I don't know if I like his terminology here, but his concept of
        the electro-magnetic zero point is accurate. I'm not telling you
        that I believe everything that Dan Winter's writes, I'm telling
        you that this particular part of it is accurate. Next slide.
        Okay, next slide. </p>
      <p>Okay there is a man by the name of Max Planck. You all remember
        Max Planck? About the turn of the century, 1906, he came with a
        little thing called little "h" that you have to put in all your
        wave computations because if you don't it isn't accurate. That's
        Planck's frequency. When Max Planck died he still couldn't tell
        us why you have to use Planck's constant. He just knew that that
        was the number it took to balance the equation, if you didn't
        use it, it didn't work. But he came up with this phenomena
        called the quanta. Well what caused him to come up with this is
        he encountered this phenomena I've got pictured up here. As you
        come across the electro-magnetic spectrum from the tower waves,
        radio waves, microwaves, when you approach the ultra-violet, you
        find that this energy right here, and he actually has this
        backwards according with how it's depicted today, as you come
        from these long wavelengths going to short wavelengths in this
        direction, that literally this is called black body radiation.
        This is the energy that emits from a perfectly absorbing black
        body. Okay and it builds and collapses and then the solar energy
        light spectrum is over on the left side and it collapses, and
        the two don't come together, and he was really disturbed of why
        don't these two peaks just run together like this. Why do they
        come up and just collapse? And what he was encountering is the
        electro-magnetic zero point. This is what I'm telling you. And
        I'm telling you the same thing he was telling you except I'm
        telling it to you with a different perspective. </p>
      <p>It was just to the... if you go on a electro-magnetic charge,
        you go from 100 electron-volts to 10 electron-volts to 1
        electron-volts, and then you can't go any further than that.
        Because in the real world there's 2.3 children in the average
        household in America. Show me the .3 child, I'd like to see him.
        There is no .3 child. On a macro scale there's 2.3 but on an
        individual family no family has .3. They have 2 or they have 3,
        but there's no .3. In the real world there's one positive
        electron and there's one negative electron, but there's nothing
        less than one. And so as you come 100, 10, 1, you can't go to .5
        or .1 or .001 electro-volts because there's no such thing in the
        real world. Now you can put anything on a chart, but in the real
        world at 1 it all ends. There's plus one and there's minus one.
        And what I want to know is where's the zero point, and it's
        between plus one and minus one. That's really easy to figure
        out. And so if you come down here from 100 to 10 to 1, then you
        have to turn around and go back plus 1, or minus 1, actually
        it's minus 1, minus 10, minus 100 and it goes back. Now if you
        pick up the electro-magnetic spectrum and you look at it you'll
        find absorption spectroscopy and emission spectroscopy all on
        the same chart. But they're not exactly the same, they're
        slightly offset because it's a logarithmic chart and where this
        turns around and goes back is where the electro-magnetic zero
        point is and it just happens to be dead center where these two
        won't reconcile. Next slide. And in fact what happens is as this
        turns around you get something that looks about like this. You
        get a singularity. It's where it literally turns around and
        starts to come back and at the point where it perfectly turns
        there's actually a singularity. Because in reality it literally
        turns and runs off in another dimension and then comes out of
        that dimension and continues on. The two miss each other by
        Planck's frequency, they don't touch. That's the width of the
        frequency. And that's what it looks like, that's literally
        coming up and turning and running down into another dimension
        and coming out of that dimension and continuing on. It's where
        another dimension intersects. It's where time intersects the
        electro-magnetic spectrum and it intersects at the
        electro-magnetic zero point. </p>
      <p>Where do you find that? You find it at the area where matter
        exists, you find it at the temperatures where you exist. To the
        right is the ionization spectrum, to the left is the
        ultra...&nbsp; is the microwave, but it's in this spectrum, in
        the middle, where the zero point is. And that's what you'll find
        out is that God, or the electro-magnetic zero point is within
        you. That's where it is. It's within all life. It's what is
        life. It's what makes up life. It's what makes up matter. All
        physicists are looking for that singularity. They're trying to
        crunch waves tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter and
        tighter together until they literally... and they're going way
        out past deep gamma trying to crunch those waves together and
        get them where they stack on top of themselves. But the amazing
        thing is at the electro-magnetic zero point they literally turn
        and run off, and relative to you they stack on top of
        themselves. It's inherent in the system that this singularity
        occurs at the electro-magnetic zero point. And all physicists
        are looking for the creation way out in deep gamma and right
        back here at null, it's where it all came from. It's the primal
        soup. It's where particles are born out of that vacuum energy
        every day. Electrons disappear into it and reappear out of it
        continually. It is the creative force. It's where it all came
        from. And if you get yourself shrunk down where you could climb
        inside that dark slit right there, where literally matter, the
        wave, no matter how long it is, it's running away from you so
        it's stacking on top of itself relative to you, if you could get
        inside of there, you would be one with God. </p>
      <p>And the way to do that is you must put on your Garment of
        Glory. You must put on your Meissner field and what that
        Meissner field does is it shifts you over into that. It's like
        taking this and just pulling it down over your self. And from
        that point you see all things, you understand all things and you
        become timeless. It's science. Okay? That's about the end, let's
        take a break, stretch your legs, walk around a little bit and be
        back in like 15 or 20 minutes. </p>

      <p>Okay we had a nice break and it's time to get back to the
        second half where David Hudson is going to go into the
        philosophical parts of his discussion. And before he does that,
        I wanted to tell you that we are going to plan a meeting, so
        that those of you who are asking about the Enterprise products
        with the Acemannan, we are going to have a meeting so that he
        can explain this to us. And I will contact you from your
        registration forms, and then the Eclectic Viewpoint will become
        a distributor for it, and then you can help us that way, that
        would give us extra funds. So we will become a distributor for
        that product and we'll get detailed explanations of it, about
        which products are the best and etcetera. David? </p>
      <p>David Hudson: </p>
      <p>Okay, Dr. McDaniels, you owe me one now. Okay, everybody here
        all right? Everybody back, settled down? I apologize to those of
        you who are bored with the first part of the presentation. I
        know that in most of the programs you attend you don't hear or
        see things quite that heavy as far as the science. But I really
        encourage you ladies to get a copy of that and take it to the
        man in your life. These men who say that they are nuts and bolts
        people. They want something they can taste, they want something
        they can feel, they want something they can look at. They don't
        want this, you know, feely, feely stuff that the women are
        always talking about. Well the women know this, it's amazing the
        women, the housewives who say, "Dave we just know it already. We
        don't need to see this, we know it". They've known it all along.
        It's the men that think with their mind, not their heart. It's
        the men that have to see this, so I apologize to the ladies who
        are bored with this, but it is the nuts and bolts, and it is the
        stuff that makes it science not philosophy, even though it
        becomes very philosophical very quickly. All right, now we're
        going to get into what most of the ladies do approve of, and
        that's the philosophical history. And you know, this is just
        investigations that I have done into the subject and some of the
        significant papers. I would like to just put these before you
        for your consideration, not try to prove or convince anything,
        just this is what I have found. </p>
      <p>As you recall in the other presentation I told you that one of
        the first people I went to was the Rabbi in Phoenix and this
        Rabbi said, "Oh yes, we know of the white powder of gold, the
        Hebrews do, but to our knowledge no one's known how to make it
        since the destruction of the first temple". He said, "This is
        the magic". Well this was a new subject to me, you've got to
        understand I don't even attend church, I'm a real bad fellow and
        I don't have any philosophy I'm trying to present here. I'm not
        trying to win anyone over to any thinking. This is information
        that I think is historically significant and I give it to you in
        the context of history, not in the context of a particular
        religion, so I want to make that disclaimer up front. I think
        it's significant to know about and I think that our
        understanding of the Bible becomes much greater after we become
        aware of this. Okay, put the first slide up. </p>
      <p>What is the Philosopher's Stone. What does it achieve? What are
        the attributes? Basically most of the information that was put
        out about the Middle Ages. This is a writing, "The Doctrine of
        Transcendental Magic" by Eliphis Levi, and I just, he gives it
        here in the Hebrew letters and so I am going to read these
        attributes to you. Okay, "Hereinafter follow the powers and
        privileges of him who hold in his right hand the clavicles of
        Solomon. These are the Keys of Solomon". Remember I told you
        these are a key, they're not the answer, don't get me wrong.
        This is not the answer, this is the way to the answer. And these
        are called The Keys to the Kingdom or The Keys of Solomon. And
        in his left hand the Branch of the Blossoming Almond which
        curiously enough in the Ark of the Covenant there was the Pot of
        the Manna and the Staff of Aaron. It blossomed. Okay?
        Coincidentally. Now I don't speak Hebrew and I'm probably not
        going to pronounce these letters right. This is the Hebrew
        alphabet and it begins with "Aleph". "He beholds God face to
        face without dying", okay, "and converses familiarly with the
        seven genie who are in command of the entire celestial army". In
        other words you communicate with the angels. "Beth", " He is
        above all griefs and all fears". "Gimel", "He reigns with all
        Heaven and is served by all Hell". "Daleth", "He rules his own
        health and life and can influence equally those of others".
        "He", "He can neither be surprised by misfortune nor overwhelmed
        by disasters nor can he be conquered by his enemies". "Vau", "He
        knows the reason of the past, present and future". "Zayin", "He
        possesses the secret of the resurrection of the dead and the Key
        of Immortality". "Such are the seven chief privileges and those
        which next are these". Now do understand these are the seven
        most important. "Cheth", "To find the Philosophical Stone".
        "Teth", "To possess the universal medicine". "Yod", "To know the
        laws of perpetual motion and prove the quadrature of the
        circle". "Kaph", "To change into gold, not only all metals, but
        also the Earth itself and even the refuse of the Earth".
        "Lamed", "To subdue the most ferocious animals and have power to
        pronounce those words which paralyze and charm serpents". "Mem",
        "To have the Ars Nestoria which gives the Universal Science."
        "Nun", "To speak learnedly on all subjects without preparation
        and without study". These finally are the seven least powers of
        the Magus. "Samekh", "To know at a glance the deep things of the
        souls of men and the mysteries of the hearts of women". Whoa!
        "Ayin", "To force nature to make him free at his pleasure".
        "Pe", "To foresee all future events which do not depend on a
        superior free will or on an indiscernible cause". "Sadhe", "To
        give at once and to all the most efficacious consolations and
        the most wholesome counsel". "Koph", "To triumph over
        adversities". "Resh", "To conquer love and hate". "Shin", "To
        have the secret of wealth. To be always a master and never a
        slave. To enjoy even poverty and never become abject or
        miserable". "Tav", "Let us add to these three sepentaries that
        the wise man rules the elements, stills the tempest, and cures
        the disease by his touch and raises the dead". </p>
      <p>That's a pretty heavy order. But after you find this out you
        become very interested in it. If this is really what it's all
        about then, you know, let's find out if this really is so. Okay
        next slide. </p>
      <p>(audience question) No I don't. I got it out of a New Age
        bookstore. It's "Transcendental Magic" by Eliphis Levi.
        [Published by Samuel Weiser, Publication date: June 1968, ISBN:
        0877280797] It's a small but fairly thick blue book. It has the
        6 pointed Star of David and "As above, so is below" and all of
        that on it. Anyway, most of you know about Zecharia Sitchin,
        some of his books are for sale out here. Zecharia Sitchin wrote
        an awful lot, he was involved in the translation of the
        cuneiform tablets that were found over in the Tigris-Euphrates
        Valley. His translations are excellent. Some of his conclusions
        I take issue with, that he extrapolates on math and he makes
        certain conjecture. What he does say is that, "The Gods came
        here to Earth. They lived here on the Earth. They came here to
        mine gold out of the sea waters." Now right there most of you
        don't know much about chemistry but if it's soluble in sea water
        and stays in sea water, it's elemental gold. Metallic gold salt
        in the sea water would precipitate and come out. Okay, so it has
        to be elemental gold. Okay, as the "oroide", the monatomic gold.
        They were not able to get enough gold so they begin to mine it
        in Africa so they could get more gold. What Sitchin says is
        obviously that gold was very important to them. They were not
        able to get enough gold so they went to Africa and began to mine
        it out of the ground. He says, "obviously they needed this for
        some important purpose such as a radiation shield around their
        planet". Well that's his conclusion. My conclusion is it was
        their food. It was the food of the Gods. That's why they needed
        the gold. </p>
      <p>Now all of your cultures even in South America and middle
        America, the gold didn't belong to the Indian peoples, they said
        it belonged to the Gods. It was the Gods'. Gold was the Gods'.
        That's because it's the food of the Gods. Okay, in Sitchin's
        books, he says that the Gods created, they took DNA of an
        Earthly being, they combined it with their DNA and they came up
        with this being that they called the Admon. The first man. That
        they kept him in an area called "Ed En". That eventually they
        learned how to make a female, and of course you know what
        happens when males and females get together. Well they began to
        have more children than they knew what to do with, they had more
        workers than the Gods needed so they begin to let some of these
        beings leave out of Eden. These beings were very unhappy, they
        weren't living very long. The Gods lived basically as immortals.
        They were only living for a few years and dying, and so the Gods
        picked a few of them, and this female God taught them how to
        make the Elixir of Life. How to make the Food of the Gods. These
        chosen people literally learned how to become sons of God and
        they took this knowledge to Egypt. Okay? That's how it happened
        in my opinion. That's Dave Hudson's version. </p>
      <p>In his book, he has a couple of things in there that I wanted
        to draw attention to. First of all, this underlined section,
        "The term Ben and it's hieroglyphic depiction, which is the
        elongated pyramidal shape, in time indeed acquired the
        connotations of virility and reproduction, and could well have
        been the source of meaning for the male offspring that Ben has
        in Hebrew. In addition to virility and reproduction, the shrine
        also acquired the attributes of rejuvenation. This in turn gave
        rise to the legend of the Ben Bird which the Greeks who had
        visited Egypt called the Phoenix." Curiously enough I live in
        Phoenix. "As these legends had it, the Phoenix was an eagle with
        plumage partly red and partly golden. Once every 500 years, as
        it was about to die, it went to Heliopolis and in some manner
        rose again from the ashes of itself or of it's father.
        Heliopolis and it's healing waters remained venerated until
        early Christian times. Local traditions claimed that when Joseph
        and Mary escaped Egypt with the child Jesus they rested by the
        shrine's well". Okay? He is on the right track. He's talking
        about the right subject. He's identifying with all the right
        characteristics, but he still doesn't have this one little piece
        of the puzzle. Okay, next slide. (audience question) That is
        from "Stairway to Heaven" by Zecharia Sitchin, [Stairway to
        Heaven (Earth Chronicles, Book 2 by Zecharia Sitchin, Published
        by Avon Books Publication date: November 1, 1990, ISBN:
        0380633396] and it talks in there about the old kingdom Pharaohs
        and High Priests that were sons of God that never died. That
        they, when it came their time that they literally traveled
        eastward across the Sinai until they came to the Island there of
        Bahrain where Dilman was, and they ascended by the Stairway to
        Heaven, or Jacob's Ladder if you are a Christian. And that in
        fact is the way they went to Heaven. They never died like we
        think of dying. And it's curious because they never found any
        remains of a Pharaoh of Old Kingdom Egypt. Anyway here's another
        reference, "Emil Bach", book on Genesis - Creation of the
        Patriarchs. Next slide. Anyway, that's just credit. </p>
      <p>I'm just kind of taking you through the information as I found
        it and as I pursued it. This is basically Joseph and his
        brothers and Emil Bach was a German researcher, and it says,
        "What it eliminated from his blood he reabsorbs spiritually.
        When through his Egyptian initiates, Moses had completed and
        ended Israel's immersion in the world of the Mysteries, Joseph's
        spiritual return home was a total one. We shall see later that
        through Moses and the Sinai revelation a spiritual restoration
        of Ishmael also took place. The four centuries between Joseph
        and Moses, which the Bible passes over, as it does with the
        period of a thousand years between Noah and Abraham, were a time
        of outward absorption, assimilation and quiet, inward
        incorporation of Egypt by Israel". Okay, that's something we
        always talk, in the Bible, about the problems the Israelites
        were having with Egypt, but, in fact, they traveled willingly to
        Egypt, and they lived in Egypt and they learned and gained
        information in Egypt. He goes into the secrets of the Bread and
        the Wine and the atmosphere of Communion Breath through them.
        Well, the Communion Breath is that which issues from the mouth
        of the Creator, which is one of the symbols for it in Old
        Kingdom Egypt. Remember I told you yesterday it was called the
        Golden Tear from the Eye of Horus, that which issues from the
        mouth of the Creator, which the Christians call the Word of God,
        but in fact it's the Spittle. And then it's the Semen of the
        Father in Heaven. </p>
      <p>And these three terminologies are what they called it in Old
        Kingdom Egypt. And the Bread and the Water, something different
        than the Bread and the Wine. And if all of you recall, the Bread
        and the Wine were shared with the twelve Apostles, but the Bread
        and the Water were shared on Mt. Herod with James, Peter and
        John. When Christ was transfigured before their eyes, a column
        of light came out the top of his head, okay? And then after that
        time, James, Peter and John could perform all the miracles that
        Christ had performed previously, and nobody could do what Christ
        did before that time. Okay, next slide. </p>
      <p>This is from the same book, "The image of Bread and Wine
        vibrates in the background, the charge administration of Bread
        and Wine, but still Egypt was involved and it was running out of
        the Bread. It's spiritual revelation was dying away". It was in
        Egypt where the Hebrews got this information and knowledge. It's
        where this technical capability came from, and they went to
        Egypt to regain what had come from Noah to Egypt. That's why
        Abraham had to go back to Egypt. Anyway, "From the beginning
        Israel had rejected the Bread and the Spirit revelation now
        deplete in Egypt. Israel was now ready to acquire the secret of
        the Bread for itself. Melchizedek bestowed Bread and Wine on
        Abraham but without yet removing the veil of the mystery from
        the Sacrament of Sun." Right here. "And then the Bread and Wine
        secreted in the events flashed forth only in concealed form out
        of the Soul into the individual soul." You know, once again, you
        have to understand that the role of Egypt was extremely
        important to the Hebrew people, and you have to understand that
        the Egyptians were conquered and slaughtered at the end of Old
        Kingdom Egypt. And from the end of Old Kingdom Egypt, the
        Egyptians were no longer Egyptians, they were Arabs. And it is
        from that time that the Hebrews had problems with them and
        fought with them and were always getting, you know, prior to
        that they got along well with them. They were an extremely
        powerful country and they were friends. </p>
      <p>(end Tape 4, side 1) </p>
      <p>(missing part of Tape 4, side 2) </p>
      <p>.... fact to remember it was actually, what was it Saul, that
        helped restore Egypt to the Egyptians and conquered the
        Amalekites, and turned it back over to the Egyptians. So the
        Hebrews were indeed fighting with the Egyptians but the
        Egyptians were really Arabs, and they're still fighting. They
        just don't get along at all. Okay, next slide. </p>
      <p>"The legacy of ancient spirit activity was utterly depleted.
        The expulsion from Paradise was complete." Then they talked
        about "the great Egyptian conqueror, Thutmose III, forced the
        entire Near East under his dominion on Palestinian ground sealed
        the death of the ancient super-century world condition". I'll
        tell you this Emil Bach is a typical German researcher, he's
        very methodical, very systematic and an excellent source of
        information. And what he's telling you is in fact what the story
        actually was in my opinion. Anyway, this is the introduction to
        the subject, you can change the slide. </p>
      <p>I began to dig into Egypt because in Egypt they were very
        careful recorders of information. The Egyptians were very
        methodical, very systematic and they recorded in stone, and so
        their recordings were very important, and they were kept for a
        long time. This is from The Book of the Dead, this is the oldest
        Book of the Dead, it's called "The Book of the Dead and the
        Papyrus of Ani". It's by Budge, the curator of the British
        museum. This is in the Papyrus of Ani, and the only reason, this
        is just a few of the pages, but what I am wanting you to see is
        the "what" and "is it". This question is being asked, they're
        talking about the changes that are going to occur as the godlike
        being, the Pharaoh, ascends to heaven, and they keep repeating
        this question. Move it on over where we can read the other side.
        They're talking about taking the tchefa food of the Gods, which
        produces the tchefa food of the Gods, behind the shrine, "Oh yea
        Gods who are in the Presence", it was called the Bread of the
        Presence. "I shall come into existence among you", and then,
        what then is it? You know, "which comes forth from the phallus
        of Ra". </p>
      <p>This is all symbolism, you got to not get into confusing the
        symbolism with what they're writing here. Their actual concept
        of the Creation was the "semen of the Father", who was Ra, the
        semen of God mixed with the blood, and they actually have him
        taking a knife and performing a circumcision on himself, and the
        blood and the semen mixed together. And that's how the world
        came into existence, how life began according to the Egyptians.
        And it is the semen of the Father in heaven and the material
        world, or the light and the material body. Anyway, I think we've
        got one more slide on it. And I ask you just get a copy of the
        "Book of the Dead and the Papyrus of Ani", and you'll see 40
        pages of "what is it", "what is it", "what is it", "what is it".
        They make a few statements, they say so "what is it?", they make
        another group of statements, "what is it?", another group of
        statements, "what is it?" You know, they're talking about
        becoming triumphant, you know, over the evils, and ask the
        question, "What then is it?" The day of the fighting of Horus
        who is the sun of God, and they're throwing excrement in the
        face of Horus, and carrying off the testicles of Seth. Well the
        testicles are also associated with the Grail, you know, the
        wounding in the thigh is always the symbol, the testicles are
        the semen of the Father in heaven. We're from testicles, and so
        the wounding in the thigh is the losing of your testicles. It's
        the non-reproductive capability and that's why it's always
        associated, these phallic symbols, everybody tries to say it's
        associated with reproduction, and the male concept. It's not,
        it's associated with this. They were talking about the Eye of
        Horus, they ask, "What then is it?", the Right Eye of Ra. And
        curiously enough, I wanted to show you here, that the hair right
        here is actually the symbol, "who raises up the hair", this is
        the enlightening or opening of your eyes so you can see. And
        what they're referring to here is that Thoth raises up the hair
        there and "he bringeth it, the living, healthy and sound without
        defect of the eye". What he's talking about is opening the third
        eye, the lifting the eyelashes of the third eye, and you
        literally know all things, and see all things, and understand
        all things even though your two eyes here can't see it. Okay?
        Let's keep asking this question, "What then is it?" And, you
        know, it's just kind of strange coincidence, when you find they
        say two or three sentences, and then they ask the question,
        "What then is it?", they say another couple sentences and they
        ask the question, "What then is it?" And it's very
        understandable that the Hebrew people, when they left Egypt,
        they had been there for 5 and 6 generations, would call it by
        the very same name, the "What then is it?" And the word Ma-Na,
        if you look in the Travels of Josephus, he defines it in there
        as a question that literally translates to "What then is it?"
        The word Manna means, "What then is it?" The very same thing
        that the Egyptians were calling it in Old Kingdom Egypt, which
        was before the Bible. Okay? Coincidentally it's the same name.
        Okay, next slide. </p>
      <p>And do keep in mind I didn't write this, somebody else wrote
        it, so.... This is from Schwaller De Lubicz, and he's, it's a
        book that he wrote called, "Sacred Science", [Sacred Science by
        R.A. Schwaller De Lubicz, Published by Inner Traditions Intl
        Ltd, Publication date: January 1989, ISBN: 0892812222] </p>
      <p>thank-you. It's up there on the top. Schwaller De Lubicz did
        not have the material, but Schwaller De Lubicz had a tremendous
        insight because he was German, he did a tremendous amount of
        research about Old Kingdom Egypt, and I wanted to read some of
        this, "To set free the Divine Word, to deliver the Living Fire
        from it's terrestrial prison where it is incarnated and
        corpified. Such is the aim proposed by the spiritual
        revelations. Meth illustrates the initiation to this end. This
        aim is offered to mankind and in general if the means to it's
        attainment is knowledge as the world of causes, the key to all
        power for the human being. Understandably then, the absolute
        conditions for unlocking this door lie in purity, selflessness
        and the mastery of instincts. This explains the enigmatic
        character of these teachings. Our own day already manifested as
        a disaster of ignoring such moral preparation and yet only
        intellectual secrets are involved today, not the secret of
        Divine spirituality. Indeed the Divine Word of the beginning is
        all that we call spiritual, and as well as that caused it fall
        into the mortal. This is the cause of the work and the struggle
        indispensable to the attainment of final deliverance. This is
        the Pharonic Opus Magnum. It ends in the Christic revelation,
        which is founded on the human incarnation of the Divine,
        revealing the ultimate phase". </p>
      <p>This is very profound writing, but it is exactly what was going
        on in Old Kingdom Egypt. Literally they had a Pharaoh who
        literally was a God. They had a Pharaoh who could read your
        mind. They had a Pharaoh who literally knew all right and all
        wrong without any judgment, without even hearing the facts,
        because he knew who you were when you were in his presence. And,
        you know, we think of having a king or a leader, but it's a
        mortal leader, and a mortal leader that only knows and has own
        self interest. In Old Kingdom Egypt, their Pharaoh was a God,
        and everyone believed it and everyone accepted that he knew, and
        it's not like anything we've ever known, I mean it's totally
        different. Anyway, next slide. </p>
      <p>Now this next slide is also a sacred science, "Taking the
        gestation of the human fetus as an example, we can conclude that
        there are times for the phases of Genesis. There are three black
        months, four white months, making seven in a first viable being,
        and then two months more, making nine for completing the perfect
        gestation of the prefigured fruit". Now coincidentally these are
        exactly the sequences that the person goes through that takes
        this material. There are actually three months of nothing but
        the sound, then there are four months of dreams, revelations and
        learning, and there's actually the two months where he becomes
        the perfected being. This also agrees with the Chinese writings,
        the Secrets of the Golden Flower, where he talks about it being
        a 10 month process, but it's 10 lunar months. And it says the
        very same sequence of events will occur. Anyway, it goes into
        all the colors and all here which are the black, the white and
        the red. Now these are all the colors that were used in the
        pyramids, that were sacred, and also the colors that were used
        in all the Arabs flags and everything today. Okay, next slide. </p>
      <p>I think this next slide is one that, just the picture says it
        all. It doesn't need any explanation. Once you understand this.
        The "Guardian of the Secret". Now pull it on over so they can
        see the picture. The King offers him the Anubis, the digestive
        system the White Bread, that is the white nourishment. The
        picture tells the whole story. See, the black Anubis represents
        the digestive system, and here he is, the King with the white
        powder offering it to the digestive system, and it's called the
        Opener of the Ways, the Keeper of the Secret. Now this is later,
        this is the 19th century. They still knew of this, but they
        couldn't make it. They didn't have the stuff anymore and so they
        were simply retelling the story over and over and over, but this
        is the story. I mean, this is it right here. The symbol, the
        digestive system and the King. This is whole story right here in
        a nutshell. They wrote so simply, it was all pictures, but the
        picture tells you the story. It wasn't words, it was the
        hieroglyphics, and there it is, and that's it. Coincidentally,
        doesn't that look like the Ark of the Covenant on the poles, and
        the Ark of the Covenant with the Cherubim on top. See the
        similarities in it? Okay, next slide. </p>
      <p>Okay this is out of "Ages in Chaos" by Immanual Velikovsky.
        Ages in Chaos [Hardcover, List: $32.95, Published by Buccaneer
        Books, Publication date: June 1990, ISBN: 0899667279] Now this
        one you can't get new, you've got to find it in used bookstores.
        I think it was 1957 it was published. Anyway, Immanual
        Velikovsky was trying to do a correlation between the writings
        in Egypt and the Hebrew Bible, or the Hebrew Torah, because he
        was Jewish. And he was researching all of the recordings that
        were in Egypt trying to find where they agreed with the Biblical
        because the Bible doesn't date things very well. The Egyptians
        were very methodical record keepers, and they did date
        everything very specifically. And the shewbread was obviously
        not a flower but a silver or gold. In the Book of Exodus it is
        said that the shewbread was made by Bezaleel, who was a
        goldsmith. Bezaleel is the man who made the Ark of the Covenant,
        made the golden decorations for the tabernacle, and made, you
        know, he was a goldsmith, and yet he made the Bread of the
        Presence of God. But the shewbread wasn't called shewbread then.
        The shewbread was called the Bread of the Presence of God.
        Remember before he was talking about being in the Presence as
        the Bread of the Presence? Okay, anyway, we need the next slide.
      </p>
      <p>He calls it the white bread, and it is called gold in this, he
        actually has the Temple of Karnak records here of the plunder
        that was taken to Egypt from the Temple of Solomon, and here it
        all is, and here is the depictions of it, okay, that's good. All
        I need to draw attention to is, see these little things that
        look like spiders right here? This is the hieroglyphic for gold.
        There, there, there, um, there, there, there, there, there
        (pointing to picture). All these first items are all gold. Okay?
        Then down here they got silver, and at the bottom they got
        copper, but the more important items are the golden items.
        Here's the tables, the golden tables, the golden vessels,
        anyway, the menorah, even the lion's heads are here someplace,
        yeah, here's a lion head. Anyway, if you read the Bible and you
        go through this list that is recorded at the Temple of Karnak,
        it's absolutely identical to what's recorded as being in the
        Temple of Solomon. Right here is the shewbread. Coincidentally
        it's the elongated pyramidal shape. It doesn't look like a loaf
        of bread does it? It's the symbol, the same symbol I just showed
        you, it's called the white nourishment, but here it's called
        white gold. And what Velikovsky said was they obviously meant
        silver, because they call it white gold. No, they meant white
        gold. They meant just what they said, it was white gold. </p>
      <p>It was the Bread of the Presence of God that once a week the
        High Priests of Melchizedek were allowed to go behind the Veil
        of the Holy of Holies, and partake of the Bread of the Presence
        of God, and then more Bread was set out for the next week as the
        offering to the God's feet, or with the Ark of the Covenant. And
        they consumed this material on a weekly basis, and they
        literally, this was the era of the great Prophets when literally
        God dwelt with his people. And these High Priests could
        communicate with the animals, they could telepathically know all
        things, it was the era of the great Prophets in the Bible.
        Anyway, that's the stuff and there it is, black and white. Next
        slide. </p>
      <p>I think that's the same thing, isn't it. Yeah, that's the same
        thing, got two copies of that. Okay, this is very interesting,
        this is the "Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered" by Eisenman and Wise,
        [The Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered : The First Complete Translation
        and Interpretation of Key Documents Withheld for over 35 Years,
        by Robert H. Eisenman, Michael Wise, Published by Penguin USA
        (Paper), Publication date: November 1, 1993, ISBN: 0140232508]
        just came out a year a year and a half ago. This is causing all
        sorts of problems in the religious communities and the academia.
        These are the scriptures that were held back for so long, for 30
        some years they couldn't translate them, they were too
        difficult, they had to be studied more. Well what it was is the
        Catholic Church told the people, and they basically were all
        Catholics, that you are to sit on anything that doesn't agree
        with the Pope's representations. And so all of the Catholic
        translators were just sitting on this information. Now they'll
        deny it, they'll "Oh no, oh no", but when Mrs. Bechtel smuggled
        this out of Israel and brought it over here on microfilm, she
        gave it to like 5 universities or something like that in the US,
        within a year and a half Eisenman and Wise had translated it.
        Okay, well everybody's furious because they translated it. Now
        this may not be exactly correct. There may be other ways of
        translating it, but this is basically correct. And what this is
        all about, these are all the ones that talk about the Essenes as
        being zealots. Now they were the people who'd not call any man
        Lord, and there's references to "'releasing the captives',
        'making the blind see', 'raising up the downtrodden' and
        'resurrecting the dead'. Resurrecting the dead? "The last
        allusion is not to be doubted" [DSSU p. 20]. It's very specific.
        Go on, move it on over. </p>
      <p>They make references to the Messianic leader, the Nasis, [DSSU
        p. 21] and I tell you most of us see that word and we think of
        Hitler and the Nazis, you know unfortunately Hitler was really
        involved with the German researchers who were in the
        Tigris-Euphrates valley, and there's only one thing worse than
        not having any knowledge and that's having a little bit of
        knowledge and perverting it. And so his super race of these
        white people and the Nazis all originated from this research
        which was going on in the 30's over in the Tigris-Euphrates
        valley. Anyway, the "Imagery relating to radiance and light
        pervaded the heavenly abode". Next slide. And here's the Hebrew
        in case anyone else wants to translate it. He actually has
        photographs of the actual script, which I didn't make copies of,
        but it's in their book and so anybody can just see it and, you
        know, make your own translations. This should be more from the
        Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered. "In the early Dead Sea Scrolls it
        talked about"... ah, here "Noah is someone who knows the secret
        of all living things", "there were three books, these books must
        have been as having to do with some mystic or unknown knowledge
        of the age." It talks about heavenly or angelic mysteries. Also
        the mystery of existence was very important, it's what they call
        the mystery of existence. Well literally it's the life essence.
        What is the Light of Life? What is it? What is it, that makes us
        alive? The Essenes were very heavy into this. Chariots of Glory
        - Mystery of Existence text in chapter seven. </p>
      <p>In most of the early Dead Sea Scrolls that were released,
        particularly the writings by Vermus, the Dead Sea Scrolls, most
        of the writings are very occupied with the Teacher of
        Righteousness, the Teacher of Righteousness. There has been a
        lot of conjecture who was the Teacher of Righteousness. Move it
        on over. No, that's not part of it. Is there any more of the
        Dead Sea Scrolls? (talking to projector operator) I thought I
        had another..... I got them mixed there. Yeah that one, come
        back to. Yeah this is it. "For he gave me the Knowledge of
        Wisdom and instructions to teach all the sons of Truth, the sons
        of Dawn, the sons of Light", this referred to. "To understand
        the era of Eternity and inquire into the past so as to know",
        presumably the hidden things. Ah, move it on over. "The idea of
        coming into light, the Sons of Light, to instruct them in
        baptismal procedures and including being purified by the Holy
        Spirit looking upon the Living Light". There's a whole bunch of
        information here. It's very good once you understand this. Go
        on, go to the next one. If you read in there, in the Dead Sea
        Scrolls, that they, in the copper scroll it says they had 26
        tons of gold and 48 tons of silver. Okay? 26 tons of gold and 48
        tons of silver. It's like they were making this stuff. They had
        no business, no way of making any money. </p>
      <p>"'Perfection', the Holy Spirit, and more startling even than
        these, that this 'is the time of the perpetuation of the way in
        the wilderness'. This is specifically tied to exegesis, to the
        Maskil's 'preparation of the Way' by 'teaching of the Miraculous
        Mysteries'." [Eisenman and Wise, The Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered,
        p. 164] That's enough, we can change it. The one I'm looking for
        should be along here someplace. Yeah. In here we finally find
        out who the Teacher of Righteousness is. To "take 'vengeance' on
        the Wicked Priest for what he did to the [Righteous Teacher]"
        Teacher of Righteousness, "i.e. 'swallowed him' or 'destroyed
        him'". The high priest swallowed the Teacher of Righteousness.
        The Teacher of Righteousness can't be a person. The Teacher of
        Righteousness is the Light. The Teacher of Righteousness is the
        Holy Spirit. Remember what we said, there's only one sin you
        never can be forgiven for, and that's to sin against the Holy
        Spirit, the teacher of Righteousness. When you are filled with
        the Light, when you are filled with the Spirit and you know all
        things and you understand all things, and to sin then is
        unforgivable because you knew better. So when the high priest
        sinned it's an unforgivable sin. "How the Wicked Priest pursued"
        the teacher, "the Righteous Teacher, to 'swallow' or 'consume'
        him". Okay? I don't know how many of you are familiar with the
        early Dead Sea Scrolls writings, but they talk repeatedly and go
        on at length about this Teacher of Righteousness. All right,
        this is what . . . the Teacher of Righteousness is something you
        can swallow. Right there. Right there. This is a big piece of
        the puzzle. You can swallow the teacher of Righteousness. In
        other words, it's a material you could take in your body. It's
        the Bread of the Presence of God. It's the High Priesthood's
        food, that only the High Priests could have. Okay, next slide. </p>
      <p>When you find out they had a metallurgical foundry, that they
        found in the center of Qumran. It's a metallurgical foundry.
        They had 26 tons of gold and 48 tons of silver. They believed
        they had angels living in their community. It says so in these
        Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered. They believed they had angels living
        in their community. When you get to looking, you find, John the
        Baptist was an Essene, the disciples were Essenes, Mary was an
        Essene. This is from the "Forgotten Books of the Bible". Okay,
        you can get this in most of the New Age bookstores. It's
        scriptures that the Church Fathers did not think was appropriate
        to include when they wrote the Bible. Right here, this
        reference, "Mary continued to live in the Temple as a Dove
        educated there and received her food from the hand of an Angel."
        Mary was selected and Mary was raised in the Holy of Holies as a
        High Priest and fed by an Angel with a Dove, all alchemical
        symbols. She was giving the High Priesthood and raised in the
        Holy of Holies. Only the High Priests could go in the Holy of
        Holies and she was raised as a High Priest, and she was fed the
        white powder of gold. That's my opinion. Next slide. </p>
      <p>When you understand that Mary, when she became filled with the
        Light, that the Essenes then chose Joseph to be her husband.
        When she became inseminated, when she became inseminated with
        this child. From the very first day of conception that child
        developed and grew in the Light. For nine months that child grew
        in the Light. That child, then on his birth, was born a son of
        God, not a son of man. He did not have to go through the 40 days
        of fasting and 30 days of taking this, and then go for 8 more
        months before he could be born again as a son of God. He,
        literally on his birth, was born a son of God. Okay? Now this is
        really going to upset some Christians, really going to upset
        them. But it's wrong, ignorance and stupidity, that they didn't
        have any knowledge of the High Priesthood. They did not know
        what a Melchizedek Priest was. They didn't understand what was
        meant by a Jew that was born a son of god. In the alchemical
        texts it's referred to, "Blessed be the man again of the
        Virgin". It's called the virgin birth, but it doesn't mean you
        re-enter the womb and come back out. It means you are, you go
        through this perfecting and become a new being. Okay? It's being
        born again as a new being. It's becoming filled with the Light
        or the Holy Ghost or the Spirit, totally perfecting every cell
        in your body, literally making you as you were meant to be in
        your prime. Then you are a true High Priest. Okay? </p>
      <p>The Bible says, "There is no way to come unto the Presence of
        the Father unless ye come as a young child". And that isn't an
        allegory. It's literal. It means exactly what it says. "In the
        end times we are to be a nation of High Priests not an elect
        High Priesthood". This isn't to be for just a few people. It's
        to be for everyone who wants it and seeks it for the proper
        reason. You will literally take a substance into your body that
        over a nine month period can perfect and purify the body. All
        your DNA is corrected. You literally become as you were meant to
        be in your prime, 17 to 20 years of age. And you can live that
        way virtually forever. Now it isn't forever, it's about
        800-1,000 years and what will happen is you'll reach a state
        where you become so perfect that you literally can ascend
        without dying. You literally can go anywhere that you think
        about, your Light body can travel to it, it can take your
        physical body with it, because the Light body is greater than
        the physical body. It exceeds the physical body, and it can move
        in space-time through the vacuum. They call it bio-location,
        they call it lots of things, and the Bible calls it the Rapture.
        But it's to come in the End Times. </p>
      <p>Now what I want you to understand is this is science people,
        this is not philosophy. Some of this is philosophy but it's also
        history and it's history that fits with the science that we have
        now. And if you don't believe it, I'm sorry, because it's coming
        anyway. If you can't hear the hoof beat, you're not listening,
        because it's coming. All right, it's called "The Last Days",
        "the Types and Shadows" from the Bible and the Book of Mormon.
        It's by Abraham Gilliadi. Abraham Gilliadi studied the
        Rabbinical priesthood and became a Rabbi in Jerusalem, and then
        he converted to the Mormon Church. Here's credit for using the
        excerpts out of his book. Abraham Gilliadi sent me this book,
        signed it, and has been following my work very closely, is very
        concerned that I am treating Aids patients. I told Abraham, "I
        don't judge people, you know, it isn't my... it's no concern to
        me how they got the Aids". Some people got it from blood
        transfusions. Some people got it from accidents. It's not for me
        to say "how did you get this?" It's a very serious disease, and
        you know I have to try helping them as I can. </p>
      <p>I have concluded, now this is a study of the Book of Isaiah,
        this whole book. It's a study of the Book of Isaiah, because the
        prophet Joseph Smith told the Mormons that they should carefully
        study the Book of Isaiah, that he was a great prophet. And in
        reading that it makes reference to the Arm of the Lord, and he
        says, "I have concluded that the Arm of the Lord refers to a
        servant of the Lord who is a descendant of David, who precedes
        Jesus' s second coming". </p>
      <p>The metaphorical pseudonyms such as the Lord's Hand, Ensign and
        Arm. "The term Arm I have found connotes the Lord's intervention
        in the affairs of humanity through the instrumentality of this
        servant. The Davidic Servant in effect accomplishes the same
        restoration of Israel and Judah that the prophet Joseph Smith
        attributes to a later day David. Israel and Judah's conversion
        and restoration Joseph predicted will occur in a Day of Power.
        According to the two Isaiah chapters a Servant of the Lord,
        who's at first hidden from the world, but whom the Lord reveals
        will gather and restore later day Israel. At that task righteous
        Gentiles will assist him". It says it's taken to the Israelites
        and they turn it down and so it's taken to the Gentiles and
        developed, which is why I'm here. "According to the two Isaiah
        chapters the Servant of the Lord, who is at first hidden from
        the world, but whom the Lord reveals will gather and restore
        later day Israel". "The Lord's making bare his arm in the sight
        of all nations therefore refers to the universally revealed
        mission that the Lord's Servant performs when the Gentiles
        assist him. Although we do not know the identity of this
        servant, we do know from scriptural patterns that such a servant
        will not announce himself but will be called to God as was David
        anciently through the prophet Samuel". Okay, next slide. </p>
      <p>Abraham Gilliadi can read Hebrew, he translates all of the
        Israeli, you know, Hebrew writings, the ancient texts, and he
        also then has access to more recent. "We find that the buried
        Lord's Arm revealing the Lord's Servant in the sight of all
        Nations has fundamental polarizing effects on all people of
        Earth, not the least on us. As soon as this polarization takes
        place the Lord brings on His cleansing judgment of the Earth".
        Okay, I don't think there's anything on the next here, so change
        it. You're welcome to buy the book and read the whole book, I'm
        just giving you some excerpts out of it that I think are
        significant. "As the Lord endowed Nefi with His powers the Lord
        will endow the Servant with His power. As Moses led Israel
        anciently so the Lord's Servant will lead the new Exodus out of
        Babylon and the new wanderings in the wilderness to the Promised
        Land". All right, the Promised Land is the new Jerusalem.
        Remember I told you, "The streets of the New Jerusalem will be
        paved with gold so pure as like unto transparent glass". The
        foundations will be made of gold like unto transparent glass. I
        don't think there's anything I need to bring to your attention
        on the other side so change it. Our analysis of the terms Great,
        Marvelous and Work also suggest the Lord's Work is prominently
        revelatory in nature and brings to light knowledge hidden up
        from the foundation of the world because of unbelief. This
        Great, Marvelous Knowledge appears in the sealed portion of the
        Book of Mormon and other books. Such knowledge will be revealed
        initially among the believing Gentiles and from these Gentiles
        it will go forth to the house of Israel. This additionally
        revelation contains the greater things or the more important
        truths in relation to them the Book of Mormon is called the
        Lesser Part. This new revelation includes a knowledge of the
        mysteries of God.." Remember I talked about the Essene, the
        mystery of existence? Okay. "The new revelation includes a
        knowledge of the mysteries of God, it comprises all things shown
        to have been in the past, things that were sealed up to come
        forth in their purity. They consist of wonders of eternity, the
        mysteries of the Kingdom of God from days of old and for ages to
        come. This Great, Marvelous Revelation nonetheless comes forth
        in a time of wickedness among the Lord's people. The new
        Revelations therefore convince the Gentiles among whom they come
        forth of the error of their ways. The Revelations show forth to
        all men the wickedness, abominations and follies of the Gentiles
        among who the Gospel has already gone forth. The Gentiles, when
        they become clean before the Lord and truly exercise faith in
        him and become sanctified, then is the time that the Lord will
        bring forth to them his Great and Marvelous Revelations. Of
        necessity the revealing of the Lord's work comes forth through
        as a point of seers of seers, and a large part of it involves
        the translation of ancient records. Although a man declares the
        Great and Marvelous Work to them they do not believe". There's
        many people who just do not hear this. You talk to them and they
        just do not hear it. next slide. </p>
      <p>I swear you think you're speaking a foreign language. You know,
        they just cannot hear it. "The Lord endows his covenant people
        with Divine power to preserve them from their enemies. Moreover
        the Great and Marvelous Work by it's very nature comes forth by
        the gift and power of God. Such a spiritual condition comes as a
        blessing based on faithfulness, none can imitate it. These
        miracles include certain small means the Lord provides the
        confound the wise. They include healings." "As shown in the Nefi
        sequence the Great and Marvelous Work causes a final and
        universal polarization of the righteous and the wicked. In other
        words it sets completely at odds those who repent from those who
        harden their hearts. In that day all will discern clearly
        between the two. To the one, the Great and Marvelous Work comes
        like a Light releasing them from darkness and in the joy of the
        Lord, and to the other it spells damnation. The wicked therefore
        seek to destroy it". Move it over. </p>
      <p>"The entire purpose of the Great and Marvelous Work therefore
        is to restore the Lord's ancient covenant people". The word
        "covenant" means "to eat bread with". "The ministry of salvation
        occurs when the Lord sets his hand the second time to restore
        his ancient covenant people from their lost and fallen state.
        The second time is the Lord's day of power." The term "Hand"
        like the term "Arm" in the Book of Isaiah serves as a
        metaphorical pseudonym of the Lord's Servant. "The Lord setting
        his Hand in other words denotes the Servant's mission of
        gathering the Lord's covenant people in the last days". Now you
        shouldn't understand this as "bringing together in a single
        room". You have all gathered here today, but the gathering
        together that will occur is the coming together in one heart and
        one mind. It isn't a physical coming together. It's learning to
        think as one people. Next slide. </p>
      <p>"We usually associate the word restoration with the restoration
        of the Gospels through the prophet Joseph Smith. The scriptural
        definition of the term restoration is not identical with our
        usual concept of the coming forth of the Gospels. That
        distinction holds true particularly as the expression
        "Restoration of all things". We discover that the Restoration of
        all things is not only future but that it flows directly out of
        the Lord's Great and Marvelous Work. Isaiah who's prophecies
        exemplify restoration uses the word "restore", which the
        Hebrew", what, I can't see it, "S-L-V-W-B" or something. "....in
        a few instances. All such instances refer to physical
        restoration of the Promised Land from it's ruined cities of the
        tribes of Israel and of political authority. Nefi, in quoting
        from Isaiah, identifies the purpose of the Marvelous Work as the
        restoration of the Lord's people from their lost and fallen
        state. That restoration occurs when the Lord raises his hand for
        the second time. Such restorative events imply that the Gospel
        is on the Earth at the time they occur, though they are not
        identical with the actual restoration of the Gospel." I agree
        with him totally. You might like to know he's been
        excommunicated from the Mormon Church. </p>
      <p>This is more of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is out of sequence.
        Anyway, this is more of the talk about the mysticism, emphasis
        on the mysteries of God, the Cavalier of Knowledge, Goodness,
        Faithfulness, Glory of His Holy One, the use of the term
        "Fountain", the Eternal Fountain, the Fountain of the Living
        Waters, the Eternal Secret, the Obscure Secret, even the mystery
        of being or the mystery of existence. I think those are really
        revealing in their nature, you know, the mystery of existence,
        the mystery of being. You know, who are we, where does it come
        from, why are we alive? Go back to Danah Zohar's book and read
        it again and you find out that.... Yeah, this is more of
        Gilliadi's, "That restoration is both spiritual and physical.
        The prophet Joseph Smith, the keys and powers of the Priesthood,
        whenever I restore all things and make known unto you all things
        in due time. The confer of the Priesthood which will bring about
        the restoration of all things and a knowledge of all things in
        the due time of the Lord. The Lord says, 'For I am about to
        restore my things to the Earth pertaining to the priesthood'".
        Even Brigham Young, and I'm not reading now, Brigham Young, the
        second prophet of the Mormon Church, which they call themselves
        the Latter Day Saints, said, "At this time you grant the
        Melchizedek Priesthood at the same time you grant the Aaronic
        Priesthood and we know that is not as it should be. When we
        grant the Melchizedek Priesthood there is knowledge and
        understanding we should give and we do not have that knowledge
        at this time. We hope we are prepared to receive it when that
        knowledge is brought to us". </p>
      <p>The knowledge is what comes with this material. It is the food
        of the High Priesthood. Reading again, "Israel gathers from
        among all nations when the time of the Gentiles are fulfilled".
        "Of Elias Jesus said that he must come and restore all things.
        Elias denotes an office, that of a forerunner of Jesus coming to
        the Earth. His mission like that of John the Revelator and
        others is to prophesies before nations, tongues and kings. The
        prophet Isaiah ascribes these preparatory tasks to the Lord's
        Servant of the last days. The Lord's Servant therefore is the
        Elias spoken of. The Lord will lead the Saints out of bondage by
        power with an outstretched arm. The Lord's latter day Servant
        will prophecy the people and kings". Okay? </p>
      <p>Are there no more? There should be some more transparencies,
        yeah? More of the Dead Sea Scrolls? There should be a couple
        more there. What are they? What does the subject say? That I'd
        like it put up next. There's a lady by the name of Virginia
        Essene and she just sent me this book, and in this book on page
        196, it's "The New Teachings for an Awakening Humanity", the
        1994 edition. It says, "This deliberate DNA retardation not only
        caused the Earth's human separation from God and the Divine
        forces, but it prevented remembrance of your spiritual origins
        and your recollection other galactic human beings presently
        alive on nearby planets and star clusters, such as the brightest
        star in your sky, Sirius. This genetic interference and
        retardation buried the truth that all Earth humans were
        originally physical beings capable of telepathic communication,
        clairvoyance, clairaudience, and clairsentience, that is they
        could consciously see, hear, feel and transmit or receive
        various vibratory frequencies of the light and information which
        was your natural inheritance". Next page. </p>
      <p>She gives three ways you can achieve this again. One, two, but
        I am most interested in the third one. The third one is teaching
        humans how to make Manna, be in an alchemical process spoken of
        in the Bible which transforms certain rare elements into health
        giving superconductive products. The greatest of all elements is
        gold because when it is transformed into a white powdery
        substance which is easily assimilated by the body it becomes a
        Light fuel for extended life, food for the Gods, beloveds, food
        for achieving the 12 helix full consciousness. We have already
        given you iridium and Rhodium". (audience laughs) That's what I
        said. I had to call her up. She sent me this book and said,
        "read this page", and so I read it and I had to call her up. She
        claims that she was given this information by Light beings, by
        Ascended Masters, she said that it was channeled to her. Ah,
        Virginia Essene, E-S-S-E-N-E, she's in California. [1:04:30] </p>
      <p>(audience comments) Yea. It's kind of an addendum to an earlier
        book she wrote; kind of like an addition to it. Anyway she
        claims that she had spoken publicly about this rhodium and
        iridium before she heard my tape and before I gave my first
        presentation in Virginia Beach in the spring of last year. And I
        asked her if she could send me a copy of the tape just so I
        could confirm it; that she didn't copy this out of my tape. I
        still haven't gotten her tape, so. . . Anyway I have to show it
        to you. It is accurate. For what it's worth there it is.
        (question from audience) New teachings for an Awakening Humanity
        by Virginia Essene. It's a 1994 edition. It came out in, I think
        it was July or August of 1994. So, if she took it from my tape,
        she hurriedly got it into print. Although she publishes her own
        books so that is possible. </p>
      <p>Anyway there is one more book that I really think is important.
        This is The Book of Knowledge: Keys of Enoch by J. J. Hertach
        written in 1975 and first published in 1978. This is on page
        486. Through a projection of Light coming from the recorder cell
        (or Merkabah activity) ". Which he claims he was taken in the
        Merkabah which is a UFO for those people . . . yea chariots of
        fire, whatever. "selected individuals can be reconnected with
        the Adam Kadmon image" (now the Adam Kadmon is the original
        Adam, the way were created before the fall) "through a resonance
        operating through hyperdimensional space. . . . Some individuals
        receive an additional high frequency resonance transmission
        operating in parallel phase with their normal resonance
        bonding." Now this is some individuals not all individuals.
        "This additional high frequency resonance operates as a
        subcarrier (through these individual biotransducers) to modulate
        paranormal energies. This explains how paranormal gifts can be
        received through the resonance of hyperdimensional space which,
        in turn, can change the molecular arrangement of material in
        conventional space." </p>
      <p>"By adjusting the conventional resonance patterns there can be
        a molecular infall or biolocation and through hyperconjugation
        (no-bond resonance) the release of tremendous energy results in
        the changing of molecular structure (e.g. melting of structure,
        discorporation and reincorporation of form, etc.)." </p>
      <p>". . . Moreover, as this high frequency resonance becomes
        aligned with the biotransducer system of the body, the seven
        chakras can be completely transfigured into the divine image." </p>
      <p>Next slide. </p>
      <p>That was page 486 and 487 of The Book of Knowledge: Keys of
        Enoch. Written in 1975, published in 1978. Now I hope that those
        of you who were awake when we went through the earlier part of
        our presentation cause here on page 497, "At this time, man can
        remove the orbital shells of 'electrons and positrons' as
        quantum (corpuscles) of light." Skipping on down, "it ultimately
        advances into the purer consciousness forms of spiritual
        evolution. </p>
      <p>43 In essence, this is the unfoldment of Living Light with the
        Holy Spirit as it interpenetrates quantum mechanical
        evolutionary orders with new form and attaches a function of
        divine purpose to the meta-material structure of the universe as
        a Shekinah unfoldment. </p>
      <p>44 The Holy Spirit regeneration changes extreme distortions of
        the. spherical symmetry, found in some nuclei of atomic and
        subatomic particles, to a perfected harmony with the
        consciousness programs of the Elohim." </p>
      <p>Wow. Wow! When I read that I just, wow. I mean the physics
        community didn't know this in 1978. How does a professor of
        Hebrew receive this? Well he claims he was taken up in the
        Merkabah and taught by Enoch. And Enoch was the alchemical
        teacher. Who should know this if it isn't Enoch. </p>
      <p>Written in 1978, they published that book. It just blows my
        mind folks, just blows my mind. I mean it's not science I can't
        explain that. And when I told J. J. Hertach about it, and he
        heard about my work, he mentioned me about six times to the
        people when he was making his presentation in Sedonia about how
        important our work was. You know, he was given this information
        by a revelatory experience. It was implanted in him and he was
        told to write down and write the book. He doesn't know anything
        else. He did as he was instructed and he wrote the book and
        there it is. But that information is so specific. In 1975 they
        didn't know about electron positron pairs operating as light.
        They didn't know about electron orbital reconfigurations. They
        didn't know about changes in the symmetry of the nuclei. There
        it is. </p>
      <p>Do you have any others? We've got about five minutes for
        questions. Does anybody have any significant questions that
        can't wait till Friday? </p>
      <p>(Question - Are you going to be able to verify the twelve
        strand helix DNA at the end of this mans book?) </p>
      <p>I can't do that. There are several people over in California
        who have contacted me that have the capability to do that. And
        what we want to do is to pick some people and literally take
        their blood samples, take tissue samples and monitor. . .
        Valerie Hunt who monitors the magnetic fields around the body
        has offered to do the monitoring on that. She does it with
        instrumentation. And we are literally going to monitor the nine
        month progression from beginning till end and see what really is
        changing in the body. </p>
      <p>(Question - Have you started that yet?) </p>
      <p>No I haven't started that yet. When we gave this man the
        rhodium and iridium we didn't know if anything was going to
        happen. I mean I didn't know any of this either. It's as this is
        happening and this high frequency sound. And I go back to page
        486 and it talks about a high frequency sound. I say, by golly
        maybe this is what is supposed to happen. And then after three
        months the visions start; exactly three months. A month taking
        it, two more months then the visions start. Three months of
        black, four months of white. And the visions went for four
        months. And at seven months is when the man starts having these
        capabilities of seeing things that no science can explain. He
        understands things that I can't tell you how he does it. But
        it's the red stage. And at the end of the nine months supposedly
        he becomes a light being; he comes through the cosmic egg. I'm
        telling you about it. It's obvious that at nine months you are
        going to say "Dave, what's happened?" I'm setting myself up for
        a goody here. I don't know what's going to happen. But it does
        bother me that everything has happened exactly on schedule to
        this point. So it means you really begin to wonder; maybe this
        is really going to happen. </p>
      <p>(Question - When will you know?) </p>
      <p>In about three to four weeks we should have answers for you. </p>
      <p>(Question - Are you familiar with the book The Bringers of the
        Dawn?) </p>
      <p>It seems to me like I read it, but it's been some time ago I
        read some of it. </p>
      <p>(In that book it talks about the twelve helixes in the DNA and
        how that early on we were separated from most of those helixes
        and that we'll be reconnected to those and that the gods are
        living off of fear. They want to keep us in fear so that they
        can live off of our fear. As opposed to the love. You had the
        love, love, love thing at the beginning of the program and so
        the love joins us all into the oneness but the fear keeps us in
        separation.) </p>
      <p>That's what it's all about, love. </p>
      <p>(Question - I forgot to ask one thing. Are you familiar with
        David Ashe's work, the British physicist who's kind of . . . As
        I'm watching and listening to everything you are putting
        together I'm running David Ashe's work and I'm wondering if
        you've heard of him?) </p>
      <p>No. </p>
      <p>(He's written a book called Science of Ascension?) </p>
      <p>Yes I've heard of that. I haven't heard of David Addis but I've
        heard of his book. I'm terrible. I pick up books and I don't
        look at the cover page, I don't look at the author, I just read
        the book. </p>
      <p>(So you've read his book?) </p>
      <p>Yes, I'm familiar with it. Yes. </p>
      <p>(What did you think of what he put together?) </p>
      <p>I thought it was interesting. It wasn't specific enough to
        help. That's the problem I have with things that aren't
        specific. That's why these particular references are really
        significant coming from me. Because these are channeled books
        and yet they are right on. Absolutely how do you explain this.
        And so, you know the Keys of Enoch is a book that I do
        recommend. I don't think there is enough in there that I can
        recommend it. Now I do have other information if people are
        interested in faster than light time travel and instantaneous
        communications through the vacuum and things like this. But you
        know we are supposed to wrap up by five which is pretty close
        here, and um, um . . . Anybody else here? </p>
      <p>(Question - It's in the Bible, there's a reference to . . .a
        statement goes to the effect that "if thine eye be single thy
        body shall be filled with light." Can you identify that as some
        of the things you are talking about?) </p>
      <p>Sure, when you raise the eyelashes; when you open your third
        eye; when you become filled with the light and you have the
        third eye opened; the single eye, then you know all things you
        become the immortal being. You become the high priest. That is
        what it is all about. In the end times we are to be a nation of
        high priests. So that is what it is all about. It's preparing us
        for what is to happen in the end times. </p>
      <p>(Two things. One is a comment that Max Planck one day, who you
        talked about, said "we are light". I thought that was an
        interesting statement especially in the light of what has been
        said here tonight. The other question I had is can someone,
        without having a linear accelerator, put something into a high
        spin state?) </p>
      <p>Sure. What I've presented here today is that these elements
        exist naturally, in nature, in the high spin state. And that's
        the point, you don't need a linear accelerator. They are there
        but they are invisible to analytical instrumentation but they
        are there. And so in drinking carrot juice you are getting
        rhodium in the high spin state. When you take the aloe vera jell
        from certain companies it is good, from others there is nothing.
        So you have to know which companies you are doing business with.
        But yea, there are many, many, many natural sources of the high
        spin elements. That's what the presentation's about. Ok. Yes
        sir? </p>
      <p>(Question - Yesterday you said that the gentleman on the test
        run had nine months of . . . .) </p>
      <p>Eight and a half months. </p>
      <p>(Eight and a half months. Did he see in the future as far as
        events that are coming and things like that; did he have any
        messages for anybody here in Dallas?) </p>
      <p>(Audience laughter.) </p>
      <p>Ah, no the gentleman . . . . he really has become disturbed. He
        lived in north Phoenix and he really . . . . when you are in
        this state in the fast to begin with, your senses become really
        keen. You can smell everything. You can taste everything. You
        can hear everything. You know, everything is just amplified
        dramatically. And he had to leave and go to New Mexico because
        he was just going crazy with all the energy that was feeding
        into him there in the valley. He has recently moved out of the
        north valley and he has gone up north to an area called New
        River, which is north of Phoenix. Trying to get away from all of
        this nervous energy. And so um, he really, really takes this
        very seriously. I mean its very profoundly changed his life and
        he is withdrawing away from most people. Trying not to involve
        with other people because he just sees things that bother him
        and he walks away from it. He doesn't like to talk about it.
        When I pump him about it he will share with me but . . .
        Initially he was talking a lot but now he's becoming quite
        withdrawn. And he's totally healthy, no illnesses and his brain
        functions fine. Everything's normal. But he just has this
        empathetic capability. He just interreacts with people and he
        just tries to get away from too many people. It just inundates
        him with feelings and emotions and all. So basically that's it.
        He doesn't have anything to say to the people in Dallas. </p>
      <p>(Question - Has he changed his diet as far as what he eats on a
        regular basis or anything?) </p>
      <p>Nothing that he's communicated to me. I mean, we didn't know
        this sound was going to continue. We assumed it was going to die
        out as soon as he went back to eating normally. So the very fact
        that it continued the test was still on; it didn't end. And you
        know it's still ongoing. It's still continuing to take place. So
        um, all I can tell you is it will be what it is meant to be. And
        what ever that is, is what it is going to be and we aren't going
        to do anything about it. Ok. </p>
      <p>(Question - As you ended the first half today you said that we
        had to put on the Meissner field, and is there a way to do that
        other than to drink the manna? Are you gonna teach us how or are
        we supposed to find this for ourselves?) </p>
      <p>Well, there are certainly other ways to achieve it. There are
        certain foods, there are certain herbal drinks, there are
        certain ways to develop what you have in your body through
        meditation and through introspection. There are Tibetan monks
        who have achieved this state, I believe. There are Sufi masters
        who achieve this state. But most of this requires thirty forty
        or fifty years of total commitment and dedication and regimen to
        go through. What I'm talking about is a very short method to
        achieve the same state. I told you before that there is a Taoist
        high priest who came to Phoenix and he said "Dave I know that
        these orgasms are supposed to be possible. I know that. I've
        never had one and I've been in caves, I have meditated, I have
        fasted, I have done all these things and have never had the
        orgasms but I know they are possible because they are in our
        sacred texts." And he said "this man is having six and seven a
        day and has had no philosophical training at all." He said,
        "however he is doing this I have to understand it; I have to
        come to know it. And so, he has the material. He's up in
        Portland and he has the material. And he's going to take it now
        and because I felt comfortable with his training and why he
        wanted to take it and all, I gave it to him. </p>
      <p>Um, you know, I have to keep a scientific hat on. You must
        understand that. This has to go to the world as science, even
        though we know better. When you understand what this is, then
        you have to think about how do I protect it and how does it go
        to the world. I believe in what I am doing is the right thing;
        that I should go to people this way; no expensive public
        advertising. Certain people come; certain people don't. The ones
        that come are the ones that are meant to hear about it. </p>
      <p>I can tell you within two years it will be available and it
        will be available to anyone who wants it. The cost will be . . .
        Whatever you have is sufficient. So no one can say they can't
        afford it. If you have no money you will get it for free. If
        you're prepared and ready for it's yours. </p>
      <p>My concern is it is not reversible. And so, I want people to
        really think about this. Women can understand this. You know,
        you don't become pregnant and then decide you don't want to be
        pregnant. And so, once this is in your body it's going. And I
        don't know how to end it; I don't know how to turn it off. So I
        don't want people saying "but Dave I don't understand this." I
        want to be comfortable that they understand what they are
        committing to when they do this. And if I'm totally comfortable
        with that then we fix them up with it. </p>
      <p>(Question - I want to thank you for your energy that you have
        shared with us. I wish you would address, just briefly, since we
        had in Texas a government sponsored superconducting
        super-collider. Were they on the right track, the wrong track or
        on an unnecessary track?) </p>
      <p>Um, believe it or not it has nothing to do with this at all.
        All they were after with the superconducting super-collider is
        you do understand that they put electricity into wires and
        around the wire produces a magnetic field. They make these big
        coils and they literally pulse this current around and around
        and around and these magnetic fields accelerate the charged
        particles. All that the superconductors do is they can flow more
        current through this conductor than they could through the wire
        and so they can make bigger fields and put more energy behind
        the charged particle. But the work that they were studying was
        the charged particle, not the superconducting field. And so
        really, I have superconductors, they have superconductors but
        their work had nothing to do with my work. </p>
      <p>(Question - There was a reference in one of the texts up there
        to the lotus flower. Do you know anything about the
        concentrations of rhodium and iridium in the lotus flower?) </p>
      <p>No I don't. </p>
      <p>(Because that was an important food source for some Indians.) </p>
      <p>Yea, there's all sorts of things that have come out of this
        over the centuries. But I really think that it goes back to a
        basic understanding. Uh, what color is the lotus flower? </p>
      <p>(White.) </p>
      <p>Yea, you see I think that's what it's all about. It's the white
        substance that the lotus flower was a symbolic depiction of the
        purity of the white substance. Uh, depending on what culture
        you're from is what symbol they use to describe it. But I do
        believe this knowledge has been gone for about three to four
        thousand years. I do know about St. Germain and I knew about all
        of this but I don't believe anyone has known how to make it. I
        think people have had it. I think the Templars got it when they
        were over in Ethiopia. I think they got some of it out of the
        Ark of the Covenant. I think that's how they became very
        wealthy. I think that some of them used it. There were people
        who could do this right about this time but after it was used up
        that was it, there was no more because no one knew how to make
        it. I think that's just a symbol you were talking about; a white
        pure material. </p>
      <p>Yes mam. </p>
      <p>(Question - I think you've answered the question to some degree
        in your remarks to the other lady. But um, I'm one of the people
        who's been studying for twenty some years alchemy and sacred
        science and throughout that literature are warnings about how
        dangerous this can be and even though the white powder didn't
        exist so I'm just interested about your thoughts about
        implications or your theories about implications and the
        selection criteria?) </p>
      <p>Well I think that the literature I've presented here in the
        presentation said it very clearly. It is the dividing sword; it
        is the revealing sword. And what it is, is total salvation for
        some and it's revealing of the bad people. And there are people
        in this world that do not want to give up the power and control
        they have over you right now. And, basically, what we are
        creating is a way to totally exit the system. (laughter and
        applause) And, you know, if ten or fifteen of you do it who
        cares. But if thousands start doing it they're gonna care. And
        all they can do is try to control it themselves. Which is the
        reason it was taken away before, because it was abused when it
        was here before. When you understand that you can project your
        thoughts into other people's minds. You can literally persuade
        someone to do what they don't want to do. And, you know, in the
        wrong hands that can be immensely powerful. To know what the
        lottery numbers are before the lottery, to be able to see things
        before they happen; to understand what's going to happen. You
        know, if you use this selfishly it is having all the
        capabilities of Christ, but using it selfishly, that's the
        anti-Christ. You know, I believe that the Christ is within all
        of us. But I believe that the anti-Christ is also within all of
        us. And I think it is acknowledging the anti-Christ, and
        overcoming the anti-Christ in ourselves is what this is all
        about. And I have to become comfortable with people; that they
        have addressed this; that they have acknowledged it, they are
        being realistic, they understand it and then they are prepared
        to do this. Because if they haven't addressed this in their
        lives; if they are just this very nave, very sweet person but
        they've never addressed this aspect the problem you worry about
        is when they get this power do they change. And this doesn't
        perfect the way you think. It perfects your body, it perfects
        your capabilities mentally but it doesn't change your mental
        state. Now if you really think it on through, it's hard to
        maintain the wrong mental state when everyone knows your
        thoughts, but there are some people who, in fact, won't care. I
        mean there are murderers and there are rapists and there are bad
        people who just will say I am bad, I know I'm bad, I don't care
        who knows it, I'm still gonna be bad. But at least we all know
        who they are, ok. It is, it is . . . There's no more gray;
        everything is either black or white. No more gray; all the gray
        disappears. And it's called the dividing sword. Yes sir? </p>
      <p>(Question - Ok, I'm confused about a couple of points. One of
        which we touched on last nights was on commitments between
        individuals. And I was saying can't you take her with you? And I
        was sort of wondering, um, what you're offering out here is the
        chance for society to transform, literally, in mass. And I guess
        I've sorta had thoughts about what are the implications as far
        as families with small children and that sort of thing; I mean,
        don't we all want to go?) </p>
      <p>Uh, there's a transition period that's difficult. Because there
        are little children that are here now that are not of an age to
        make the decision for themselves and so they need to be given
        time to grow up and make the decision for themselves. But you
        will see that as people go to this state then as children are
        born they are born into this state and their whole nature
        changes. They become like Christ from birth. And so, this I
        think is the eventual destiny. Getting to that point there is
        this transition period that, of course, is a problem. And I
        think that all of us need to understand, if you have people who
        depend on you and need you in this material world, you have to
        reconcile the commitments you've made to these people. And make
        them aware of what you want to do and make sure that they are
        comfortable with this; with you going on without them. If you
        have small children and they need you right now then you need to
        stay with them until they are older . . . </p>
      <p>(I don't) </p>
      <p>But that is a situation. And I think that's it. I don't think
        death is the finality. I think you get to come back again and
        again until you get it right. I think this is the way to quit
        coming back. I think this is the way to literally ascend on and
        take your body with you. You don't really, then, come back
        again. This is an option that you will have. Now there will be
        some people who so love their fellow man that they will choose
        stay here on earth even though they can ascend. And these people
        will be called the true latter day saints. And they will
        literally walk this earth like angels and they will cure by
        laying on of hands, they will resurrect the dead. You know,
        Christ said greater things than I have done you will do also.
        It's what's supposed to happen. This isn't something that isn't
        appropriate; this is supposed to be this way. </p>
      <p>(Um, another point that you just made . . . you kind of
        answered one of my questions . . . that it perfects your state
        of mind. I also got the impression that it would somehow perfect
        your soul and right the wrongs. Um, with that kind of knowledge;
        that kind of um, you know, wisdom that you wouldn't choose the
        wrong things.) </p>
      <p>I would think that most people would straighten their lives
        out. That it would just come about naturally with this
        progression. But not all people. And when you read the Bible,
        the Bible talks about the anti-Christ. And I so believe, I do
        believe that, like it or not, there are some people who are just
        truly evil, bad people. And you know, I don't understand it and
        I'm sure you don't understand it, but they are this way. And
        some of these people are going to change. And I think they are
        going to have to die and they are going to have to come back
        again till they get it right. Fortunately we've got a thousand
        years here to work on it. So they can keep on working on it till
        they get it right. The Bible doesn't talk about these being
        great times, these end times. There's a lot of confrontations, a
        lot of battles, a lot of fighting over this. Because it's
        something they want to control and posses; they don't want us to
        have. My greatest protection is to give it to you. Put the word
        out. Let everybody know about this stuff. Tell you everything.
        That's the greatest protection I can have. </p>
      <p>(Ok, one last thing I wanted to say is you teased us a couple
        of times saying that you would perhaps cover some ground after
        we had turned the lights and cameras and stuff off. I want to
        make sure that happens, ok?) </p>
      <p>If we have time. </p>
      <p>(Thank you very much.) </p>
      <p>Ok. Yes sir. </p>
      <p>(Question - You kept mentioning harmonics with elements. And I
        was wondering where I could get a harmonic table of elements?
        With the arrangement in a harmonic.) </p>
      <p>Uh, harmonics. I'm talking about a resonance energy, resonance
        transfer. There actually is a table of vibrational frequencies
        that you could see what resonates with what things. </p>
      <p>(Where would I be able to get that?) </p>
      <p>I can get you one. It actually came from the um, um . . . over
        in California, what do they call themselves? The um,
        Rosicrucian, the Rosicrucian Society. They have a table. </p>
      <p>(And it's got the elements arranged in such a way?) </p>
      <p>Yea and the resonance frequencies that they all vibrate at. </p>
      <p>(Thank you.) </p>
      <p>(Question - I wondering if you could provide the numbers on
        your patent?) </p>
      <p>Now it's not granted here in the U.S. </p>
      <p>(Question - Why not?) </p>
      <p>Any patent involving superconductivity has to be approved by
        the Department of Defense before it can be issued. And they . .
        . You gotta understand the legality of the way it works. When I
        applied I told them I was going to apply world wide and they
        said fine. I didn't call it a superconductor. I described the
        Meissner field, I described flux flow, I showed the levitation,
        I did all these things and I only mentioned superconductivity in
        the closing paragraphs of my patent. I said it has udders, it
        gives milk, it has baby calves but I never called it a cow.
        (Laughter) Apparently the reviewer, when we notified him about
        three weeks before the end of our year, and somebody picked up
        the patent and read it again and said oh bologna this is
        superconductivity. Well the law says it has to go to the
        Department of Defense for approval before I can file world wide
        because it is strategically important. So it was sent to the
        Department of Defense. They refused to let me file world wide. I
        complained because by law I was supposed to have a six month
        appeal period. I said I must protect my date. The cold fusion
        people have come out with their information. Somebody's going to
        figure this out eventually and so they allowed me to file world
        wide over the objection of the Department of Defense. All right,
        it gets heavier though. The Department of Defense signed the ex
        head of physics from Princeton University, um, what's his name,
        it's not coming to mind now. Anyway they hire him, he flies out
        of Virginia, what do you call it, the CIA headquarters, Langley,
        he flies out of Langley and he's been authorized to take money
        out of Swiss bank accounts and put it into technologies that
        benefit the military. Cause Congress didn't approve the star
        wars budget that was proposed and so what they do is just
        circumvent it and get them funded anyway by him investing in
        their companies. Anyway the Department of Defense wanted this
        technology and I wouldn't give them what they wanted so they
        refused to let me go to patent pending here in the U.S. They
        told me that if I would give them an affidavit from a credible
        laboratory totally independent of me that indeed the white
        powder of gold exists. And they chose gold for some reason. I
        went to Argonne National Laboratories, got a fellow by the name
        of Mike McNallen who is an MIT metallurgical chemist who
        previously worked at Argonne National Labs to actually buy gold,
        make it into the white powder and sign affidavits for me. And
        then they said "we've changed our mind. Now you have to take the
        white powder of gold back to gold or we are not going to let you
        go to patent pending." At that point I said "look, you told me I
        could go to patent pending. This is a materials patent; it is
        not a procedural patent. I've proved to you that white powder of
        gold exists. I've showed you how to make applesauce out of the
        apple, now you want me to take applesauce back to an apple." And
        I said "I do know how to do it but you don't need that for me to
        go to patent pending on this." And uh, it was at that time,
        basically in 1991, 92 and uh, uh, my attorney said they can
        never issue a patent to anyone else who would apply to you,
        because you have applied for it and been turned down. And after
        $540,000 in 1993 I dropped the patent pursuit. No one can ever
        be granted a patent on this that would ever apply to me. I was
        issued in about twelve countries worldwide and I dropped those
        patent pursuits. I don't believe that it's right for anyone to
        own this technology. I'm here giving it to you. You know that's
        what I have to do. You know I literally spent $540,000 cash on
        the patenting process and I turned it down and walked away from
        it, because once you get the patent then you've got to pursue
        the patent. You've got to have the money to sue people and go
        after them and all you're doing is just providing all the
        information for somebody to steal it from you. And so, when you
        understand how complex this is. I spent years and years and
        years, everyday in the laboratory myself. There's an awful lot
        of technique involved in this, an awful lot. When you realize
        that if you don't believe this will happen it won't happen. You
        have to know it's is going to happen for it to happen. When you
        understand that these materials are superconductors; they
        literally interreact with your thoughts. And if you believe it
        it happens every time. And if you question it you never see it.
        And there are some built in safeguards in this whole thing that
        are just not our normal thinking. And so, even though every
        piece of the puzzle is in my patent no one can do it unless I
        teach them how to do it. And so it's like the analogy I give you
        is a book playing the concert piano. I can give you a book on
        it, you can read the book but that doesn't mean you are going to
        play that piano. You still gotta to sit down and practice. It's
        the only way you're going to learn to play the piano. And the
        only way you're going to learn to do this chemistry is you gotta
        work at it. And it takes years. And so, I welcome Bell Labs into
        competition with me. They have a lot of work to do. Um, the
        reference numbers I have [for the patent] is 2180-CIP-fdl [this
        number differs from the numbers on the UK Patent Application].
        The revision was in four of 1989. That's the latest copy. Here's
        the patent if you are interested in seeing it. </p>
      <p>(I would like to yea.) </p>
      <p>Ok, any other specific questions? Ok if not, that concludes the
        taped portion of the presentation. If we can have all the tapes
        turned off. (applause) </p>
      <p>End of tape. </p>
