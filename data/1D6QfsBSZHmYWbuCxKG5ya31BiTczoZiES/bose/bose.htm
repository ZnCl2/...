        <p><b>THE MECHANICAL RESPONSE OF LIVING SUBSTANCES</b> </p>
        <p><i>Mechanical response -- Different kinds of stimuli --
            Myograph -- Characteristics of response-curve: period,
            amplitude, form -- Modification of response-curves.</i></p>
      </center>
      <p>One of the most striking effects of external disturbance on
        certain types of living substance is a visible change of form.
        Thus, a piece of muscle when pinched contracts. The external
        disturbance which produced this change is called the stimulus.
        The body which is thus capable of responding is said to be
        irritable or excitable. A stimulus thus produces a state of
        excitability which may sometimes be expressed by change of form.
      </p>
      <p><i>Mechanical response to different kinds of stimuli.</i>—This
        reaction under stimulus is seen even in the lowest organisms; in
        some of the amœboid rhizopods, for instance. These lumpy
        protoplasmic bodies, usually elongated while creeping, if
        mechanically jarred, contract into a spherical form. If, instead
        of mechanical&nbsp; disturbance, we apply salt solution, they
        again contract, in the same way as before. Similar effects are
        produced by sudden illumination, or by rise of temperature, or
        by electric shock. A living substance may thus be put into an
        excitatory state by either mechanical, chemical, thermal,
        electrical, or light stimulus. Not only does the point
        stimulated show the effect of stimulus, but that effect may
        sometimes be conducted even to a considerable distance. This
        power of conducting stimulus, though common to all living
        substances, is present in very different degrees. While in some
        forms of animal tissue irritation spreads, at a very slow rate,
        only to points in close neighbourhood, in other forms, as for
        example in nerves, conduction is very rapid and reaches far. </p>
      <p>The visible mode of response by change of form may perhaps be
        best studied in a piece of muscle. When this is pinched, or an
        electrical shock is sent through it, it becomes shorter and
        broader. A responsive twitch is thus produced. The excitatory
        state then disappears, and the muscle is seen to relax into its
        normal form. </p>
      <p><i>Mechanical lever recorder</i>.— In the case of contraction
        of muscle, the effect is very quick, the twitch takes place in
        too short a time for detailed observation by ordinary means. A
        myographic apparatus is therefore used, by means of which the
        changes in the muscle are self-recorded. Thus we obtain a
        history of its change and recovery from the change. The muscle
        is connected to one end of a writing lever. When the muscle
        contracts, the tracing point is pulled up in one&nbsp;
        direction, say to the right. The extent of this pull depends on
        the amount of contraction. A band of paper or a revolving
        drum-surface moves at a uniform speed at right angles to the
        direction of motion of the writing lever. When the muscle
        recovers from the stimulus, it relaxes into its original form,
        and the writing point traces the recovery as it moves now to the
        left, regaining its first position. A curve is thus described,
        the rising portion of which is due to contraction, and the
        falling portion to relaxation or recovery. The ordinate of the
        curve represents the intensity of response, and the abscissa the
        time (fig. 1). </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 1.—Mechanical Lever Recorder</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig001.jpg" width="250" height="281"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The muscle M with the attached bone is securely held at one
        end, the other end being connected with the writing lever. Under
        the action of stimulus the contracting muscle pulls the lever
        and moves the tracing point to the right over the travelling
        recording surface P. When the muscle recovers from contraction,
        the tracing point returns to its original position. See on P the
        record of muscle curve. </p>
      <p><i>Characteristics of the response-curve: (1) Period, (2)
          Amplitude, (3) Form.</i> — Just as a wave of sound is
        characterised by its (1) period, (2) amplitude, and (3) form, so
        may these response-curves be distinguished from each other. As
        regards the period, there is an enormous variation,
        corresponding to the functional activity of the muscle. For
        instance, in tortoise it may be as high as a second, whereas in
        the wing-muscles of many insects it is as small as 1/300 part of
        a second. ‘It is probable that a continuous graduated scale
        might, as suggested by Hermann, be drawn up in the animal
        kingdom, from the excessively rapid contraction of&nbsp; insects
        to those of tortoises and hibernating dormice.’[1] Differences
        in form and amplitude of curve are well illustrated by various
        muscles of the tortoise. The curve for the muscle of the neck,
        used for rapid withdrawal of the head on approach of danger, is
        quite different from that of the pectoral muscle of the same
        animal, used for its sluggish movements. </p>
      <p>Again, progressive changes in the same muscle are well seen in
        the modifications of form which consecutive muscle-curves
        gradually undergo. In a dying muscle, for example, the amplitude
        of succeeding curves is continuously diminished, and the curves
        themselves are elongated. Numerous illustrations will be seen
        later, of the effect, in changing the form of the curve, of the
        increased excitation or depression produced by various agencies.
      </p>
      <p>Thus these response records give us a means of studying the
        effect of stimulus, and the modification of response, under
        varying external conditions, advantage being taken of the
        mechanical contraction produced in the tissue by the stimulus.
        But there are other kinds of tissue where the excitation
        produced by stimulus is not exhibited in a visible form. In
        order to study these we have to use an altogether independent
        method, the method of electric response. </p>

      <p>Unlike muscle, a length of nerve, when mechanically or
        electrically excited, does not undergo any visible change. That
        it is thrown into an excitatory state, and that it conducts the
        excitatory disturbance, is shown however by the contraction
        produced in an attached piece of muscle, which serves as an
        indicator. </p>
      <p>But the excitatory effect produced in the nerve by stimulus can
        also be detected by an electrical method. If an isolated piece
        of nerve be taken and two contacts be made on its surface by
        means of non-polarisable electrodes at A and B, connection being
        made with a galvanometer, no current will be observed, as both A
        and B are in the same physico-chemical condition. The two
        points, that is to say, are iso-electric. </p>
      <p>If now the nerve be excited by stimulus, similar disturbances
        will be evoked at both A and B. If, further, these disturbances,
        reaching A and B almost simultaneously, cause any electrical
        change, then,&nbsp; similar changes taking place at both points,
        and there being thus no relative difference between the two, the
        galvanometer will still indicate no current. This null-effect is
        due to the balancing action of B as against A. (See fig. 2, a.)
      </p>
      <p><i>Conditions for obtaining electric response. </i>— If then
        we wish to detect the response by means of the galvanometer, one
        means of doing so will lie in the abolition of this balance,
        which may be accomplished by making one of the two points, say
        B, more or less permanently irresponsive. In that case, stimulus
        will cause greater electrical disturbance at the more responsive
        point, say A, and this will be shown by the galvanometer as a
        current of response. To make B less responsive we may injure it
        by means of a cross-sectional cut, a burn, or the action of
        strong chemical reagents. </p>

      <p>(a) Iso-electric contacts; no current in the galvanometer. <br>
        (b) The end B injured; current of injury from B to A:
        stimulation gives rise to an action current from A to B. <br>
        (c) Non-polarisable electrode. </p>
      <p><i>Current of injury.</i> — We shall revert to the subject of
        electric response; meanwhile it is necessary to say a few words
        regarding the electric disturbance caused by the injury itself.
        Since the physico-chemical conditions of the uninjured A and the
        injured B are now no longer the same, it follows&nbsp; that
        their electric conditions have also become different. They are
        no longer iso-electric. There is thus a more or less permanent
        or resting difference of electric potential between them. A
        current — the current of injury — is found to flow in the nerve,
        from the injured to the uninjured, and in the galvanometer,
        through the electrolytic contacts from the uninjured to the
        injured. As long as there is no further disturbance this current
        of injury remains approximately constant, and is therefore
        sometimes known as ‘the current of rest’ (fig. 2, b). </p>
      <p>A piece of living tissue, unequally injured at the two ends, is
        thus seen to act like a voltaic element, comparable to a copper
        and zinc couple. As some confusion has arisen, on the question
        of whether the injured end is like the zinc or copper in such a
        combination, it will perhaps be well to enter upon this subject
        in detail. </p>
      <p>If we take two rods, of zinc and copper respectively, in
        metallic contact, and further, if the points A and B are
        connected by a strip of cloth s moistened with salt solution, it
        will be seen that we have a complete voltaic element. A current
        will now flow from B to A in the metal (fig. 3, a) and from A to
        B through the electrolyte s. Or instead of connecting A and B by
        a single strip of cloth s, we may connect them by two strips s
        s?, leading to non-polarisable electrodes E E?. The current will
        then be found just the same as before, i.e. from B to A in the
        metallic part, and from A through s s? to B, the wire W being
        interposed, as it were, in the electrolytic part of the circuit.
        If now a galvanometer be interposed at O, the current will flow
        from B to A through the galvanometer, i.e. from right to left.
        But if we interpose the galvanometer in the electrolytic part of
        the circuit, that is to say, at W, the same current will appear
        to flow in the opposite direction. In fig. 3, c, the
        galvanometer is so interposed, and in this case it is to be
        noticed that when the current in the galvanometer flows from
        left to right, the metal connected to the left is zinc. </p>
      <p>Compare fig. 3, d, where A B is a piece of nerve of which the B
        end is injured. The current in the galvanometer&nbsp; through
        the non-polarisable electrode is from left to right. The
        uninjured end is therefore comparable to the zinc in a voltaic
        cell (is zincoid), the injured being copper-like or cuproid.[2]
      </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 3.—Diagram showing the Correspondence between injured
          (B) and uninjured (A) contacts in Nerve, and Cu and Zn in a
          Voltaic Element</b> </p>

        <p><img src="fig003.jpg" width="550" height="261"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Comparison of (c) and (d) will show that the injured end of B
        in (d) corresponds with the Cu in (c). </p>
      <p>If the electrical condition of, say, zinc in the voltaic couple
        (fig. 3, c) undergo any change (and I shall show later that this
        can be caused by molecular disturbance), then the existing
        difference of potential between A and B will also undergo
        variation. If for example the electrical condition of A approach
        that of B, the potential difference will undergo a diminution,
        and the current hitherto flowing in the circuit will, as a
        consequence, display a diminution, or negative variation. </p>
      <p><i>Action current</i>. — We have seen that a current of injury
        — sometimes known as ‘current of rest’ — flows in a nerve from
        the injured to the uninjured, and that the injured B is then
        less excitable than the uninjured A. If now the nerve be
        excited, there being a greater&nbsp; effect produced at A, the
        existing difference of potential may thus be reduced, with a
        consequent diminution of the current of injury. During
        stimulation, therefore, a nerve exhibits a negative variation.
        We may express this in a different way by saying that a ‘current
        of action’ was produced in response to stimulus, and acted in an
        opposite direction to the current of injury (fig. 2, b). The
        action current in the nerve is from the relatively more excited
        to the relatively less excited. </p>
      <p><i>Difficulties of present nomenclature. </i>— We shall deal
        later with a method by which a responsive current of action is
        obtained without any antecedent current of injury. ‘Negative
        variation’ has then no meaning. Or, again, a current of injury
        may sometimes undergo a change of direction (see note, p. 12).
        In view of these considerations it is necessary to have at our
        disposal other forms of expression by which the direction of the
        current of response can still be designated. Keeping in touch
        with the old phraseology, we might then call a current
        ‘negative’ that flowed from the more excited to the less
        excited. Or, bearing in mind the fact that an uninjured contact
        acts as the zinc in a voltaic couple, we might call it
        ‘zincoid,’ and the injured contact ‘cuproid.’ Stimulation of the
        uninjured end, approximating it to the condition of the injured,
        might then be said to induce a cuproid change. </p>
      <p>The electric change produced in a normal nerve by stimulation
        may therefore be expressed by saying that there has been a
        negative variation, or that there was a current of action from
        the more excited to the less excited, or that stimulation has
        produced a cuproid change. </p>
      <p>The excitation, or molecular disturbance, produced by a
        stimulus has thus a concomitant electrical expres sion. As the
        excitatory state disappears with the return of the excitable
        tissue to its original condition, the current of action will
        gradually disappear.[3] The movement of the galvanometer needle
        during excitation of the tissue thus indicates a molecular upset
        by the stimulus; and the gradual creeping back of the
        galvanometer deflection exhibits a molecular recovery. </p>
      <p>This transitory electrical variation constitutes the
        ‘response,’ and its intensity varies according to that of the
        stimulus. </p>
      <p><i>Electric recorder</i>. — We have thus a method of obtaining
        curves of response electrically. After all, it is not
        essentially very different from the mechanical method. In this
        case we use a magnetic lever (fig. 4, a), the needle of the
        galvanometer, which is deflected by the electromagnetic pull of
        the current, generated under the action of stimulus, just as the
        mechanical lever was deflected by the mechanical pull of the
        muscle contracting under stimulus. </p>
      <p>The accompanying diagram (fig. 4, b) shows how,&nbsp; under the
        action of stimulus, the current of rest undergoes a transitory
        diminution, and how on the cessation of stimulus there is
        gradual recovery of the tissue, as exhibited in the return of
        the galvanometer needle to its original position. </p>

        electrodes connecting A and B with galvanometer G. Stimulus
        produces ‘negative variation’ of current of rest. Index
        connected with galvanometer needle records curve on travelling
        paper (in practice, moving galvanometer spot of light traces
        curve on photographic plate). Rising part of curve shows effect
        of stimulus; descending part, recovery. </p>
      <p>(b) O is the zero position of the galvanometer; injury produces
        a deflection A B; stimulus diminishes this deflection to C; C D
        is the recovery. </p>
      <p><i>Two types of response — positive and negative</i>. — It may
        here be added that though stimulus in general produces a
        diminution of current of rest, or a negative variation (e.g.
        muscles and nerves), yet, in certain cases, there is an
        increase, or positive variation. This is seen in the response of
        the retina to light. Again, a tissue which normally gives a
        negative variation may undergo molecular changes, after which it
        gives a positive variation. Thus Dr. Waller finds that whereas
        fresh nerve always gives negative variation, stale nerve
        sometimes gives positive; and that retina, which when fresh
        gives positive, when stale, exhibits negative variation. </p>
      <p>The following is a tabular statement of the two types of
        response: </p>
      <p>I. Negative variation. — Action current from more excited to
        less excited — cuproid change in the excited — e.g. fresh muscle
        and nerve, stale retina. </p>
      <p>II. Positive variation. — Action current from less excited to
        more excited — zincoid change in the excited — e.g. stale nerve,
        fresh retina.[4] </p>
      <p>From this it will be seen that it is the fact of the electrical
        response of living substances to stimulus that is of essential
        importance, the sign plus or minus being a minor consideration.
      </p>
      <p><i>Universal applicability of the electrical mode of response.</i>
        — This mode of obtaining electrical response is applicable to
        all living tissues, and in cases like that of muscle, where
        mechanical response is also available, it is found that the
        electrical and mechanical records are practically identical. </p>
      <p>The two response-curves seen in the accompanying diagram (fig.
        5), and taken from the same muscle by the two methods
        simultaneously, clearly exhibit this. Thus we see that
        electrical response can not only take the place of the
        mechanical record, but has the further&nbsp; advantage of being
        applicable in cases where the latter cannot be used. </p>
      <p><i>Electrical response: A measure of physiological activity.</i>
        — These electrical changes are regarded as physiological, or
        characteristic of living tissue, for any conditions which
        enhance physiological activity also, pari passu, increase their
        intensity. Again, when the tissue is killed by poison,
        electrical response disappears, the tissue passing into an
        irresponsive condition. Anæsthetics, like chloroform, gradually
        diminish, and finally altogether abolish, electrical response. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 5.—Simultaneous Record of the Mechanical (M) and (E)
          Electrical Responses of the Muscle of Frog. (Waller.)</b> </p>

        <p><img src="fig005.jpg" width="250" height="325"></p>
      </center>
      <p>From these observed facts — that living tissue gives response
        while a tissue that has been killed does not—it is concluded
        that the phenomenon of response is peculiar to living
        organisms.[5] The response phenomena that we have been studying
        are therefore considered as due to some unknown, super-physical
        ‘vital’ force and are thus relegated to a region beyond physical
        inquiry. </p>
      <p>It may, however, be that this limitation is not justified, and
        surely, at least until we have explored the whole range of
        physical action, it cannot be asserted definitely that a
        particular class of phenomena is by its very nature outside that
        category. </p>
      <p><i>Electric response in plants.</i> — But before we proceed to
        the inquiry as to whether these responses are or are not due to
        some physical property of matter, and are to be met with even in
        inorganic substances, it will perhaps be advisable to see
        whether they are not paralleled by phenomena in the transitional
        world of plants. We shall thus pass from a study of response in
        highly complex animal tissues to those given under simpler vital
        conditions. </p>
      <p>Electric response has been found by Munck, Burdon-Sanderson,
        and others to occur in sensitive plants. But it would be
        interesting to know whether these responses were confined to
        plants which exhibit such remarkable mechanical movements, and
        whether they could not also be obtained from ordinary plants
        where visible movements are completely absent. In this
        connection, Kunkel observed electrical changes in association
        with the injury or flexion of stems of ordinary plants.[6] My
        own attempt, however, was directed, not towards the obtaining of
        a mere qualitative response, but rather to the determination of
        whether throughout the whole range of response phenomena a
        parallelism between animal and vegetable could be detected. That
        is to&nbsp; say, I desired to know, with regard to plants, what
        was the relation between intensity of stimulus and the
        corresponding response; what were the effects of superposition
        of stimuli; whether fatigue was present, and in what manner it
        influenced response; what were the effects of extremes of
        temperature on the response; and, lastly, if chemical reagents
        could exercise any influence in the modification of plant
        response, as stimulating, anæsthetic, and poisonous drugs have
        been found to do with nerve and muscle. </p>
      <p>If it could be proved that the electric response served as a
        faithful index of the physiological activity of plants, it would
        then be possible successfully to attack many problems in plant
        physiology, the solution of which at present offers many
        experimental difficulties. </p>
      <p>With animal tissues, experiments have to be carried on under
        many great and unavoidable difficulties. The isolated tissue,
        for example, is subject to unknown changes inseparable from the
        rapid approach of death. Plants, however, offer a great
        advantage in this respect, for they maintain their vitality
        unimpaired during a very great length of time. </p>
      <p>In animal tissues, again, the vital conditions themselves are
        highly complex. Those essential factors which modify response
        can, therefore, be better determined under the simpler
        conditions which obtain in vegetable life. </p>
      <p>In the succeeding chapters it will be shown that the response
        phenomena are exhibited not only by plants but by inorganic
        substances as well, and that the&nbsp; responses are modified by
        various conditions in exactly the same manner as those of animal
        tissues. In order to show how striking are these similarities, I
        shall for comparison place side by side the responses of animal
        tissues and those I have obtained with plants and inorganic
        substances. For the electric response in animal tissues, I shall
        take the latest and most complete examples from the records made
        by Dr. Waller. </p>
      <p>But before we can obtain satisfactory and conclusive results
        regarding plant response, many experimental difficulties will
        have to be surmounted. I shall now describe how this has been
        accomplished.[7] </p>

        been made, based on the supposition that the injured end is

      <p>‘The excitatory state evoked by stimulus manifests itself in
        nerve fibres by E.M. changes, and as far as our present
        knowledge goes by these only. The conception of such an
        excitable living tissue as nerve implies that of a molecular
        state which is in stable equilibrium. This equilibrium can be
        readily upset by an external agency, the stimulus, but the term
        “stable” expresses the fact that a change in any direction must
        be succeeded by one of opposite character, this being the return
        of the living structure to its previous state. Thus the
        electrical manifestation of the excitatory state is one whose
        duration depends upon the time during which the external agent
        is able to upset and retain in a new poise the living
        equilibrium, and if this is extremely brief, then the recoil of
        the tissue causes such manifestation to be itself of very short
        duration.’ — <i>Text-book of Physiology</i>, ed. by Schäfer,

      <p>[4] I shall here mention briefly one complication that might
        arise from regarding the current of injury as the current of
        reference, and designating the response current either positive
        or negative in relation to it. If this current of injury
        remained always invariable in direction—that is to say, from the
        injured to the uninjured—there would be no source of
        uncertainty. But it is often found, for example in the retina,
        that the current of injury undergoes a reversal, or is reversed
        from the beginning. That is to say, the direction is now from
        the uninjured to the injured, instead of the opposite. Confusion
        is thus very apt to arise. No such misunderstanding can however
        occur if we call the current of response towards the more
        excited positive, and towards the less excited negative. </p>

        sign of life by contracting when stimulated ... An ordinary
        nerve, normally connected with its terminal organs, gives sign
        of life by means of muscle, which by direct or reflex path is
        set in motion when the nerve trunk is stimulated. But such nerve
        separated from its natural termini, isolated from the rest of
        the organism, gives no sign of life when excited, either in the
        shape of chemical or of thermic changes, and it is only by means
        of an electrical change that we can ascertain whether or no it
        is alive ... The most general and most delicate sign of life is

          stimulus dependent on amplitude of vibration — Effectiveness
          of stimulus dependent on rapidity also.</i> </p>
      <p>I shall first proceed to show that an electric response is
        evoked in plants under stimulation.[8] </p>
      <p>In experiments for the exhibition of electric response it is
        preferable to use a non-electrical form of stimulus, for there
        is then a certainty that the observed response is entirely due
        to reaction from stimulus, and not, as might be the case with
        electric stimulus, to mere escape of stimulating current through
        the tissue. For this reason, the mechanical form of stimulation
        is the most suitable. </p>
      <p>I find that all parts of the living plant give electric
        response to a greater or less extent. Some, however, give
        stronger response than others. In favourable cases, we may have
        an E.M. variation as high as ·1 volt.&nbsp; It must however be
        remembered that the response, being a function of physiological
        activity of the plant, is liable to undergo changes at different
        seasons of the year. Each plant has its particular season of
        maximum responsiveness. The leaf-stalk of horse-chestnut, for
        example, exhibits fairly strong response in spring and summer,
        but on the approach of autumn it undergoes diminution. I give
        here a list of specimens which will be found to exhibit fairly
        good response: </p>
      <p>Root. — Carrot (Daucus Carota), radish (Raphanus sativus). </p>
      <p>Stem. — Geranium (Pelargonium), vine (Vitis vinifera). </p>
      <p>Leaf-stalk. — Horse-chestnut (Æsculus Hippocastanum), turnip
        (Brassica Napus), cauliflower (Brassica oleracea), celery (Apium
        graveolens), Eucharis lily (Eucharis amazonica). </p>
      <p>Flower-stalk. — Arum lily (Richardia africana). </p>
      <p>Fruit. — Egg-plant (Solanum Melongena). </p>
      <p><i>Negative variation.</i> — Taking the leaf-stalk of turnip we
        kill an area on its surface, say B, by the application of a few
        drops of strong potash, the area at A being left uninjured. A
        current is now observed to flow, in the stalk, from the injured
        B to the uninjured A, as was found to be the case in the animal
        tissue. The potential difference depends on the condition of the
        plant, and the season in which it may have been gathered. In the
        experiment here described (fig. 6, a) its value was ·13 volt. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 6. — (a) Experiment for Exhibiting Electric Response in
          Plants by Method of Negative Variation. (b) Responses in
          Leaf-stalk of Turnip to Stimuli of Two Successive Taps, the
          Second being Stronger.</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig006.jpg" width="500" height="298"></p>
      </center>
      <p>A and B contacts are about 2 cm. apart, B being injured. Plant
        is stimulated by a tap between A and B. Stimulus acts on both A
        and B, but owing to injury of B, effect at A is stronger and a
        negative variation due to differential action occurs. </p>
      <p>A sharp tap was now given to the stalk, and a sudden
        diminution, or negative variation, of current occurred, the
        resting potential difference being&nbsp; decreased by ·026 volt.
        A second and stronger tap produced a second response, causing a
        greater diminution of P.D. by ·047 volt (fig. 6, b). The
        accompanying figure is a photographic record of another set of
        response-curves (fig. 7). The first three responses are for a
        given intensity of stimulus, and the next six in response to
        stimulus nearly twice as strong. It will be noticed that fatigue
        is exhibited in these responses. Other experiments will be
        described in the next chapter which show conclusively that the
        response was not due to any accidental circumstance but was a
        direct result of stimulation. But I shall first discuss the
        experimental arrangements and method of obtaining these graphic
        records. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 7. — Record of Responses in Plant (Leaf-stalk of
          Cauliflower) by Method of Negative Variation</b> </p>

        <p><img src="fig007.jpg" width="350" height="246"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The first three records are for stimulus intensity 1; the next
        six are for intensity twice as strong; the successive responses
        exhibit fatigue. The vertical line to the left represents ·1
        volt. The record is to be read from right to left. </p>
      <p><i>Response recorder.</i> — The galvanometer used is a
        sensitive dead-beat D’Arsonval. The period of complete swing of
        the coil under experimental&nbsp; conditions is about 11
        seconds. A current of 10-9 ampere produces a deflection of 1 mm.
        at a distance of 1 metre. For a quick and accurate method of
        obtaining the records, I devised the following form of response
        recorder. The curves are obtained directly, by tracing the
        excursion of the galvanometer spot of light on a revolving drum
        (fig. 8). The drum, on which is wrapped the paper for receiving
        the record, is driven by clockwork. Different speeds of
        revolution can be given to it by adjustment of the
        clock-governor, or by changing the size of the driving-wheel.
        The galvanometer spot is thrown down on the drum by the inclined
        mirror M. The galvanometer deflection takes place at right
        angles to the motion of the paper. A stylographic pen attached
        to a carrier rests on the writing surface. The carrier slides
        over a rod parallel to the drum. As has been said before, the
        galvanometer deflection takes place parallel to the drum,
        and&nbsp; as long as the plant rests unstimulated, the pen,
        remaining coincident with the stationary galvanometer spot on
        the revolving paper, describes a straight line. If, on
        stimulation, we trace the resulting excursion of the spot of
        light, by moving the carrier which holds the pen, the rising
        portion of the response-curve will be obtained. The galvanometer
        spot will then return more or less gradually to its original
        position, and that part of the curve which is traced during the
        process constitutes the recovery. The ordinate in these curves
        represents the E.M. variation, and the abscissa the time. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 8.—Response Recorder</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig008.jpg" width="350" height="250"></p>
      </center>
      <p>We can calibrate the value of the deflection by applying a
        known E.M.F. to the circuit from a compensator, and noting the
        deflection which results. The speed of the clock is previously
        adjusted so that the recording surface moves exactly through,
        say, one inch a minute. Of course this speed can be increased to
        suit the particular experiment, and in some it is as high as six
        inches a minute. In this simple manner very accurate records may
        be made. It has the additional advantage that one is able at
        once to see whether the specimen is suitable for the purpose of
        investigation. A large number of records might be taken by this
        means in a comparatively short time. </p>
      <p><i>Photographic recorder.</i> — Or the records may be made
        photographically. A clockwork arrangement moves a photographic
        plate at a known uniform rate, and a curve is traced on the
        plate by the moving spot of light. All the records that will be
        given are accurate reproductions of those obtained by one of
        these two methods. Photographic records are reproduced in white
        against a black background. </p>
      <p><i>Compensator.</i> — As the responses are on variation of
        current of injury, and as the current of injury may be strong,
        and throw the spot of light beyond the recording surface, a
        potentiometer balancing arrangement may be used (fig. 9), by
        which the P.D. due to injury is exactly compensated; E.M.
        variations produced by stimulus are then taken in the usual
        manner. This compensating arrangement is also helpful, as has
        been said before, for calibrating the E.M. value of the
        deflection. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 9.—The Compensator</b> </p>

      <p>A B is a stretched wire with added resistances R and R?. S is a
        storage cell. When the key K is turned to the right one scale
        division = ·001 volt, when turned to the left one scale division
        = ·01 volt. P is the plant. </p>
      <p><i>Means of graduating the intensity of stimulus.</i> — One of
        the necessities in connection with quantitative measurements is
        to be certain that the intensity of successive stimuli is (1)
        constant, or (2) capable of gradual increase by known amounts.
        No two taps given by the hand can be made exactly alike. I have
        therefore devised the two following methods of stimulation,
        which have been found to act satisfactorily. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 10.—The Spring-tapper</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig010.jpg" width="250" height="200"></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>The spring-tapper. </i>— This consists (fig. 10) of the
        spring proper (S), the attached rod (R) carrying at its end the
        tapping-head (T). A projecting rod — the lifter (L) — passes
        through S R. It is provided with a screw-thread, by means of
        which its length, projecting downwards, is regulated. This fact,
        as we shall see, is made to determine the height of the stroke.
        (C) is a cogwheel. As one of the spokes of the cogwheel is
        rotated past (L), the spring is lifted and released, and (T)
        delivers a sharp tap. The height of the lift, and therefore the
        intensity of the stroke, is measured by means of a graduated
        scale. We can increase the intensity of the stroke through a
        wide range (1) by increasing the projecting length of the
        lifter, and (2) by shortening the length of spring by a sliding
        catch. We may give isolated single taps or superpose a series in
        rapid succession according as the wheel is rotated slow or fast.
        The only disadvantage of the tapping method of stimulation is
        that in long-continued experiment the point struck is liable to
        be injured. The vibrational mode of stimulation to be presently
        described labours under no such disadvantage. </p>
      <p><i>The electric tapper.</i> — Instead of the simple mechanical
        tapper, an electromagnetic tapper may be used. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 11.—The Torsional Vibrator</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig011.jpg" width="600" height="223"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Plant P is securely held by a vice V. The two ends are clamped
        by holders C C?. By means of handles H H?, torsional vibration
        may be imparted to either the end A or end B of the plant. The
        end view (b) shows how the amplitude of vibration is
        predetermined by means of movable stops S S?. </p>
      <p><i>Vibrational stimulus. </i>— I find that torsional vibration
        affords another very effective method of stimulation (fig. 11).
        The plant-stalk may be fixed in a vice (V), the free ends being
        held in tubes (C C?), provided with three clamping jaws. A rapid
        torsional vibration[9] may now be imparted to the stalk by means
        of the handle (H). The amplitude of vibration, which determines
        the intensity of stimulus, can be accurately measured by the
        graduated circle. The amplitude of vibration may be
        predetermined by means of the sliding stops (S S?). </p>
      <p><i>Intensity of stimulus dependent on amplitude of vibration.</i>
        — I shall now describe an experiment which shows that torsional
        vibration is as effective as stimulation by taps, and that its
        stimulating intensity increases, length of stalk being constant,
        with amplitude of&nbsp; vibration. It is of course obvious that
        if the length of the specimen be doubled, the vibration, in
        order to produce the same effect, must be through twice the
        angle. I took a leaf-stalk of turnip and fixed it in the
        torsional vibrator. I then took record of responses to two
        successive taps, the intensity of one being nearly double that
        of the other. Having done this, I applied to the same stalk two
        successive torsional vibrations of 45° and 67° respectively.
        These successive responses to taps and torsional vibrations are
        given in fig. 12, and from them it will be seen that these two
        modes of stimulation may be used indifferently, with equal
        effect. The vibrational method has the advantage over tapping,
        that, while with the latter the stimulus is somewhat localised,
        with vibration the tissue subjected to stimulus is uniformly
        stimulated throughout its length. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 12.—Response in Plant to Mechanical Tap or Vibration</b>
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig012.jpg" width="500" height="293"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The end B is injured. A tap was given between A and B and this
        gave the response-curve a. A stronger tap gave the response b.
        By means of the handle H, a torsional vibration of 45° was now
        imparted, this gave the response c. Vibration through 67° gave
        d. </p>
      <p>Effectiveness of stimulus dependent on rapidity also. In order
        that successive stimuli may be equally effective&nbsp; another
        point has to be borne in mind. In all cases of stimulation of
        living tissue it is found that the effectiveness of a stimulus
        to arouse response depends on the rapidity of the onset of the
        disturbance. It is thus found that the stimulus of the ‘break’
        induction shock, on a muscle for example, is more effective, by
        reason of its greater rapidity, than the ‘make’ shock. So also
        with the torsional vibrations of plants, I find response
        depending on the quickness with which the vibration is effected.
        I give below records of successive stimuli, given by vibrations
        through the same amplitude, but delivered with increasing
        rapidity (fig. 13). </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 13.—Influence of Suddenness on the Efficiency of
          Stimulus</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig013.jpg" width="200" height="212"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The curves a, b, c, d, are responses to vibrations of the same
        amplitude, 30°. In a the vibration was very slow; in b it was
        less slow; it was rapid in c, and very rapid in d. </p>
      <p>Thus if we wish to maintain the effective intensity of stimulus
        constant we must meet two conditions: (1) The amplitude of
        vibration must be kept the same. This is done by means of the
        graduated circle. (2) The vibration period must be kept the
        same. With a little practice, this requirement is easily
        fulfilled. </p>
      <p>The uniformity of stimulation which is thus attained solves the
        great difficulty of obtaining reliable quantitative values, by
        whose means alone can rigorous demonstration of the phenomena we
        are studying become possible. </p>

        which I devised for obtaining plant response. It has the
        advantage of offering us a complementary means of verifying the
        results found by the method of negative variation. As it is
        also, in itself, for reasons which will be shown later, a more
        perfect mode of inquiry, it enables us to investigate problems
        which would otherwise have been difficult to attempt. </p>
      <p>When electrolytic contacts are made on the uninjured surfaces
        of the stalk at A and B, the two points, being practically
        similar in every way, are iso-electric, and little or no current
        will flow in the galvanometer. If now the whole stalk be
        uniformly stimulated, and if both ends A and B be equally
        excited at the same moment, it is clear that there will still be
        no responsive current, owing to balancing action at the two
        ends. This difficulty as regards the obtaining of response was
        overcome in the method of negative variation, where the
        excitability of one end was depressed by chemical reagents or
        injury, or abolished by excessive tempera ture. On stimulating
        the stalk there was produced a greater excitation at A than at
        B, and a current of action was then observed to flow in the
        stalk from the more excited A to the less excited B (fig. 6). </p>
      <p>But we can cause this differential action to become evident by
        another means. For example, if we produce a block, by clamping
        at C between A and B (fig. 14, a), so that the disturbance made
        at A by tapping or vibration is prevented from reaching B, we
        shall then have A thrown into a relatively greater excitatory
        condition than B. It will now be found that a current of action
        flows in the stalk from A to B, that is to say, from the excited
        to the less excited. When the B end is stimulated, there will be
        a reverse current (fig. 14, b). </p>

      <p>(b) Responses obtained by alternately stimulating the two ends.
        Stimulation of A produces upward response; of B gives downward
        response. </p>
      <p>We have in this method a great advantage over that of negative
        variation, for we can always verify any set of results by making
        corroborative reversal experiments. </p>
      <p>By the method of injury again, one end is made initially
        abnormal, i.e. different from the condition which it maintains
        when intact. Further, inevitable changes will proceed unequally
        at the injured and uninjured ends, and the conditions of the
        experiment may thus undergo unknown variations. But by the&nbsp;
        block method which has just been described, there is no injury,
        the plant is normal throughout, and any physiological change
        (which in plants will be exceedingly small during the time of
        the experiment) will affect it as a whole. </p>

      <p>The leaf-stalk is clamped securely in the middle with the cork
        C, inside the tube T, which is filled with water, the plant
        being completely immersed. Moistened threads in connection with
        the two non-polarisable electrodes are led to the side tubes t
        t?. One end of the stalk is held in ebonite forceps and
        vibrated. A current of response is found to flow in the stalk
        from the excited A to the unexcited B, and outside, through the
        liquid, from B to A. A portion of this current, flowing through
        the side tubes t t?, produces deflection in the galvanometer. </p>
      <p><i>Plant response a physiological or vital response. </i>— I
        now proceed to a demonstration of the fact that whatever be the
        mechanism by which they are brought about, these plant responses
        are physiological in their character. As the investigations
        described in the next few chapters will show, they furnish an
        accurate index of physiological activity. For it will be found
        that, other things being equal, whatever tends to exalt or
        depress the vitality of the plant tends also to increase or
        diminish its electric response. These E.M. effects are well
        marked, and attain considerable value, rising sometimes, as has
        been said before, to as much as ·1 volt or more. They are
        proportional to the intensity of stimulus. </p>
      <p>It need hardly be added that special precautions are taken to
        avoid shifting of contacts. Variation of contact, however, could
        not in any case account for repeated transient responses to
        repeated stimuli, when contact is made on iso-electric surfaces.
        Nor could it&nbsp; in any way explain the reversible nature of
        these responses, when A and B are stimulated alternately. These
        responses are obtained in the plants even when completely
        immersed in water, as in the experimental arrangement (fig. 15).
        It will be seen that in this case, where there could be no
        possibility of shifting of contact, or variation of surface,
        there is still the usual current of response. </p>
      <p>I shall describe here a few crucial experiments only, in proof
        of the physiological character of electric response. The test
        applied by physiologists, in order to discriminate as to the
        physiological nature of response, consists in finding out
        whether the response is diminished or abolished by the action of
        anæsthetics, poisons, and excessively high temperature, which
        are known to depress or destroy vitality. </p>
      <p>I shall therefore apply these same tests to plant responses. </p>
      <p><i>Effect of anæsthetics and poisons.</i> — Ordinary
        anæsthetics, like chloroform, and poisons, like mercuric
        chloride, are known to produce a profound depression or abolish
        all signs of response in the living tissue. For the purpose of
        experiment, I took two groups of stalks, with leaves attached,
        exactly similar to each other in every respect. In order that
        the leaf-stalks might absorb chloroform I dipped their cut ends
        in chloroform-water, a certain amount of which they absorbed,
        the process being helped by the transpiration from the leaves.
        The second group of stalks was placed simply in water, in order
        to serve for control experiment. The narcotic action of
        chloroform, finally&nbsp; culminating in death, soon became
        visually evident. The leaves began to droop, a peculiar
        death-discolouration began to spread from the mid rib along the
        venation of the leaves. Another peculiarity was also observed.
        The aphides feeding on the leaves died even before the
        appearance of the discoloured patches, whereas on the leaves of
        the stalks placed in water these little creatures maintained
        their accustomed activity, nor did any discolouration occur. In
        order to study the effect of poison, another set was placed in
        water containing a small quantity of mercuric chloride. The
        leaves here underwent the same change of appearance, and the
        aphides met with the same untimely fate, as in the case of those
        subjected to the action of chloroform. There was hardly any
        visible change in the appearance of the stalks themselves, which
        were to all outer seeming as living as ever, indications of
        death being apparent only on the leaf surfaces. I give below the
        results of several sets of experiments, from which it would
        appear that whereas there was strong normal response in the
        group of stalks kept in water, there was practically a total
        abolition of all response in those anæsthetised or poisoned. </p>
      <p>Experiments on the effect of anæsthetics and poisons. A batch
        of ten leaf-stalks of plane-tree was placed with the cut ends in
        water, and leaves in air; an equal number was immersed in
        chloroform-water; a third batch was placed in 5 per cent.
        solution of mercuric chloride. </p>
      <p>Similarly a batch of three horse-chestnut leaf-stalks was put
        in water, another batch in chloroform-water, and a third batch
        in mercuric chloride solution. </p>

      <p>These results conclusively prove the physiological nature of
        the response. </p>
      <p>I shall in a succeeding chapter give a continuous series of
        response-curves showing how, owing to progressive death from the
        action of poison, the responses undergo steady diminution till
        they are completely abolished. </p>
      <p><i>Effect of high temperature. </i>— It is well known that
        plants are killed when subjected to high temperatures. I took a
        stalk, and, using the block method, with torsional&nbsp;
        vibration as the stimulus, obtained strong responses at both
        ends A and B. I then immersed the same stalk for a short time in
        hot water at about 65° C., and again stimulated it as before.
        But at neither A nor B could any response now be evoked. As all
        the external conditions were the same in the first and second
        parts of this experiment, the only difference being that in one
        the stalk was alive and in the other killed, we have here
        further and conclusive proof of the physiological character of
        electric response in plants. </p>
      <p>The same facts may be demonstrated in a still more striking
        manner by first obtaining two similar but opposite responses in
        a fresh stalk, at A and B, and then killing one half, say B, by
        immersing only that half of the stalk in hot water. The stalk is
        replaced in the apparatus, and it is now found that whereas the
        A half gives strong response, the end B gives none. </p>
      <p>In the experiments on negative variation, it was tacitly
        assumed that the variation is due to a differential action,
        stimulus producing a greater excitation at the uninjured than at
        the injured end. The block method enables us to test the
        correctness of this assumption. The B end of the stalk is
        injured or killed by a few drops of strong potash, the other end
        being uninjured. There is a clamp between A and B. The end A is
        stimulated and a strong response is obtained. The end B is now
        stimulated, and there is little or no response. The block is now
        removed and the plant stimulated throughout its length. Though
        the stimulus now acts on both ends, yet, owing to the
        irresponsive condition of B, there is a resultant response,
        which from its direction is found&nbsp; to be due to the
        responsive action of A. This would not have been the case if the
        end B had been uninjured. We have thus experimentally verified
        the assumption that in the same tissue an uninjured portion will
        be thrown into a greater excitatory state than an injured, by
        the action of the same stimulus. </p>

        <p><b>PLANT RESPONSE—ON THE EFFECTS OF SINGLE STIMULUS AND OF
            SUPERPOSED STIMULI</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Effect of single stimulus — Superposition of stimuli —
          Additive effect — Staircase effect — Fatigue — No fatigue when
          sufficient interval between stimuli — Apparent fatigue when
          stimulation frequency is increased — Fatigue under continuous
          stimulation. --- Effect of single stimulus.</i> </p>
      <p>In a muscle a single stimulus gives rise to a single twitch
        which may be recorded either mechanically or electrically. If
        there is no fatigue, the successive responses to uniform stimuli
        are exactly similar. Muscle when strongly stimulated often
        exhibits fatigue, and successive responses therefore become
        feebler and feebler. In nerves, however, there is practically no
        fatigue and successive records are alike. Similarly, in plants,
        we shall find some exhibiting marked fatigue and others very
        little. </p>

      <p>(a) in muscle; (b) in carrot. </p>
      <p><i>Superposition of stimuli.</i> — If instead of a single
        stimulus a succession of stimuli be superposed, it happens that
        a second shock is received before recovery from the first has
        taken place. Individual effects will then become more or less
        fused. When the frequency is sufficiently increased, the
        intermittent effects are fused, and we find an almost unbroken
        curve. When for example the muscle attains its maximum
        contraction (corresponding to the frequency and strength of
        stimuli) it&nbsp; is thrown into a state of complete tetanus, in
        which it appears to be held rigid. If the rapidity be not
        sufficient for this, we have the jagged curve of incomplete
        tetanus. If there is not much fatigue, the upper part of the
        tetanic curve is approximately horizontal, but in cases where
        fatigue sets in quickly, the fact is shown by the rapid decline
        of the curve. With regard to all these points we find strict
        parallels in plant response. In cases where there is no fatigue,
        the successive responses are identical (fig. 16). With
        superposition of stimuli we have fusion of effects, analogous to
        the tetanus of muscle (fig. 17). And lastly, the influence of
        fatigue in plants is to produce a modification of response-curve
        exactly similar to that of muscle (see below). One effect of
        superposition of stimuli may be mentioned here. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 18.—Additive Effect</b> <br>

      <p>(a) A single stimulus of 3° vibration produced little or no
        effect, but the same stimulus when rapidly superposed thirty
        times, produced the large effect (b). (Leaf-stalk of turnip.) <br>
        &nbsp;Additive effect.—It is found in animal responses that
        there is a minimum intensity of stimulus, below which no
        response can be evoked. But even a sub-minimal stimulus will,
        though singly ineffective, become effective by the summation of
        several. In plants, too, we obtain a similar effect, i.e. the
        summation of single ineffective stimuli produces effective
        response (fig. 18). </p>
      <p><i>Staircase effect.</i> — Animal tissues sometimes exhibit
        what is known as the ‘staircase effect,’ that is to say, the
        heights of successive responses are gradually increased, though
        the stimuli are maintained constant. This is exhibited typically
        by cardiac muscle, though it is not unknown even in nerve. The
        cause is obscure, but it seems to depend on the condition of the
        tissue. It appears as if the molecular sluggishness of tissue
        were in these cases only gradually removed under stimulation,
        and the increased effects were due to increased molecular
        mobility. Whatever be the explanation, I have sometimes observed
        the same staircase effect in plants (fig. 19). </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 19.—‘Staircase Effect’ in Plant</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig019.jpg" width="163" height="457"></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Fatigue.</i> — It is assumed that in living substances like
        muscle, fatigue is caused by the break down or&nbsp;
        dissimilation of tissue by stimulus. And till this waste is
        repaired by the process of building-up or assimilation, the
        functional activity of the tissue will remain below par. There
        may also be an accumulation of the products of dissimilation —
        ‘the fatigue stuffs’ — and these latter may act as poisons or
        chemical depressants. </p>
      <p>In an animal it is supposed that the nutritive blood supply
        performs the two-fold task of bringing material for assimilation
        and removing the fatigue products, thus causing the
        disappearance of fatigue. This explanation, however, is shown to
        be insufficient by the fact that an excised bloodless muscle
        recovers from fatigue after a short period of rest. It is
        obvious that here the fatigue has been removed by means other
        than that of renewed assimilation and removal of fatigue
        products by the circulating blood. It may therefore be
        instructive to study certain phases of fatigue exhibited under
        simpler conditions in vegetable tissue, where the constructive
        processes are in abeyance, and there is no active circulation
        for the removal of fatigue products. </p>
      <p>It has been said before that the E.M. variation caused by
        stimulus is the concomitant of a disturbance of the molecules of
        the responsive tissues from their normal equilibrium, and that
        the curve of recovery exhibits the restoration of the tissue to
        equilibrium. </p>
      <p><i>No fatigue when sufficient interval between successive
          stimuli.</i> — We may thus gather from a study of the
        response-curve some indication of the molecular distortion
        experienced by the excited tissue. Let us first take the case of
        an experiment whose record is given&nbsp; in fig. 20, a. It will
        be seen from that curve that one minute after the application of
        stimulus there is a complete recovery of the tissue; the
        molecular condition is exactly the same at the end of recovery
        as in the beginning of stimulation. The second and succeeding
        response-curves therefore are exactly similar to the first,
        provided a sufficient interval has been allowed in each case for
        complete recovery. There is, in such a case, no diminution in
        intensity of response, that is to say, no fatigue. </p>
      <p>We have an exactly parallel case in muscles. ‘In muscle with
        normal circulation and nutrition there is always an interval
        between each pair of stimuli, in which the height of twitch does
        not diminish even after protracted excitation, and no fatigue
        appears.’[10] </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 20.—Record Showing Diminution of Response when
          Sufficient Time is not Allowed for Full Recovery</b> </p>

      </center>
      <p>In (a) stimuli were applied at intervals of one minute; in (b)
        the intervals were reduced to half a minute; this caused a
        diminution of response. In (c) the original rhythm is restored,
        and the response is found to be enhanced. (Radish.) </p>
      <p><i>Apparent fatigue when stimulation frequency increased.</i> —
        If the rhythm of stimulation frequency be now changed, and made
        quicker, certain remarkable modifications will appear in the
        response-curves. In fig. 20, the first part shows the responses
        at one minute interval, by which time the individual recovery
        was complete. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 21.—Fatigue in Celery</b> </p>

      </center>
      <p>Vibration of 30° at intervals of half a minute. </p>
      <p>The rhythm was now changed to intervals of half&nbsp; a minute,
        instead of one, while the stimuli were maintained at the same
        intensity as before. It will be noticed (fig. 20, b) that these
        responses appear much feebler than the first set, in spite of
        the equality of stimulus. An inspection of the figure may
        perhaps throw some light on the subject. It will be seen that
        when greater frequency of stimulation was introduced, the tissue
        had not yet had time to effect complete recovery from previous
        strain. The molecular swing towards equilibrium had not yet
        abated, when the new stimulus, with its opposing impulse, was
        received. There is thus a diminution of height in the resultant
        response. The original rhythm of one minute was now restored,
        and the succeeding curves (fig. 20, c) at once show increased
        response. An analogous instance may be cited in the case of
        muscle response, where ‘the height of twitch diminishes more
        rapidly in proportion as the excitation interval is
        shorter.’[11] </p>

      <p>Stimulus: 30° vibration at intervals of one minute. </p>
      <p>From what has just been said it would appear that one of the
        causes of diminution of response, or fatigue, is the residual
        strain. This is clearly seen in fig. 21, in a record which I
        obtained with celery-stalk. It will be noticed there that, owing
        to the imperfect molecular recovery during the time allowed, the
        succeeding heights of the responses have undergone a continuous
        diminution. Fig. 22 gives a&nbsp; photographic record of fatigue
        in the leaf-stalk of cauliflower. </p>
      <p>It is evident that residual strain, other things being equal,
        will be greater if the stimuli have been excessive. This is well
        seen in fig. 23, where the set of first three curves A is for
        stimulus intensity of 45° vibration, and the second set B, with
        an augmented response, for stimulus intensity of 90° vibration.
        On reverting in C to stimulus intensity of 45°, the responses
        are seen to have undergone a great diminution as compared with
        the first set A. Here is seen marked fatigue, the result of
        overstrain from excessive stimulation. </p>

      <p>Successive stimuli applied at intervals of one minute. The
        intensity of stimulus in C is the same as that of A, but
        response is feebler owing to previous over-stimulation. Fatigue
        is to a great extent removed after fifteen minutes’ rest, and
        the responses in D are stronger than those in C. The vertical
        line between arrows represents ·05 volt. (Turnip leaf-stalk.) </p>
      <p>If this fatigue be really due to residual strain effect, then,
        as strain disappears with time, we may expect the responses to
        regain their former height after a period of rest. In order to
        verify this, therefore, I renewed the stimulation (at intensity
        45°) after fifteen minutes. It&nbsp; will at once be seen from
        record D how far the fatigue had been removed. </p>
      <p>One peculiarity that will be noticed in these curves is that,
        owing to the presence of comparatively little residual strain,
        the first response of each set is relatively large. The
        succeeding responses are approximately equal where the residual
        strains are similar. The first response of A shows this because
        it had had long previous rest. The first of B shows it because
        we are there passing for the first time to increased
        stimulation. The first of C does not show it, because there is
        now a strong residual strain. D again shows it because the
        strain has been removed by fifteen minutes’ rest. </p>
      <p><i>Fatigue under continuous stimulation. </i>— The effect of
        fatigue is exhibited in marked degree when a tissue is subjected
        to continuous stimulation. In cases where there is marked
        fatigue, as for instance in certain muscles, the top of the
        tetanic curve undergoes rapid decline. A similar effect is
        obtained also with plants (fig. 24). </p>

      </center>
      <p>The effect of rest in producing molecular recovery, and hence
        in the removal of fatigue, is well illustrated in the following
        set of photographic records (fig. 25). The first shows the curve
        obtained with a fresh plant.&nbsp; The effect is seen to be very
        large. Two minutes were allowed for recovery, and then
        stimulation was repeated during another two minutes. The
        response in this case is seen to be decidedly smaller. A third
        case is somewhat similar to the second. A period of rest of five
        minutes was now allowed, and the curve obtained subsequently,
        owing to partial removal of residual strain, is found to exhibit
        greater response. </p>

      <p>In the first three records, two minutes’ stimulation is
        followed by two minutes’ recovery. The last record was taken
        after the specimen had a rest of five minutes. The response,
        owing to removal of fatigue by rest, is stronger. </p>
      <p>The results thus arrived at, under the simple conditions of
        vegetable life, free as they are from all possible complications
        and uncertainties, may perhaps throw some light on the obscure
        phenomena of fatigue in animal tissues. </p>

        <b>CHAPTER VI</b>
        <p><b>PLANT RESPONSE—ON DIPHASIC VARIATION</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Diphasic variation — Positive after-effect and positive
          response — Radial E.M. variation.</i> </p>
      <p>When a plant is stimulated at any point, a molecular
        disturbance — the excitatory wave — is propagated outwards from
        the point of its initiation. </p>
      <p><i>Diphasic variation.</i> — This wave of molecular disturbance
        is attended by a wave of electrical disturbance. (Usually
        speaking, the electrical relation between disturbed and less
        disturbed is that of copper to zinc.) It takes some time for a
        disturbance to travel from one point to another, and its
        intensity may undergo a diminution as it recedes further from
        its point of origin. Suppose a disturbance originated at C; if
        two points are taken near each other, as A and B, the
        disturbance will reach them almost at the same time, and with
        the same intensity. The electric disturbance will be the same in
        both. The effect produced at A and B will balance each other and
        there will be no resultant current. </p>
      <p>By killing or otherwise reducing the sensibility of B as is
        done in the method of injury, there is no response at B, and we
        obtain the unbalanced response, due to disturbance at A; the
        same effect is obtained by putting&nbsp; a clamp between A and
        B, so that the disturbance may not reach B. But we may get
        response even without injury or block. If we have the contacts
        at A and B, and if we give a tap nearer A than B (fig. 26, a),
        then we have (1) the disturbance reaching A earlier than B. (2)
        The disturbance reaching A is much stronger than at B. The
        disturbance at B may be so comparatively feeble as to be
        negligible. </p>
      <p>It will thus be seen that we might obtain responses even
        without injury or block, in cases where the disturbance is
        enfeebled in reaching a distant point. In such a case on giving
        a tap near A a responsive current would be produced in one
        direction, and in the opposite direction when the tap is given
        near B (fig. 26, b). Theoretically, then, we might find a
        neutral point between A and B, so that, on originating the
        disturbance there, the waves of disturbance would reach A and B
        at the same instant and with the same intensity. If, further,
        the rate of recovery be the same for both points, then the
        electric disturbances produced at A and B will continue to
        balance each other, and the galvanometer will show no current.
        On taking a cylindrical root of radish I have sometimes
        succeeded in finding a neutral point, which, being disturbed,
        did not give rise to any resultant current. But disturbing a
        point to the right or to the left gave rise to opposite
        currents. </p>
      <p>It is, however, difficult to obtain an absolutely cylindrical
        specimen, as it always tapers in one direction. The conductivity
        towards the tip of the root is not exactly the same as that in
        the ascending direction. It&nbsp; is therefore difficult to fix
        an absolutely neutral point, but a point may be found which
        approaches this very nearly, and on stimulating the stalk near
        this, a very interesting diphasic variation has been observed.
        In a specimen of cauliflower-stalk, (1) stimulus was applied
        very much nearer A than B (the feeble disturbance reaching B was
        negligible). The resulting response was upward and the recovery
        took place in about sixty seconds. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 26.—Diphasic Variation</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig026.jpg" width="300" height="277"></p>
      </center>
      <p>(2) Stimulus was next applied near B. The resulting response
        was now downward (fig. 26, b). </p>
      <p>(3) The stimulus was now applied near the approximately neutral
        point N. In this case, owing to a slight difference in the rates
        of propagation in the two directions, a very interesting
        diphasic variation was produced (fig. 26, c). From the record it
        will be seen that the disturbance arrived earlier at A than at
        B. This produced an upward response. But during the&nbsp;
        subsidence of the disturbance at A, the wave reached B. The
        effect of this was to produce a current in the opposite
        direction. This apparently hastened the recovery of A (from 60
        seconds to 12 seconds). The excitation of A now disappeared, and
        the second phase of response, that due to excitation of B, was
        fully displayed. </p>
      <p><i>Positive after-effect.</i> — If we regard the response due
        to excitation of A as negative, the later effect on B would
        appear as a subsequent positive variation. </p>
      <p>In the response of nerve, for example, where contacts are made
        at two surfaces, injured and uninjured, there is sometimes
        observed, first a negative variation, and then a positive
        after-effect. This may sometimes at least be due to the proximal
        uninjured contact first giving the usual negative variation, and
        the more distant contact of injury giving rise, later, to the
        opposite, that is to say, apparently positive, response. There
        is always a chance of an after-effect due to this cause, unless
        (1) the injured end be completely killed and rendered quite
        irresponsive, or (2) there be an effective block between A and
        B, so that the disturbance due to stimulus can only act on one,
        and not on the other. </p>
      <p>I have found cases where, even when there was a perfect block,
        a positive after-effect occurred. It would thus appear that if
        molecular distortion from stimulus give rise to a negative
        variation, then during the process of molecular recovery there
        may be over-shooting of the equilibrium position, which may be
        exhibited as a positive variation. </p>
      <p><i>Positive variation.</i> — The responses given by muscle or
        nerve are, normally speaking, negative. But that of retina is
        positive. The sign of response, however, is apt to be reversed
        if there be any molecular modification of the tissue from
        changes of external circumstances. Thus it is often found that
        nerve in a stale condition gives positive, instead of the normal
        negative variation, and stale retina often gives negative,
        instead of the usual positive. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 27.—Abnormal Positive Responses in Stale Leaf-stalk of

      </center>
      <p>The relative intensities of stimuli in the two cases are in the
        ratio of 1:7. </p>
      <p>Curiously enough, I have on many occasions found exactly
        parallel instances in the response of plants. Plants when fresh,
        as stated, give negative responses as a rule. But when somewhat
        faded they sometimes give rise to positive response. Again, just
        as in the modified nerve the abnormal positive response gives
        place to the normal negative under strong and long-continued
        stimulation, so also in the modified plant the abnormal positive
        response passes into negative&nbsp; (fig. 27) under strong
        stimulation. I was able in some cases to trace this process of
        gradual reversal, by continuously increasing the intensity of
        stimulus. It was then found that as the stimulus was increased,
        the positive at a certain point underwent a reversal into the
        normal negative response (fig. 28). </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 28. Abnormal Positive passing into Normal Negative in a
          Stale Specimen of Leaf-stalk of Cauliflower</b> </p>

        <p><img src="fig028.jpg" width="350" height="215"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Stimulus was gradually increased from 1 to 10, by means of
        spring-tapper. When the stimulus intensity was 10, the response
        became reversed into normal negative. (Parts of 8 and 9 are out
        of the plate.) </p>
      <p>The plant thus gives a reversed response under abnormal
        conditions of staleness. I have sometimes found similar reversal
        of response when the plant is subjected to the abnormal
        conditions of excessively high or low temperature. </p>
      <p><i>Radial E.M. variation.</i> — We have seen that a current of
        response flows in the plant from the relatively more to the
        relatively less excited. A theoretically important experiment is
        the following: A thick stem of plant stalk was taken and a hole
        bored so as to make one contact with the interior of the tissue,
        the other being&nbsp; on the surface. After a while the current
        of injury was found to disappear. On exciting the stem by taps
        or torsional vibration, a responsive current was observed which
        flowed inwards from the more disturbed outer surface to the
        shielded core inside (fig. 29). Hence it is seen that when a
        wave of disturbance is propagated along the plant, there is a
        concomitant wave of radial E.M. variation. The swaying of a tree
        by the wind would thus appear to give rise to a radial E.M.F. </p>

        they are in general recorded up. But in cases where it is

        response will be recorded up, and negative down. </p>

        <p><b>PLANT RESPONSE—ON THE RELATION BETWEEN STIMULUS AND
            RESPONSE</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Increased response with increasing stimulus — Apparent
          diminution of response with excessively strong stimulus.</i> </p>
      <p>As already said, in the living tissue, molecular disturbance
        induced by stimulus is accompanied by an electric disturbance,
        which gradually disappears with the return of the disturbed
        molecules to their position of equilibrium. The greater the
        molecular distortion produced by the stimulus, the greater is
        the electric variation produced. The electric response is thus
        an outward expression of a molecular disturbance produced by an
        external agency, the stimulus. </p>
      <p><i>Curve of relation between stimulus and response.</i> — In
        the curve showing the relation between stimulus and response in
        nerve and muscle, it is found that the molecular effect as
        exhibited either by contraction or E.M. variation in muscle, or
        simply by E.M. variation in nerve, is at first slight. In the
        second part, there is a rapidly increasing effect with increased
        stimulus. Finally, a tendency shows itself to approach a limit
        of response. Thus we find the curve at first slightly convex,
        then straight and ascending, and lastly, concave to the abscissa
        (fig. 30). </p>
      <p>In muscle the limit of response is reached much sooner than in
        nerve. As will be seen, the range of variation of stimulus in
        these curves is not very&nbsp; great. When the stimulus is
        carried beyond moderate limits, the response, owing to fatigue
        or other causes, may sometimes undergo an actual diminution. </p>

      <p>Taps of increasing strength 1:2:3:4 producing increased

      <p>I have obtained very interesting results, with reference to the
        relation between stimulus and response, when experimenting with
        plants. These results are suggestive of various types of
        response met with in animal tissues. </p>
      <p>1. In order to obtain the simplest type of effects, not
        complicated by secondary phenomena, one has to choose specimens
        which exhibit little fatigue. Having procured these, I undertook
        two series of experiments. In the first (A) the stimulus was
        applied by means of the spring-tapper, and in the second (B) by
        torsional vibration. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;(A) The first stimulus was given by a fall of the lever
        through h, the second through 2 h, and so on. The
        response-curves clearly show increasing effect with increased
        stimulus (fig. 31). </p>

        to 7·5° to 10° to 12·5° in amplitude. It will be observed how
        the intensity of response tends to approach a limit (fig. 32). </p>

      <p>&nbsp;2. The next figure shows how little variation is produced
        with low value of stimulus, but with increasing stimulus the
        response undergoes a rapid increase, after which it tends to
        approach a limit (fig. 33, a). </p>

        intervals of two minutes. The record is taken for one minute. </p>
      <p>(b) Record for stale radish. There is a reversed response for
        the feeble stimulus of 5° vibration. </p>
      <p>3. As an extreme instance of the case just cited, I have often
        come across a curious phenomenon. During the gradual increase of
        the stimulus from a low value there would be apparently no
        response. But when a critical value was reached a maximum
        response would suddenly occur, and would not be exceeded when
        the stimulus was further increased. Here we have a parallel to
        what is known in animal physiology as the ‘all or none’
        principle. With the cardiac muscle, for example, there is a
        certain minimal intensity which is effective in producing
        response, but further increase of stimulus produces no increase
        in response. </p>
      <p>4. From an inspection of the records of responses&nbsp; which
        are given, it will be seen that the slope of a curve which shows
        the relation of stimulus to response will at first be slight,
        the curve will then ascend rapidly, and at high values of
        stimulus tend to become horizontal. The curve as a whole
        becomes, first slightly convex to the abscissa, then straight
        and ascending, and lastly concave. A far more pronounced
        convexity in the first part is shown in some cases, especially
        when the specimen is stale. This is due to the fact that under
        these circumstances response is apt to begin with an actual
        reversal of sign, the plant under feebler than a certain
        critical intensity of stimulus giving positive, instead of the
        normal negative, response (fig. 33, b). </p>
      <p><i>Diminution of response with excessively strong stimulus. </i>—
        It is found that in animal tissues there is sometimes an actual
        diminution of response with excessive increase of stimulus. Thus
        Waller finds, in working with retina, that as the intensity of
        light stimulus is gradually increased, the response at first
        increases, and then sometimes undergoes a diminution. This
        phenomenon is unfortunately complicated by fatigue, itself
        regarded as obscure. It is therefore difficult to say whether
        the diminution of response is due to fatigue or to some
        reversing action of an excessively strong stimulus. </p>
      <p>From fig. 33, b, above, it is seen that there was an actual
        reversal of response in the lower portion of the curve. It is
        therefore not improbable that there may be more than one point
        of reversal. </p>
      <p>In physical phenomena we are, however, acquainted with numerous
        instances of reversals. For example,&nbsp; a common effect of
        magnetisation is to produce an elongation of an iron rod. But
        Bidwell finds that as the magnetising force is pushed to an
        extreme, at a certain point elongation ceases and is succeeded,
        with further increase of magnetising force, by an actual
        contraction. Again a photographic plate, when exposed
        continuously to light, gives at first a negative image. Still
        longer exposure produces a positive. Then again we have a
        negative. There is thus produced a series of recurrent
        reversals. In photographic prints of flashes of lightning, two
        kinds of images are observed, one, the positive — when the
        lightning discharge is moderately intense — and the other,
        negative, the so-called ‘dark lightning’ — due to the reversal
        action of an intensely strong discharge. </p>
      <p>In studying the changes of conductivity produced in metallic
        particles by the stimulus of Hertzian radiation, I have often
        noticed that whereas feeble radiation produces one effect,
        strong radiation produces the opposite. Again, under the
        continuous action of electric radiation, I have frequently found
        recurrent reversals.[13] </p>
      <p><i>Diminution of response under strong stimulus traced to
          fatigue. </i>— But there are instances in plant response
        where the diminution effect can be definitely traced to fatigue.
        The records of these cases are extremely suggestive as to the
        manner in which the diminution is brought about. The
        accompanying figures (fig. 34) give records of responses to
        increasing stimulus. They were made with specimens of
        cauliflower-stalks, one of which (a) showed little fatigue,
        while in the other (b)&nbsp; fatigue was present. It will be
        seen that the curves obtained by joining the apices of the
        successive single responses are very similar. </p>

      </center>
      <p>In (a) fatigue is absent, in (b) it is present. </p>
      <p>In one case there is no fatigue, the recovery from each
        stimulus being complete. Every response in the series therefore
        starts from a position of perfect equilibrium, and the height of
        the single responses increases with increasing stimulation. But
        in the second case,&nbsp; the strain is not completely removed
        after any single stimulation of the series. That recovery is
        partial is seen by the gradual shifting of the base line
        upwards. In the former case the base line is horizontal and
        represents a condition of complete equilibrium. Now, however,
        the base line, or line of modified equilibrium, is tilted
        upwards. Thus even in this case if we measure the heights of
        successive responses from the line of absolute equilibrium, they
        will be found to increase with increasing stimulus. Ordinarily,
        however, we make no allowance for the shifting of the base line,
        measuring response rather from the place of its previous
        recovery, or from the point of modified equilibrium. Judged in
        this way, the responses undergo an apparent diminution. </p>

        <p><b>PLANT RESPONSE—ON THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE</b></p>

      <p><i>Effect of very low temperature — Influence of high
          temperature — Determination of death-point — Increased
          response as after-effect of temperature variation — Death of
          plant and abolition of response by the action of steam.</i> </p>
      <p>For every plant there is a range of temperature most favourable
        to its vital activity. Above this optimum, the vital activity
        diminishes, till a maximum is reached, when it ceases
        altogether, and if this point be maintained for a long time the
        plant is apt to be killed. Similarly, the vital activity is
        diminished if the temperature be lowered below the optimum, and
        again, at a minimum point it ceases, while below this minimum
        the plant may be killed. We may regard these maximum and minimum
        temperatures as the death-points. Some plants can resist these
        extremes better than others. Length of exposure, it should
        however be remembered, is also a determining factor in the
        question as to whether or not the plant shall survive
        unfavourable conditions of temperature. Thus we have hardy
        plants, and plants that are affected by excessive variations of
        temperature. Within the characteristic power of the species,
        there may be, again, a certain amount of individual difference.
      </p>
      <p>These facts being known, I was anxious to deter mine whether
        the undoubted changes induced by temperature in the vital
        activity of plants would affect electrical response. </p>
      <p><i>Effect of very low temperature.</i> — As regards the
        influence of very low temperature, I had opportunities of
        studying the question on the sudden appearance of frost. In the
        previous week, when the temperature was about 10° C., I had
        obtained strong electric response in radishes whose value varied
        from ·05 to ·1 volt. But two or three days later, as the effect
        of the frost, I found electric response to have practically
        disappeared. A few radishes were, however, found somewhat
        resistant, but the electric response had, even in these cases,
        fallen from the average value of ·075 V. under normal
        temperature to ·003 V. after the frost. That is to say, the
        average sensitiveness had been reduced to about 1/25th. On
        warming the frost-bitten radish to 20° C. there was an
        appreciable revival, as shown by increase in response. In
        specimens where the effect of frost had been very great, i.e. in
        those which showed little or no electric response, warming did
        not restore responsiveness. From this it would appear that frost
        killed some, which could not be subsequently revived, whereas
        others were only reduced to a condition of torpidity, from which
        there was revival on warming. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 35. — Diminution of Response in Eucharis by Lowering of
          Temperature</b> </p>

      <p>(a) Normal response at 17° C. <br>
        (b) The response almost disappears when plant is subjected to
        ?2° C. for fifteen minutes. <br>
        (c) Revival of response on warming to 20° C. </p>
      <p>I now tried the effect of artificial lowering of temperature on
        various plants. A plant which is very easily affected by cold is
        a certain species of Eucharis lily. I first obtained responses
        with the leaf-stalk of this lily at the ordinary temperature of
        the room&nbsp; (17° C.). I then placed it for fifteen minutes in
        a cooling chamber, temperature ?2° C., for only ten minutes,
        after which, on trying to obtain response, it was found to have
        practically disappeared. I now warmed the plant by immersing it
        for awhile in water at 20° C., and this produced a revival of
        the response (fig. 35). If the plant be subjected to low
        temperature for too long a time, there is then no subsequent
        revival. </p>
      <p>I obtained a similar marked diminution of response with the
        flower-stalk of Arum lily, on lowering the temperature to zero.
      </p>
      <p>My next attempt was to compare the sensibility of different
        plants to the effect of lowered temperatures. For this purpose I
        chose three specimens: (1) Eucharis lily; (2) Ivy; and (3)
        Holly. I took their normal response at 17° C., and found that,
        generally speaking, they attained a fairly constant value after
        the third or fourth response. After taking these records of
        normal response, I placed the specimens in an ice-chamber,&nbsp;
        temperature 0° C., for twenty-four hours, and afterwards took
        their records once more at the ordinary temperature of the room.
        From these it will be seen that while the responsiveness of
        Eucharis lily, known to be susceptible to the effect of cold,
        had entirely disappeared, that of the hardier plants, Holly and
        Ivy, showed very little change (fig. 36). </p>
      <p>Another very curious effect that I have noticed is that when a
        plant approaches its death-point by reason of excessively high
        or low temperature, not only is its general responsiveness
        diminished almost to zero, but even the slight response
        occasionally becomes reversed. </p>

        freezing temperature for twenty-four hours. </p>
      <p>Influence of high temperature, and determination of
        death-point. — I next tried to find out whether a rise of
        temperature produced a depression of response, and whether the
        response disappeared at a maximum temperature — the temperature
        of death-point. For this purpose I took a batch of six radishes
        and obtained from them responses at gradually increasing
        temperatures. These specimens were obtained late in the season,
        and their electric responsiveness was much lower than those
        obtained earlier. The plant, previously kept for five minutes in
        water at a definite temperature&nbsp; (say 17° C.), was mounted
        in the vibration apparatus and responses observed. The plant was
        then dismounted, and replaced in the water-bath at a higher
        temperature (say 30° C.) again, for five minutes. A second set
        of responses was now taken. In this way observations were made
        with each specimen till the temperature at which response almost
        or altogether ceased was reached. I give below a table of
        results obtained with six specimens of radish, from which it
        would appear that response begins to be abolished in these cases
        at temperatures varying from 53° to 55° C. </p>

      <p>Amplitude of vibration which determines the intensity of
        stimulus is measured by the graduated circle seen to the right.
        Temperature is regulated by the electric heating coil R. For
        experiments on action of anæsthetics, vapour of chloroform is
        blown in through the side tube. </p>
      <p><i>Electric heating.</i> — The experiments just described were,
        however, rather troublesome, inasmuch as, in order to produce
        each variation of temperature, the specimen had to be taken out
        of the apparatus, warmed, and remounted. I therefore introduced
        a modification by which this difficulty was obviated. The
        specimen was now enclosed in a glass chamber (fig. 37), which
        also contained a spiral of German-silver wire, through which
        electric currents could be sent, for the purpose of heating the
        chamber. By varying the intensity of the current, the
        temperature could be regulated at will. The specimen chosen for
        experiment was the leaf-stalk of celery. It was kept at each
        given temperature for&nbsp; ten minutes, and two records were
        taken during that time. It was then raised by 10° C., and the
        same process was repeated. It will be noticed from the record
        (fig. 38) that in this particular case, as the temperature rose
        from 20° C. to 30° C., there was a marked diminution of
        response. At the same time, in this case at&nbsp; least,
        recovery was quicker. At 20° C., for example, the response was
        21 dns., and the recovery was not complete in the course of a
        minute. At 30° C., however, the response had been reduced to 7·5
        divisions, but there was almost complete recovery in twelve
        seconds. As the temperature was gradually increased, a
        continuous decrease of response occurred. This diminution of
        response with increased temperature appears to be universal, but
        the quickening of recovery may be true of individual cases only.

      <p>In radishes response disappeared completely at 55° C., but with
        celery, heated in the manner described, I could not obtain its
        entire abolition at 60° C. or even higher. A noticeable
        circumstance, however, was the prolongation of the period of
        recovery at these high temperatures. I soon understood the
        reason of this apparent anomaly. The method adopted in the
        present case was that of dry heating, whereas the previous
        experiments had been carried on by the use of hot water. It is
        well known that one can stand a temperature of 100° C. without
        ill effects in the hot-air chamber of a Turkish bath, while
        immersion in water at 100° C. would be fatal. </p>
      <p>In order to find out whether subjection to hot water would kill
        the celery-stalk, I took it out and placed it&nbsp; for five
        minutes in water at 55° C. This, as will be seen from the record
        taken afterwards, effectively killed the plant (fig. 38, w). </p>

      <p>Increased sensitiveness as after-effect of temperature
        variation.—A very curious effect of temperature variation is the
        marked increase of sensitiveness which often appears as its
        after-effect. I noticed this first in a series of observations
        where records were taken during the rise of temperature and
        continued while the temperature was falling (fig. 39). The
        temperature was adjusted by electric heating. It was found that
        the responses were markedly enhanced during cooling, as&nbsp;
        compared with responses given at the same temperatures while
        warming (see table). Temperature variation thus seems to have a
        stimulating effect on response, by increasing molecular mobility
        in some way. The second record (fig. 40) shows the variation of
        response in Eucharis lily (1) during the rise, and (2) during
        the fall&nbsp; of temperature. Fig. 41 gives a curve of
        variation of response during the rise and fall of temperature. </p>

        temperature of plant-chamber gradually rose on starting current

      <p><i>Point of temperature maximum.</i> — We have seen how, in
        cases of lowered temperature, response is abolished earlier in
        plants like Eucharis, which are affected by cold, than in the
        hardier plants such as Holly and Ivy. Plants again are unequally
        affected as regards the upper range. In the case of Scotch kale,
        for instance, response disappears after ten minutes of water
        temperature of about 55° C., but with Eucharis fairly marked
        response can still be obtained after such immersion and does not
        disappear till it has been subjected for ten minutes to hot
        water, at a temperature of 65° C. or even higher. The reason of
        this great power of resistance to heat is probably found in the
        fact that the Eucharis is a tropical plant, and is grown, in
        this country, in hot-houses where a comparatively high
        temperature is maintained. </p>

      <p><i>The effect of steam.</i> — I next wished to obtain a
        continuous record by which the effects of suddenly increased
        temperatures, culminating in the death of the plant, might be
        made evident. For this purpose I mounted the plant in the glass
        chamber, into which steam&nbsp; could be introduced. I had
        chosen a specimen which gave regular response. On the
        introduction of steam, with the consequent sudden increase of
        temperature, there was a transitory augmentation of
        excitability. But this quickly disappeared, and in five minutes
        the plant was effectively killed, as will be seen graphically
        illustrated in the record (fig. 42). </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 42.—Effect of Steam in Killing Response</b> </p>

      </center>
      <p>The two records to the left exhibit normal response at 17° C.
        Sudden warming by steam produced at first an increase of
        response, but five minutes exposure to steam killed the plant
        (carrot) and abolished the response. </p>
      <p>Vibrational stimulus of 30° applied at intervals of one minute;
        vertical line = ·1 volt. </p>
      <p>It will thus be seen that those modifications of vital activity
        which are produced in plants by temperature variation can be
        very accurately gauged by electric response. Indeed it may be
        said that there is no other method by which the moment of
        cessation of vitality can be so satisfactorily distinguished.
        Ordinarily, we&nbsp; are able to judge that a plant has died,
        only after various indirect effects of death, such as withering,
        have begun to appear. But in the electric response we have an
        immediate indication of the arrest of vitality, and we are
        thereby enabled to determine the death-point, which it is
        impossible to do by any other means. </p>
      <p>It may be mentioned here that the explanation suggested by
        Kunkel, of the response being due to movement of water in the
        plant, is inadequate. For in that case we should expect a
        definite stimulation to be under all conditions followed by a
        definite electric response, whose intensity and sign should
        remain invariable. But we find, instead, the response to be
        profoundly modified by any influence which affects the vitality
        of the plant. For instance, the response is at its maximum at an
        optimum temperature, a rise of a few degrees producing a
        profound depression; the response disappears at the maximum and
        minimum temperatures, and is revived when brought back to the
        optimum. Anæsthetics and poisons abolish the response. Again, we
        have the response undergoing an actual reversal when the tissue
        is stale. All these facts show that mere movement of water could
        not be the effective cause of plant response. </p>

          formalin — Method in which response is unaffected by variation
          of resistance — Advantage of block method — Effect of dose.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The most important test by which vital phenomena are
        distinguished is the influence on response of narcotics and
        poisons. For example, a nerve when narcotised by chloroform
        exhibits a diminishing response as the action of the anæsthetic
        proceeds. (See below, fig. 43.) Similarly, various poisons have
        the effect of permanently abolishing all response. Thus a nerve
        is killed by strong alkalis and strong acids. I have already
        shown how plants which previously gave strong response did not,
        after application of an anæsthetic or poison, give any response
        at all. In these cases it was the last stage only that could be
        observed. But it appeared important to be able to trace the
        growing effect of anæsthetisation or poisoning throughout the
        process. There were, however, two conditions which it at first
        appeared difficult to meet. First it was necessary to find a
        specimen which would normally exhibit no fatigue, and give rise
        for a long time to a uniform series&nbsp; of response. The
        immediate changes made in the response, in consequence of the
        application of chemical reagents, could then be demonstrated in
        a striking manner. And with a little trouble, specimens can be
        secured in which perfect regularity of response is found. The
        record given in fig. 16, obtained with a specimen of radish,
        shows how possible it is to secure plants in which response is
        absolutely regular. I subjected this to uniform stimulation at
        intervals of one minute, during half an hour, without detecting
        the least variation in the responses. But it is of course easier
        to find others in which the responses as a whole may be taken as
        regular, though there may be slight rhythmic fluctuations. And
        even in these cases the effect of reagents is too marked and
        sudden to escape notice. </p>

      <p>For the obtaining of constant and strong response I found the
        best materials to be carrot and radish, selected individuals
        from which gave most satisfactory results. The carrots were at
        their best in August and September,&nbsp; after which their
        sensitiveness rapidly declined. Later, being obliged to seek for
        other specimens, I came upon radish, which gave good results in
        the early part of November; but the setting-in of the frost had
        a prejudicial effect on its responsiveness. Less perfect than
        these, but still serviceable, are the leaf-stalks of turnip and
        cauliflower. In these the successive responses as a whole may be
        regarded as regular, though a curious alternation is sometimes
        noticed, which, however, has a regularity of its own. </p>
      <p>My second misgiving was as to whether the action of reagents
        would be sufficiently rapid to display itself within the time
        limit of a photographic record. This would of course depend in
        turn upon the rapidity with which the tissues of the plant could
        absorb the reagent and be affected by it. It was a surprise to
        me to find that, with good specimens, the effect was manifested
        in the course of so short a time as a minute or so. </p>
      <p><i>Effect of chloroform.</i> — In studying the effect of
        chemical reagents in plants, the method is precisely similar to
        that employed with nerve; that is to say, where vapour of
        chloroform is used, it is blown into the plant chamber. In cases
        of liquid reagents, they are applied on the points of contact A
        and B and their close neighbourhood. The mode of experiment was
        (1) to obtain a series of normal responses to uniform stimuli,
        applied at regular intervals of time, say one minute, the record
        being taken the while on a photographic plate. (2) Without
        interrupting this procedure, the anæsthetic agent, vapour of
        chloroform, was blown into the closed chamber containing the
        plant.&nbsp; It will be seen how rapidly chloroform produces
        depression of response (fig. 44), and how the effect grows with
        time. In these experiments with plants, the same curious
        shifting of the zero line is sometimes noticed as in nerve when
        subjected similarly to the action of reagents. This is a point
        of minor importance, the essential point to be noticed being
        that the responses are rapidly reduced. </p>

      <p><i>Effects of chloral and formalin</i>. — I give below (figs.
        45, 46) two sets of records, one for the reagent chloral and the
        other for formalin. The reagents were applied in the form of a
        solution on the tissue at the two leading contacts, and the
        contiguous surface. The rhythmic fluctuation in the normal
        response shown in fig. 45 is interesting. The abrupt decline,
        within a&nbsp; minute of the application of chloral, is also
        extremely well marked. </p>

      <p><i>Response unaffected by variation of resistance.</i> — In
        order to bring out clearly the main phenomena, I have postponed
        till now the consideration of a point of some difficulty. To
        determine the influence of a reagent in modifying the
        excitability of the tissue, we rely upon its effect in exalting
        or depressing the responsive E.M.&nbsp; variation. We read this
        effect by means of galvanometric deflections. And if the
        resistance of the circuit remained constant, then an increase of
        galvanometer deflection would accurately indicate a heightened
        or depressed E.M. response, due to greater or less excitability
        of tissue caused by the reagent. But, by the introduction of the
        chemical reagent, the resistance of the tissue may undergo
        change, and owing to this cause, modification of response as
        read by the galvanometer may be produced without any E.M.
        variation. The observed variation of response may thus be partly
        owing to some unknown change of resistance, as well as to that
        of the E.M. variation in response to stimulus. </p>
      <p>We may however discriminate as to how much of the observed
        change is due to variation of resistance by comparing the
        deflections produced in the galvanometer by the action of a
        definite small E.M.F. before and after the introduction of the
        reagent. If the deflections be the same in both cases, we know
        that the resistance has not varied. If there have been any
        change, the variation of deflection will show the amount, and we
        can make allowance accordingly. </p>
      <p>I have however adopted another method, by which all necessity
        of correction is obviated, and the galvanometric deflections
        simply give E.M. variations, unaffected by any change in the
        resistance of the tissue. This is done by interposing a very
        large and constant resistance in the external circuit and
        thereby making other resistances negligible. An example will
        make this point clear. Taking a carrot as the vegetable tissue,
        I found its resistance plus the resistance of the non-
        polarisable electrode equal to 20,000 ohms. The introduction of
        a chemical reagent reduced it to 19,000 ohms. The resistance of
        the galvanometer is equal to 1,000 ohms. The high external
        resistance was 1,000,000 ohms. The variation of resistance
        produced in the circuit would therefore be 1,000 in (1,000,000 +
        19,000 + 1,000) or one part in 1,020. Therefore the variation of
        galvanometric deflection due to change of resistance would be
        less than one part in a thousand (cf. fig. 49). </p>
      <p><i>The advantage of the block method. </i>— In these
        investigations I have used the block method, instead of that of
        negative variation, and I may here draw attention to the
        advantages which it offers. In the method of negative variation,
        one contact being injured, the chemical reagents act on injured
        and uninjured unequally, and it is conceivable that by this
        unequal action the resting difference of potential may be
        altered. But the intensity of response in the method of injury
        depends on this resting difference. It is thus hypothetically
        possible that on the method of negative variation there might be
        changes in the responses caused by variation of the resting
        difference, and not necessarily due to the stimulating or
        depressing effect of the reagent on the tissue. </p>
      <p>But by the block method the two contacts are made with
        uninjured surfaces, and the effect of reagents on both is
        similar. Thus no advantage is given to one contact over the
        other. The changes now detected in response are therefore due to
        no adventitious circumstance, but to the reagent itself. If
        further verification&nbsp; be desired as to the effect of the
        reagent, we can obtain it by alternate stimulation of the A and
        B ends. Both ends will then show the given change. I give below
        a record of responses given by two ends of leaf-stalk of turnip,
        stimulated alternately in the manner described. The stalk used
        was slightly conical, and owing to this difference between the A
        and B ends the responses given by one end were slightly
        different from those given by the other, though the stimuli were
        equal. A few drops of 10 per cent. solution of NaOH was applied
        to both the ends. It will be seen how quickly this reagent
        abolished the response of both ends (fig. 47). </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 47. — Abolition of Response at both A and B Ends by the
          Action of NaOH</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig047.jpg" width="450" height="230"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Stimuli of 30° vibration were applied at intervals of one
        minute to A and B alternately. Response was completely abolished
        twenty-four minutes after application of NaOH. </p>
      <p><i>Effect of dose</i>. — It is sometimes found that while a
        reagent acts as a poison when given in large quantities, it may
        act as a stimulant in small doses. Of the two following records
        fig. 48 shows the slight stimulating&nbsp; effect of very dilute
        KOH, and fig. 49 exhibits nearly complete abolition of response
        by the action of the same reagent when given in stronger doses.
      </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 48.—Stimulating Action of very dilute KOH</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig048.jpg" width="400" height="280"></p>
      </center>
      <p>So we see that, judged by the final criterion of the effect
        produced by anæsthetics and poisons, the plant response fulfils
        the test of vital phenomenon. In previous chapters we have found
        that in the matter of response by negative variation, of the
        presence or absence of fatigue, of the relation between stimulus
        and response, of modification of response by high and low
        temperatures, and even in the matter of occasional abnormal
        variations such as positive response in a modified tissue, they
        were strictly correspondent to similar phenomena in animal
        tissues. The remaining test, of the influence of chemical
        reagents, having now been applied, a complete parallelism may be
        held to have been established between plant response on the one
        hand, and that of animal tissue on the other. </p>

        <p><b>RESPONSE IN METALS</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Is response found in inorganic substances? — Experiment on
          tin, block method — Anomalies of existing terminology —
          Response by method of depression — Response by method of
          exaltation.</i> </p>
      <p>We have now seen that the electrical sign of life is not
        confined to animals, but is also found in plants. And we have
        seen how electrical response serves as an index to the vital
        activity of the plant, how with the arrest of this vital
        activity electrical response is also arrested temporarily, as in
        the case amongst others of anæsthetic action, and permanently,
        for instance under the action of poisons. Thus living tissues —
        both animal and vegetable — may pass from a responsive to an
        irresponsive condition, from which latter there may or may not
        be subsequent revival. </p>
      <p>Hitherto, as already said, electrical response in animals has
        been regarded as a purely physiological phenomenon. We have
        proved by various tests that response in plants is of the same
        character. And we have seen that by physiological phenomena are
        generally understood those of which no physical explanation can
        be offered, they being supposed to be due to the play of some
        unknown vital force existing in living substances and giving
        rise to electric response to stimulation as one of its
        manifestations. </p>
      <p><i>Is response found in inorganic substances? </i>[14] — It is
        now for us, however, to examine into the alleged super-physical
        character of these phenomena by stimulating inorganic substances
        and discovering whether they do or do not give rise to the same
        electrical mode of response which was supposed to be the special
        characteristic of living substances. We shall use the same
        apparatus and the same mode of stimulation as those employed in
        obtaining plant response, merely substituting, for the stalk of
        a plant, a metallic wire, say ‘tin’ (fig. 50). Any other metal
        could be used instead of tin. </p>
      <p><i>Experiment on tin, block method.</i> — Let us then take a
        piece of tin wire[15] from which all strains have been
        previously removed by annealing, and hold it clamped in the
        middle at C. If the strains have been successfully removed A and
        B will be found iso-electric, and no current will pass through
        the galvanometer. If A and B are not exactly similar, there will
        be a slight current. But this will not materially affect the
        results to be described presently, the slight existing current
        merely adding itself algebraically to the current of response. </p>
      <p>If we now stimulate the end A by taps, or better&nbsp; still by
        torsional vibration, a transitory ‘current of action’ will be
        found to flow in the wire from B to A, from the unstimulated to
        the stimulated, and in the galvanometer from the stimulated to
        the unstimulated. Stimulation of B will give rise to a current
        in an opposite direction. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 50.—Electric Response in Metals</b> </p>

      </center>
      <p>(a) Method of block; (b) Equal and opposite responses when the
        ends A and B are stimulated; the dotted portions of the curves
        show recovery; (c) Balancing effect when both the ends are
        stimulated simultaneously. </p>
      <p><i>Experiment to exhibit the balancing effect.</i> — If the
        wire has been carefully annealed, the molecular condition of its
        different portions is found to be approximately the same. If
        such a wire be held at the ‘balancing point’ (which is at or
        near the middle) by the clamp, and a quick vibration, say, of
        90° be given to A, an upward deflection will be produced; if a
        vibration of 90° be given to B, there will be an equal downward
        deflection. If now both the ends A and B are vibrated
        simultaneously, the responsive E.M. variation at the two ends
        will continuously balance each other and the galvanometer spot
        will remain quiescent (fig. 30, A, B, R). This balance will be
        still maintained when the block is removed and the wire is
        vibrated as a whole. It is to be remembered that with the length
        of wire constant,&nbsp; the intensity of stimulus increases with
        the amplitude of vibration. Again, keeping the amplitude
        constant, the intensity of stimulus is increased by shortening
        the wire. Hence it will be seen that if the clamp be shifted
        from the balancing point towards A, simultaneous vibration of A
        and B through 90° will now give a resultant upward deflection,
        showing that the A response is now relatively stronger. Thus
        keeping the rest of the circuit untouched, merely moving the
        clamp from the left, past the balancing point to the right, we
        get either a positive, or zero, or negative, resultant effect. </p>
      <p>In tin the current of response is from the less to the more
        excited point. In the retina also, we found the current of
        action flowing from the less stimulated to the more stimulated,
        and as that is known as a positive response, we shall consider
        the normal response of tin to be in like manner positive. </p>
      <p>Just as the response of retina or nerve, under certain
        molecular conditions, undergoes reversal, the positive being
        then converted into negative, and negative into positive, so it
        will be shown that the response in metallic wires under certain
        conditions is found to undergo reversal. </p>
      <p><i>Anomalies of present terminology. </i>— When there is no
        current of injury, a particular current of response can hardly
        be called a negative, or positive, variation. Such nomenclature
        is purely arbitrary, and leads, as will be shown, to much
        confusion. A more definite terminology, free from
        misunderstanding, would be, as already said, to regard the
        current towards the more stimulated as positive, and that
        towards the less stimulated, in tissue or wire, as negative. </p>
      <p>The stimulated end of tin, say the end A, thus becomes&nbsp;
        zincoid, i.e. the current through the electrolyte
        (non-polarisable electrodes with interposed galvanometer) is
        from A to B, and through the wire, from the less stimulated B to
        the more stimulated A. Conversely, when B is stimulated, the
        action current flows round the circuit in an opposite direction.
        This positive is the most usual form of response, but there are
        cases where the response is negative. </p>
      <p>In order to show that normally speaking a stimulated wire
        becomes zincoid, and also to show once more the anomalies into
        which we may fall by adopting no more definite terminology than
        that of negative variation, I have devised the following
        experiment (fig. 51). Let us take a bar, one half of which is
        zinc and the other half copper, clamped in the middle, so that a
        disturbance produced at one end may not reach the other; the two
        ends are connected to a galvanometer through non-polarisable
        electrodes. The current through the electrolyte (non-polarisable
        electrodes and interposed galvanometer) will then flow from left
        to right. We must remember that metals under stimulation
        generally become, in an electrical sense, more zinc-like. On
        vibrating the copper end (inasmuch as copper would then become
        more zinc-like) the difference of potential between zinc and
        copper ought to be diminished, and the current flowing in the
        circuit would therefore be lessened. But vibration of the zinc
        end ought to increase the potential difference, and there ought
        to be then an increase of current during stimulation of zinc. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 51.—Current of Response towards the Stimulated End</b>
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig051.jpg" width="297" height="225"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Hence when Cu stimulated: action current ?, normal E.M.F.
        diminished (·85-·009) V. </p>
      <p>When Zn stimulated: action current ?, normal E.M.F. increased
        (·85 + ·013) V. </p>
      <p>In the particular experiment of fig. 51, the E.M.F. between the
        zinc and copper ends was found to be ·85 volt. This was balanced
        by a potentiometer arrangement, so that the galvanometer spot
        came to zero. On vibrating the zinc wire, a deflection of 33
        dns. was obtained, in a direction which&nbsp; showed an increase
        of E.M.F. On stopping the vibration, the spot of light came back
        to zero. On now vibrating the copper wire, a deflection of 23
        dns. was obtained in an opposite direction, showing a diminution
        of E.M.F. This transitory responsive variation disappeared on
        the cessation of disturbance. </p>
      <p>By disturbing the balance of the potentiometer, the
        galvanometer deflection due to a known increase of E.M.F. was
        found from which the absolute E.M. variation caused by
        disturbance of copper or zinc was determined. </p>
      <p>It was thus found that stimulation of zinc had increased the
        P.D. by fifteen parts in 1,000, whereas stimulation of copper
        had decreased it by eleven parts in 1,000. According to the old
        terminology, the response due to stimulation of zinc would have
        been regarded as positive variation, that of copper negative.
        The responses however are not essentially opposite in character,
        the action current in the bar being in both cases towards the
        more excited. For this reason it would be preferable, as already
        said, to employ the terms positive and negative in the sense I
        have suggested, i.e. positive, when the current in the acted
        substance is towards the more excited, and negative, when
        towards the less excited. The method of block is, as I have
        already shown, the most perfect for the study of these
        responses. </p>
      <p>In the experiment fig. 50, if the block is abolished and the
        wire is struck in the middle, a wave of molecular disturbance
        will reach A and B. The mechanical and the attendant electrical
        disturbance will at these points reach a maximum and then
        gradually subside. The resultant effect in the galvanometer will
        be due to EA-EB when EA and EB are the electrical variations
        produced at A and B by the stimulus. The electric changes at A
        and B will continuously balance each other, and the resultant
        effect on the galvanometer will be zero: (a) if&nbsp; the
        exciting disturbance reaches A and B at the same time and with
        the same intensity; (b) if the molecular condition is similar at
        the two points; and (c) if the rate of rise and subsidence of
        excitation is the same at the two points. In order that a
        resultant effect may be exhibited in the galvanometer, matters
        have to be so arranged that the disturbance may reach one point,
        say A, and not B, and vice versa. This was accomplished by means
        of a clamp, in the method of block. Again a resultant
        differential action may be obtained even when the disturbance
        reaches both A and B, if the electrical excitability of one
        point is exalted or depressed by physical or chemical means. We
        shall in Chap. XVI study in detail the effect of chemical
        reagents in producing the enhancement or depression of
        excitability. There are thus two other means of obtaining a
        resultant effect — (2) by the method of relative depression, (3)
        by the method of relative exaltation. </p>
      <p><i>Electric response by method of depression.</i> — We may thus
        by reducing or abolishing the excitability of one end by means
        of suitable chemical reagents (so-called method of injury)
        obtain response in metals without a block. The entire length of
        the wire may then be stimulated and a resultant response will be
        produced, owing to the difference between the excitability of
        the two ends. A piece of tin wire is taken, and one normal
        contact is made at A (strip of cloth moistened with water, or
        very dilute salt solution). The excitability of B is depressed
        by a few drops of strong potash or oxalic acid. By the
        application of the latter there will be a small P.D. between A
        and B; this will simply&nbsp; produce a displacement of zero. By
        means of a potentiometer the galvanometer spot may be brought
        back to the original position. The shifting of the zero will not
        affect the general result. The effect of mechanical stimulus is
        to produce a transient electro-motive response, which will be
        superposed algebraically on the existing P.D. The deflection
        will take place from the modified zero to which the spot returns
        during recovery. On now stimulating the wire as a whole by, say,
        torsional vibration, the current of response will be found
        towards the more excitable, i.e. from B to A (fig. 52, a). </p>

      <p>When the wire is stimulated as a whole the current of response
        is towards the more excitable. </p>
      <p>In (a) A is a normal contact, B has been depressed by oxalic
        acid; current of response is towards the more excitable A. </p>
      <p>In (b) the same wire is used, only A is depressed by oxalic
        acid and a normal contact is made at a fresh point B?, a little
        to the left of B in (a). Current of response is now from A
        towards the more excitable B?. </p>
      <p>A corroborative reversal experiment may next be made on the
        same piece of wire. The normal contact, through water or salt
        solution, is now made at B?, a little to the left of B. The
        excitability of A is now depressed by oxalic acid. On
        stimulation of the whole wire, the current of response will now
        be found to flow in an opposite direction—i.e. from A to B?—but
        still from the relatively less to the relatively more excitable
        (fig. 52, b). </p>
      <p>From these experiments it will be seen how in one identical
        piece of wire the responsive current flows now in one direction
        and then in the other, in absolute conformity with theoretical
        considerations. </p>

      </center>
      <p>The contact B is made more excitable by chemical stimulant
        (Na2CO3). The current of response is towards the more excitable
        B. </p>
      <p><i>Method of exaltation.</i> — A still more striking
        corroboration of these results may, however, be obtained by the
        converse process of relative exaltation of the responsiveness of
        one contact. This may be accomplished by touching one contact,
        say B, with a reagent which like Na2CO3 exalts the electric
        excitability. On stimulation of the wire, the current of
        response is towards the more excitable B (fig. 53). </p>
      <p>I give four records (fig. 54) which will clearly exhibit the
        responses as obtained by the methods of relative depression or
        exaltation. In (a) B is touched with the excitant Na2CO3, a
        permanent current flows from A to B, response to stimulus is in
        the same direction as the permanent current (positive
        variation). In (b) B is touched with a trace of the depressant
        oxalic acid, the permanent current is in the same direction as
        before, but the current of response is in the opposite direction
        (negative variation). In (c) B is touched with dilute KOH, the
        response is exhibited by a positive variation. In (d) B is
        touched with strong KOH, the response is now exhibited by a
        negative variation. The last two results, apparently anomalous,
        are due to the fact, which will be demonstrated later, that KOH
        in minute quantities is an excitant, while in large quantities
        it is a depressant. </p>

      </p>
      <p>We have thus seen that we may obtain response (1) by block
        method, (2) by the method of injury, or relative depression of
        responsiveness of one contact, and (3) by the method of relative
        exaltation of responsiveness of one contact. In all these cases
        alike we obtain a consistent action current, which in tin is
        normally positive, or towards the relatively more excited. </p>

          stimulus — Considerations showing that electric response is
          due to molecular disturbance — Test experiment — Molecular
          voltaic cell.</i> </p>
      <p>We have already seen that metals respond to stimulus by E.M.
        variation, just as do animal and vegetable tissues. We have yet
        to see whether the similarity extends to this point only, or
        goes still further, whether the response-curves of living and in
        organic are alike, and whether the inorganic response-curve is
        modified, as living response was found to be, by the influence
        of external agencies. If so, are the modifications similar? What
        are the effects of superposition of stimuli? Is there fatigue?
        If there be, in what way does it affect the curves? And lastly,
        is the response of metals exalted or depressed by the action of
        chemical reagents? </p>
      <p><i>Conditions of obtaining quantitative measurements. </i>— In
        order to carry out these investigations, it is necessary to
        remove all sources of uncertainty, and obtain quantitative
        measurements. Many difficulties at first presented themselves in
        the course of this attempt, but they were&nbsp; completely
        removed by the adoption of the following experimental
        modification. In the simple arrangement for qualitative
        demonstration of response in metals previously described,
        successive experiments will not give results which are strictly
        comparable (1) unless the resistance of the circuit be
        maintained constant. This would necessitate the adoption of some
        plan for keeping the electrolytic contacts at A and B absolutely
        invariable. There should then be no chance of any shifting or
        variation of contact. (2) There must also be some means of
        applying successive stimuli of equal intensity. (3) And for
        certain further experiments it will be necessary to have some
        way of gradually increasing or decreasing the stimuli in a
        definite manner. </p>
      <p><i>Modification of the block method.</i> — By consideration of
        the following experimental modifications of the block method
        (fig. 55), it will be found easy to construct a perfected form
        of apparatus, in which all these conditions are fully met. The
        essentials to be kept in mind were the introduction of a
        complete block midway in the wire, so that the disturbance of
        one half should be prevented from reaching the other, and the
        making of a perfect electrolytic contact for the electrodes
        leading to the galvanometer. </p>
      <p>Starting from the simple arrangement previously described where
        a straight wire is clamped in the middle (fig. 55, a), we next
        arrive at (b). Here the wire A B is placed in a U tube and
        clamped in the middle by a tightly fitting cork. Melted paraffin
        wax is poured to a certain depth in the bend of the tube. The
        two&nbsp; limbs of the tube are now filled with water, till the
        ends A and B are completely immersed. Connection is made with
        the non-polarisable electrodes by the side tubes. Vibration may
        be imparted to either A or B by means of ebonite clip holders
        seen at the upper ends A B of the wire. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 55.—Successive Modifications of the Block Method from
          the ‘Straight Wire’ (a) to ‘Cell Form’ (e)</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig055.jpg" width="450" height="410"></p>
      </center>
      <p>When A is excited, current of response in the wire is from less
        excited B to more excited A. Note that though the current of
        response is constant in direction, the galvanometer deflection
        in (d) will be opposite to that in (b). </p>
      <p>It will be seen that the two limbs of the tube filled with
        water serve the purpose of the strip of moistened cloth used in
        the last experiment to make electric connections with the
        leading-out electrodes—with the advantage that we have here no
        chance of any shifting of contact or variation of surface, the
        contact between&nbsp; the wire and the surrounding liquid being
        perfect and invariable. </p>
      <p>On now vibrating the end A of the tin wire by means of the
        ebonite clip holder, a current will be found to flow from B to A
        through the wire—that is to say, towards the excited—and from A
        to B in the galvanometer. </p>
      <p>The next modification (c) is to transfer the galvanometer from
        the electrolytic to the metallic part of the circuit, that is to
        say, it is interposed in a gap made by cutting the wire A B, the
        upper part of the circuit being directly connected by the
        electrolyte. Vibration of A will now give rise to a current of
        response which flows in the metallic part of the circuit with
        the interposed galvanometer from B to A. We see that though the
        direction of the current in this is the same as in the last
        case, yet the galvanometer deflection is now reversed, for the
        evident reason that we have it interposed in the metallic and
        not in the electrolytic part of the circuit. </p>
      <p>The next arrangement (d) consists simply of the preceding
        placed upside down. Here A and B are held parallel to each other
        in an electrolytic bath (water). Mechanical vibration may now be
        applied to A without affecting B, and vice versa. </p>
      <p>The actual apparatus, of which this is a diagrammatic
        representation, is seen in (e). </p>
      <p>Two pieces, from the same specimen of wire, are clamped
        separately at their lower ends by means of ebonite screws, in an
        L-shaped piece of ebonite. The wires are fixed at their upper
        ends to two electrodes — leading to the galvanometer — and kept
        moderately and uniformly stretched by spiral springs. The
        handle, by which a torsional vibration is imparted to the wire,
        may be slipped over either electrode. The amplitude of vibration
        is measured by means of a graduated circle. </p>
      <p>It will be seen from these arrangements: </p>
      <p>(1) That the cell depicted in (e) is essentially the same as
        that in (a). </p>
      <p>(2) That the wires in the cell being immersed to a definite
        depth in the electrolyte there is always a perfect and
        invariable contact between the wire and the electrolyte. The
        difficulty as regards variation of contact is thus eliminated. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 56.—Equal and Opposite Responses exhibited by A and B</b>
      </p>

        <p><img src="fig056.jpg" width="250" height="246"></p>
      </center>
      <p>(3) That as the wires A and B are clamped separately below, we
        may impart a sudden molecular disturbance to either A or B by
        giving a quick to-and-fro (torsional) vibration round the
        vertical wire, as axis, by means of the handle. As the wire A is
        separate from B, disturbance of one will not affect the other.
        Vibration of A produces a current in one direction, vibration of
        B in the opposite direction. Thus we have means of verifying
        every experiment by obtaining corroborative and reversed
        effects. When the two wires have been brought to exactly the
        same molecular condition by the&nbsp; processes of annealing or
        stretching, the effects obtained on subjecting A or B to any
        given stimulus are always equal (fig. 56). </p>
      <p>Usually I interpose an external resistance varying from one to
        five megohms according to the sensitiveness of the wire. The
        resistance of the electrolyte in the cell is thus relatively
        small, and the galvanometer deflections are proportional to the
        E.M. variations. It is always advisable to have a high external
        resistance, as by this means one is not only able to keep the
        deflections within the scale, but one is not troubled by slight
        accidental disturbances. </p>
      <p>Graduation of intensity of stimulus. — If now a rapid torsional
        vibration be given to A or B, an E.M. variation will be induced.
        If the amplitude of vibration be kept constant, successive
        responses—in substances which, like tin, show no fatigue—will be
        found to be absolutely identical. But as ‘the amplitude of
        vibration’ is increased, response will also become enhanced (see
        Chap. XV). </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 57.—Top View of the Vibration Cell</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig057.jpg" width="250" height="240"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The amplitude of vibration is determined by means of movable
        stops S S?, fixed to the edge of the graduated circle G. The
        index arm I plays between the stops. (The second index arm,
        connected with B, and the second circle are not shown.) </p>
      <p>Amplitude of vibration is measured by means of the graduated
        circle (fig. 57). A projecting index, in connection with the
        vibration-head, plays between fixed and sliding stops (S and
        S?), one at the zero point of the scale, and the other
        movable.&nbsp; The amplitude of a given vibration can thus be
        predetermined by the adjustment of the sliding stop. In this way
        we can obtain either uniform or definitely graduated stimuli. </p>
      <p>Considerations showing that electric response is due to
        molecular disturbance.—The electromotive variation varies with
        the substance. With superposition of stimuli, a relatively high
        value is obtained in tin, amounting sometimes to nearly half a
        volt, whereas in silver the electromotive variation is only
        about ·01 of this value. The intensity of the response, however,
        does not depend on the chemical activity of the substance, for
        the electromotive variation in the relatively chemically
        inactive tin is greater than that of zinc. Again, the sign of
        response, positive or negative, is sometimes modified by the
        molecular condition of the wire (see Chap. XII). </p>
      <p>As regards the electrolyte, dilute NaCl solution, dilute
        solution of bichromate of potash &amp;c. are normal in their
        action, that is to say, the electric response in such
        electrolytes is practically the same as with water. Ordinarily I
        use tap-water as the electrolyte. Zinc wires in ZnSO4 solution
        give responses similar in character to those given by, for
        example, Pt or Sn in water. </p>
      <p><i>Test experiment.</i> — It may be urged that the E.M. effect
        is due in some way (1) to the friction of the vibrating wire
        against the liquid; or (2) to some unknown surface action, at
        the point in the wire of the contact of liquid and air surfaces.
        This second objection has already been completely met in experi
        mental modification, fig. 55, b, where the wire was shown to
        give response when kept completely immersed in water, variation
        of surface being thus entirely eliminated. </p>
      <p>Both these questions may, however, be subjected to a definite
        and final test. When the wire to be acted on is clamped below,
        and vibration is imparted to it, a strong molecular disturbance
        is produced. If now it be carefully released from the clamp, and
        the wire rotated backwards and forwards, there could be little
        molecular disturbance, but the liquid friction and surface
        variation, if any, would remain. The effect of any slight
        disturbance outstanding owing to shaking of the wire would be
        relatively very small. </p>
      <p>We can thus determine the effect of liquid friction and surface
        action by repeating an experiment with and without clamping. In
        a tin wire cell, with interposed external resistance equal to
        one million ohms, the wire A was subjected to a series of
        vibrations through 180°, and a deflection of 210 divisions was
        obtained. A corresponding negative deflection resulted on
        vibrating the wire B. Now A was released from the clamp, so that
        it could be rotated backwards and forwards in the water by means
        of the handle. On vibrating the wire A no measurable deflection
        was produced, thus showing that neither water friction nor
        surface variation had anything to do with the electric action.
        The vibration of the still clamped B gave rise to the normal
        strong deflection. </p>
      <p>As all the rest of the circuit was kept absolutely the same in
        the two different sets of experiments, these&nbsp; results
        conclusively prove that the responsive electro-motive variation
        is solely due to the molecular disturbance produced by
        mechanical vibration in the acted wire. </p>
      <p>A new and theoretically interesting molecular voltaic cell may
        thus be made, in which the two elements consist of the same
        metal. Molecular disturbance is in this case the main source of
        energy. A cell once made may be kept in working order for some
        time by pouring in a little vaseline to prevent evaporation of
        the liquid. </p>
      <p>It will be shown further, in succeeding chapters, by numerous
        instances, that any conditions which increase molecular mobility
        will also increase intensity of response, and conversely that
        any conditions having the reverse effect will depress response.

            RESULTS</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Preparation of wire — Effect of single stimulus.</i> </p>
      <p>I shall now proceed to describe in detail the response-curves
        obtained with metals. The E.M. variations resulting from
        stimulus range, as has been said, from ·4 volt to ·01 of that
        value, according to the metal employed. And as these are
        molecular phenomena, the effect will also depend on the
        molecular condition of the wire. </p>
      <p><i>Preparation of wire. </i>— In order to have our results
        thoroughly consistent, it is necessary to bring the wire itself
        into a normal condition for experiment. The very fact of
        mounting it in the cell strains it, and the after-effect of this
        strain may cause irregularities in the response. </p>
      <p>For the purpose of bringing the wire to this normal state, one
        or all of the following devices may be used with advantage. (1)
        The wires obtained are usually wound on spools. It is,
        therefore, advisable to straighten any given length, before
        mounting, by holding it stretched, and rubbing it up and down
        with a piece of cloth. On washing with water, they are now ready
        for mounting in the cell. </p>
      <p>(2) The cell is usually filled with tap-water, and a period of
        rest after making up, generally speaking, improves the
        sensitiveness. These expedients are ordinarily sufficient, but
        it occasionally happens that the wire has got into an abnormal
        condition. </p>

      <p>Stimuli (vibration of 160°) applied at intervals of one minute.
      </p>
      <p>In this case it will be found helpful (3) to have recourse to
        the process of annealing. For if response be a molecular
        phenomenon, then anything that increases molecular mobility will
        also increase its intensity. Hence we may expect annealing to
        enhance responsiveness. This inference will be seen verified in
        the record given in fig. 58. In the case under consideration,
        the convenient method employed was by pouring hot water into the
        cell, and allowing it to stand and cool slowly. The first three
        pairs of responses were taken by stimulating A and B
        alternately, on mounting in the cell, which was filled with
        water. Hot water was then substituted, and the cell was&nbsp;
        allowed to cool down to its original temperature. The six
        following pairs of responses were then taken. That this
        beneficial effect of annealing was not due to any accidental
        circumstance will be seen from the fact that both wires have
        their sensitiveness equally enhanced. </p>
      <p>(4) In addition to this mode of annealing, both wires may be
        short-circuited and vibrated for a time. Lastly (5) slight
        stretching in situ will also sometimes be found beneficial. For
        this purpose I have a screw arrangement. </p>
      <p>By one or all of these methods, with a little practice, it is
        always possible to bring the wires to a normal condition. The
        responses subsequently obtained become extraordinarily
        consistent. There is therefore no reason why perfect results
        should not be arrived at. </p>

      <p><i>Effect of single stimulus.</i> — The accompanying figure
        (fig. 59) gives a series, each of which is the response curve
        for a single stimulus of uniform intensity, the amplitude of
        vibration being kept constant. The perfect regularity of
        responses will be noticed in this figure. The wire after a long
        period of rest may be in an abnormal condition, but after a
        short period of stimulation the responses become extremely
        regular, as may be noticed in this figure. Tin is, usually
        speaking, almost indefatigable, and I have often obtained
        several hundreds of successive responses showing practically no
        fatigue. In the figure it will be noticed that the rising
        portion&nbsp; of the curve is somewhat steep, and the recovery
        convex to the abscissa, the fall being relatively rapid in its
        first, and less rapid in its later, parts. As the electric
        variation is the concomitant effect of molecular disturbance—a
        temporary upset of the molecular equilibrium—on the cessation of
        the external stimulus, the excitatory state, and its expression
        in electric variation, disappear with the return of the
        molecules to their condition of equilibrium. This process is
        seen clearly in the curve of recovery. </p>
      <p>Different metals exhibit different periods of recovery, and
        this again is modified by any influence which affects the
        molecular condition. </p>
      <p>That the excitatory state persists for a time even on the
        cessation of stimulus can be independently shown by keeping the
        galvanometer circuit open during the application of stimulus,
        and completing it at various short intervals after the
        cessation, when a persisting electrical effect, diminishing
        rapidly with time, will be apparent. The rate of recovery
        immediately on the cessation of stimulus is rather rapid, but
        traces of strain persist for a short time. </p>

      <p><i>Effects of molecular inertia — Prolongation of period of
          recovery by overstrain — Molecular model — Reduction of
          molecular sluggishness attended by quickened recovery and
          heightened response — Effect of temperature — Modification of
          latent period and period of recovery by the action of chemical
          reagents — Diphasic variation.</i> </p>
      <p>We have seen that the stimulation of matter causes an electric
        variation, and that the acted substance gradually recovers from
        the effect of stimulus. We shall next study how the form of
        response-curves is modified by various agencies. </p>
      <p>In order to study these effects we must use, in practice, a
        highly sensitive galvanometer as the recorder of E.M.
        variations. This necessitates the use of an instrument with a
        comparatively long period of swing of needle, or of suspended
        coil (as in a D’Arsonval). Owing to inertia of the recording
        galvanometer, however, there is a lag produced in the records of
        E.M. changes. But this can be distinguished from the effect of
        the molecular inertia of the substance itself by comparing two
        successive records taken with the same instrument, in one of
        which the latter effect is relatively absent, and in the other
        present. We wish, for example, to find out&nbsp; whether the
        E.M. effect of mechanical stimulus is instantaneous, or, again,
        whether the effect disappears immediately. We first take a
        galvanometer record of the sudden introduction and cessation of
        an E.M.F. on the circuit containing the vibration-cell (fig. 60,
        a). We then take a record of the E.M. effect produced by a
        stimulus caused by a single torsional vibration. In order to
        make the conditions of the two experiments as similar as
        possible, the disturbing E.M.F., from a potentiometer, is
        previously adjusted to give a deflection nearly equal to that
        caused by stimulus. The torsional vibration was accomplished in
        a quarter of a second, and the contact with the potentiometer
        circuit was also made for the same length of time. </p>

      <p>(a) Arrangement for applying a short-lived E.M.F. <br>
        (b) Difference in the periods of recovery: (1) from
        instantaneous E.M.F.; and (2) that caused by mechanical
        stimulus. </p>
      <p>The record was then taken as follows. The recording drum had a
        fast speed of six inches in a minute, one of the small
        subdivisions representing a second. The battery contact in the
        main potentiometer circuit was made for a quarter of a second as
        just mentioned and a record taken of the effect of a short-lived
        E.M.F.&nbsp; on the circuit containing the cell. (2) A record
        was next taken of the E.M. variation produced in the cell by a
        single stimulus. It will be seen on comparison of the two
        records that the maximum effect took place relatively later in
        the case of mechanical stimulus, and that whereas the
        galvanometer recovery in the former case took place in 11
        seconds, the recovery in the latter was not complete till after
        60 seconds (fig. 60, b). This shows that it takes some time for
        the effect of stimulus to attain its maximum, and that the
        effect does not disappear till after the lapse of a certain
        interval. The time of recovery from strain depends on the
        intensity of stimulus. It takes a longer time to recover from a
        stronger stimulus. But, other things being equal, successive
        recovery periods from successive stimulations of equal intensity
        are, generally speaking, the same. </p>
      <p>We may now study the influence of any change in external
        conditions by observing the modifications it produces in the
        normal curve. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Recovery is complete in 60? when the stimulus is due to 20°
        vibration. But with stronger stimulus of 40° vibration, the
        period of recovery is prolonged to 90?. </p>
      <p><i>Prolongation of period of recovery by overstrain.</i> — The
        pair of records given in fig. 61 shows how&nbsp; recovery is
        delayed, as the effect of overstrain. Curve (a) is for a single
        stimulus due to a vibration of amplitude 20°, and curve (b) for
        a stimulus of 40° amplitude of vibration. It will be noticed how
        relatively prolonged is the recovery in the latter case. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 62.—Model showing the Effect of Friction</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig062.jpg" width="400" height="385"></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Molecular Model.</i> — We have seen that the electric
        response is an outward expression of the molecular disturbance
        produced by the action of the stimulus. The rising part of the
        response-curve thus exhibits the effect of molecular upset, and
        the falling part, or recovery, the restoration to equilibrium.
        The mechanical model (fig. 62) will help us to visualise many
        complex response phenomena. The molecular model consists of a
        torsional pendulum—a wire with a dependent sphere. By the
        stimulus of a blow there is produced a torsional vibration—a
        response followed by recovery. The writing lever attached to the
        pendulum records&nbsp; the response-curves. The form of these
        curves, stimulus remaining constant, will be modified by
        friction; the less the friction, the greater is the mobility.
        The friction may be varied by more or less raising a vessel of
        sand touching the pendulum. By varying the friction the
        following curves were obtained. </p>
      <p>(a) When there is little friction we get an after-oscillation,
        to which we have the corresponding phenomenon in the retinal
        after-oscillation (compare fig. 105). </p>
      <p>(b and c) If the friction is increased, there is a damping of
        oscillation. In (c) we get recovery-curves similar to those
        found in nerve, muscle, plant, and metal. </p>
      <p>(d) If the friction is still further increased the maximum is
        reached much later, as will be seen in the increasing slant of
        the rising part of the curve; the height of response is
        diminished and the period of recovery very much prolonged by
        partial molecular arrest. The curve (d) is very similar to the
        ‘molecular arrest’ curve obtained by small dose of chemical
        reagents which act as ‘poison’ on living tissue or on metals
        (compare fig. 93, a). </p>
      <p>(e) When the molecular mobility is further decreased there is
        no recovery (compare fig. 93, b). </p>
      <p>Still further increase of friction completely arrests the
        molecular pendulum, and there is no response. </p>
      <p>From what has been said, it will be seen that if in any way the
        friction is diminished or mobility increased the response will
        be enhanced. This is well exemplified in the heightened response
        after annealing (fig. 58) and after preliminary vibration (figs.
        81, 82). </p>
      <p>Possibly connected with this may be the increased responses
        exhibited by the action of stimulants (figs. 89, 90). </p>
      <p>Reduction of molecular sluggishness attended (1) by quickened
        recovery.—Sometimes, after a cell has been resting for too long
        a period, especially on cold days, the wire gets into a sluggish
        condition, and the period of recovery is thereby prolonged. But
        successive vibrations gradually remove this inertness, and
        recovery is then hastened. This is shown in the accompanying
        curves, fig. 63, where (a) exhibits only very partial recovery
        even after the expiration of 60 seconds, whereas when a few
        vibrations had been given recovery was entirely completed in 47
        seconds (b). There was here little change in the height of
        response. </p>

      <p>(a) Slow recovery of a wire in a sluggish condition. <br>
        (b) Quickened recovery in the same wire after a few vibrations.
      </p>
      <p>Or (2) by heightened response. — The removal of sluggishness by
        vibration, resulting in increased molecular mobility, is in
        other instances attended by increase in the height of response,
        as will be seen from the two sets of records which follow (fig.
        64). Cold, due to prevailing frosty weather, had made the wires
        in the cell somewhat lethargic. The records in (a) were&nbsp;
        the first taken on the day of the experiment. The amplitudes of
        vibration were 45°, 90°, and 135°. In (b) are given the records
        of the next series, which are in every case greater than those
        of (a). This shows that previous vibration, by conferring
        increased mobility, had heightened the response. In this case,
        removal of molecular sluggishness is attended by greater
        intensity of response, without much change in the period of
        recovery. In connection with this it must be remembered that
        greater strain consequent on heightened response has a general
        tendency to a prolongation of the period of recovery. </p>

      <p>(a) Three sets of responses for 45°, 90°, and 135° vibration in
        a sluggish wire. <br>
        (b)The next three sets of responses in the same wire; increased
        mobility conferred by previous vibration has heightened the
        response. </p>
      <p>It is thus seen that when the wire is in a sluggish condition,
        successive vibrations confer increased molecular mobility, which
        finds expression in quickened recovery or heightened response. </p>
      <p><i>Effect of temperature.</i> — Similar considerations lead us
        to expect that a moderate rise of temperature will be conducive
        to increase of response. This is exhibited in&nbsp; the next
        series of records. The wire at the low temperature of 5° C.
        happened to be in a sluggish condition, and the responses to
        vibrations of 45° to 90° in amplitude were feeble. Tepid water
        at 30° C. was now substituted for the cold water in the cell,
        and the responses underwent a remarkable enhancement. But the
        excessive molecular disturbance caused by the high temperature
        of 90° C. produced a great diminution of response (fig. 65). </p>

          and 90°</b> </p>

        temperature of 5° C. <br>
        (b) Enhanced response at 30° C. <br>
        (c) Diminution of response at 90° C. </p>
      <p><i>Diphasic variation.</i> — It has already been said that if
        two points A and B are in the same physico-chemical condition,
        then a given stimulus will give rise to similar excitatory
        electric effects at the two points. If the&nbsp; galvanometer
        deflection is ‘up’ when A alone is excited, the excitation of B
        will give rise to a downward deflection. When the two points are
        simultaneously excited the electric variation at the two points
        will continuously balance each other. Under such conditions
        there will be no resultant deflection. But if the intensity of
        stimulation of one point is relatively stronger, then the
        balance will be disturbed, and a resultant deflection produced
        whose sign and magnitude can be found independently by the
        algebraical summation of the individual effects of A and B. </p>
      <p>It has also been shown that a balancing point for the block,
        which is approximately near the middle of the wire, may be found
        so that the vibrations of A and B through the same amplitude
        produce equal and opposite deflection. Simultaneous vibration of
        both will give no resultant current; when the block is abolished
        and the wire is vibrated as a whole, there will still be no
        resultant, inasmuch as similar excitations are produced at A and
        B. </p>
      <p>After obtaining the balance, if we apply an exciting reagent
        like Na2CO3 at one point, and a depressing reagent like KBr at
        the other, the responses will now become unequal, the more
        excitable point giving a stronger deflection. We can, however,
        make the two deflections equal by increasing the amplitude of
        vibration of the less sensitive point. The two deflections may
        thus be rendered equal and opposite, but the time relations—the
        latent period, the time rate for attaining the maximum
        excitation and recovery from that effect—will no longer be the
        same in the two cases. There would therefore&nbsp; be no
        continuous balance, and we obtain instead a very interesting
        diphasic record. I give below an exact reproduction of the
        response-curves of A and B recorded on a fast-moving drum. It
        will be remembered that one point was touched with Na2CO3 and
        the other with KBr. By suitably increasing the amplitude of
        vibration of the less sensitive, the two deflections were
        rendered approximately equal. The records of A and B were at
        first taken separately (fig. 66, a). It will be noticed that the
        maximum deflection of A was attained relatively&nbsp; much
        earlier than that of B. The resultant curve R? was obtained by
        summation. </p>

      <p>(a) Records of A and B obtained separately. R? is the resultant
        by algebraical summation. (b) Diphasic record obtained by
        simultaneous stimulation of A and B. </p>
      <p>After taking the records of A and B separately, a record of
        resultant effect R due to simultaneous vibration of A and B was
        next taken. It gave the curious two-phased response—positive
        effect followed by negative after-vibration, practically similar
        to the resultant curve R? (fig. 66, b). </p>
      <p>The positive portion of the curve is due to A effect and the
        negative to B. If by any means, say by either increasing the
        amplitude of vibration of A or increasing its sensitiveness, the
        response of A is very greatly enhanced, then the positive effect
        would be predominant and the negative effect would become
        inconspicuous. When the two constituent responses are of the
        same order of magnitude, we shall have a positive response
        followed by a negative after-vibration; the first twitch will
        belong to the one which responds earlier. If the response of A
        is very much reduced, then the positive effect will be reduced
        to a mere twitch and the negative effect will become
        predominant. </p>
      <p>I give a series of records, fig. 67, in which these three
        principal types are well exhibited, the two contacts having been
        rendered unequally excitable by solutions of the two reagents
        KBr and Na2CO3. A and B were vibrated simultaneously and records
        taken. (a) First, the relative response of B (downward) is
        increased by increasing its amplitude of vibration. The
        amplitude of vibration of A was throughout maintained constant.
        The negative or downward response is now very conspicuous, there
        being only a mere preliminary indication&nbsp; of the positive
        effect. (b) The amplitude of vibration of B is now slightly
        reduced, and we obtain the diphasic effect. (c) The intensity of
        vibration of B is diminished still further, and the negative
        effect is seen reduced to a slight downward after-vibration, the
        positive up-curve being now very prominent (fig. 67). </p>

      <p><i>Continuous transformation from negative to positive.</i> — I
        have shown the three phases of transformation, the intensity of
        one of the constituent responses being varied by altering the
        intensity of disturbance. </p>
      <p>In the following record (fig. 68) I succeeded in obtaining a
        continuous transformation from positive to negative phase by a
        continuous change in the relative sensitiveness of the two
        contacts. </p>
      <p>I found that traces of after-effect due to the application of
        Na2CO3 remain for a time. If the reagent is previously applied
        to an area and the traces of the&nbsp; carbonate then washed
        off, the increased sensitiveness conferred disappears gradually.
        Again, if we apply Na2CO3 solution to a fresh point, the
        sensitiveness gradually increases. There is another further
        interesting point to be noticed: the beginning of response is
        earlier when the application of Na2CO3 is fresh. </p>

      <p>Thick dots represent the times of application of successive
        stimuli. </p>
      <p>We have thus a wire held at one end, and successive uniform
        vibrations at intervals of one minute imparted to the wire as a
        whole, by means of a vibration head on the other end. </p>
      <p>Owing to the after-effect of previous application of Na2CO3 the
        sensitiveness of B is at the beginning great, hence the three
        resultant responses at the beginning are negative or downward. </p>
      <p>Dilute solution of Na2CO3 is next applied to A. The response of
        A (up) begins earlier and continues to grow stronger and
        stronger. Hence, after this application, the response shows a
        preliminary positive twitch of A followed by negative deflection
        of B. The positive grows&nbsp; continuously. At the fifth
        response the two phases, positive and negative, become equal,
        after that the positive becomes very prominent, the negative
        being reduced as a feeble after-vibration. </p>
      <p>It need only be added here that the diphasic variations as
        exhibited by metals are in every way counterparts of similar
        phenomena observed in animal tissues. </p>

      <p><i>Fatigue.</i> — In some metals, as in muscle and in plant, we
        find instances of that progressive diminution of response which
        is known as fatigue (fig. 69). The accompanying record shows
        this in platinum (fig. 70). It has been said that tin is
        practically indefatigable. We must, however, remember that this
        is a question of degree only. Nothing is absolutely
        indefatigable. The exhibition of fatigue depends on various
        conditions. Even in tin, then, I obtained the characteristic
        fatigue-curve with a specimen which had been in continuous use
        for&nbsp; many days (fig. 71). While discussing the subject of
        fatigue in plants, I have adduced considerations which showed
        that the residual effect of strain was one of the main causes
        for the production of fatigue. This conclusion receives
        independent support from the records obtained with metals. </p>

      <p>In this connection the important fact is that the various
        typical fatigue effects exhibited in living substances are
        exactly reproduced in metals, where there can be question
        neither of fatigue-product producing fatigue effects, nor of
        those constructive processes by which they might be removed. We
        have seen, both in muscles and in plants, that if sufficient
        time for complete recovery be allowed between each pair of
        stimuli, the heights of successive responses are the same, and
        there is no apparent fatigue (see page 39). But the height of
        response diminishes as the excitation interval is shortened. We
        find the same thing in metals. Below is given a record taken
        with tin (fig. 72). Throughout the experiment the amplitude of
        vibration was maintained constant, but in (a) the interval
        between consecutive stimuli was 1?, while in (b) this was
        reduced to 30?. A diminution of height immediately occurs. On
        restoring the original rhythm as in (c), the responses revert to
        their first large value.&nbsp; Thus we see that when the wire
        has not completely recovered, its responses, owing to residual
        strain, undergo diminution. Height of response is thus decreased
        by incomplete recovery. If then sufficient time be not allowed
        for perfect recovery, we can understand how, under certain
        circumstances, the residual strain would progressively increase
        with repetition of stimulus, and thus there would be a
        progressive diminution of height of response or fatigue. Again,
        we saw in the last chapter that increase of strain necessitates
        a longer period of recovery. Thus the longer a wire is
        stimulated, the more and more overstrained it becomes, and it
        therefore requires a gradual prolongation of the interval
        between the successive stimuli, if recovery is to be complete.
        This interval, however, being maintained constant, the recovery
        periods virtually undergo a gradual reduction, and successive
        recoveries become&nbsp; more and more incomplete. These
        considerations may be found to afford an insight into the
        progressive diminution of response in fatigued substances. </p>

          of Recovery</b> </p>

        <p><img src="fig072.jpg" width="350" height="221"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The stimulus is maintained constant. In (a) the interval
        between two successive stimuli is one minute, in (b) it is half
        a minute, and in (c) it is again one minute. The response in (b)
        is feebler than in either (a) or (c). </p>
      <p>Fatigue under continuous stimulation. — Fatigue is perhaps best
        shown under continuous stimulation. For example, in muscles,
        when fresh and not fatigued, the top of the tetanic curve is
        horizontal, or may even be ascending, but with long-continued
        stimulation the curve declines. The rapidity of this decline
        depends on the nature of the muscle and its previous condition.
      </p>
      <p>In metals I have found exactly parallel instances. In tin, so
        little liable to fatigue, the top of the curve is horizontal or
        ascending; or it may exhibit a slight decline. But the record
        with platinum shows the rapid decline due to fatigue (fig. 73).
      </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 73</b> </p>

      <p>(a) The top of response-curve under continuous stimulation in
        tin is horizontal or ascending as in figure. <br>
        (b) In platinum there is rapid decline owing to fatigue. </p>
      <p>Taking any of these instances, say that in which fatigue is
        most prominent, it is found that short period of rest restores
        the original intensity of response. This affords additional
        proof of the fact that fatigue is due to overstrain, and that
        this strain, with its sign of attendant fatigue, disappears with
        time. </p>
      <p><i>Staircase effect.</i> — We shall now discuss an effect which
        appears to be the direct opposite of fatigue. This is the
        curious phenomenon known to physiologists as ‘the staircase’
        effect, in which successive uniform stimuli produce a series of
        increasing responses. This&nbsp; is seen under particular
        conditions in the response of certain muscles (fig. 74, a). It
        is also observed sometimes even in nerve, which otherwise,
        generally speaking, gives uniform responses. Of this effect, no
        satisfactory theory has as yet been offered. It is in direct
        contradiction to that theory which supposes that each stimulus
        is followed by dissimilation or break-down of the tissue,
        reducing its function below par. For in these cases the supposed
        dissimilation is followed not by a decrease but by an increase
        of functional activity. This ‘staircase effect’ I have shown to
        be occasionally exhibited by plants. I have also found it in
        metals. In the last chapter we have seen that a wire often
        falls, especially after resting for a long time, into a state of
        comparative sluggishness, and that this molecular inertness then
        gradually gives place to increased mobility under stimulation.
        As a consequence, an increased response is thus obtained. I give
        in fig. 74, b, a series of responses to uniform stimuli,
        exhibited by platinum which had been at rest for some time. This
        effect is very clearly shown here. So we see that in a substance
        which has previously been in a sluggish condition, stimulation
        confers increased mobility. Response thus reaches a maximum, but
        continued stimulation may afterwards produce overstrain, and the
        subsequent responses may then show a decline. This consideration
        will explain certain types of responses&nbsp; exhibited by
        muscles, where the first part of the series exhibits a staircase
        increase followed by declining responses of fatigue. </p>

      <p>Reversed response due to molecular modification and its
        transformation into normal after continuous stimulation (1) in
        nerve.—Reference has already been made to the fact that a nerve
        which, when fresh, exhibited the normal negative response, will
        often, if kept for some time in preservative saline, undergo a
        molecular modification, after which it gives a positive
        variation. Thus while the response given by fresh nerve is
        normal or negative, a stale nerve gives modified, i.e. reversed
        or positive, response. This peculiar modification does not
        always occur, yet is too frequent to be considered abnormal.
        Again, when such a nerve is subjected to tetanisation or
        continuous stimulation, this modified response tends once more
        to become normal. </p>
      <p>It is found that not only tetanisation, but also CO2 has the
        power of converting the modified response into normal. Hence it
        has been suggested that the conversion under tetanisation of
        modified response to normal, in stale nerve, is due to a
        hypothetical evolution of CO2 in the nerve during
        stimulation.[16] </p>
      <p>(2) In metals. — I have, however, met with exactly parallel
        phenomena in metals, where, owing to some molecular
        modification, the responses became reversed, and where, under
        continuous stimulation, though here&nbsp; there could be no
        possibility of the evolution of CO2, they tended again to become
        normal. </p>
      <p>If after mounting a wire in a cell filled with water, it be set
        aside for too long a time, I have sometimes noticed that it
        undergoes a certain modification, owing to which its response
        ceases to be normal and becomes reversed in sign. I have
        obtained this effect with various metals, for instance lead and
        tin, and even with the chemically inactive substance—platinum. </p>

      <p>The galvanometer is not dead-beat, and shows after-oscillation.
      </p>
      <p>The subject will be made clearer if we first follow in detail
        the phenomenon exhibited by modified nerve, giving this abnormal
        response. The normal responses in nerve are usually represented
        by ‘down’ and the reversed abnormal responses by ‘up’ curves. In
        the modified nerve, then, the abnormal responses are ‘up’
        instead of the normal ‘down.’ The record of such abnormal
        response in the modified nerve is shown in fig. 75. It will be
        noticed that in this, the successive&nbsp; responses are
        undergoing a diminution, or tending towards the normal. After
        continuous stimulation or tetanisation (T), it will be seen that
        the abnormal or ‘up’ responses are converted into normal or
        ‘down.’ </p>
      <p>I shall now give a record which will exhibit an exactly similar
        transformation from the abnormal to normal response after
        continuous stimulation. Here the normal responses are
        represented by ‘up’ and the abnormal by ‘down’ curves. This
        record was given by a tin wire, which had been molecularly
        modified (fig. 76). We have at first the abnormal responses;
        successive responses are undergoing a diminution or tending
        towards the normal; after continuous stimulation (T), the
        subsequent responses are seen to have become normal. Another
        record, obtained with platinum, shows the same phenomenon (fig.
        77). </p>

        platinum — side by side, it will be seen how essentially similar
        they are in every respect.[17] </p>
      <p>This reversion to normal is seen to have appeared in a
        pronounced manner after rapidly continuous stimulation, in
        process of which the modified molecular condition must in some
        way have reverted to the normal. </p>

      <p><i>Increased response after continuous stimulation.</i> — We
        have seen that responses to uniform stimuli sometimes show a
        staircase increase, apparently owing to the gradual removal of
        molecular sluggishness. Possibly analogous to this is the
        increase of response in nerve after continuous stimulation or
        tetanisation, observed by Waller (fig. 79). Like the staircase
        effect, this contravenes the commonly accepted theory of the
        dissimilation of tissue by stimulus, and the consequent
        depression of response. It is suggested by Waller that&nbsp;
        this increase of response after tetanisation may be due to the
        hypothetical evolution of CO2 to which allusion has previously
        been made. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 81.—Enhanced Response in Tin After Continuous
          Stimulation T</b> </p>

      </center>
      <p>But there is an exact correspondence between this phenomenon
        and that exhibited by metals under similar conditions. I give
        here two sets of records (figs. 80, 81), one obtained with
        platinum and the other with tin, which demonstrate how the
        response is enhanced after continuous stimulation in a manner
        exactly similar to that noticed in the case of nerve. </p>
      <p>The explanation which has been suggested with regard to the
        staircase effect — increased molecular mobility due to removal
        of sluggishness by repeated stimulation—would appear to be
        applicable in this case&nbsp; also. It would appear, then, that
        in all the phenomena which we have studied under the heads of
        ‘staircase’ effect, increase of response after continuous
        stimulation, and fatigue, there is a similarity between the
        observations made upon the response of muscle and nerve on the
        one hand, and that of metals on the other. Even in their
        abnormalities we have seen an agreement. </p>
      <p>But amongst these phenomena themselves, though at first sight
        so diverse, there is some kind of continuity. Calling all normal
        response positive, for the sake of convenience, we observe its
        gradual modification, corresponding to changes in the molecular
        condition of the substance. </p>
      <p>Beginning with that case in which molecular modification is
        extreme, we find a maximum variation of response from the
        normal, that is to say, to negative. </p>
      <p>Continued stimulation, however, brings back the molecular
        condition to normal, as evidenced by the progressive lessening
        of the negative response, culminating in reversion to the normal
        positive. This is equally true of nerve and metal. </p>
      <p>In the next class of phenomena, the modification of molecular
        condition is not so great. It now exhibits itself merely as a
        relative inertness, and the responses, though positive, are
        feeble. Under continued stimulation, they increase in the same
        direction as in the last case, that is to say, from less
        positive to more positive, being the reverse of fatigue. This is
        evidenced alike by the staircase effect and by the increase of
        response after tetanisation, seen not only in nerve but also in
        platinum and tin. </p>
      <p>The substance may next be in what we call the normal condition.
        Successive uniform stimuli now evoke uniform and equal positive
        responses, that is to say, there is no fatigue. But after
        intense or long-continued stimulation, the substance is
        overstrained. The responses now undergo a change from positive
        to less positive; fatigue, that is to say, appears. </p>
      <p>Again, under very much prolonged stimulation the response may
        decline to zero, or even undergo a reversal to negative, a
        phenomenon which we shall find instanced in the reversed
        response of retina under the long-continued stimulus of light. </p>
      <p>We must then recognise that a substance may exist in various
        molecular conditions, whether due to internal changes or to the
        action of stimulus. The responses give us indications of these
        conditions. A complete cycle of molecular modifications can be
        traced, from the abnormal negative to the normal positive, and
        then again to negative seen in reversal under continuous
        stimulation. </p>
      <p><b>FOOTNOTES:</b> </p>
      <p>[16] ‘Considering that we have no previous evidence of any
        chemical or physical change in tetanised nerve, it seems to me
        not worth while pausing to deal with the criticism that it is
        not CO2, but “something else” that has given the result.’ —
        Waller, <i>Animal Electricity</i>, p. 59. That this phenomenon
        is nevertheless capable of physical explanation will be shown
        presently. </p>
      <p>[17] In order to explain the phenomena of electric response,
        some physiologists assume that the negative response is due to a
        process of dissimilation, or breakdown, and the positive to a
        process of assimilation, or building up, of the tissue. The
        modified or positive response in nerve is thus held to be due to
        assimilation; after continuous stimulation, this process is
        supposed to be transformed into one of dissimilation, with the
        attendant negative response. </p>
      <p>How arbitrary and unnecessary such assumptions are will become
        evident, when the abnormal and normal responses, and their
        transformation from one to the other, are found repeated in all
        details in metals, where there can be no question of the
        processes of assimilation or dissimilation. </p>

      <p><i>Relation between stimulus and response — Magnetic analogue —
          Increase of response with increasing Stimulus — Threshold of
          response — Superposition of Stimuli — Hysteresis.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Relation between stimulus and response.</i>— We have seen
        what extremely uniform responses are given by tin, when the
        intensity of stimulus is maintained constant. Hence it is
        obvious that these phenomena are not accidental, but governed by
        definite laws. This fact becomes still more evident when we
        discover how invariably response is increased by increasing the
        intensity of stimulus. </p>
      <p>Electrical response is due, as we have seen, to a molecular
        disturbance, the stimulus causing a distortion from a position
        of equilibrium. In dealing with the subject of the relation
        between the disturbing force and the molecular effect it
        produces, it may be instructive to consider certain analogous
        physical phenomena in which molecular deflections are also
        produced by a distorting force. </p>
      <p><i>Magnetic analogue.</i>— Let us consider the effect that a
        magnetising force produces on a bar of soft iron. It is known
        that each molecule in such a bar is an&nbsp; individual magnet.
        The bar as a whole, nevertheless, exhibits no external
        magnetisation. This is held to be due to the fact that the
        molecular magnets are turned either in haphazard directions or
        in closed chains, and there is therefore no resultant polarity.
        But when the bar is subjected to a magnetising force by means,
        say, of a solenoid carrying electrical current, the individual
        molecules are elastically deflected, so that all the molecular
        magnets tend to place themselves along the lines of magnetising
        force. All the north poles thus point more or less one way, and
        the south poles the other. The stronger the magnetising force,
        the nearer do the molecules approach to a perfect alignment, and
        the greater is the induced magnetisation of the bar. </p>
      <p>The intensity of this induced magnetisation may be measured by
        noting the deflection it produces on a freely suspended magnet
        in a magnetometer. </p>
      <p>The force which produces that molecular deflection, to which
        the magnetisation of the bar is immediately due, is the
        magnetising current flowing round the solenoid. The
        magnetisation, or the molecular effect, is measured by the
        deflection of the magnetometer. We may express the relation
        between cause and effect by a curve in which the abscissa
        represents the magnetising current, and the ordinate the
        magnetisation produced (fig. 82). </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 82.—Curve of Magnetisation</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig082.jpg" width="300" height="216"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In such a curve we may roughly distinguish three parts. In the
        first, where the force is feeble, the mole cular deflection is
        slight. In the next, the curve is rapidly ascending, i.e. a
        small variation of impressed force produces a relatively large
        molecular effect. And lastly, a limit is reached, as seen in the
        third part, where increasing force produces very little further
        effect. In this cause-and-effect curve, the first part is
        slightly convex to the abscissa, the second straight and
        ascending, and the third concave. </p>
      <p><i>Increase of response with increasing stimulus.</i> — We
        shall find in dealing with the relation between the stimulus and
        the molecular effect—i.e. the response—something very similar. </p>
      <p>On gradually increasing the intensity of stimulus, which may be
        done, as already stated, by increasing the amplitude of
        vibration, it will be found that, beginning with feeble
        stimulation, this increase is at first slight, then more
        pronounced, and lastly shows a tendency to approach a limit. In
        all this we have a perfect parallel to corresponding phenomena
        in animal and vegetable response. We saw that the proper
        investigation of this subject was much complicated, in the case
        of animal and vegetable tissues, by the appearance of fatigue.
        The comparatively indefatigable nature of tin causes it to offer
        great advantages in the pursuit of this inquiry. I give below
        two series of records made with tin. The first record, fig. 83,
        is for increasing amplitudes from 5° to 40° by steps of 5°. The
        stimuli are imparted at intervals of one minute. It will be
        noticed that whereas the recovery is complete in one minute when
        the stimulus is moderate, it is not quite complete when the
        stimulus is stronger. The&nbsp; recovery from the effect of
        stronger stimulus is more prolonged. Owing to want of complete
        recovery, the base line is tilted slightly upward. This slight
        displacement of the zero line does not materially affect the
        result, provided the shifting is slight. </p>

      <p>The amplitudes of vibration are increased by steps of 10°, from
        20° to 160°. (The deflections are reduced by interposing a high
        external resistance.) <br>
        The next figure (fig. 84) gives record of responses&nbsp;
        through a wider range. For accurate quantitative measurements it
        is preferable to wait till the recovery is complete. We may
        accomplish this within the limited space of the recording
        photographic plate by making the record for one minute; during
        the rest of recovery, the clockwork moving the plate is stopped
        and the galvanometer spot of light is cut off. Thus the next
        record starts from a point of completed recovery, which will be
        noticed as a bright spot at the beginning of each curve. With
        stimulation of high intensity, a tendency will be noticed for
        the responses to approach a limit. </p>

      </center>
      <p>A single stimulus produces the feeble effect shown in the first
        response. Superposition of 5, 9, 13 such stimuli produce the
        succeeding stronger responses. </p>
      <p><i>Threshold of response. </i>— There is a minimum intensity
        of stimulus below which there is hardly any visible response. We
        may regard this point as the threshold of response. Though
        apparently ineffective, the subliminal stimuli produce some
        latent effect, which may be demonstrated by their additive
        action. The&nbsp; record in fig. 85 shows how individually
        feeble stimuli become markedly effective by superposition. </p>
      <p><i>Superposition of stimuli.</i> — The additive effect of
        succeeding stimuli will be seen from the above. The fusion of
        effect will be incomplete if the frequency of stimulation be not
        sufficiently great; but it will tend to be more complete with
        higher frequency of stimulation (fig. 86). We have here a
        parallel case to the complete and incomplete tetanus of muscles,
        under similar conditions. </p>
      <p>By the addition of these rapidly succeeding stimuli, a maximum
        effect is produced, and further stimulation adds nothing to
        this. The effect is balanced by a force&nbsp; of restitution.
        The response-curve thus rises to its maximum, after which the
        deflection is held as it were rigid, so long as the vibration is
        kept up. </p>
      <p>It was found that increasing intensities of single stimuli
        produced correspondingly increased responses. The same is true
        also of groups of stimuli. The maximum effect produced by
        superposition of stimuli increases with the intensity of the
        constituent stimuli. </p>

      <p>As the frequency of stimulation is increased the fusion becomes
        more and more complete. Vertical line to the right represents ·1
        volt. </p>
      <p><i>Hysteresis.</i> — Allusion has already been made to the
        increased responsiveness conferred by preliminary stimulation
        (see p. 127). Being desirous of finding out in what manner this
        is brought about, I took a series&nbsp; of observations for an
        entire cycle, that is to say, a series of observations were
        taken for maximum effects, starting from amplitude of vibration
        of 10° and ending in 100°, and backwards from 100° to 10°.
        Effect of hysteresis is very clearly seen (see A, fig. 87);
        there is a considerable divergence between the forward and
        return curves, the return curve being higher. On repeating the
        cycle several times, the divergence is found very much reduced,
        the wire on the whole is found to assume a more constant
        sensitiveness. In this steady condition, generally speaking, the
        sensitiveness for smaller amplitude of vibration is found to be
        greater than at the very beginning, but the reverse is the case
        for stronger intensity of stimulation. </p>

      </center>
      <p><i>Effect of annealing.</i> — I repeated the experiment with
        the same wire, after pouring hot water into the cell and
        allowing it to cool to the old temperature. From the cyclic
        curve (B, fig. 87) it will be seen (1) that the sensitiveness
        has become very much enhanced; (2) that there is relatively less
        divergence between the forward and return curves. Even this
        divergence practically disappeared at the third cycle, when the
        forward and backward curves coincided (C, fig. 87). The above
        results show in what manner the excitability of the wire is
        enhanced by purely physical means. </p>
      <p>It is very curious to notice that addition of Na2CO3 solution
        (see Chap. XV — Action of Stimulants) produces enhancement of
        responsive power similar to that produced by annealing; that is
        to say, not only is there a great increase of sensitiveness, but
        there is also a reduction of hysteresis. </p>

      <p>We have seen that the ultimate criterion of the physiological
        character of electric response is held to be its abolition when
        the substance is subjected to those chemical reagents which act
        as poisons. </p>

      </center>
      <p><i>Action of chemical reagents. </i>— Of these reagents, some
        are universal in their action, amongst which strong solutions of
        acids and alkalis, and salts like mercuric chloride, may be
        cited. These act as powerful toxic agents, killing the living
        tissue, and causing electric response to disappear. (See fig.
        88.) It must, however, be remembered that there are again
        specific poisons&nbsp; which may affect one kind of tissue and
        not others. Poisons in general may be regarded as extreme cases
        of depressants. As an example of those which produce moderate
        physiological depression, potassium bromide may be mentioned,
        and this also diminishes electric response. There are other
        chemical reagents, on the other hand, which produce the opposite
        effect of increasing the excitability and causing a
        corresponding exaltation of electric response. </p>
      <p>We shall now proceed to inquire whether the response of
        inorganic bodies is affected by chemical reagents, so that their
        excitability is exalted by some, and depressed or abolished by
        others. Should it prove to be so, the last test will have been
        fulfilled, and that parallelism which has been already
        demonstrated throughout a wide range of phenomena, between the
        electric response of animal tissues on the one hand, and that of
        plants and metals on the other, will be completely established.
      </p>
      <p><i>Action of stimulants on metals. </i>— We shall first study
        the stimulating action of various chemical reagents. The method
        of procedure is to take a series of normal responses to uniform
        stimuli, the electrolyte being water. The chemical reagent whose
        effect is to be observed is now added in small quantity to the
        water in the cell, and a second series of responses taken, using
        the same stimulus as before. Generally speaking, the influence
        of the reagent is manifested in a short period, but there may be
        occasional instances where the effect takes some time to develop
        fully. We must remember that by the introduction of the chemical
        reagent some change may&nbsp; be produced in the internal
        resistance of the cell. The effect of this on the deflection is
        eliminated by interposing a very high external resistance (from
        one to five megohms) in comparison with which the internal
        resistance of the cell is negligible. The fact that the
        introduction of the reagent did not produce any variation in the
        total resistance of the circuit was demonstrated by taking two
        deflections, due to a definite fraction of a volt, before and
        after the introduction of the reagent. These deflections were
        found equal. </p>

      <p>I first give a record of the stimulating action of sodium
        carbonate on tin, which will become evident by a comparison of
        the responses before&nbsp; and after the introduction of Na2CO3
        (fig. 89). The next record shows the effect of the same reagent
        on platinum (fig. 90). </p>

      </center>
      <p><i>Action of depressants.</i> — Certain other reagents, again,
        produce an opposite effect. That is to say, they diminish the
        intensity of response. The record given on the next page (fig.
        91) shows the depressing action of 10 per cent. solution of KBr
        on tin. </p>

        <p><img src="fig091.jpg" width="350" height="298"></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Effect of ‘poison.’</i> — Living tissues are killed, and
        their electric responses are at the same time abolished by the
        action of poisons. It is very curious that various chemical
        reagents are similarly effective in killing the response of
        metals. I give below a record (fig. 92) to show how oxalic acid
        abolishes the response. The depressive effect of this reagent is
        so great that a strength of one part in 10,000 is often
        sufficient to produce complete&nbsp; abolition. Another notable
        point with reference to the action of this reagent is the
        persistence of after-effect. This will be clearly seen from an
        account of the following experiment. The two wires A and B, in
        the cell filled with water, were found to give equal responses.
        The wires were now lifted off, and one wire B was touched with
        dilute oxalic acid. All traces of acid were next removed by
        rubbing the wire with cloth under a stream of water. On
        replacing the wire in the cell, A gave the usual response,
        whereas that of B&nbsp; was found to be abolished. The
        depression produced is so great and passes in so deep that I
        have often failed to revive the response, even after rubbing the
        wire with emery paper, by which the molecular layer on the
        surface must have been removed. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 92.—Abolition of Response by Oxalic Acid</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig092.jpg" width="300" height="354"></p>
      </center>
      <p>We have seen in the molecular model (fig. 62, d, e) how the
        attainment of maximum is delayed, the response diminished, and
        the recovery prolonged or arrested by increase of friction or
        reduction of molecular mobility. </p>
      <p>It would appear as if the reagents which act as poisons
        produced some kind of molecular arrest. The following records
        seen to lend support to this view. If the oxalic acid is applied
        in large quantities, the abolition of response is complete. But
        on carefully adding just the proper amount I find that the first
        stimulus evokes a responsive electric twitch, which is less than
        the normal, and the period of recovery is very much prolonged
        from the normal one minute before, to five minutes after, the
        application of the reagent (fig. 93, a). In another record the
        arrest is more pronounced, i.e. there is now no recovery (fig.
        93, b). Note also that the maximum is attained much later.
        Stimuli applied after the arrest produce no effect, as if the
        molecular mechanism became, as it were, clogged or locked up. </p>
      <p>In connection with this it is interesting to note that the
        effect of veratrine poison on muscle is somewhat similar. This
        reagent not only diminishes the excitability, but causes a very
        great prolongation of the period of recovery. </p>
      <p>In connection with the action of chemical reagents the
        following points are noteworthy. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 93.—‘Molecular Arrest’ by the Action of ‘poison’</b> </p>

        <p><img src="fig093.jpg" width="375" height="502"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In each, curves to the left show the normal response, curve to
        the right shows the effect of poison. In (a) the arrest is
        evidenced by prolongation of period of recovery. In (b) there is
        no recovery. </p>
      <p>(1) The effect of these reagents is not only to increase or
        diminish the height of the response-curve, but also to modify
        the time relations. By the action of some the latent period is
        diminished, others produce a prolongation of the period of
        recovery. Some curious effects produced by the change of time
        relations have been noticed in the account given of diphasic
        variation (see p. 113). </p>
      <p>&nbsp;(2) The effect produced by a chemical reagent depends to
        some extent on the previous condition of the wire. </p>
      <p>(3) A certain time is required for the full development of the
        effect. With some reagents the full effect takes place almost
        instantaneously, while with others the effect takes place
        slowly. Again the effect may with time reach a maximum, after
        which there may be a slight decline. </p>

      <p>(a) is the normal response; (b) is the stimulating action of
        small dose of potash (3 parts in 1,000); (c) is the abolition of
        response with a stronger dose (3 parts in 100). </p>
      <p>(4) The after-effects of the reagents may be transitory or
        persistent; that is to say, in some cases the removal of the
        reagent causes the responses to revert to the normal, while in
        others the effect persists even after the removal of all traces
        of the reagent. </p>
      <p><i>Opposite effects of large and small doses.</i> — There
        remains a very curious phenomenon, known not only&nbsp; to
        students of physiological response but also known in medical
        practice, namely that of the opposite effects produced by the
        same reagent when given in large or in small doses. Here, too,
        we have the same phenomena reproduced in an extraordinary manner
        in inorganic response. The same reagent which becomes a ‘poison’
        in large quantities may act as a stimulant when applied in small
        doses. This is seen in record fig. 94, in which (a) gives the
        normal responses in water; KOH solution was now added so as to
        make the strength three parts in 1,000, and (b) shows the
        consequent enhancement of response. A further quantity of KOH
        was added so as to increase the strength to three parts in 100.
        This caused a complete abolition (c) of response. </p>
      <p>It will thus be seen that as in the case of animal tissues and
        of plants, so also in metals, the electrical responses are
        exalted by the action of stimulants, lowered by depressants, and
        completely abolished by certain other reagents. The parallelism
        will thus be found complete in every detail between the
        phenomena of response in the organic and the inorganic. </p>

        <p><b>ON THE STIMULUS OF LIGHT AND RETINAL CURRENTS</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Visual impulse: (1) chemical theory; (2) electrical theory —
          Retinal currents — Normal response positive — Inorganic
          response under stimulus of light — Typical experiment on the
          electrical effect induced by light.</i> </p>
      <p>The effect of the stimulus of light on the retina is perceived
        in the brain as a visual sensation. The process by which the
        ether-wave disturbance causes this visual impulse is still very
        obscure. Two theories may be advanced in explanation. </p>
      <p><i>(1) Chemical theory. </i>— According to the first, or
        chemical, theory, it is supposed that certain visual substances
        in the retina are affected by light, and that vision originates
        from the metabolic changes produced in these visual substances.
        It is also supposed that the metabolic changes consist of two
        phases, the upward, constructive, or anabolic phase, and the
        downward, destructive, or katabolic phase. Various visual
        substances by their anabolic or katabolic changes are supposed
        to produce the variations of sensation of light and colour. This
        theory, as will be seen, is very complex, and there are certain
        obstacles in the way of its acceptance. It is, for instance,
        difficult to see how this very quick visual process could be due
        to a comparatively slow chemical action, consisting of&nbsp; the
        destructive breaking-down of the tissue, followed by its
        renovation. Some support was at first given to this chemical
        theory by the bleaching action of light on the visual purple
        present in the retina, but it has been found that the presence
        or absence of visual purple could not be essential to vision,
        and that its function, when present, is of only secondary
        importance. For it is well known that in the most sensitive
        portion of the human retina, the fovea centralis, the visual
        purple is wanting; it is also found to be completely absent from
        the retinæ of many animals possessing keen sight. </p>
      <p><i>(2) Electrical theory.</i> — The second, or electrical,
        theory supposes that the visual impulse is the concomitant of an
        electrical impulse; that an electrical current is generated in
        the retina under the incidence of light, and that this is
        transmitted to the brain by the optic nerve. There is much to be
        said in favour of this view, for it is an undoubted fact, that
        light gives rise to retinal currents, and that, conversely, an
        electrical current suitably applied causes the sensation of
        light. </p>
      <p><i>Retinal currents</i>. — Holmgren, Dewar, McKendrick, Kuhne,
        Steiner, and others have shown that illumination produces
        electric variation in a freshly excised eye. About this general
        fact of the electrical response there is a widespread agreement,
        but there is some difference of opinion as regards the sign of
        this response immediately on the application, cessation, and
        during the continuance of light. These slight discrepancies may
        be partly due to the unsatisfactory nomenclature—as regards use
        of terms positive and negative—hitherto in&nbsp; vogue and
        partly also to the differing states of the excised eyes
        observed. </p>
      <p>Waller, in his excellent and detailed work on the retinal
        currents of the frog, has shown how the sign of response is
        reversed in the moribund condition of the eye. </p>
      <p>As to the confusion arising from our present terminology, we
        must remember that the term positive or negative is used with
        regard to a current of reference—the so-called current of
        injury. </p>

      <p>The current of response is from the nerve to the retina. </p>
      <p>When the two galvanometric contacts are made, one with the cut
        end of the nerve, and the other on the uninjured cornea, a
        current of injury is found which in the eye is from the nerve to
        the retina. In the normal freshly excised eye, the current of
        response due to the action of light on the retina is always from
        the nerve, which is not directly stimulated by light, to the
        retina, that is, from the less excited to the more excited (fig.
        95). This current of response flows, then, in the same direction
        as the existing current of reference—the current of injury—and
        may therefore be called positive. Unfortunately the current of
        injury is very often apt to change its sign; it then flows
        through the eye from the cornea to the nerve. And now, though
        the current of response due to light may remain unchanged in
        direction, still, owing to the reversal of the current of
        reference, it will appear as negative. That is to say, though
        its absolute direction is the same as before, its relative
        direction is altered. </p>
      <p>I have already advocated the use of the term positive for
        currents which flow towards the stimulated, and negative for
        those whose flow is away from the stimulated. If such a
        convention be adopted, no confusion can arise, even when, as in
        the given cases, the currents of injury undergo a change of
        direction. </p>
      <p><i>Normal response positive. </i>— The normal effect of light
        on the retina, as noticed by all the observers already
        mentioned, is a positive variation, during exposure to light of
        not too long duration. Cessation of light is followed by
        recovery. On these points there is general agreement amongst
        investigators. Deviations are regarded as due to abnormal
        conditions of the eye, owing to rough usage, or to the rapid
        approach of death. For just as in the dying plant we found
        occasional reversals from negative to positive response, so in
        the dying retina the response may undergo changes from the
        normal positive to negative. </p>
      <p>The sign of response, as we have already seen in numerous
        cases, depends very much on the molecular condition of the
        sensitive substance, and if this condition be in any way
        changed, it is not surprising that the character of the response
        should also undergo alteration. </p>
      <p>Unlike muscle in this, successive retinal responses exhibit
        little change, for, generally speaking, fatigue is very slight,
        the retina recovering quickly even under strong light if the
        exposure be not too long. In exceptional cases, however,
        fatigue, or its converse, the staircase effect, may be observed.
      </p>
      <p><i>Inorganic response under the stimulus of light.</i> — It may
        now be asked whether such a complex vital&nbsp; phenomenon as
        retinal response could have its counterpart in non-living
        response. Taking a rod of silver, we may beat out one end into
        the form of a hollow cup, sensitising the inside by exposing it
        for a short time to vapour of bromine. The cup may now be filled
        with water, and connection made with a galvanometer by
        non-polarisable electrodes. There will now be a current due to
        difference between the inner surface and the rod. This may be
        balanced, however, by a compensating E.M.F. </p>

          Cell</b> </p>

      <p>Thick lines represent the effect during illumination, dotted
        lines the recovery in darkness. Note the preliminary negative
        twitch, which is sometimes also observed in responses of frog’s
        retina. </p>
      <p>We have thus an arrangement somewhat resembling the eye, with a
        sensitive layer corresponding to the retina, and the less
        sensitive rod corresponding to the conducting nerve-stump (fig.
        96, a). </p>
      <p>The apparatus is next placed inside a black box, with an
        aperture at the top. By means of an inclined mirror, light may
        be thrown down upon the sensitive surface through the opening. </p>
      <p>On exposing the sensitive surface to light, the balance is at
        once disturbed, and a responsive current of positive character
        produced. The current, that is to&nbsp; say, is from the less to
        the more stimulated sensitive layer. On the cessation of light,
        there is fairly quick recovery (fig. 96, b). </p>
      <p>The character and the intensity of E.M. variation of the
        sensitive cell depend to some extent on the process of
        preparation. The particular cell with which most of the
        following experiments were carried out usually gave rise to a
        positive variation of about ·008 volt when acted on for one
        minute by the light of an incandescent gas-burner which was
        placed at a distance of 50 cm. </p>

      <p>A, B are the two faces of a brominated sheet of silver. One
        face, say A, is acted on by light. The current of response is
        from B to A, across the plate. </p>
      <p><i>Typical experiment on the electrical effect induced by
          light.</i> — This subject of the production of an electrical
        current by the stimulus of light would appear at first sight
        very complex. But we shall be able to advance naturally to a
        clear understanding of its most complicated phenomena if we go
        through a preliminary consideration of an ideally simple case.
        We have seen, in our experiments on the mechanical stimulation
        of, for example, tin, that a difference of electric potential
        was induced between the more stimulated and less stimulated
        parts of the same rod, and that an action current could thus be
        obtained, on making suitable electrolytic connections. Whether
        the more excited was zincoid or cuproid depended on the
        substance and its molecular condition. </p>
      <p>Let us now imagine the metal rod flattened into a plate, and
        one face stimulated by light, while the other is protected.
        Would there be a difference of potential induced between the two
        faces of this same sheet of metal? </p>
      <p>Let two blocks of paraffin be taken and a large hole drilled
        through both. Next, place a sheet of metal between the blocks,
        and pour melted paraffin round the edge to seal up the junction,
        the two open ends being also closed by panes of glass. We shall
        have then two compartments separated by the sheet of metal, and
        these compartments may be filled with water through the small
        apertures at the top (fig. 97, a). </p>

          Cell</b> </p>

      <p>Ten seconds’ exposure to light followed by fifty seconds’
        recovery in the dark. Thick lines represent action in light,
        dotted lines represent recovery. </p>
      <p>The two liquid masses in the separated chambers thus make
        perfect electrolytic contacts with the two faces A and B of the
        sheet of metal. These two faces may be put in connection with a
        galvanometer by means of two non-polarisable electrodes, whose
        ends dip into the two chambers. If the sheet of metal have been
        properly annealed, there will now be no difference of potential
        between the two faces, and no current in the galvanometer. If
        the two faces are not molecularly similar, however, there will
        be a current, and the electrical effects to be subsequently
        described will act additively, in an algebraical sense. Let one
        face now be exposed to the stimulus of light. A responsive
        current will be found to flow, from the less to the more
        stimulated face, in some cases, and in others in an opposite
        direction. </p>
      <p>It appears at first very curious that this difference of
        electric potential should be maintained between opposite faces
        of a very thin and highly conducting sheet of metal, the
        intervening distance between the opposed surfaces being so
        extremely small, and the electrical resistance quite
        infinitesimal. A homogeneous sheet of metal has become by the
        unequal action of light, molecularly speaking, heterogeneous.
        The two opposed surfaces are thrown into opposite kinds of
        electric condition, the result of which is as if a certain
        thickness of the sheet, electrically speaking, were made
        zinc-like, and the rest copper-like. From such unfamiliar
        conceptions, we shall now pass easily to others to which we are
        more accustomed. Instead of two opposed surfaces, we may obtain
        a similar response by unequally lighting different portions of
        the same surface. Taking a sheet of metal, we may expose one
        half, say A, to light, the other half, B, being screened.
        Electrolytic contacts are made by plunging the two limbs in two
        vessels which are in connection with the two non-polarisable
        electrodes E and E? (fig. 98, a). On&nbsp; illumination of A and
        B alternately, we shall now obtain currents flowing alternately
        in opposite directions. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Just as in the strain cells the galvanometer contact was
        transferred from the electrolytic part to the metallic part of
        the circuit, so we may next, in an exactly similar manner, cut
        this plate into two, and connect these directly to the
        galvanometer, electrolytic connection being made by partially
        plunging them into a cell containing water. The posterior
        surfaces of the two half-plates may be covered with a
        non-conducting coating. And we arrive at a typical
        photo-electric cell (fig. 98, b). These considerations will show
        that the eye is practically a photo-electric cell. </p>

      <p>Illumination L for one minute, recovery in dark for two minutes
        during obscurity D. (Waller.) </p>
      <p>We shall now give detailed experimental results obtained with
        the sensitive silver-bromide cell, and compare its
        response-curve with those of the retina. A series of uniform
        light stimuli gives rise to uniform&nbsp; responses, which show
        very little sign of fatigue. How similar these response-curves
        are to those of the retina will be seen from a pair of records
        given below, where fig. 99 shows responses of frog’s retina, and
        fig. 100 gives the responses obtained with the sensitive silver
        cell (fig. 100). </p>
      <p>It was said that the responses of the retina are uniform. This
        is only approximately true. In addition to numerous cases of
        uniform responses, Waller finds instances of ‘staircase’
        increase, and its opposite, slight fatigue. In the record here
        given of the silver cell, the staircase effect is seen at the
        beginning, and followed by slight fatigue. I have other records
        where for a very long time the responses are perfectly uniform,
        there being no sign of fatigue. </p>

      <p>Another curious phenomenon sometimes observed in the response
        of retina is an occasional slight increase of response
        immediately on the cessation of light, after which there is the
        final recovery. An indication of this is seen in the second and
        fourth curves in fig. 99. Curiously enough, this abnormality is
        also occasionally met with in the responses of the silver cell,
        as seen in the first two curves of fig. 100. Other instances
        will be given later. </p>

      <p>We shall next proceed to study the effect, on the response of
        the sensitive cell, of all those conditions which influence the
        normal response of the retina. We shall then briefly inquire
        whether even the abnormalities sometimes met with in retinal
        responses have not their parallel in the responses given by the
        inorganic. </p>

      <p>Illumination 20?, obscurity 40?. </p>
      <p>In (a) is shown a series of responses at 20° C. — the record
        exhibits slight fatigue. (b) is the slight irregular response at
        50° C. (c) is the record on re-cooling; it exhibits ‘staircase’
        increase. </p>
      <p><i>Effect of temperature.</i> — It has been found that when the
        temperature is raised above a certain point, retinal response
        shows rapid diminution. On cooling, however, response reappears,
        with its original intensity. In the response given by the
        sensitive cell, the same peculiarity is noticed. I give below
        (fig. 101, a) a set of response-curves for 20° C. These
        responses, after showing slight fatigue, became fairly constant.
        On raising the temperature to 50° C. response practically
        disappeared (101, b). But on cooling to the first temperature
        again, it reappeared, with its original if not slightly greater
        intensity (fig. 101, c). A curious point is that while in&nbsp;
        record (a), before warming, slight fatigue is observed, in (c),
        after cooling, the reverse, or staircase effect, appears. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 102.—Response-curves for Increasing Duration of
          Illumination from 1? to 10?</b> </p>

      <p>In (a) the source of light was at a distance of 50 cm.; in (b)
        it was at a distance of 25 cm. Note the after-oscillation. </p>
      <p><i>Effect of increasing length of exposure. </i>— If the
        intensity of light be kept constant, the magnitude of response
        of the sensitive cell increases with length of exposure. But
        this soon reaches a limit, after which&nbsp; increase of
        duration does not increase magnitude of effect. Too long an
        exposure may however, owing to fatigue, produce an actual
        decline. </p>
      <p>I give here two sets of curves (fig. 102) illustrating the
        effect of lengthening exposure. The intensities of light in the
        two cases are as 1 to 4. The incandescent burner was in the two
        cases at distances 50 and 25 cm. respectively. It will be
        observed that beyond eight seconds’ exposure the responses are
        approximately uniform. Another noticeable fact is that with long
        exposure there is an after-oscillation. This growing effect with
        lengthening exposure and attainment of limit is exactly
        paralleled by responses of retina under similar conditions. </p>
      <p>Relation between intensity of light and magnitude of
        response.—In the responses of retina, it is found that
        increasing intensity of light produces an increasing effect. But
        the rate of increase is not uniform: increase of effect does not
        keep pace with increase of stimulus. Thus a curve giving the
        relation between stimulus and response is concave to the axis
        which represents the stimulus. </p>
      <p>The same is true of the sensation of light. That is to say,
        within wide limits, intensity of sensation does not increase so
        rapidly as stimulus. </p>
      <p>This particular relation between stimulus and effect is also
        exhibited in a remarkable manner by the sensitive cell. For a
        constant source of light I used an incandescent burner, and
        graduated the intensity of the incident light by varying its
        distance from the sensitive cell. The intensity of light
        incident on the cell, when&nbsp; the incandescent burner is at a
        distance of 150 cm., has been taken as the arbitrary unit. In
        order to make allowance for the possible effects of fatigue I
        took two successive series of responses (fig. 103). In the
        first, records were taken with intensities diminishing from 7 to
        1, and immediately afterwards increasing from 1 to 7, in the
        second. </p>

        the ratios of 7, 5, 3, and 1. On the right they are for the
        increasing intensities 1, 3, 5, and 7. The thick lines are
        records during exposures of one minute; the dotted lines
        represent recoveries for one minute. </p>

        150 cm. is taken as unit.) </p>

      <p>As the zero point was slightly shifted during the&nbsp; course
        of the experiment, the deflection in each curve was measured
        from a line joining the beginning of the response to the end of
        its recovery. A mean deflection, corresponding to each
        intensity, was obtained by taking the average of the descending
        and ascending readings. The two sets of readings did not,
        however, vary to any marked extent. </p>
      <p>The deflections corresponding to the intensities 1, 3, 5, 7,
        are, then, as 9·5 to 18, to 30, to 41. If the deflections had
        been strictly proportionate to the intensities of light stimulus
        they would have been as 9·5 to 28·5, to 47·5, to 66·5. </p>

      <p>In another set of records, with a different cell, I obtained
        the deflections of 6, 10, 13, 15, corresponding to light
        intensities of 3, 5, 7, and 9. </p>
      <p>The two curves in fig. 104, giving the relation between
        response and stimulus, show that in the case of inorganic
        substances, as in the retina (Waller), magnitude of response
        does not increase so rapidly as stimulus. </p>
      <p><i>After-oscillation.</i> — When the sensitive surface is
        subjected to the continued action of light, the E.M.&nbsp;
        effect attains a maximum at which it remains constant for some
        time. If the exposure be maintained after this for a longer
        period, there will be a decline, as we found to be the case in
        other instances of continued stimulation. The appearance of this
        decline, and its rapidity, depends on the particular condition
        of the substance. </p>
      <p>When the sensitive element is considerably strained by the
        action of light, and if that light be now cut off, there is a
        rebound towards recovery and a subsequent after-oscillation.
        That is to say, the curve of recovery falls below the zero
        point, and then slowly oscillates back to the position of
        equilibrium. We have already seen an instance of this in fig.
        102. Above is given a series of records showing the appearance
        of decline, from too long-continued exposure and recovery,
        followed by after-oscillation on the cessation of light (fig.
        105). Certain visual analogues to this phenomenon will be
        noticed later. </p>

      <p><i>Abnormal effects.</i> — We have already treated of all the
        normal effects of the stimulus of light on the retina, and their
        counterparts in the sensitive cell. But the retina undergoes
        molecular changes when injured, stale, or in a dying condition,
        and under these circumstances various complicated modifications
        are observed in the response. </p>

      <p>The thick line represents response during light (half a
        minute’s exposure), and dotted line the recovery during
        darkness. Note the terminal positive twitch. </p>
      <p><i>1. Preliminary negative twitch.</i> — When the light is
        incident on the frog’s retina, there is sometimes a transitory
        negative variation, followed by the normal positive response.
        This is frequently observed in the sensitive cell (see fig. 96,
        b). </p>
      <p><i>2. Reversal of response. </i>— Again, in a stale retina,
        owing to molecular modification the response is apt to undergo
        reversal (Waller). That is to say, it now becomes negative. In
        working with the same sensitive cell on different days I have
        found it occasionally exhibiting this reversed response. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;3. Transient rise of current on cessation of light.</i>
        — Another very curious fact observed in the retina by Kuhne and
        Steiner is that immediately on the stoppage of light there is
        sometimes a sudden increase in the retinal current, before the
        usual recovery takes place. This is very well shown in the
        series of records taken by Waller (fig. 106). It will be noticed
        that on illumination the response-curve rises, that continued
        illumination produces a decline, and that on the cessation of
        light there is a transient rise of current. I give here a series
        of records which will show the remarkable similarity between the
        responses of the cell and retina, in respect even of
        abnormalities so marked as those described (fig. 107). I may
        mention here that some of these curious effects, that is to say,
        the preliminary negative twitch and sudden augmentation of the
        current on the cessation of light, have also been noticed by
        Minchin in photo-electric cells. </p>
      <p><i>4. Decline and reversal.</i> — We have seen that under the
        continuous action of light, response begins to&nbsp; decline.
        Sometimes this process is very rapid, and in any case, under
        continued light, the deflection falls. </p>
      <p>(1) The decline may nearly reach zero. If now the light be cut
        off there is a rebound towards recovery downwards, which carries
        it below zero, followed by an after-oscillation (fig. 108, a). </p>
      <p>(2) If the light be continued for a longer time, the decline
        goes on even below zero; that is to say, the response now
        becomes apparently negative. If, now, the light be stopped,
        there is a rebound upwards to recovery, with, generally
        speaking, a slight preliminary twitch downwards (fig. 108, b,
        c). This rebound carries it back, not only to the zero position,
        but sometimes beyond that position. We have here a parallel to
        the following observation of Dewar and McKendrick:&nbsp; ‘When
        diffuse light is allowed to impinge on the eye of the frog,
        after it has arrived at a tolerably stable condition, the
        natural E.M.F. is in the first place increased, then diminished;
        during the continuance of light it is still slowly diminished to
        a point where it remains tolerably constant, and on the removal
        of light there is a sudden increase of the E.M. power nearly up
        to its original position.’[18] </p>

        <p><img src="fig108.jpg" width="450" height="240"></p>
      </center>
      <p>(a) Decline short of zero; on stoppage of light, rebound
        downwards to zero; after-oscillation. </p>
      <p>(b) Decline below zero; on stoppage of light, rebound towards
        zero, with preliminary negative twitch. </p>
      <p>(c) The same, decline further down; negative twitch almost
        disappearing. </p>
      <p>(3) I have sometimes obtained the following curious result. On
        the incidence of light there is a response, say, upward. On the
        continuation of light the response declines to zero and remains
        at the zero position, there being no further action during the
        continuation of stimulus. But on the cessation or ‘break’ of
        light stimulus, there is a response downwards, followed by the
        usual recovery. This reminds us of a somewhat similar responsive
        action produced by constant electric current on the muscle. At
        the moment of ‘make’ there is a responsive twitch, but
        afterwards the muscle remains quiescent during the passage of
        the current, but on breaking the current there is seen a second
        responsive twitch. </p>
      <p><i>Résumé.</i> — So we see that the response of the sensitive
        inorganic cell, to the stimulus of light, is in every way
        similar to that of the retina. In both we have, under normal
        conditions, a positive variation; in both the intensity of
        response up to a certain limit increases with the duration of
        illumination; it is affected, in both alike, by temperature; in
        both there is comparatively little fatigue; the increase of
        response with intensity of&nbsp; stimulus is similar in both;
        and finally, even in abnormalities — such as reversal of
        response, preliminary negative twitch on commencement, and
        terminal positive twitch on cessation of illumination, and
        decline and reversal under continued action of light — parallel
        effects are noticed. </p>

      <p>We may notice here certain curious relations even in these
        abnormal responses (fig. 109). If the equilibrium position
        remain always constant, then it is easy to understand how, when
        the rising curve has attained its maximum, on the cessation of
        light, recovery should proceed downwards, towards the
        equilibrium position (fig. 109, a). One can also understand how,
        after reversal by the continued action of light, there should be
        a recovery upwards towards the old equilibrium position (fig.
        109, b). What is curious is that in certain cases we get, on the
        stoppage of light, a preliminary twitch away from the zero or
        equilibrium position, upwards as in (c) (compare also fig. 107)
        and downwards as in (d) (compare also fig. 108 b). </p>
      <p>In making a general retrospect, finally, of the effects&nbsp;
        produced by stimulus of light, we find that there is not a
        single phenomenon in the responses, normal or abnormal,
        exhibited by the retina which has not its counterpart in the
        sensitive cell constructed of inorganic material. </p>

          Positive and negative after-images — Binocular alternation of

          impression.</i> </p>
      <p>We have already referred to the electrical theory of the visual
        impulse. We have seen how a flash of light causes a transitory
        electric impulse not only in the retina, but also in its
        inorganic substitute. Light thus produces not only a visual but
        also an electrical impulse, and it is not improbable that the
        two may be identical. Again, varying intensities of light give
        rise to corresponding intensities of current, and the curves
        which represent the relation between the increasing stimulus and
        the increasing response have a general agreement with the
        corresponding curve of visual sensation. In the present chapter
        we shall see how this electrical theory not only explains in a
        simple manner ordinary visual phenomena, but is also deeply
        suggestive with regard to others which are very obscure. </p>
      <p>We have seen in our silver cell that if the molecular
        conditions of the anterior and posterior surfaces were exactly
        similar, there would be no current. In practice, however, this
        is seldom the case. There is, generally&nbsp; speaking, a slight
        difference, and a feeble current in the circuit. It is thus seen
        that there may be an existing feeble current, to which the
        effect of light is added algebraically. The stimulus of light
        may thus increase the existing current of darkness (positive
        variation). On the cessation of light again, the current of
        response disappears and there remains only the feeble original
        current. </p>
      <p>In the case of the retina, also, it is curious to note that on
        closing the eye the sensation is not one of absolute darkness,
        but there is a general feeble sensation of light, known as ‘the
        intrinsic light of the retina.’ The effect produced by external
        light is superposed on this intrinsic light, and certain curious
        results of this algebraical summation will be noticed later. </p>

      <p>Showing greater persistence of after-effect when the stimulus
        is strong. </p>
      <p>(a) Short exposure of 2? to light of intensity 1; (b) short
        exposure of 2? to light nine times as strong. </p>
      <p><i>Effect of light of short duration.</i> — If we subject the
        sensitive cell to a flash of radiation, the effect is not
        instantaneous but grows with time. It attains a maximum some
        little time after the incidence of light, and the effect then
        gradually passes away. Again, as we have seen previously with
        regard to mechanical strain, the after-effect persists for a
        slightly longer time when the stimulus is stronger. The same is
        true of the after-effect of the stimulus of light. Two curves
        which exhibit this are given below (fig. 110). With regard to
        the first point—that the maximum effect is attained some time
        after the cessation of a short exposure — the corresponding
        experiment on the eye may be made as follows: at the end of a
        tube is fixed a glass disc coated with lampblack, on which, by
        scratching with a pin, some words are written in transparent
        characters.&nbsp; The length of the tube is so adjusted that the
        disc is at the distance of most distinct vision from the end of
        the tube applied to the eye. The blackened disc is turned
        towards a source of strong light, and a short exposure is given
        by the release of a photographic shutter interposed between the
        disc and the eye. On closing the eye, immediately after a short
        exposure, it will at first be found that there is hardly any
        well-defined visual sensation; after a short time, however, the
        writing on the blackened disc begins to appear in luminous
        characters, attains a maximum intensity, and then fades away. In
        this case the stimulus is of short duration, the light being cut
        off before the maximum effect is attained. The after-effect here
        is positive, there being no reversal or interval of darkness
        between the direct image and the after-image, the one being
        merely the continuation of the other. But we shall see, if light
        is cut off after a maximum effect is attained by long&nbsp;
        exposure, that the immediate after-image would be negative (see
        below). The relative persistence of after-effect of lights of
        different intensities may be shown in the following manner: </p>
      <p>If a bold design be traced with magnesium powder on a blackened
        board and fired in a dark room, the observer not being
        acquainted with the design, the instantaneous flash of light,
        besides being too quick for detailed observation, is obscured by
        the accompanying smoke. But if the eyes be closed immediately
        after the flash, the feebler obscuring sensation of smoke will
        first disappear, and will leave clear the more persistent
        after-sensation of the design, which can then be read
        distinctly. In this manner I have often been able to see
        distinctly, on closing the eyes, extremely brief phenomena of
        light which could not otherwise have been observed, owing either
        to their excessive rapidity or to their dazzling character.[19]
      </p>
      <p><i>After-oscillation.</i> — In the case of the sensitive silver
        cell, we have seen (fig. 105), when it has been subjected for
        some time to strong light, that the current of response attains
        a maximum, and that on the stoppage of the stimulus there is an
        immediate rebound towards recovery. In this rebound there may be
        an over-shooting of the equilibrium position, and an
        after-oscillation is thus produced. </p>
      <p>If there has been a feeble initial current, this oscillatory
        after-current, by algebraical summation, will cause the current
        in the circuit to be alternately weaker and stronger than the
        initial current. </p>
      <p><i>Visual recurrence. </i>— Translated into the visual
        circuit, this would mean an alternating series of after-images.
        On the cessation of light of strong intensity and long duration,
        the immediate effect would be a negative rebound, unlike the
        positive after-effect which followed on a short exposure. </p>
      <p>The next rebound is positive, giving rise to a sensation of
        brightness. This will go on in a recurrent series. </p>
      <p>If we look for some time at a very bright object, preferably
        with one eye, on closing the eye there is an immediate dark
        sensation followed by a sensation of light. These go on
        alternating and give rise to the phenomena of recurrent vision.
        With the eyes closed, the positive or luminous phases are the
        more prominent. </p>
      <p>This phenomenon may be observed in a somewhat different manner.
        After staring at a bright light we may look towards a
        well-lighted wall. The dark phases will now become the more
        noticeable. </p>
      <p>If, however, we look towards a dimly lighted wall, both the
        dark and bright phases will be noticed alternately. </p>
      <p>The negative effect is usually explained as due to fatigue.
        That position of the retina affected by light is supposed to be
        ‘tired,’ and a negative image to be formed in consequence of
        exhaustion. By this exhaus tion is meant either the presence of
        fatigue-stuffs, or the breaking-down of the sensitive element of
        the tissue, or both of these. In such a case we should expect
        that this fatigue, with its consequent negative image, would
        gradually and finally disappear on the restoration of the retina
        to its normal condition. </p>
      <p>We find, however, that this is not the case, for the negative
        image recurs with alternate positive. The accepted theory of
        fatigue is incapable of explaining this phenomenon. </p>
      <p>In the sensitive silver cell, we found that the molecular
        strain produced by light gave rise to a current of response, and
        that on the cessation of light an oscillatory after-effect was
        produced. The alternating after-effect in the retina points to
        an exactly similar process. </p>
      <p><i>Binocular alternation of vision.</i> — It was while
        experimenting on the phenomena of recurrent vision that I
        discovered the curious fact that in normal eyes the two do not
        see equally well at a given instant, but that the visual effect
        in each eye undergoes fluctuation from moment to moment, in such
        a way that the sensation in the one is complementary to that in
        the other, the sum of the two sensations remaining approximately
        constant. Thus they take up the work of seeing, and then,
        relatively speaking, resting, alternately. This division of
        labour, in binocular vision, is of obvious advantage. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 111.—Stereoscopic Design</b> </p>

        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>As regards maximum sensation in the two retinæ there is then a
        relative retardation of half a period. This may be seen by means
        of a stereoscope, carrying, instead of stereo-photographs,
        incised plates through which we look at light. The design
        consists of two&nbsp; slanting cuts at a suitable distance from
        each other. One cut, R, slants to the right, and the other, L,
        to the left (see fig. 111). When the design is looked at through
        the stereoscope, the right eye will see, say R, and the left L,
        the two images will appear superimposed, and we see an inclined
        cross. When the stereoscope is turned towards the sky, and the
        cross looked at steadily for some time, it will be found, owing
        to the alternation already referred to, that while one arm of
        the cross begins to be dim, the other becomes bright, and vice
        versa. The alternate fluctuations become far more conspicuous
        when the eyes are closed; the pure oscillatory after-effects are
        then obtained in a most vivid manner. After looking through the
        stereoscope for ten seconds or more, the eyes are closed. The
        first effect observed is one of darkness, due to the rebound.
        Then one luminous arm of the cross first projects aslant the
        dark field, and then slowly disappears, after which the second
        (perceived by the other eye) shoots out suddenly in a direction
        athwart the first. This alternation proceeds for a long time,
        and produces the curious effect of two luminous blades crossing
        and recrossing each other. </p>
      <p>Another method of bringing out the phenomenon of alternation in
        a still more striking manner is to look at two different sets of
        writing, with the two eyes. The resultant effect is a blur, due
        to superposition, and the inscription cannot be read with the
        eyes open. But on&nbsp; closing them, the composite image is
        analysed alternately into its component parts, and thus we are
        enabled to read better with eyes shut than open. </p>
      <p>This period of alternation is modified by age and by the
        condition of the eye. It is, generally speaking, shorter in
        youth. I have seen it vary in different individuals from 1? to
        10? or more. About 4? is the most usual. With the same
        individual, again, the period is somewhat modified by previous
        conditions of rest or activity. Very early in the morning, after
        sleep, it is at its shortest. I give below a set of readings
        given by an observer: </p>
      <p>&nbsp; Period&nbsp;&nbsp; Period <br>
        8 a.m. 3? 6 p.m. 5·4? <br>
        12 noon 4? 9&nbsp; " 5·6? <br>
        3 p.m. 5? 11&nbsp; " 6·5? </p>
      <p>Again, if one eye be cooled and the other warmed, the retinal
        oscillation in one eye is quicker than in the other. The quicker
        oscillation overtakes the slower, and we obtain the curious
        phenomenon of ‘visual beats.’ </p>
      <p><i>After-images and their revival.</i> — In the experiment with
        the stereoscope and the design of the cross, the after-images of
        the cross seen with the eyes closed are at first very
        distinct—so distinct that any unevenness at the edges of the
        slanting cuts in the design can be distinctly made out. There
        can thus be no doubt of the ‘objective’ nature of the strain
        impression on the retina, which on the cessation of direct
        stimulus of light gives rise to after-oscillation with the
        concomitant visual recurrence. This recurrence may therefore be
        taken as a proof of the physical strain produced on the&nbsp;
        retina. The recurrent after-image is very distinct at the
        beginning and becomes fainter at each repetition; a time comes
        when it is difficult to tell whether the image seen is the
        objective after-effect due to strain or merely an effect of
        ‘memory.’ In fact there is no line of demarcation between the
        two, one simply merges into the other. That this ‘memory’ image
        is due to objective strain is rendered evident by its
        recurrence. </p>
      <p>In connection with this it is interesting to note that some of
        the undoubted phenomena of memory are also recurrent. ‘Certain
        sensations for which there is no corresponding process outside
        the body are generally grouped for convenience under this term
        [memory]. If the eyes be closed and a picture be called to
        memory, it will be found that the picture cannot be held, but
        will repeatedly disappear and appear.’[20] </p>
      <p>The visual impressions and their recurrence often persist for a
        very long time. It usually happens that owing to weariness the
        recurrent images disappear; but in some instances, long after
        this disappearance, they will spontaneously reappear at most
        unexpected moments. In one instance the recurrence was observed
        in a dream, about three weeks after the original impression was
        made. In connection with this, the revival of images, on closing
        the eyes at night, that have been seen during the day, is
        extremely interesting. </p>
      <p><i>Unconscious visual impression.</i> — While repeating certain
        experiments on recurrent vision, the above phenomenon became
        prominent in an unexpected&nbsp; manner. I had been intently
        looking at a particular window, and obtaining the subsequent
        after-images by closing the eye; my attention was concentrated
        on the window, and I saw nothing but the window either as a
        direct or as an after effect. After this had been repeated a
        number of times, I found on one occasion, after closing the eye,
        that, owing to weariness of the particular portion of the
        retina, I could no longer see the after-image of the window;
        instead of this I however saw distinctly a circular opening
        closed with glass panes, and I noticed even the jagged edges of
        a broken pane. I was not aware of the existence of a circular
        opening higher up in the wall. The image of this had impressed
        itself on the retina without my knowledge, and had undoubtedly
        been producing the recurrent images which remained unnoticed
        because my principal field of after-vision was filled up and my
        attention directed towards the recurrent image of the window.
        When this failed to appear, my field of after-vision was
        relatively free from distraction, and I could not help seeing
        what was unnoticed before. It thus appears that, in addition to
        the images impressed in the retina of which we are conscious,
        there are many others which are imprinted without our knowledge.
        We fail to notice them because our attention is directed to
        something else. But at a subsequent period, when the mind is in
        a passive state, these impressions may suddenly revive owing to
        the phenomenon of recurrence. This observation may afford an
        explanation of some of the phenomena connected with ocular
        phantoms and hallucinations not traceable to any disease. In
        these&nbsp; cases the psychical effects produced appear to have
        no objective cause. Bearing in mind the numerous visual
        impressions which are being unconsciously made on the retina, it
        is not at all unlikely that many of these visual phantoms may be
        due to objective causes. </p>

      <p>[19] As an instance of this I may mention the experiment which
        I saw on the quick fusion of metals exhibited at the Royal
        Institution by Sir William Roberts-Austen (1901), where, owing
        to the glare and the dense fumes, it was impossible to see what
        happened in the crucible. But I was able to see every detail on
        closing the eyes. The effects of the smoke, being of less
        luminescence, cleared away first, and left the after-image of
        the molten metal growing clearer on the retina. </p>

        <b>CHAPTER XX</b>
        <p><b>GENERAL SURVEY AND CONCLUSION</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>We have seen that stimulus produces a certain excitatory change
        in living substances, and that the excitation produced sometimes
        expresses itself in a visible change of form, as seen in muscle;
        that in many other cases, however — as in nerve or retina —
        there is no visible alteration, but the disturbance produced by
        the stimulus exhibits itself in certain electrical changes, and
        that whereas the mechanical mode of response is limited in its
        application, this electrical form is universal. </p>
      <p>This irritability of the tissue, as shown in its capacity for
        response, electrical or mechanical, was found to depend on its
        physiological activity. Under certain conditions it could be
        converted from the responsive to an irresponsive state, either
        temporarily as by anæsthetics, or permanently as by poisons.
        When thus made permanently irresponsive by any means, the tissue
        was said to have been killed. We have seen further that from
        this observed fact — that a tissue when killed passes out of the
        state of responsiveness into that of irresponsiveness; and from
        a confusion of ‘dead’ things with inanimate matter, it has been
        tacitly assumed that inorganic substances, like dead&nbsp;
        animal tissues, must necessarily be irresponsive, or incapable
        of being excited by stimulus—an assumption which has been shown
        to be gratuitous. </p>
      <p>This ‘unexplained conception of irritability became the
        starting-point,’ to quote the words of Verworn,[21] ‘of
        vitalism, which in its most complete form asserted a dualism of
        living and lifeless Nature.... The vitalists soon,’ as he goes
        on to say, ‘laid aside, more or less completely, mechanical and
        chemical explanations of vital phenomena, and introduced, as an
        explanatory principle, an all-controlling unknown and
        inscrutable “force hypermécanique.” While chemical and physical
        forces are responsible for all phenomena in lifeless bodies, in
        living organisms this special force induces and rules all vital
        actions. </p>
      <p>‘Later vitalists, however, attempted no analysis of vital
        force; they employed it in a wholly mystical form as a
        convenient explanation of all sorts of vital phenomena.... In
        place of a real explanation a simple phrase such as “vital
        force” was satisfactory, and signified a mystical force
        belonging to organisms only. Thus it was easy to “explain” the
        most complex vital phenomena.’ </p>
      <p>From this position, with its assumption of the super-physical
        character of response, it is clear that on the discovery of
        similar effects amongst inorganic substances, the necessity of
        theoretically maintaining such dualism in Nature must
        immediately fall to the ground. </p>
      <p>In the previous chapters I have shown that not the fact of
        response alone, but all those modifications in&nbsp; response
        which occur under various conditions, take place in plants and
        metals just as in animal tissues. It may now be well to make a
        general survey of these phenomena, as exhibited in the three
        classes of substances. </p>
      <p>We have seen that the wave of molecular disturbance in a living
        animal tissue under stimulus is accompanied by a wave of
        electrical disturbance; that in certain types of tissue the
        stimulated is relatively positive to the less disturbed, while
        in others it is the reverse; that it is essential to the
        obtaining of electric response to have the contacts leading to
        the galvanometer unequally affected by excitation; and finally
        that this is accomplished either (1) by ‘injuring’ one contact,
        so that the excitation produced there would be relatively
        feeble, or (2) by introducing a perfect block between the two
        contacts, so that the excitation reaches one and not the other.
      </p>
      <p>Further, it has been shown that this characteristic of
        exhibiting electrical response under stimulus is not confined to
        animal, but extends also to vegetable tissues. In these the same
        electrical variations as in nerve and muscle were obtained, by
        using the method of injury, or that of the block. </p>
      <p>Passing to inorganic substances, and using similar experimental
        arrangements, we have found the same electrical responses evoked
        in metals under stimulus. </p>
      <p>Negative variation. — In all cases, animal, vegetable, and
        metal, we may obtain response by the method of negative
        variation, so called, by reducing the excitability of one
        contact by physical or chemical means. Stimulus causes a
        transient diminution of the existing current,&nbsp; the
        variation depending on the intensity of the stimulus (figs. 4,
        7, 54). </p>

          Metal</b> </p>

        <p><img src="fig112.jpg" width="450" height="119"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The normal response in nerve is represented ‘down.’ In this and
        following figures, (A) is the record of responses in animal, (P)
        in plant, and (M) in metal. </p>
      <p><i>Relation between stimulus and response.</i> — In all three
        classes we have found that the intensity of response increases
        with increasing stimulus. At very high intensities of stimulus,
        however, there is a tendency of the response to reach a limit
        (figs. 30, 32, 84). The law that is known as Weber-Fechner’s
        shows a similar characteristic in the relation between stimulus
        and sensation. And if sensation be a measure of physiological
        effect we can understand this correspondence of the
        physiological and sensation curves. We now see further that the
        physiological effects themselves are ultimately reducible to
        simple physical phenomena. </p>
      <p><i>Effects of superposition.</i> — In all three types,
        ineffective stimuli become effective by superposition. </p>
      <p>Again, rapidly succeeding stimuli produce a maximum effect,
        kept balanced by a force of restitution, and continuation of
        stimulus produces no further effect, in the three cases alike
        (figs. 17, 18, 86). </p>
      <p><i>Uniform responses. </i>— In the responses of animal,
        vegetable, and metal alike we meet with a type where the
        responses are uniform (fig. 112). </p>
      <p><i>Fatigue.</i> — There is, again, another type where fatigue
        is exhibited. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 113. — Fatigue (A) in Muscle, (P) in Plant, (M) in
          Metal</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig113.jpg" width="400" height="162"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The explanation hitherto given of fatigue in animal tissues —
        that it is due to dissimilation or breakdown of tissue,
        complicated by the presence of fatigue-products, while recovery
        is due to assimilation, for which material is brought by the
        blood-supply — has long been seen to be inadequate, since the
        restorative effect succeeds a short period of rest even in
        excised bloodless muscle. But that the phenomena of fatigue and
        recovery were not primarily dependent on dissimilation or
        assimilation becomes self-evident when we find exactly similar
        effects produced not only in plants, but also in metals (fig.
        113). It has been shown, on the other hand, that these effects
        are primarily due to cumulative residual strains, and that a
        brief period of rest, by removing the overstrain, removes also
        the sign of fatigue. </p>
      <p><i>Staircase effect. </i>— The theory of dissimilation due to
        stimulus reducing the functional activity below par, and thus
        causing fatigue, is directly negatived by what is known as the
        ‘staircase’ effect, where successive equal stimuli produce
        increasing response. We saw an&nbsp; exactly similar phenomenon
        in plants and metals, where successive responses to equal
        stimuli exhibited an increase, apparently by a gradual removal
        of molecular sluggishness (fig. 114). </p>

        <p><img src="fig114.jpg" width="350" height="148"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Increased response after continuous stimulation. — An effect
        somewhat similar, that is to say, an increased response, due to
        increased molecular mobility,&nbsp; is also shown sometimes
        after continuous stimulation, not only in animal tissues, but
        also in metals (fig. 115). </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 115. — Increased Response after Continuous Stimulation
          in Nerve and Metal</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig115.jpg" width="400" height="190"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The normal response in animal tissue is represented ‘down,’ in
        metal ‘up.’ </p>
      <p><i>Modified response.</i> — In the case of nerve we saw that
        the normal response, which is negative, sometimes becomes
        reversed in sign, i.e. positive, when the specimen is stale. In
        retina again the normal positive response is converted into
        negative under the same conditions. Similarly, we found that a
        plant when withering often shows a positive instead of the usual
        negative response (fig. 28). On nearing the death-point, also by
        subjection to extremes of temperature, the same reversal of
        response is occasionally observed in plants. This reversal of
        response due to peculiar molecular modification was also seen in
        metals. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 116. — Modified Abnormal Response in (A) Nerve and (M)
          Metal converted into Normal, after Continuous Stimulation</b>
      </p>

        <p><img src="fig116.jpg" width="450" height="212"></p>
      </center>
      <p>(A) is the record for nerve (recording galvanometer not being
        dead-beat shows after-oscillation); the abnormal ‘up’ is
        converted into normal ‘down’ after continuous stimulation. (M)
        is the record for metal, the abnormal ‘down’ being converted
        into normal ‘up’ after like stimulation. </p>
      <p>But these modified responses usually become normal when the
        specimen is subjected to stimulation either strong or long
        continued (fig. 116). </p>
      <p><i>Diphasic variation.</i> — A diphasic variation is observed
        in nerve, if the wave of molecular disturbance does not reach
        the two contacts at the same moment, or if the rate of
        excitation is not the same at the two points. A similar diphasic
        variation is also observed in the responses of plants and metals
        (figs. 26, 68). </p>
      <p><i>Effect of temperature.</i> — In animal tissues response
        becomes feeble at low temperatures. At an optimum temperature it
        reaches its greatest amplitude, and, again, beyond a maximum
        temperature it is very much reduced. </p>
      <p>We have observed the same phenomena in plants. In metals too,
        at high temperatures, the response is very much diminished
        (figs. 38, 65). </p>
      <p><i>Effect of chemical reagents. </i>— Finally, just as the
        response of animal tissue is exalted by stimulants, lowered by
        depressants, and abolished by poisons, so also we have found the
        response in plants and metals undergoing similar exaltation,
        depression, or abolition. </p>
      <p>We have seen that the criterion by which vital response is
        differentiated is its abolition by the action of certain
        reagents—the so-called poisons. We find, however, that ‘poisons’
        also abolish the responses in plants and metals (fig. 117). Just
        as animal tissues pass from a state of responsiveness while
        living to a state of irresponsiveness when killed by poisons, so
        also we find metals transformed from a responsive to an
        irresponsive condition by the action of similar ‘poisonous’
        reagents. </p>
      <p>The parallel is the more striking since it has long been known
        with regard to animal tissues that the&nbsp; same drug,
        administered in large or small doses, might have opposite
        effects, and in preceding chapters we have seen that the same
        statement holds good of plants and metals also. </p>
      <p><i>Stimulus of light.</i> — Even the responses of such a highly
        specialised organ as the retina are strictly paralleled by
        inorganic responses. We have seen how the stimulus of light
        evokes in the artificial retina responses which coincide in all
        their detail with those produced in the real retina. This was
        seen in ineffective stimuli becoming effective after repetition,
        in the relation between stimulus and response, and in the
        effects produced by temperature; also in the phenomenon of
        after-oscillation. These similarities went even further, the
        very abnormalities of retinal response finding their reflection
        in the inorganic. </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 117. — Abolition of Response in Nerve, Plant, and Metal
          by the Action of the same ‘Poison’</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig117.jpg" width="500" height="175"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The first half in each set shows the normal response, the
        second half the abolition of response after the application of
        the reagent. </p>
      <p>Thus living response in all its diverse manifestations is found
        to be only a repetition of responses seen in the inorganic.
        There is in it no element of mystery or caprice, such as we must
        admit to be applied in the&nbsp; assumption of a hypermechanical
        vital force, acting in contradiction or defiance of those
        physical laws that govern the world of matter. Nowhere in the
        entire range of these response-phenomena — inclusive as that is
        of metals, plants, and animals — do we detect any breach of
        continuity. In the study of processes apparently so complex as
        those of irritability, we must, of course, expect to be
        confronted with many difficulties. But if these are to be
        overcome, they, like others, must be faced, and their
        investigation patiently pursued, without the postulation of
        special forces whose convenient property it is to meet all
        emergencies in virtue of their vagueness. If, at least, we are
        ever to understand the intricate mechanism of the animal
        machine, it will be granted that we must cease to evade the
        problems it presents by the use of mere phrases which really
        explain nothing. </p>
      <p>We have seen that amongst the phenomena of response, there is
        no necessity for the assumption of vital force. They are, on the
        contrary, physico-chemical phenomena, susceptible of a physical
        inquiry as definite as any other in inorganic regions. </p>
      <p>Physiologists have taught us to read in the response-curves a
        history of the influence of various external agencies and
        conditions on the phenomenon of life. By these means we are able
        to trace the gradual diminution of responsiveness by fatigue, by
        extremes of heat and cold, its exaltation by stimulants, the
        arrest of the life-process by poison. </p>
      <p>The investigations which have just been described&nbsp; may
        possibly carry us one step further, proving to us that these
        things are determined, not by the play of an unknowable and
        arbitrary vital force, but by the working of laws that know no
        change, acting equally and uniformly throughout the organic and
        the inorganic worlds. </p>
