      <b>Every</b> tree within reach of human greed and ingenuity now
      can be exploited for free electricity -- "Elec-Treecity", as it
      were -- or "Tree-lectricity", if you prefer.<br>

      Inquiring minds might text/tweet, "WTF ru babbling about?", to
      which crass social intercourse a studied mind can respond, "FYI,
      read/share the attached file", viz :<br>

      <b>Voltree</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      In 2010, Gordon Wadle and Kris Lagadinos received US Patent
      US7667340 for their novel method to produce "Power from a
      Non-Animal Organism". The invention exploits the difference in pH
      between the soil and tree roots to generate micro-currents.<br>
      <br>
      Wadle was inspired by lightning, over half of which erupts from
      the ground. The resulting system comprises a metal rod owwied into
      the tree (yes, it hurts, dammit!), a grounding rod, and circuitry
      that produces 2.1 volts, sufficient to maintain a full charged
      Ni-Cd battery and LED light load. His partner Chris Lagadinos
      designed the circuitry to filter and amplify the collected energy
      to charge a battery. It could be designed to generate 12 volts and
      one amp of power, which is useful power level that can power many
      small tools and appliances.<br>
      <br>
      The inventors designed the Voltree bioenergy harvester to recharge
      or replace batteries for micropower remote sensors such as
      radiation detectors, climate monitors, and wildfire alert networks
      (RIP Smokey). Voltree Power describes it thus on their <a
        href="http://voltreepower.com/bioHarvester.html">website</a>:<br>
      <blockquote> "When coupled with our software and low-power
        transceiver hardware, this technology makes practical the
        deployment of large-scale, long-term sensor networks in a
        variety of previously inaccessible environments, such as under
        triple-canopy or in hostile terrain. Voltree Powerâ€™s bioenergy
        harvester can be used with temperature and humidity sensors as
        shown below, or with a wide variety of other sensors... [ It is
        ] independent of wind, light, heat gradients, or mechanical
        movement... Weather-resistant and completely quiet....
        Environmentally benign to produce and operate.. Parasitically
        harvests metabolic energy from any large plant without harming
        it... Useful lifetime of the device is only limited by the
        lifetime of the host."<br>
      </blockquote>
      This simple (if you ignore the computer) technology ultimately may
      prove itself to be more practical and more affordable than solar
      or wind power. Wadle said:<br>
      <blockquote> "While the development is in its infancy, it has the
        potential to provide an unlimited supply of constant, clean
        energy without relying on fossil fuels, a power generating plant
        complex or an elaborate transmission network... Now we've
        learned that there is an immense, inexhaustible source of energy
        literally all around us that can be harnessed and converted into
        usable electric power." <br>
      </blockquote>
      Their patent offers some examples with enormous potential for
      electricity and profit, despite being micropower. The inventors
      tested many parameters, e.g.:<br>
      <blockquote> "...[V]oltage yield from different trees using
        different tap configurations, different ground rod quantities,
        and different numbers of taps... different geographic locations
        of the trees, different types of trees, different tap materials,
        different tap depths, different tap diameters, different tap
        heights (i.e., height from ground level), different tree
        altitudes, varying numbers of taps, and varying soil
        conditions...<br>
        <br>
        "[F]actors such as the species and/or the variety of a
        particular plant, e.g., tree, affects the available voltage
        and/or current. For example, an oak tree located 40 feet above
        sea level and a maple tree located 200 feet above sea level
        provided differing amounts of voltage and/or current. Trees
        produced a substantially constant DC voltage (and some AC
        voltage), while other plants produced a less-constant DC voltage
        than trees... The load can draw more current from the tree using
        multiple ground rods...<br>
        <br>
        "The apparatus was used to collect weather related information.
        Voltage readings were collected as a lightning storm approached
        from the West of a test site including a tree. As the storm
        approached the test site, a voltage provided by the tree
        decreased... The closer the storm was relative to the test site,
        the larger the voltage drop... Thus, by measuring the voltage
        provided by the tree 25, it was possible to gather information
        regarding the severity of an approaching storm. After a storm
        had passed over the test site, the voltage provided by the tree
        would return to normal levels within about thirty-five to forty
        minutes."<br>
      </blockquote>
      Besides providing power for gadgets, tree-lectricity can be used
      to stimulate the growth of other plants to new heights! This new
      form of electroculture should revolutionize horticulture some
      century. The Voltree patent describes the experimental cultivation
      broccoli and tomatoes cultivated with tree-lectricity, in which a
      tree was coupled to a group of plants roots, resulting in the
      benefits of increased growth and resistance to pests and frost<br>
      <blockquote> "The energized broccoli plant grew taller than the
        other neighboring broccoli plants, and produced a larger center
        head and more side heads than the other neighboring broccoli
        plants. An additional experiment was performed by energizing the
        smallest and weakest broccoli plant of the group of broccoli
        plants. Within about two to three days of being energized, the
        newly-energized broccoli plant was about the same size and
        height as the neighboring non-energized broccoli plants.<br>
        <br>
        "The energized broccoli plant was not bothered by pests, whereas
        the non-energized broccoli plants were attacked by pests. As
        determined by several visual inspections during the growing
        season, the energized broccoli plant was substantially untouched
        by pests, whereas the non-energized broccoli plants' leaves were
        eaten by pests. As a further experiment, a worm was placed on
        the energized broccoli plant and then onto one of the other
        broccoli plants. After being placed on the "energized" broccoli
        plant, the worm did not eat the broccoli plant and fell off.
        When the same worm was placed on the non-energized broccoli
        plant, the worm began eating the broccoli plant soon thereafter.
        An additional experiment was performed by energizing a
        pest-inhabited broccoli plant. Within about one hour of being
        energized, the pests inhabiting the broccoli plant vacated the
        plant...<br>
        <br>
        "The energized tomato plant grew approximately thirty-three
        percent higher than the non-energized plants. The energized
        tomato plant also produced more tomatoes than the non-energized
        tomato plants. Furthermore, the energized tomato plant survived
        the first two frosts of the winter season, whereas the
        non-energized tomato plants died after the first frost."<br>
      </blockquote>
      The "dirty" electricity collected by the Voltree harvester can be
      cleaned&nbsp; to charge batteries without need for computer
      controls. The Ambient Power Module (APM), invented by Joe Tate, is
      a very simple array of capacitors and diodes that functions as a
      voltage multiplier to convert radio frequencies into electrical
      power sufficient to operate clocks, smoke alarms, and battery
      chargers. <br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="tateapm.jpg" alt="tate apm"
          width="436" height="282"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Tate received US Patent US4628299 (Seismic Warning System Using RF
      Energy Monitor) for the APM. As the title indicates, it also
      provides early warning because fault lines generate radio
      frequencies that increase in amplitude before an earthquake.
      Furthermore, it acts as a passive proximity detector for ships
      &amp; structures. The APM should integrate neatly with the Voltree
      system, or with General Squier's Floraphone:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Tree-tennas and Floraphones</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Major-General George O. Squier, who was the US Army's Chief Signal
      Officer during World War One, developed a method to enlist trees
      as antennas. In July 1919, he published a detailed article
      explaining the technology of "Talking Through The Trees" in <i>The

        Electrical Experimenter</i>:<br>
      <blockquote> "My attention was first called to this phenomenon
        during the course of summer maneuvers of the Army at Camp
        Atascadero, CA, where, due to the prevalence of the dry season
        of the soil, it was found that the regular Army buzzer telephone
        and telegraph sets were inoperative with any ordinary ground or
        earth but became operative when connected to a metallic nail
        driven in the trunk or roots of a live tree. This incident led
        the author to pursue the subject experimentally in the autumn of
        1904 continuing the experiments to the range of frequencies than
        employed in radio-telegraphy..."<br>
      </blockquote>
      Eventually he determined that trees are "as good as any man-made
      aerial, regardless of the size or extent of the latter, and better
      in the respect that it brings to the operator's ears far less
      static interference."<br>
      <br>

      </div>
      <br>
      The eminent journal <i>Scientific American</i> also introduced
      the public to the technology in July 1919. The article, "With
      Trees For Ears", promised "A Wireless Station Within the Reach of
      Everybody". Apparently they hadn't yet heard of cellphones:<br>
      <blockquote> "It will puzzle the amateur as it has puzzled the
        experts, how a tree, which is certainly well grounded, can also
        be an insulated aerial. The method of getting the disturbances
        in potential from treetop to instrument is so simple as to be
        almost laughable. One climbs a tree to two-thirds of its height,
        drives a nail a couple of inches into the tree, hangs a wire
        therefrom, and attaches the wire to the receiving apparatus as
        if it were a regular lead-in from a lofty copper or aluminum
        aerial. Apparently some of the etheric disturbances passing from
        treetop to ground through the tree are diverted through the wire
        --- and the thermionic tube most efficiently does the rest.<br>
        <br>
        "It is interesting to learn that the tree behaves very much like
        any other aerial; it receives better in dry clear weather than
        in muggy, damp weather. It plucks messages from the ether more
        clearly at night than in the day. It is affected very little by
        rain. It is affected not at all by the presence of other trees;
        so far as has yet been ascertained it makes little difference
        whether one drives his nail in a tree in the forest or a lone
        tree on the plain. Certainly it makes no difference that amounts
        to anything whether the tree be just an ordinary tree or a
        giant...<br>
        <br>
        "A dead tree will not do, and a tree not in leaf is not so
        sensitive as one in full foliage. It makes much difference where
        the nail is driven. General Squier calls the proper place the
        optimum point, and experimentally it has been determined that
        two-thirds of the distance from ground to top is the best place
        -- in a 60-foot tree, 40 feet from the ground.<br>
        <br>
        "One nail is sufficient, and it may be any kind of nail; but
        copper is preferred as not rusting. In practice, if a tree
        station is to be at all permanent, several nails would be driven
        and connected to the same wire, each additional nail up to 6 or
        8 making the diverted current a little stronger. But 40 nails
        apparently produce no clearer signals than half a dozen.<br>
        <br>
        "The tree may serve as a receiving station for several sets,
        either connected in series with the same material or from
        separate terminals.<br>
        <br>
        "[F]or short distances it has been shown that two-way telephonic
        communications is easily established through trees with
        remarkably low values of transmitting antenna current."<br>
      </blockquote>
      The <i>Scientific American</i> article also anticipates the
      TreeVolt device by almost a century:<br>
      <blockquote> "Since a transmitting station is a central point for
        electromagnetic waves sent out in all directions over the
        surface of the earth, a large class of information, such as
        meteorological reports, crop reports, and general news items of
        interest to all, may in time be sent from central points, to be
        received in many places within the radius of influence of the
        signal station, and this, too, by the simplest form of
        apparatus."<br>
      </blockquote>
      General Squier almost waxed florid about his invention: <br>
      <br>
      "The messages carried over this tree telephone and telegram system
      have been named by the writer. They are to be â€˜floragramsâ€™. The
      tree telephone is to be a â€˜floraphoneâ€™; the tree telegraph a
      â€˜floragraphâ€™.<br>
      <blockquote> "The discovery is now announced after experiments
        covering 15 years, beginning in California and continuing
        intermittently until the outbreak of the war, when they went
        forward with vigor as an emergency means of communication. The
        system was utilized during the war in listening-in on the German
        radio communication..."<br>
        <br>
        "Without entering into the details of these preliminary
        experiments here it may be said that one of the best receiving
        arrangements is found to be an elevated tree earth-terminal in
        the upper part of the tree top, and an earth consisting
        practically of several short pieces of insulated wire, sealed at
        the outer end, radiating out from a common center, and buried a
        few inches beneath the surface of the ground in the neighborhood
        of the tree. It was soon found that a tree-antenna could be used
        efficiently as a multiple radio receiving set over widely
        different wavelengths, receiving either from separate terminals
        at the same or different heights of the tree, or in series from
        the same terminal.<br>
        <br>
        "This same type of circuit was employed in an inverse manner for
        radio-telephonic transmitting purposes, although the experiments
        thus far have been limited to short distances. It was found that
        2-way radio-telephonic communication was easily established with
        remarkably low values of transmitting antenna current. A number
        of trees can be connected up to give the effect of one large
        antenna."<br>
      </blockquote>
      <b>The Spray-On Antenna</b><br>
      <br>
      Although it defies conventional antenna technology, the proven
      "Spray On Antenna" invented by <a
        href="sutera/sutera.htm">Anthony
        Sutera and Rhett Spencer</a> is a new paradigm that has been
      adopted by some military and emergency services.<br>
      <br>
      The spray is formulated with proprietary nano-capacitors that
      minimize the magnetic field in Near Field Magnetic Induction
      (NFMI). That allows the radiation of an amplified signal with no
      additional power input, besides increasing range, improving
      efficiency and saving energy.<br>
      <br>
      When sprayed, the particles chemically weld together in a solid
      form that greatly improves antenna performance, e.g.: a test with
      an RFID chip with 5-foot range transmitted to 700 feet when
      connected to the spray-on antenna.<br>
      <br>
      In Sutera's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWAKqxZslK8">video


        presentation</a> of the product, he says:<br>
      <blockquote> "We have come up with a material that when you spray
        it on, it lays out just in the right pattern and all of these
        little capacitors charge and discharge extremely quickly in real
        time and they don't create any heat."<br>
      </blockquote>
      Spencer, et al. received US Patent US9088071 (Techniques for
      Conductive Particle Based Material). In abstract, it is described
      thus:<br>
      <blockquote> "An antenna system and method for fabricating an
        antenna are provided. The antenna system includes a substrate
        and an antenna. The antenna includes a conductive particle based
        material applied onto the substrate. The conductive particle
        based material includes conductive particles and a binder. When
        the conductive particle based material is applied to the
        substrate, the conductive particles are dispersed in the binder
        so that at least a majority of the conductive particles are
        adjacent to, but do not touch, one another."<br>
      </blockquote>
      The nano-particles probably including copper, which is mentioned
      in their patent. If you're curious, the thrilling manufacture of
      nano-capacitors also is described in patents US9802050 and
      US7428137.<br>
      <br>
      <b>W-Waves</b><br>
      <br>
      Trees have plenty to say about all this and more (via W-Waves), if
      you are to believe O. <a href="http://www.darkmatterwaves.com">Ed
        Wagner</a> ( Wagner Research Laboratory, Rogue River, OR):<br>
      <blockquote> "In 1988 I discovered waves in plants. I called them
        W-waves because they were first observed in live wood. These
        waves travel throughout plants. I also found these waves were
        present in other materials such as salt solution filled pourous
        materials and likely all matter everywhere since I have detected
        them everywhere I have searched. I found that W-waves also
        travel between plants and facilitate plant communication2. If I
        wounded one plant I found an almost immediate response in nearby
        plants... [T]he oscillations of W-waves in plant material seems
        to organize charge so that we see periodicity in the
        organization of charge in plants. Charge is the only thing other
        than dark matter that is relatively free to move through
        ordinary matter... These waves seem to interact with ordinary
        matter to control charge location, matter displacement, life
        organization, and provide communication.<br>
        <br>
        "The variable velocities found for these waves may provide
        better and more versatile means of communication throughout the
        universe. These waves may travel many times faster than light
        under the proper conditions since they appear to be non-
        electromagnetic. They may provide communication with the most
        remote locations within reasonable times.<br>
        <br>
        "These versatile waves may explain many of the controversial
        anomalous phenomena found on earth such as dowsing, mental
        telepathy, acupuncture, person to person healing, communication
        between plants and between plants and humans, and other related
        phenomena."<br>

      <br>
      Several other paths to plant-based electrical power are being
      explored by researchers, though they seem to be a long way to go
      for an electron. For example, scientists at UC Berkeley have
      devised up a technique to generate energy from genetically
      modified tobacco. The extract of cultured tobacco plant cells is
      applied to a substrate to produce solar power. Others have
      prototyped a method to exploit the dielectric liquid-gas interface
      during evaporation. The moving interface changes the liquid's
      electrical properties. When a capacitor is placed on the surface
      during evaporation a potential of 2-5 Âµvolts is generated. The Bio
      Volt team from MIT created a prototype device to transmute
      cellulose biomass to electricity. It requires 6 months to recharge
      a cellphone battery, but it costs only a few dollars to construct,
      and waste biomass is widely available and abundant. The power can
      be increased by connecting several units.<br>

      Meanwhile, now you know how to light an LED with a tree. It isn't
      much, but "Better to light an LED than to curse the darkness",
