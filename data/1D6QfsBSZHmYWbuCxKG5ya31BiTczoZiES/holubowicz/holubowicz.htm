        (July 2004/2007) </p>
      <center><b><font size="+1">Gun-Engine</font></b></center>
      <p>While current engines made us masters of converting useful
        forms of energy into useless energy, I propose to reverse that.
      </p>
      <p>Current engines waste more than 80% of the energy in fuel,
        utilizing only a fraction of the available energy, as typical
        combustion engines are full of inherit causes of inefficiency.
        The major blunder is the current cooling system based on a
        radiator that disposes heat -- and thus, heats up the
        environment. The environment stores that heat as a useless form
        of energy as we have not yet develop a technology that would use
        it. </p>
      <p>I've found one way to utilize that heat, and so propose a high
        efficiency engine that converts this engine heat into extra
        work. The conversion quadruples efficiency -- thus fuel
        consumption and GHG emission are cut by 80%. In addition the NOx
        emission is eliminated. </p>
      <p>In the name of Kyoto accord I'm asking you to pass this
        information on to a proper person that is interested in
        improving living conditions in urban environment densely crowded
        with cars and trucks. </p>
      <p>The gun-engine operates unexpectedly well! Amazingly much
        better than expected. Runs so cool and is immune to variations
        of the ignition point completely. We run it without any cooling
        at all. The director of automotive department of the University
        cannot stop complementing me. To find out why it is cool I
        suggested to test temperature gradient by placing 16 temperature
        probes at strategic points of the gun-engine. At this point I
        want to tell you the difference between my first prototype
        (blown about 3 years ago) and this one. My first prototype had
        cylinder prolonged only 1" and this one is prolonged 2" so the
        bullet travels about 3 times longer distance in this and that
        expands exhaust better. My conclusion is (might be too hectic,
        but probably correct) that the harmonic oscillations of the
        pressure does produce extra expansions, therefore the total
        expansion consists of major expansion (like in diesel) plus
        summation of all extra expansions and that converts all the
        energy released from fuel into work. The gun-engine consumes so
        little fuel that it is difficult to measure precisely. </p>
      <p>I think that all the thermodynamics of today's engines is a big
        B.S. developed by those who wasted $Billions in grants, to cover
        the lack of performance. </p>

      <p>MQ: I suppose we should start by first getting a little
        information on yourself. What is your background and what lead
        you to start developing the Gun-engine? </p>
      <p>I'm a physicist skilled in QED (Quantum Electro Dynamics)
        rather than in engines. Severely crippled, over sixty, I’ve been
        on social assistance since a stroke paralyzed my body over 8
        years ago. Therefore I sit in an empty (subsidized) apartment,
        and instead of being depressed I try to save our planet earth,
        meaning that I think and invent. </p>
      <p>One day, busy with trying to develop a theory of anti-gravity,
        I had been moved to Earth by my son Greg (I have three sons and
        a daughter). Greg challenged me to improve combustion engines,
        before completing my anti-gravity theory. He said that every
        engine is only 20% efficient and that was unbelievable. I said
        that if that is true, I would have no problem improving engines.
      </p>
      <p>He insisted that it is true, so I accepted the challenge
        saying: <br>
        - “Three-phase electric motors are about 94 % efficient so it
        would be difficult to improve that; <br>
        - “Dear son any device that is only 20% efficient should be easy
        to improve; <br>
        - “It should be easy because the inefficiency must be caused by
        a very poor design, so it is only to change the principle of
        operation and the design.” </p>
      <p>My son laughed! </p>
      <p>I sat and wrote a plan to go ahead with a new challenge. 8
        years later I received certificates of filing for patents from
        patent offices. (patent pending) </p>
      <p>Q: How does the Gun-engine differ from standard automotive
        engines that are on the market? What makes your design better? </p>
      <p>My gun-engine has many things in common with a traditional
        engine, (induction and exhaust evacuation valves, crankshaft,
        etc.) yet it is different since it explodes fuel; traditional
        engines cannot withstand the explosions. The key point of
        difference is that the explosions of fuel vapor pre-mixed with
        air (homogeneous fuel) do not act on the primary piston that
        produces work, but rather on an additional piston that floats on
        a compressible air pocket. This arrangement introduces certain
        delaying of pressure building over the primary piston that
        produces work. This provides the important opportunity to
        improve torque up to 70 to 90 times without fuel consumption
        increase. </p>
      <p>Also, the arrangement changed torque vs. Speed, and power vs.
        speed characteristics. The torque is independent of speed, and
        power is in proportion to speed, which eliminates the need to
        use transmission or reduction gears. In addition, this new
        arrangement eliminates the need for advancing the ignition,
        which is responsible for related parasitic torque in every
        traditional engine. Therefore the arrangement also allows
        development of transmission-free gadgetry such as cars and
        trucks. </p>
      <p>Every traditional engine is infested with causes of
        inefficiency; therefore, it is bad by design. I've eliminated
        most of the causes, so I believe my gun-engine is better by
        design. One of the most important causes of the inefficiency is
        the waste of heat by cooling through a radiator. Another not
        less important cause of the inefficiency is the release of hot,
        incompletely-expanded exhaust. I've replaced the radiator -- the
        major cause of the inefficiency in every traditional engine --
        with an internal cooling that preserves heat, which could be
        converted into extra work. </p>
      <p>I've integrated a gun with this engine, therefore the expansion
        of exhaust is to, or even below, the atmospheric pressure. </p>
      <p>Traditional engines work in a four stroke cycle, (some in a two
        stroke cycle) yet my gun-engine uses a four-stroke cycle during
        starting and to reach the destined speed, upon which it switches
        automatically to a twelve-stroke cycle that converts all the
        energy released from fuel into work. </p>
      <p>The twelve-stroke cycle comprises: <br>
        - an induction stroke to supply fuel vapor with air into
        explosion chamber; <br>
        - a compression stroke to initiate explosions trough the
        compression heat; <br>
        - primary power stroke similar to that in traditional engines
        and; <br>
        - up to four compression and four extra power strokes that
        convert this energy that is wasted in traditional engines into
        extra work. </p>
      <p>The conversion does quadruple the efficiency over that of
        traditional engines, and in combination with elimination of
        transmission, allows construction of a vehicle capable of
        exceeding 220 mpg in mileage. </p>
      <p>Q: How do you see your Gun-engine competing with the best of
        today's engines in the market place? When do you see your engine
        entering the market? </p>
      <p>To begin with, this engine is cheaper to produce due to
        elimination of some production processes and complexities. As
        the gun-engine can accept any fuel, including hydrogen, the
        owner of the vehicle could select the most economic fuel on the
        market. With the greatly-improved mileage of a transmission-free
        vehicle exceeding 220 mpg would naturally eliminate traditional
        engines from the market altogether. </p>
      <p>In addition, if properly financed, the gun-engine should
        prevent the highly-advertised fuel cell from entering into
        market as its efficiency is much below that of my gun-engine. I
        do believe that Hydrogen should not be wasted as oil resources
        have been, so my advice is to rethink the fuel cell technology.
        It should be perfected prior to entering into mass production
        stage. </p>
      <p>I also believe that the gun-engine which could use existing and
        futuristic fuel infrastructure is a much better alternative to
        highly financed, pretty expensive, yet not very reliable
        technology, the mass production of which does not exist.
        However, the existing production facilities and methods for
        traditional engines could easily be adapted to mass-produce the
        gun-engine. </p>
      <p>I also think that a device that could accept many fuels or fuel
        blends is much better alternative to one which runs only on very
        pure Hydrogen. </p>
      <p>Q: Can your Gun-engine be scaled down? </p>
      <p>Indeed it can. I've even written a paper on the subject titled
        "Improving mileage" that I would distribute at the Arno
        Technology Fair in Hanover. The president of that fair granted
        me a free booth, so that I could present my technology as a
        better alternative to fuel cells there. </p>
      <p>Q: With all the current claims about the hydrogen economy, what
        do you see happening if your engine was brought to market? Would
        it supplant or support it? </p>
      <p>I do believe that a full-scale introduction of my engine into
        the market would cause a temporary disturbance of the oil
        market. It would certainly have the same impact as a sudden
        increase of oil production to an unimaginable level, like
        quadrupling the supply of oil. That would certainly eliminate
        imports of oil into North America. </p>
      <p>Yet the most important would be the impact of savings of fuel
        reaching the stunning level of 90 % of fuel production. While
        part of the money could be used to increase the quality of life,
        most of that money could be reinvested into more profitable
        ventures. This would eliminate unemployment and move North
        America into a never-known golden age when everybody would have
        good income and medical care. </p>
      <p>Yet the most visible impact would be on the environment, as
        this new efficient gun engine would have the same effect as
        taking out of our streets and roads up to 90% of vehicles.
        Indeed preservation of oil resources for generations to come
        would certainly prolong time needed to build the Hydrogen
        Infrastructure, which would ease transition to a hydrogen era.
        Yet the most important result is that the oil monopoly would not
        be replaced with a hydrogen monopoly, since every individual,
        farmer, logger or trucker would be able to fuel his vehicle or
        tractor with home-made fuel. Indeed the gun-engine supports
        existing as well as futuristic infrastructures. </p>
      <p>Q: What is your vision for the next 5-10 years? Where do you
        see the global energy infrastructure going? </p>
      <p>I do not think five or ten years from now would be different
        than today, because those in power rather care for their own
        career than for the country or the World. One voice of this
        inventor could not convince these that it is worthwhile to
        invest as little as, let's say, $200,000 into this technology as
        a scientific grant. Professors at Universities would do their
        best to prevent that from happening and those at NRC do not have
        any knowledge nor will to do that. The changes could come when
        we are out of oil and have not yet developed any hydrogen
        infrastructure. My role as an inventor is to provide the
        opportunity. </p>
      <p>Politicians decide if that is worth to try, but the new
        government in Canada, very much under the sway of the Bush
        administration, is leading that country away from supporting the
        Kyoto Accord. [Editor's comment: It’s why the current Canadian
        Prime Minister’s election campaign was financed by Alberta and
        international oil interests; they knew they could count on him
        to put their agenda first. And he has complied by already
        canceling government programs designed to promote reducing
        emissions, and no doubt will also follow George Bush’s announced
        way of reducing oil pricing – by removing environmental
        controls!] You could predict on your own the chances of this
        project to succeed. </p>
      <p>Q: Do you have any interested investors or companies looking at
        the gun-engine? </p>
      <p>I had some but could not accept the conditions. As for today I
        am trying to convince a certain European engine manufacturer to
        produce a large marine version of the gun-engine as vessel's
        thrust would be 200,000 Hp power at 100 RPM. I would meet in
        Germany with CEO of German Industry, but am not very optimistic.
        I'm not very optimistic since these companies want exclusive
        rights and I would want to preserve that universal right for
        myself, so would negotiate only one particular application and
        one particular power. I have three partners of my
        soon-to-be-registered enterprise that would be privately owned
        to reduce overhead. I’m obliged to keep it confidential so would
        not tell you what application we would try to introduce to
        market. </p>
      <p>Q: How lightweight would a vehicle be that uses your engine?
        Does the gun-engine require expensive composites? </p>
      <p>A vehicle that uses the gun-engine would be little less heavy,
        (elimination of transmission and lighter gun-engine) yet its
        production costs would be only a fraction of that of current
        engine, since many manufacturing processes could be eliminated
        and the gun-engine does not require difficult processes or
        not-yet-developed materials. In addition, only these parts
        exposed to explosions of fuel would need to be made out of
        metal. The rest could be made of mould-injected plastics, and
        this manufacturing process is less expensive than metal
        processing. </p>
      <p>Q: Why has nobody thought of this concept before? Were they
        stuck in the "same old, same old" routine? </p>
      <p>How could I know why nobody else has not thought about a
        concept like mine? I cannot answer this question, because I do
        not answer questions I do not know the answer to. But you could
        answer why haven't you thought about similar concept. Could you?

        email interviews with Kazimierz Holubowicz from Feb. 19 - March
        3, 2006. Edited by Mary-Sue Haliburton. </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p><b>PESWiki Directory Excerpts ---</b> </p>
      <p>Canadian inventor Kazimierz ("Stan") Holubowicz&nbsp; has come
        up with an environmentally friendly and transmission-free engine
        based on the same mechanics as how a bullet is shot from a gun.
        The engine can run on any liquid or gaseous fuel, including
        acetylene.&nbsp; Initial test results showed 92% efficiency. </p>
      <p><i>How it Works</i> --- The fuel is vaporized before going into
        the combustion chamber.&nbsp; Vaporized fuel combusts much more
        rapidly.&nbsp; The piston moves against an air chamber, which
        then pushes it back into position in a spring-like action once
        the combustion is complete.&nbsp; This prevents mechanical
        stress on the components.&nbsp; Water is injected 8 parts per
        one part fuel, along with the fuel.&nbsp; As the fuel combusts,
        the heat turns the water to steam, augmenting the expansion in
        the chamber.&nbsp; This also absorbs the heat so that the run
        temperature is much lower.&nbsp; The exhaust is only 140 degrees
        Fahrenheit. </p>
      <p>A recent test of a Suzuki engine on a dynamometer showed a 14%
        increase in power using just 10% of the amount of fuel using the
        Gun Engine technology. </p>
      <p>After a bad experience with a previous group who absconded
        money and delayed progress, as of Aug. 4, 2008, the inventor is
        looking for a new team to invest in and develop the
        technology... </p>
      <p>The conversion includes: </p>
      <p>a device to vaporize fuel that also pre-mixes the resulting
        vapor with air in explosive proportion; <br>
        an internal cooling that preserves heat to avoid thermal losses
        infesting today's engines; <br>
        a device to convert the preserved heat into additional work
        (extra mileage); <br>
        replacing original combustion with rapid fuel detonations; <br>
        a device to adjust compression ratio on the run to accept any
        fuel octane; <br>
        meetings of highest pressure acting on work piston with
        horizontal crank; </p>
      <p>As convert detonates fuel vapor, which yields about fourteen
        times higher pressure than max pressure of the original Suzuki,
        I limited fuel supply to 10% of the original spec to avoid
        cylinder bursting, yet the measured power output reading was
        exceeding max power of original Suzuki fully fueled. Also no
        traces of pollutants in emissioons (zero toxic emissions). </p>
      <p>I also run the convert on many fuels including Hydrogen. No
        visible performance were noticed, yet the most important was
        that the convert runs very well on Acetylene that is already in
        production and the distribution infrastructure exists. This fuel
        is important as it is made out of coal and not petroleum. </p>

      <p>This invention deals with the efficiency of engines. It
        proposes to replace current combustion with explosions of fuel
        to eliminate losses of fuel (caused by disintegrations of fuel),
        improve internal pressure, and eliminate black engine deposits
        together with emissions of black particulates. The invention
        proposes to replace the cylinder head of prior art engine with a
        harmonic oscillator that shields the work-piston from explosions
        and eliminates excessive stress in crank and related parts. The
        oscillator is explosion driven. It comprises a gun-device, to
        explode fuel and convert energy released by explosions into
        kinetic energy stored in a free oscillati ng mass. To prevent
        heat losses, water injections replaced current cooling in this
        invention. The heat is preserved in the resulting steam and
        converted to extra work. The conversion does quadruple the
        efficiency, which cuts fuel consumption and GHG emissions in
        80%. In addition, the water injections block NOx synthesis. </p>
