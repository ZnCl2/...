                  thoroughly edited the female principle from the first
                  official edition of the New Testament, with the
                  exception of a few polite mentions of Virgin Mary and
                  Mary Magdalene (who may well have been Jesus’ wife;
                  the heretical 1970s paperback book <i>The Jesus
                    Scroll</i> makes that assertion). The Mother is not
                  so easily suppressed by ignorance, however, and she
                  has appeared to her devotees many times throughout
                  Church history, albeit at irregular intervals. She
                  often makes appointments for her next visit. She
                  usually appears within a globe of white light, wearing
                  a dress and scarf, her feet in a cloud, sometimes
                  holding the infant Jesus. Lightning and thunder,
                  clouds of unusual shapes, and angels sometimes
                  accompany her manifestations. There were over 300
                  reported apparitions of Mary in the 20th century
                  alone. The visitations reviewed here (in
                  "chronological" order) are the most credible of the
                  many such. Several include interesting prophecies,
                  some of which have come to pass.</font></big></div>

                to legend, the Black Madonna was painted by St. Luke the

                painting Mary, she told him about the events in Jesus’
                life that he wrote into his gospel years later. St.
                Helen found the painting in Jerusalem in 326 AD while
                she was there on a pilgrimage. She gave it to her son
                Constantine, who enshrined it in Constantinople. The
                painting is credited with saving the city from a Saracen
                invasion when it was displayed on the city wall; the
                heathen were utterly demoralized and subsequently
                routed.</font> </big></p>

                came to possess it, and presented it to Prince Leo of
                Ruthenia (in northwest Hungary). During an invasion of
                Ruthenia in the 11th century, the king prayed to the
                Blessed Mother for help. A mystic darkness descended on
                the enemy, who began attacking each other in confusion,
                and Ruthenia was saved. The painting was entrusted to
                the care of a Pauline monastery in Czestochowa, Poland.
                The Madonna is called black because of soot coating it,

                appeared and asked them to build a church on Rome’s
                Esquiline hill. John told Pope Liberius of the dream.
                The Pope also had received the same dream, and together
                they went to Esquiline hill, which was covered with snow
                --- on August 5 --- in the outline of a church!
                Construction was begun immediately in conformity with
                the floor plan. The resulting Basilica of Santa Maria
                Maggiore is one of the largest churches on earth.</font></big></div>

                visits from the Blessed Virgin, and she died in 1876.

                grotto and stood above the rosebush. She beckoned to
                Bernadette to approach, and they prayed together.

                present on October 13. Many witnesses saw a bright cloud
                over the beech tree, but only the three children could
                see and hear the woman.</font> </big></p>

                the children for two days in the hope of forcing a
                confession of fraud from them. Though the children had
                been prevented from meeting the Madonna on August 13,
                she appeared to them on August 19 at Valinhos, near the
                site of her first appearance. The Madonna then told them
                that she would appear a final time on October 13, and

                day the Madonna transmitted the prophecy known as the
                Secret of Our Lady of the Rosary. It was a rainy day,
                but newspaper journalists who were eyewitnesses reported
                that the rain stopped suddenly and the sun reappeared.
                In the words of A. Garret, a professor at Coimbra
                University, the sun looked like "a burnished wheel cut
                out of mother of pearl. This disc spun dizzily around...
                It whirled upon itself with mad rapidity, then advanced,
                blood red, towards the Earth, threatening to crush us
                with its weight." Terrified spectators fell to their
                knees in prayer. The sun returned to normal, then twice
                again repeated the prodigy. In addition, the rain-soaked
                clothes of the audience dried out during the brief time
                of the solar phenomenon.</font> </big></p>

                Secret of Our Lady of the Rosary is a three-part
                prophecy that she ordered to be kept secret for 25 years
                or until the death of Lucia, whichever came first.
                Francisco and Jacinta died in the influenza pandemic
                that ravaged Europe in 1918 and 1919. Lucia became a
                Dorothe Sister, and in 1948 she became a Barefoot
                Carmelite in a closed convent at Coimbra. Lucia learned
                to write, and recorded the text of the secret prophecy.
                This was kept in the Bishopric of Leiria until 1943,
                when Pope Pius XII revealed the first two parts through
                the agency of Cardinal Schuster. The final, secret part
                of the prophecy was opened by Pope John XXIII and
                several cardinals in 1960, according to the Madonna's
                directions, but it was not revealed to the public. The
                first section is a vision of Hell. The second part
                predicts World War II. The following segment was

                the Angel cried out in a loud voice: 'Penance, Penance,

                Cross of rough-hewn trunks as of a cork-tree with the
                bark; before reaching there the Holy Father passed
                through a big city half in ruins and half trembling with
                halting step, afflicted with pain and sorrow, he prayed
                for the souls of the corpses he met on his way; having
                reached the top of the mountain, on his knees at the
                foot of the big Cross he was killed by a group of
                soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at him, and in the
                same way there died one after another the other Bishops,
                Priests, men and women Religious, and various lay people
                of different ranks and positions. Beneath the two arms
                of the Cross there were two Angels each with a crystal
                aspersorium in his hand, in which they gathered up the
                blood of the Martyrs and with it sprinkled the souls

                for herself, one for the convent, one for China, and one
                for all humanity. Our Lady requested that a statue of

                showers of rose petals that bore miraculous images of
                Jesus Christ, Virgin Mary, and scenes such as the

                Crucifixion. The apparitions caused much disturbance in
                the community, and the convent was persecuted. All
                records of the apparitions, including Teresita’s diary,
                were destroyed. The statue of Our Lady was hidden by the
                nuns, however, thus saving it from destruction. The
                convent was sealed and the nuns were forbidden to speak
                to any outsiders. Teresita left the convent in the 1950s
                under the pressure of negative media and fraudulent
                "Holy Rose Petal" vendors who were exploiting the

                  March 25, 1945, the Virgin Mary appeared as Our Lady
                  of All Nations and delivered her message to Ida
                  Peerdeman, a single woman who was 40 years old at that
                  time, living in Amsterdam. Ida continued to receive
                  messages from her (56 in all) until 1950. Much
                  emphasis was placed on the Eucharist, which can save
                  the world. Following are excerpts from some of the
                  messages:</font></big></div>

                &nbsp;“I see on my left somebody standing over me in a
                long white garment, full of womanly grace. I understand
                her to be the Blessed Virgin. She lifts up three, then
                four, and finally five fingers while saying to me, "The
                3 stands for March, the 4 for April, and the 5 for May
                5th." Then she shows me her Rosary and says, "This has
                saved you. Persevere to the end [in saying it]." After a
                brief silence she adds, "The prayer is to be made known
                everywhere." Then in front of me I see nothing but
                soldiers, many of them Allies, and the Blessed Virgin is
                pointing to them. She takes the crucifix of her Rosary
                in her hand and points at it and then again to the
                soldiers. I am given to understand that the Cross must
                become the support of the lives of those soldiers, for
                the voice continues: "They will soon go home now ---
                these here", and she points to the troops.</font></big></div>

                the palm of my hand. A cross is being laid down before
                me and I have to take it up. I do so very slowly; it is

                side to side, saying, "Listen, mankind. You will
                preserve peace if you believe in Him. Make this known,"
                she adds. This is repeated three times. While speaking,
                she puts a crucifix in my hand and I have to hold it up
                in all directions for everyone to see. The Lady points
                to the crucifix." (April 21, 1945)</font></big></div>

                "I hear the voice again and suddenly I see a sacrifice
                being offered as in ancient times. The smoke, however,
                hangs over the altar. I hear the voice say, "Yahweh
                warns His people." Then I hear, <br>
                "Be faithful. They have scattered my lambs." Then the
                Lady plants a crucifix upon the sacrificial altar and I
                see, as it were, the whole world gathered around it. The
                people, however, are standing there with downcast looks
                and turned away from the cross. "Come, my faithful
                ones!" the voice now calls and I see a chalice being
                offered to the crowd. "But for a number of them in
                vain", I hear the voice say. I feel an impulse to look
                up and all at once I see the Lady standing before me.
                She smiles, extends her arms and calls invitingly,
                "Come." A large number of men of all sorts is now
                standing before me: "gentlemen", "rough men" and men
                dressed in black (priests and religious). Among then all
                there is a mixture of good and not so good. The Lady
                urges them to follow her, promising to guide them. Now I
                see a long and hard road before me, at the end of which
                there is a great light. "This way", says the Lady, and
                with an impressive gesture she indicates to the men that
                they have to walk along this road. The going is very
                difficult. On both sides men are falling away. The Lady
                watches with motherly solicitude and keeps smiling at
                them compassionately. Then I see written before me, "Be
                renewed in Jesus Christ." After this the Lady looks sad
                and says, "England will find her way back to me." She
                pauses and then adds very slowly and quietly, "So will
                America." Then the Lady disappears and I see a peculiar
                cloud hanging over the world." (July 29, 1945)</font></big></div>

                of 1961, The Virgin Mary appeared to four girls
                (Conchita Gonzales, Mari Loli Mazon, Jacinta Gonzalez,
                and Mari Cruz Gonzalez, ages 11-12) near the village of
                San Sebastian de Garabandal in the Cantabrian Mountains
                of northwest Spain. The girls were praying together when
                they heard a thunderous sound and saw a beautiful angel.
                It said nothing, then disappeared. The girls ran to the
                village church and told everyone about the occurence.
                The angel appeared to them several more times before it
                announced that the Blessed Virgin would appear to them.
                Later that day she appeared in the company of two angels
                with an all-seeing eye above her. She visited the girls
                more than 2,000 times in the next four years. The
                apparition repeatedly urged repentance, and said that a
                miraculous sign will appear some day. Conchita wrote
                this about it in her Diary:</font> </big></p>

                the only one to whom the Blessed Virgin spoke of the
                miracle. She forbade me to say what it will consist of.
                I can't announce the date either until eight days before
                it is due to occur. What I can reveal is that it will
                coincide with an event in the Church and with the feast
                of a saint, martyr of the Eucharist; that it will take
                place at 8:30 on a Thursday evening; that it will be
                visible to all those who are in the village and
                surrounding the mountains; that the sick who are present
                will be cured, and the incredulous will believe. It will
                be the greatest miracle that Jesus will have performed
                for the world. There won't be the slightest doubt that
                it comes from God and that it is for the good of
                mankind. A sign of the Miracle, which it will be

                transmitted into the interior of our souls. It will last
                a very little time, but it will seem a very long time

                June, 1981, six youths from the village of Medjugorje in
                central Yugoslavia met Mother Mary on Mount Podbrdo. The
                apparitions have continued since then, albeit with
                decreasing frequency. Mary sends a message of faith,
                conversions, and fasting to brig peace to Earth. She has
                come to bring humanity back to her son Jesus Christ, and
                she warns that Satan is extremely active now; it is
                necessary to pray often and fervently to defend against
                his assaults. Medjugorje has subsequently become a major
                pilgrimage site for more than 10 million devout
                Christians. The Serbo-Croatian conflict erupted on the
                10th anniversary of the apparition.</font> </big></p>

                these warnings, she will advise a priest of her choice.
                Mirjana's testimony will be a confirmation of the

                me for this, but you must realize that Satan exists. One
                day he appeared before the throne of God and asked
                permission to submit the Church to a period of trial.
                God gave him permission to try the Church for one
                century. This century is under the power of the devil;
                but when the secrets confided to you come to pass, his
                power will be destroyed. Even now he is beginning to
                lose his power and has become aggressive. He is
                destroying marriages, creating divisions among priests
                and is responsible for obsessions and murder. You must
                protect yourselves against these things through fasting
                and prayer, especially community prayer. Carry blessed
                objects with you. Put them in your house, and restore
                the use of holy water...</font> </big></p>

                Father, I do not want to be responsible for the ruin of
                anyone. I am doing my best. The world is being called to
                conversion and reconciliation. In writing to you, Holy
                Father, I am doing only doing my duty. After drafting
                this letter, I gave it to the youngsters so that they
                might ask the Blessed Virgin whether its contents are
                accurate. Ivan Dragicevic relayed the following answer:
                "Yes, the contents of the letter are the truth. You must
                notify first the Supreme Pontiff and then the Bishop".</font>

                primary message of the Blessed Virgin always has been
                one of Peace, Prayer, and Mercy, rather than of her
                prophecies, which are contingent upon the power of
                Prayer. According to Mary, the wrath of God and Jesus
                can be averted (or at least delayed) by repentance and
                the Rosary. This approach to world peace actually seems
                to have worked in the case of the fall of the USSR,
                which also prevented (or long delayed) the invasion of
                Europe by Soviet forces.</font> </big></p>
