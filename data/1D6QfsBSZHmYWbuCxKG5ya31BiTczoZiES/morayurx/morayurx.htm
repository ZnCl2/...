      One hundred years ago (1859) Charles Darwin published his book <i>The
Origin




        of Species</i>. In some ways the reception of evolution in
      biology at that time resembles the present state of reception of
      evolution of the elements; the science of transmutation. <br>
      <br>
      In the following pages we wish to prove that this science of
      transmutation is not only theoretically possible but it is
      continually taking place in nature and can be synthesized by man.
      It is our contention that Transmutation, Activation, and Fission
      are essentially one in the same reaction depending on the
      condition of the material receiving the action and the emanation
      received. <br>
      <i><br>

      (Charge: 1 = 4.803 + 0.003 x 10<sup>-10</sup> e.s.u.) <br>
      <br>
      It is the emanation which, by freeing itself and by projecting its
      disaggregated particles on the surface of other bodies, produces
      the so-called induced radioactivity. This phenomenon exists in all
      substances placed in the neighborhood of a radioactive compound,
      the substance becoming radioactive to a lesser or greater degree
      for various periods of time. Radioactivity, artificially provoked
      in any substance, disappears only after a fairly long time: <br>
      <br>
      All gases or metals placed close to a radioactive substance or on
      which is blown, by means of a long tube, the emanation which it
      disengages, become momentarily radioactive. It being admitted that
      this radioactivity is generated by the freeing of electric
      particles, it must be supposed that these particles are capable of
      being carried along by the air and of attaching themselves like
      dust to other bodies, and possess properties singularly different
      from those of ordinary electricity. It has been demonstrated that
      the emanation of thorium can pass through water and sulphuric acid
      without losing its activity. If a metallic wire charged with
      negative electricity be exposed to the emanation of thorium, it
      becomes radioactive; if this wire be treated with sulphuric acid
      and the residuum then evaporated, it will be found that this
      latter is still radioactive. <br>
      <br>
      The induced radioactivity communicated to an inactive substance
      may be much more intense than that of the radioactive substance
      from which it emanated. When, in an enclosed vessel, containing
      some emanation from a radioactive body (thorium for example), a
      metal plate charged with negative electricity at a high potential
      is introduced, all the particles emitted by the thorium
      concentrate themselves upon it and this plate becomes ten thousand
      times more active, surface for surface, then the thorium itself.
      These facts are not, any more than the preceding ones, explainable
      by the electric current theory. <br>
      <br>
      If a metal (rendered artificially radioactive) is brought to a
      white heat, it loses its radioactivity, which spreads itself over
      the bodies in its neighborhood. Here again, we see atoms behaving
      in a very strange manner. <br>
      <br>
      The phenomenon of induced radioactivity is, then, quite
      unexplainable with energy ideas as to electric particles. It
      cannot be admitted that such particles deposited on a metal can
      remain for weeks in the charged state and be carried along by
      reagents. It would see, from M. Curie’s experiments, that bismuth,
      plunged into a solution of bromide or radium and carefully washed
      immediately, remains radioactive for at least three years. This
      radioactivity would seem even to persist after energetic chemical
      treatment or metallic plating. <br>
      <br>
      In respect to induced radioactivity, certain forms of matter or
      particles can be stored on bodies for a great length of time and
      expend themselves very slowly. In experiments on phosphorescence
      it was noted that sulphide of calcium exposed to the sun for a few
      seconds, radiates invisible light for 18 months, as is proved by
      the possibility of photographing the isolated object in the dark
      room or in the most complete darkness. At the end of 18 months it
      no longer gives any radiation, but still preserves a residual
      particle charge which persists for an indefinite period, and can
      be made visible by causing infrared rays to fall on the surface of
      the isolated body. <br>
      <br>
      A radioactive body was, 50 years ago, compared to a magnet which
      keeps its magnetism forever and can, without losing its power,
      magnetize other bodies. There was not foundation for this
      comparison, for the magnet is not the seat of a constant emission
      of particles into space. It might, however, be employed to explain
      roughly the phenomenon of induced radioactivity, which could be
      reduced to the fact that a radioactive body imparts its particles
      to a neighboring body, as the lodestone gives magnetization to
      fragments of iron near it. If the molecules of the air were
      magnetic (and they are so in a slight degree) a lodestone would
      magnetize them, and they themselves might magnetize others. If
      they preserved their magnetism, we should have particle (which we
      do not) which, like the emanation of radioactive bodies, remain on
      the surface of a metal without losing is properties. <br>
      <br>
      Finally we come to Gamma radiation which do not remain on any
      material and which no magnetic attraction can deviate. These are
      radiations, not particles as the Alpha and Beta particles which
      were first considered above. <br>
      <br>
      The most striking phenomenon may not attract our attention except
      when light is thrown upon them by other phenomena, or when some
      great generalization capable of explaining them forces us to
      examine them more closely. When, in Lavoisier’s experiments,
      hydrogen was found to be electrified, it was only because the
      atoms of this substance had undergone the commencement of
      dissociation. It is curious to note that the first experiment from
      which it could be deduced that matter is changeable had for its
      author the illustrious Lavoisier, whose greatest claim to glory is
      that of endeavoring to prove that matter is indestructible. <br>
      <br>
      Experiments prove that a large number of chemical reactions,
      whether accompanied or unaccompanied by the disengagement of gas,
      produce effluves similar to the cathode rays, and therefore reveal
      a dissociation or change of matter without return during the
      reactions. <br>
      <br>
      Among these reactions the decomposition of water by zinc and
      sulphuric acid or merely by the sodium amalgam, the formation of
      acetylene by carbide of calcium, the formation of oxygen by the
      decomposition of oxygenated water by means of dioxide of
      manganese, and the hydration of quinine sulphate. <br>
      <br>
      As regards quinine sulphate, it presents a highly curious
      phenomenon. Quinine, it is well known, becomes phosphorescent by
      the action of heat, but what was not know at first was that after
      having lost its phosphorescence, if sufficiently heated it becomes
      highly luminous and radioactive on refrigeration. After seeking
      the cause of its phosphorescence on cooling, and pricing it to e
      due to a very light hydration, it was noted that by reason of this
      hydration the substance became radioactive for a few minutes. <br>
      <br>
      Experiments prove that most substances contain a provision of
      radioactive matter which can be expelled by a slight heat and
      spontaneously formed anew; these substances are therefore, like
      ordinary radioactive substances, subject to spontaneous
      dissociation. It is, unless “agitated”, extremely slow. <br>
      <br>
      Spontaneous dissociation has been made evident by means of slight
      heat or bombardment by rays. It is possible, however, by the help
      of various artifices (for instance, by folding the metal over
      itself so as to form a closed cylinder) to allow radioactive
      products to form in the cylinder, the presence of which is
      verified by the measurement of ray counters. The substance thus
      experimented on, however, soon ceases to be active. It has not,
      however, used up all its provisions of radioactivity; it has
      simply lost all that it can emit at the temperature under which
      the operation is effected. But, as with phosphorescent substances
      or radioactive matter, one need but heat it a little for it to
      produce an increased quantity of active effluves. <br>
      <br>
      These researches prove that all substances in nature are
      radioactive, and that this radioactivity is no way a property
      peculiar to a few bodies. All matter, then, tends spontaneously
      towards dissociation. This latter is most often very small,
      because it is hindered by the action of opposing forces. It is
      only exceptionally, and under the influences of light, combustion,
      chemical action, etc., capable of striving against these forces,
      that dissociation reaches a certain intensity. <br>
      <br>
      Having proved by experiments that the dissociation of matter is a
      general phenomenon, it is only reasonable to say that the doctrine
      of the invariability of the weight of atoms, on which all modern
      chemistry is based, is only an illusion resulting entirely from
      lack of out ability to weigh the vibrations. Were our balances
      sufficiently sensitive, all out chemical laws would be considered
      as merely approximations. With proper instruments we should note
      in many circumstances, and especially in chemical reactions, that
      the atoms loses a part of its weight and that, contrary to the
      principle laid down as the basis of chemistry, we do not recover
      in a chemical combination the total weight of the substances
      employed to bring about this combination. <br>
      <br>
      This discussion which has gone on since the beginning of time in
      one place to be picked up in another, plays a great part in
      natural phenomena. It is probably the origin of atmospheric
      electricity and all energy phenomena. <br>
      <br>
      Time, space, matter and energy form the elements of things and are
      the fundamental basis of all our knowledge. Time and space are the
      magnitudes in which we confine the universe, energy is the cause
      of phenomena, and matter their web. The great French scientist, Dr
      LeBon, wrote “matter may be reconverted” (please note, he wrote
      “reconverted”, not just “converted”) into force, not only because
      it is, as I have proved, a particular form of energy but also
      because it is only defined in equations of mechanics by the
      symbols of force”, i.e., energy. <br>
      <br>
      The sun has been giving off energy for hundreds of millions of
      years according to geological records. If the sun continues to
      shine at the expense of its mass in accordance with the theory of
      relativity, it is easy to show that the mass of the sun is
      diminishing at the rate of 4,200,000 tons per second in order to
      supply the energy which pours forth from the sun. Less than 200
      millionth of its energy is intercepted by the planets and their
      satellites. <br>
      <br>
      Now the Theory of Relativity is that the radiation of energy is
      accompanied by a loss of mass. This loss of mass is given as the
      loss of energy (in ergs) divided by the square of the velocity of
      light (9 x 10). Could the sun lose mass at this rate for hundreds
      of millions of years unless its’ mass is millions of times greater
      than science claims? There is something wrong with this theory of
      mass energy or we must have a very imperfect understanding of the
      situation, for at this rate the sun has been squandering its
      resources of matter vs energy so prodigally that it long since
      would have ended in bankruptcy. This proves we must doubtless have
      at present a very imperfect understanding of the situation. <br>
      <br>
      In the far off stellar crucibles we see the same laws being obeyed
      as in our laboratories and according to Dr M Luckeish’s statements
      in his book Foundations of the Universe (Dr Luckeish was the
      Director of Lightning Research Laboratory for General Electric
      Co.), he states as we trace down infinitesimal constituents of the
      atom we find that matter apparently does not exist at all as the
      realistic substance we have supposed it to be. There at its very
      foundation matter seems to consist of electric charges. As Dr
      Steinmetz of General Electric said at one time, in the final
      analysis all things are electricity. That being the case, where
      can we draw the line between energy and matter? Is it not
      evolution of energy and an evolution of matter, energy continually
      changing onto matter and matter into energy? <br>
      <br>
      The atom of matter is known to consist of positive nucleus-protons
      and negative particles of electricity, i.e., electrons. Usually
      electrons are considered to revolve around the nucleus, the number
      varying depending on the element. Thus everywhere from stellar
      space to atomic space we find matter in motion, and when we think
      of how small the protons and electrons are we can see how
      Democritus was not so far from stating the facts when he made his
      bold statement hundreds of years ago that matter, physical
      phenomena, reduced itself to a single item --- motion. Again this
      shows the evolution of energy and matter. <br>
      <br>
      The process of radiation, whether in the form of long heat rays or
      luminous rays or so-called actinic rays or electrical vibrations
      all come under one heading, radiant energy. Where does a vibration
      cease to be energy and become a form of matter or matter a form of
      energy? <br>
      <br>
      The greatest principle of this theory is in the Kinetic Theory of
      Matter which can be pressed into further service in explaining the
      structure of matter which is matter itself. When in 1873 Maxwell
      propounded the electromagnetic theory of light (all radiation),
      his achievement was epochal. The exact manner in which this
      radiant energy traversed space is not known. The quantum theory
      advanced by Planck in 1900 was equally as epochal. Here we have
      the atomistic principle applied to energy instead of having it
      confined only to matter as it has been. In other words, in the
      quantum theory we have the atomic theory applied to physical
      processes. The atom of matter and the atom of electricity (the
      electron) and the atom action (quantum), a product of energy and
      time, all can be explained in the same category. Elements of
      energy of equal magnitude analogous to the equality of electrons
      or atoms of a given element. We use quanta as commonly as we do
      electrons and atoms and molecules. Matter is built of molecules,
      the molecules of atoms and the atoms of electrons and protons.
      Here we see the atomic theory applied to matter, to electricity
      and finally divided into quanta. With such a picture of the
      Universe and of matter we may cease to be surprised at anything,
      but our interest and admiration grow. <br>
      <br>
      The hypothesis of an atomic structure of matter leads of the
      hypothesis of an atomic structure of electricity and on to the
      conception of an elementary quantum of elementary charge
      (electrical charge). Dr Millikan’s work made possible a direct and
      extremely accurate determination of the elementary quantum of
      electricity, i.e., energy into matter. <br>
      <br>
      Energy has a definite elastic rigidity and density and is subject
      to displacement and strain. Dr LeBon, the great French scientist,
      held he had proven that matter was a particular form of energy. It
      is a fact that it is impossible to touch matter without causing
      electricity to come from it. It is also impossible to touch mater
      without heat coming from it. <br>
      <br>
      In 1903, Edgar Larkin, Director of Lowe Observatory (Echo
      Mountain, California), wrote: “Energy is defined as a condition of
      matter in virtue of which any definite portion may affect changes
      in any other definite portion”. (Prof. Baker first wrote this in
      1892 and later discoveries confirm this statement). “Energy then”,
      Dr Larkin continues, “is a state of matter, a result of a
      particular condition or state in which matter may be when any
      observed phase of energy appears”. Dr Larkin continues that these
      two, matter and energy, are the sum total of all that has been
      found during three centuries of incessant research in all that
      portion of the universe which is visible in a 40-inch telescope or
      the most powerful spectroscope ever made. <br>
      <br>
      Or, in other words, matter and energy are possible one at various
      rates of vibration. <br>
      <br>
      In the final analysis, all things are rates of frequency or
      vibration, the evolution of matter into energy and of energy into
      matter. <br>
      <br>
      Let us examine some of the “accepted” reactions that occur in
      nature. The most common of these is the Uranium-Radium series in
      which Uranium fissions or ages to form ordinary lead in a period
      of a little more than 4-1/2 billion years (See Fig. 1 and Fig.
      1a,b,c). <br>
      <br>
      It was the Thorium series that Dr Rutherford must have used in his
      synthesis of Radium from Thorium. <br>
      <br>
      The last of this decay chain is Actinium. <br>
      <b><br>
        FIGURE 1</b>

      </center>
      <br>
      <br>
      Now with the above we have proven that in nature Uranium becomes
      Lead. Thorium becomes Lead, and Actinium becomes Lead. <br>
      <br>
      In the non-chain substances we have shown that there are five
      elements that are known to transmute into seven other elements. <br>
      <br>
      If there are seven elements produced by non-chain reactions, then
      how many more elements are produced by elements with half-life
      reactions that have not yet been explored? <br>
      <br>
      In 1919 Lord Rutherford at Cavendish Laboratories, Cambridge,
      England succeeded in converting nitrogen atoms into oxygen atoms.
      It was not long after that it was found that radium could be grown
      or aged at a rapid rate from Ionium. <br>
      <br>
      The net electric charge of the normal hydrogen atom is 0. The
      positive charge of the nucleus of such an atom is balanced by the
      negative charges of the electrons on the atom’s orbits. In the
      atomic complexity after hydrogen is the atom of heavy hydrogen,
      deuterium. It has a mass of 2, but only a single positive charge
      on the nucleus and a single orbital electron. Its nucleus is
      called a deuteron; this contains an additional particle of unit
      mass, termed a neutron, which has no electric charge. <br>
      <br>
      The next better known elements heavier than deuterium is helium.
      The normal helium atom has a nucleus consisting of 2 protons and 2
      neutrons. It must, therefore, contain 2 orbital electrons. The
      nucleus of the helium atom is an alpha particle. All other atoms
      appear to be made up of combinations of protons, neutrons, and
      alpha particles, with the proper number of orbital electrons to
      insure electrical neutrality (See Fig. 2). <br>
      <b><br>
        FIGURE 2</b>
      <center><img src="fig2.gif" height="209" width="491"></center>

      In helium, the 2 electrons occupy similar orbits. In the next
      substance (lithium), a second group of orbits, or energy level,
      appears, and successive elements contain an additional electron in
      this shell or energy level until there are 8, making, with the 2
      in the innermost energy level, a total of 10 (neo). With the next
      substance, sodium (at. no. 11), a third energy level is reached.
      This development goes on to uranium (at. no. 92, at. wt. 238).
      One, and only one, element is defined for every number in this
      series (See Fig. 3). <br>

      Radiation --- The term radiation has come to include two quite
      different types of energy propagation through space --- one by
      means of wave motion, the other by means of particles. <br>
      Electromagnetic or wave radiation includes a wide range from radio
      waves to cosmic rays. Particle radiation, on the other hand,
      comprises various atomic and subatomic particles set in
      exceedingly rapid motion by the action either of electric fields
      or of radioactive sources. Energy content of these particles
      depends on their mass and speed. When electromagnetic radiation
      interacts with matter, energy is gained or dissipated in discrete
      units called photons. The energy of a photon, called a quantum, is
      proportional to the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation.
      The higher the frequency or the shorter the wavelength, the
      greater the energy of the quantum. When electromagnetic radiation
      interacts with matter in such a manner as to amplify its energy, a
      wide variety of changes is produced depending on the energy of the
      quantum absorbed. <br>

      An example of a change in electronic configuration&nbsp; […] Such
      changes may result in photochemical action though commonly the
      energy is degraded into thermal disturbances, thereby affecting
      only the rate of chemical change, as in vibrational and rotational
      effects. <br>

      <br>
      When a quantum with somewhat higher energy content is absorbed,
      the action may result in ejection of an electron from an atom or
      molecule, photoelectric effect, leaving such an atom or molecule
      positively charged. Thus a pair of ions is produces (radio
      ionization), one positively charged and the other negatively
      charged. This process may give rise to actual chemical change. <br>
      <b><br>
        FIGURE 5</b>
      <center><img src="fig5.gif" height="328" width="549"></center>
      <br>
      When the quantum of energy absorbed corresponds to that of x-rays
      or gamma rays, an electron may be ejected from any of the orbital
      shells of an atom. Such a case of photoelectric effect is
      illustrated in Fig. 5. Since electrons in the inner shells of
      atoms are more firmly held than those in outer shells, a large
      amount of kinetic energy must be imparted t an electron of an
      inner orbit in causing its liberation. <br>
      <br>
      A high energy quantum of electromagnetic radiation causes electron
      back-rush to move through matter with initially high kinetic
      energy, and then this energy is passed along the electron paths in
      production of a multiplicity of ion pairs. The number of such ion
      pairs per unit length of path, specific ionization, increases as
      the kinetic energy of electrons diminishes (Fig. 6). <br>
      <b><br>
        FIGURE 6</b>
      <center><img src="fig6.gif" height="523" width="545"></center>
      <br>
      In some cases, however, the full energy of the quantum is not
      utilized in ejection of an electron from an atom, and the residual
      energy is transformed into a new photon or quantum of lower
      potential energy. The new photon, in turn, produces another ion
      pair and undergoes repeated transformation until all of the energy
      is completely used up in production of ion pairs or thermal
      changes. Thus this process resulting from absorption of high
      energy quanta causes production of vast numbers of ion pairs in
      the matter acted on by the radiation. <br>
      <br>
      When electrons are removed from the inner orbit of atoms, the
      vacancies are filled by electrons dropping in from outer energy
      levels, the consequence being, so far as atomic changes are
      concerned, a change in the number of valence electrons (Fig. 7).
      Such an action may change the atom, or molecule, and result in an
      atomic change such as the change from silver to chromium. <br>

      Whatever frequency of current used and whatever ray or rays used,
      the frequency of the current and the wave length of the ray or
      rays must harmonize so as to blend or synchronize with the natural
      frequency or wavelength of the substance treated so as to produce
      the synchronous action that will set up proper vibration. We might
      coin an expression and call this action a ‘super-ultrasonic
      reaction” between the frequency of current, the wavelength of the
      ray, and the vibratory rate of the substance treated to cause the
      desired catalytic reaction. <br>
      <br>
      By applying combination of certain frequencies generated from
      specially constructed tubes and applying rays from other
      especially constructed tubes to the solution, a catalytic reaction
      is obtained similar to the action of mesons from cosmic rays on
      fission materials. <br>
      <br>
      In the catalytic recovery of ionic minerals it must be remembered
      we are dealing with a dispersed material which nature has not yet
      metallized in the general sense as we know or recognize metals. <br>
      <br>
      The ionic metals may not ionize with the other metal’s atoms to
      unite in a stable metallic form because the ionic metal formed
      again as a reaction product presents itself in its original form
      of ionic metal at the end of the reaction rather than becoming an
      actual part of the final reaction of becoming a stable metal. <br>
      <br>
      Ionic potential is of the greatest importance. All matter
      possesses a natural rate of vibration (frequency). Ionic material
      has elasticity and gives off a natural frequency inherent to the
      natural rate of vibration of the substances and these vibrations
      propagate frequencies which take the form of a displacement of
      oscillations. <br>
      <br>
      When a resilient substance is subject to strain and then set free,
      one of two things may happen; the substance may slowly recover
      from the strain and gradually obtain to its natural state, or the
      oscillating recoil will carry it past its position of equilibrium
      and cause the medium to execute a series of oscillations. If these
      oscillations become violent enough, disintegration and
      transformation will take place because the first flow of
      oscillations is succeeded by a backrush and the first discharge
      will over-run itself and severe recoil sets in. this can be proven
      mathematically. <br>
      <br>
      When oscillations reach a certain frequency and intensity, inertia
      will assert itself and a stable material is produced. In the
      uniting of the ionic metallic atoms by the vibrating reaction,
      they have undergone physical changes by excitation. Disintegration
      and transformation of the atoms occur to form and unite with other
      metallic atoms of the same vibration. Molecules of metal which can
      be recognized as metalized matter result. <br>
      <br>
      In other words, in studying what takes place in the laboratories
      of the Universe, science has found the uranium and radium series
      changing from uranium to radium, radium to radon and radium, A, B,
      C, C1, D (radio lead), radium E, F (polonium), and finally in the
      series into stable lead after having been isotopic lead (non
      stable) twice before in the natural process of change, i.e.,
      aging. <br>
      By hastening nature’s process the time of change may be shortened
      from many years to a few days and low-grade ore matured into an
      ore of higher crystalline content. <br>
      <br>
      In order to fully understand the theories behind Ionic Mining
      methods, it becomes necessary to state several theories and to
      accept them as fact. Without these statements to rely upon, any
      attempt at explaining or understanding the nature of this work
      must be wasted effort. <br>

      … it is necessary to accept the fact that all matter, regardless
      of its name or weight, is a rate of frequency, of vibration and
      nothing more. It must also be accepted that all these various

      The very fact that in fission materials, such as uranium, a
      dissociation is taking place, which is indicative of the
      complexity of the internal structure of the atoms of such
      materials. It must be remembered that this complexity is also
      indicative of the entire universe, and that each atom is a
      miniature of the universe. One other fact must be remembered and
      accepted, that nature in the laboratories of the universe is
      constantly evolving and changing matter and energy, one into the
      other, that the energy of the universe is kinetic in nature and

      … In a similar way the amount of material C passes through a
      maximum in about three and one half times X after aging starts.
      After an interval of about 25 times X both B and C increase or
      decrease approximately to an exponential law with the time falling
      to half value in both cases or doubling in value and we will refer
      to this action as Y. Over the intervals considered, the amount of
      D increases steadily with time, very slowly at first and then with
      greater rapidity. The maximum is reached when B and C have fully
      aged. Finally the amount of D, the ionic matter, will increase or
      decrease exponentially with the time corresponding to a period of
      25 times. <br>

      It has been found that the uranium atoms ‘age” in many ways and
      break up into all the elements from zinc (at. no.&nbsp; 30) to
      gadolinium (at. no. 64). Neutrons are also emitted in the process
      of aging. In one process, barium (at. no. 56) and krypton (at. no
      36) may be formed as a pair (sum of the atomic numbers --- 92,
      that of uranium). In another process, lanthanum and bromine may be
      the aged product pair. Since neutrons are also produced in the
      aging process, these may serve to initiate the aging of other U<sub>235</sub>
      nuclei. One of the reactions is U<sub>235</sub> – n – Ba + Kr –
      xn. [? Possibly division symbol] <br>
      <br>
      The aged products formed in this way are very unstable, having too
      many neutrons, and therefore a series of transformations proceed,
      giving off beta particles and gamma radiation until stable
      isotopes of other elements are produced. <br>

      In speaking of the transformation of mater, Sir Ernest Rutherford
      stated in his book <i>Radiations from Radio-Active Substances</i>
      (1930 edition): <br>
      <br>
      “The bombardment of matter by swift moving alpha particles is a
      powerful method for the artificial transformation of the nuclei of
      a number of the ordinary elements. By this method one is able, not
      only to cause a disintegration of a nucleus with loss of mass but
      also in some cases to build up a nucleus of greater mass by the
      capture of the colliding alpha particle”. <br>
      <br>
      Nature is continually evolving matter and forces, one element into
      another, an eternal process which is more noticeable to us in the
      heavier elements than in those of less complex structure
      nevertheless, all matter is in continual vibration or oscillation,
      and in these oscillations electrical potentials of the nucleus of
      the atom are lessened or increased until the proper multiplicity
      of potentials are obtained to allow voluntary dissociation. When
      this occurs, then the electrical balance of the atom is disturbed
      to such an extent that certain things must happen. Either the mass
      of the particle must be replaced by other mass of the same
      electrical potential, or the internal; structure of the atom must
      undergo change to compensate for this imbalance. However, this
      process of rebalancing may take place instantly, or it may stretch
      over a period of hundreds of millions of years. In the cases of
      the metals we are concerned with, the process is slow, and atoms
      which have given up one or more electrons or electrical potential
      particles may be said to be ionized. Metals in such ionized
      isotopic form do not respond to conventional methods of recovery
      or assay. The logical solution to the problem of recovery of these
      unfinished elements is to copy nature. Observe what nature does
      and then devise the means to give nature a boost. In the mater of
      metals, attention must be paid to the crystals of these metals. A
      crystal of metal must be regarded as a molecule of metal because
      of the electronic binding of the atoms. If the binding of the
      atoms into a crystal is accomplished by electrons, and the atoms
      complete in their electrical potential, then the crystal is
      metallic in form and responds to conventional methods of
      treatments or recovery methods. The problem becomes one of
      obtaining a proper electrical balance… <br>

      … respond to conventional methods of treatment. <br>
      <br>
      Now under the process for the recovery of ionic uranium or other
      metals there are two possibilities of theories as to what actually
      happens inside the atom under this recovery process. It is unknown
      whether the atom responds best when it is in the before or in the
      after stage of electronic excitation. This means that the
      conversion from isotopic ionic form to metallic form may be caused
      by generating excitation in the interior of the atom so as to
      cause the escape of particles or it may be caused by creating such
      potentials and electrical balances in the atom so as to cause
      additional particles to become attracted and absorbed by the atom
      to gain its electrical balance. Whichever may be the case, results
      are obtained when certain types of frequencies are imposed upon
      the atom under the influence of specific types of catalysts. In
      view of the above two points of view as to what happens, the
      material may become heavier and gain weight, or it may become
      lighter as it loses particles. However, these gains or losses, as
      the case may be, taken on an atomic scale are not directly
      attributable to the addition of any materials to the raw ores
      during the treatment. The recovery percentages depend entirely
      upon the amount of isotopic ionized material present in the raw
      ores. One ton of material does in for treatment, and one tone of
      material relatively speaking is recovered with the process. <br>

      In natural phenomena an alpha particle strikes a nucleus head-on
      only once in many millions of times. By properly controlled
      arrangements these head-on collisions can be made to occur
      artificially and these head-on collisions will cause a complete
      dissociation of the atom and a complete change or aging of the
      atomic structure of the ionic mineral. Potentials of many millions
      of volts may be acquired naturally by these head-on collisions,
      without the use of the Cyclotron. <br>

      Elements are being formed in the stars; then why not artificially
      by duplicating nature? <br>
      <br>
      In the application of an electrostatic and wave or frequency
      charge in a chemical catalyst the crystalline structure can be
      changed to such an extent as to result in almost a complete change
      of the appearance of individual molecules. It is known that
      certain liquids under x-rays give evidence of structure resembling
      crystals. A study of Bragg’s Law may be helpful to grasp the
      change here. Revision of the change to a definite time of change
      will result in a change of charge which will result in an
      alteration of the characteristics of the crystal. <br>
      <br>
      Matter differs in construction only as it differs in rate of
      frequency, accounting for its atomic weight. The proton, positron,
      neutron, meson, neutrino and ion are all particles of matter. This
      is true of alpha and beta particles. Alpha particles are simply
      helium carrying a double positive charge effected from certain
      nuclei with very high velocity. Changing the force of any one of
      the binding forces of the atom changes the crystalline structure.

      “There can be no doubt that the stars do serve as reactors in
      which elements are produced. But not all stars do so in the same
      manner or with the same efficiency. Those of the Sun’s type are
      relatively inactive, though even they ‘cook’ the heavy elements on
      a small scale” (cook, produce, grow, age). <br>
      <br>
      The nature of the chemical bonds which an atom can form is
      determined by the electronic structure of the atom. By the
      application of rays and frequencies in an electromagnetic and
      electrostatic field one element can be changed into another
      element by such an application of energy. This may more readily be
      accomplished when the elements are in their ionic stage. <br>
      <br>
      It was pointed out by Shiester in 1903 that every physical
      property of one element has been found to be shared by all the
      other elements, in varying degrees (rates of frequency or
      vibration). <br>
      Here is an example of “aging” within nature: <br>
      <br>
      Radioactive elements are widely disseminated throughout the
      surface of the earth and traces of active matter will be separated
      with all metals. Take the experiments with lead, the most active
      of all common materials. With radium present in the ores from
      which the lead is prepared the product radium “1” will be
      separated with the lead; the alpha particle activity of such lead
      will be due to the subsequent product radium F or polonium which
      has been produced artificially. Now owing to the decay (aging) of
      radium D (259 years is required) by nature, the activity of the
      lead will decrease in this aging. Old lead is much less active
      than new lead. Please note: old lead, new lead, old formations,
      new formation; ionic uranium is a new formation, metal uranium is
      old formation. The evolution of matter, aging or call it what you
      will, all can be done artificially just as it is done by nature. <br>
      <br>
      Capture or loss of electrons by alpha particles is one example of
      the process of this evolution. <br>
      <br>
      In 1920, would any orthodox scientist dare to have said that it
      was possible to separate U<sub>235</sub> from U<sub>238</sub>,
      changing U<sub>238</sub> into U<sub>239</sub> and U<sub>239</sub>
      into the new element Neptunium, which in turn undergoes beta aging
      into another new element Plutonium? Aging from isotopic ionic
      crystals is possible when we acknowledge that aging from one form
      of uranium to another and finally into lead is taking place all
      the time in nature. Nature can be copied and her process
      duplicated in a few weeks, which nature takes hundreds of years to
      accomplish. <br>
      <br>
      The conclusion reached after years of research in analyzing the
      nature, character, and commercibility of values existing in these
      forms of mineral deposits in clays, sands, and various earths
      proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that herein lie the true and
      greatest mineral values of the world. Although they are not always
      determinable by commercial assayers, their capture by properly
      developed frequency and oscillatory action, and recovery in highly
      commercial quantities is assured. <br>
      <br>
      The greatest source of mineral wealth lies, not in the old method
      of seeking the fast depleting metallic form of metals but in
      taking the abundant supplies of the isotopes of the metals to be
      found practically everywhere in their ionic form and processing
      this material into their stable metallic form. <br>
      <br>
      This is not a refining method at all. The silicate sands and
      foreign matter are not removed in this process. This can be done
      later by regular processes. These experiments are aimed at finding
      a quick, cheap method of changing ionic isotopes of uranium
      bearing materials into uranium oxide crystals which will respond
      to conventional methods. By this process we cut down nature’s time
      of changing ionic isotopes of minerals into fusible metals from
      hundreds of thousands of years to a few days, just as wine and
      beers may now be aged in a fraction of the time which used to be
      required by the slow, natural oxidation processes. <br>
      <br>
      What practical results can accrue to the uranium industry as a
      result? An increased yield of several hundred percent has been
      realized in the laboratory. Samples of very low grade ores, which
      ran less than 1/2 of one percent before treatment, by the ionic
      isotope recovery method produced 20 to 30 percent uranium. <br>

      is isotopic with a refractive index which varies from 1.50 to
      1.52. this substance was not identified and might be an artificial
      product.”. <br>
      <br>
      The above samples were less than 0.09% U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>
      before processing by the Ionic Isotope process. A sample of 30% U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>
      was processed, and it was reported by the United States Atomic
      Energy Commission, grand Junction, Colorado, as follows: <br>
      <br>
      “The sample appears to be a fused or reduced uranium dioxide and
      will probable assay between 75 and 85 % U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>”.



      <br>
      <br>
      It has also been reported to us that “Dr Marven (AEC) has said
      that no ore of the type brought in exists in the United States
      except by the process of aging --- which you seem to have been
      able to do”. <br>
      <br>
      A sample of ore was taken at random and the chemical assay was
      0.047 % U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and this sample processed with
      the following results: <br>
      <br>
      Before processing, chemical analysis 0.047 % U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>
      <br>
      <br>
      Partially, processed, chemical analysis 4.720 % U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>
      <br>
      <br>
      Process completed, chemical analysis 21.947 % U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>
      <br>
      <br>
      Although scores of chemical assays relative to ionic mining have
      been run by commercial assayers and certificates of assays
      obtained from 1940 to date, it was not until 1956 that it was
      demonstrated that isotopic ionic recovery could be done
      commercially and only recently has the data been compiled. <br>
      <br>
      Finally, what has been done? Let us answer this by giving a
      history of the test and the result. (Only a limited number of
      tests will be mentioned to save time and space). Variations in the
      results are due to variations in ores. <br>

      <br>
      Step #1. May, 19158 --- 4.72 % <br>

      <br>
      Step #3. May 16, 1958 --- 21.945 % <br>
      <br>
      Step #4. Dec. 17, 1958 --- 54.48 % <br>
      <br>
      The following are successive runs on ore assayed before treatment
      by Crisman and Nichols, Dec. 17, 1958 as 4.59 % U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>
      (one pound of ore): <br>
      <br>
      After treatment (Feb. 17, 1959): 23.810 % U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>
      <br>
      <br>
      March 10, 1959 --- 19.584 % <br>
      <br>
      March 11, 1959 --- 32.022 % <br>
      <br>
      March 11, 1959 --- 51.408 % <br>
      <br>
      What is now the conclusion we arrive at from the above technical
      findings? It can be summed down to two points: 1 --- ore of no
      commercial values can be made of commercial values; 2 --- ore of
      low commercial values can be made highly valuable. Example: take
      the ore referred to in a former report and assayed April 29, 1958.
      This ore, before ionic isotopic processing, had no value, assaying
      at 0.047 % U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>; after the first step of
      treatment this same ore assayed, May 1, 1958, 4.72 %. <br>
      <br>
      Referring to schedule of prices for uranium ore as specified in
      the U.S. AEC circular #5 revised and circular #6, this ore is
      worth, including all bonuses paid, about $788 per ton. After the
      second stage of treatment this same ore assayed at 21.94 % U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the AEC schedule of prices referred to above they only list
      prices on 10 % U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. therefore if this 21 %
      ore is sold at twice the value of 10 % ore, this ore would be
      worth about $3,300&nbsp; per ton, and the cost for processing
      about $230 per ton. <br>
      <br>
      The average upgrading “aging” results of all U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>
      bearing ores we have worked with to date have been well over an
      increase in values to 10 % U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> content. <br>
      <br>
      Remember, this is not a refining process; no silicates or sands
      are removed by this process. This can be done later by
      conventional methods now in use. This is strictly an aging process
      as an aid or hastening of nature’s process as has been explained.
