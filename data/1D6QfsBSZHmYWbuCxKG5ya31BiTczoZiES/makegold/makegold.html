          <b>Alchemists</b> have tried to make gold from other elements
          ever since smelting was discovered. The process of discovery
          eventually culminated in the legendary Philosophers' Stone,
          (Lapis Philosophorum), which supposedly can transmute base
          metals such as lead or mercury into gold -- besides being able
          to heal any disease, rejuvenate, and enlighten the adept, etc.
          The collective effort of The Great Work (Ars Magna), as it was
          called, peaked in Europe during the 17th century and declined
          thereafter with the development of modern chemistry. Popular
          opinion now considers the Philosophers' Stone to be a psychic
          projection with no scientific basis in material reality.<br>
          <br>
          That is almost true insofar as most alchemists were somewhat
          deluded, ignorant, or addlepated with mercury poisoning. Au
          contraire, the singular case of Wenzel Seyler, who was not an
          alchemist, proves the truth of physical Alchemy beyond
          reasonable doubt. His fantastic story was verified and
          well-documented by Doctor Johan Becher (1635-1682) in "<b><a
              href="alchemistscript/becher-magnatur.pdf" ">Magnalia
              Naturae</a></b> (1680). Becher also minted a medallion
          from gold he made with Seyler's tincture<br>

        Wenzel Seyler (AKA Wenceslaus Seilerus) was a reluctant young
        friar of the Augustinian order -- he had entered to avoid
        prosecution for sexing with the Governor's daughter. In 1676, he
        and an elderly priest discovered a cache of the Philosophers'
        Stone buried in the ruins of a chapel at Brno (Moravia, now the
        Czech Republic) by the founding abbot circa 1350. When the
        priest died suddenly of a stroke, Seyler stole the treasure and
        escaped from the abbey. After a series of misadventures, he
        became a favorite of Austria's Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I.
        Hoping to secure royal patronage, Seyler presented the Emperor
        with a medal, decorated with portraits of members of the
        Habsburg family, and Leopold I in the center. The souvenir is on
        display in the Kunsthistorisches Museum (Vienna). Seyler
        performed many demonstrations of gold-making, becoming a great
        favorite of Emperor Leopold, appointed Hereditary Master of the
        Mint of Bohemia, and ennobled as "Baron Seyler von Reinburgh".<br>
        <br>
        His incredible good fortune was the sole exception to the rule.
        Several genuine master alchemists of that era willingly suffered
        death by torture rather than reveal their sacred secret
        synthesis to greedy tyrants. But there was no particular reason
        to torture Seyler other than sadism (which hadn't been invented
        yet), for he did not know how to make the Lapis, and the Emperor
        had immediately appropriated much of it for himself. Seyler
        wasted his fabulous fortune in depravity and eventually resorted
        to sordid fraud by adulterating the dwindling stock.

        Baron Wilhelm von Schroeder, who was a member of the Royal
        Society in London, claimed that Friedrich Augustus II
        (1670-1773), the great Polish Elector of Saxony, manufactured
        large quantities of gold by alchemical means, but the family
        heirs lost the way. Schroeder transmits this story in his
        "Instructions Respecting the Art of Transmutation and
        Ameliorating the Metals" (1684):
        <p style="margin-left:.5in">"My intention is not to enter into
          Disputes as my time is too precious for that; what I propose
          writing I have seen and partly elaborated myself, and am still
          employed in bringing the same to perfection. </p>
        <p style="margin-left:.5in">"Although it is hardly worth a Man’s
          while to bring any proofs concerning the Reality and Existence
          of our Art, yet if we were not to mention something, our
          silence would by many be deemed inability, therefore almost
          against our inclination we see ourselves obliged to relate a
          few Tracts, the Truth of which cannot be taken in question.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:.5in">"Plinius in his 33 Book of Natural
          History, says: that there exists a process whereby Gold is
          made by means of orpiment, a process which invited the Emperor
          Caligula, a prince very covetous of Riches, to cause some men
          to work a great quantity of orpiment; by which operation
          perfect Gold was procured, but so small a quantity that the
          Emperor had reason to repent of his avarice.<br>
          <br>
          "It is positively known that Theophrastus Paracelsus was well
          acquainted with the knowledge of transmuting mercury and lead
          into gold; this has even been attested by some of his enemies.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:.5in">"Raymundus Lullius transmuted a
          great quantity of lead into gold, which he gave to King Henry
          of England, to enable him to assist other powers in retaking
          the Holy Land from the Turks; this is well authenticated in
          History, and yet there exists yet a letter written by the same
          Raymundus Lullius to King Henry, where he comments having
          furnished gold to the King, as he employed it to the contrary
          to agreement, to go to war with France. Through this Letter
          Raymundus Lullius was put in the Tower of London, as a
          prisoner of State.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:.5in">"I have seen several Rose Nobles,
          which have all been made of that gold procured by Lullius. But
          what need have we to quote Examples of remote times? We have
          plenty of a later date, and even have no occasion to go out of
          Germany!</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"Whosoever doubts,
          let him go to Dresden in Saxony, and examine the so-called
          Gold-House, and let him enquire what has been translated in
          that laboratory, in the times of Elector Augustus, Electress
          Anne and their Son Christianus I, and let him ask from where
          proceeded those superb buildings seen in Dresden? If he, the
          unbeliever, wants still more proofs, let him go to the
          Electoral Libraries and enquire for the Chemical Acts and
          Journals of the Middle and later End of the 15th Century. And
          if he goes to the Secret Chancery, he will see such an immense
          quantity of manuscripts and large volumes, some written by the
          Elector Augustus himself, wherein he may read how from time to
          time the tingeing powders were elaborated and what immense
          quantities of Gold was procured thereby weekly, that he may
          well be astonished, as we have been ourselves.<br>

          "On the other hand in the Chamber of Public Accounts, where
          all the immense Expenses were set down, for erecting such
          magnificent buildings, he will not find a single groschen set
          down as received for defraying such enormous expenses.<br>

          "Such buildings were the Palaces, Stables, Gardens,

        Martin Ruland the Elder (1532-1602) wrote "A Lexicon of Alchemy"
        in which he generously provided these instructions for the
        transmutation of silver by arsenic:
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">We propose to
          provide in this place an account of a formal experiment, the
          worth of which has been tested over and over again, and has in
          fact become little less than familiar among operators in the
          pursuit of the Grand Work. In order to perform it a large
          crucible must be provided, and it must be of such a quality as
          will be able to resist the action of intense heat. This
          crucible must be set over a burning furnace, and at the bottom
          of the vessel there must be strewn Powder of Colophony (a kind
          of resin) to about the thickness of the little finger. Above
          this undermost layer there must be another layer of Fine
          Powder of Iron --- that is, the Finest Iron Filings --- which
          shall be of the same thickness. Subsequently, the filings must
          be covered with a little Red Sulphur. Then the fire in the
          furnace must be increased till the iron filings have passed
          into a liquid condition. The next operation is to throw in
          Borax --- that kind which is made use of by goldsmiths for
          melting gold. To this must be added a like quantity of Red
          Arsenic, and as much Pure Silver as will be equivalent to the
          weight of the Iron Filings. Let the entire composition undergo
          coction by driving the furnace, taking care at the same time
          not to inhale the steam, on account of the arsenic in the
          vessel. Take then another crucible into which, by inclining
          the first vessel, you must pour the cocted matter, having
          previously stirred it effectually with an iron spatula.
          Proceed in such a manner that the composition will flow into
          the second crucible in a purified state, and devoid of
          excremental matter. By means of the Water of Separation
          [nitric acid], the Gold will be precipitated to the bottom.
          When it has been collected, let it be melted in a crucible,
          and the result will be good Gold, which will repay all pains
          and expense which have been devoted to its production. This
          chemical secret is contained in the ‘Hermetic Cabinet’, and
          the facility with which the experiment can be performed has
          led many persons to undertake it. The authority cited in
          support of it is no less than that of the most learned Basil
          Valentine..."</p>

          resin, iron powder, sulfur, borax, realgar/orpiment (Danger!),
          and silver together, decant, cool, and extract with nitric
          acid. Traces of gold probably will be present in the reagents,
          so it behooves one to determine their purity before proceeding
          to a sorely mistaken conclusion.<br

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">The method
          developed by Theodore Tiffereau was successful in principle,
          but he never capitalized on it. Tiffereau conducted his
          experiments while supporting himself making daguerotypes in
          Mexico during the 1820s. He claimed that Mexican silver
          possesses peculiar qualities that lend to its augmentation.
          Tiffereau once demonstrated his process at the French Mint in
          Paris, but the results were unsatisfactory. In 1854 he
          submitted several memoirs to the French Academie des Sciences
          describing his alleged transmutation of silver to gold.<br>
          <br>
          Tiffereau's general method was to dissolve silver in
          concentrated nitric or sulfuric acid and "solarize" the
          solution for two weeks, then boil it to dryness. He complained
          that the sunlight in France was not so effective as in Mexico
          -- possibly due to the different levels of ultraviolet light.
          Trace amounts of zinc, iron, alumina, silica, sulfur,&nbsp;
          copper, ozone, and gold served to catalyze the reaction. The
          blackish-green residue was refluxed in nitric acid for several
          hours until it appeared golden. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Tiffereau attributed the production of gold in the earth to
          the action of the "microbe of gold". He was vindicated in the
          1980s by the discovery that placer gold nuggets can form
          around a nucleus of Bacillus cereus.<br

        The eminent occultist Arthur E. Waite (1857-1942) published "A
        Collection of Alchymical Processes" which includes a segment
        entitled "Silver Transmuted into Gold by the Action of Light",
        similarly to Tiffereau's technique:
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"In the focus of a
          Burning-Glass, 12 inches in diameter, place a glass Flask, 2
          inches in diameter, containing Nitric Acid, diluted with its
          own volume of water:<br>
          <br>
          "Pour into the Nitric Acid, alternately, small quantities of a
          Solution of Nitrate of Silver and of Muriatic acid, the object
          being to cause the Chloride of Silver to form a minutely
          divided state, so as to produce a milky fluid, into the
          interior of which the brilliant convergent cone may pass, and
          the currents generated in the Flask by the Heat may so drift
          all the Chloride through the Light.<br>
          <br>
          "The Chloride, if otherwise exposed to the Sun, merely
          blackens on the surface, the interior parts undergoing no
          change: This difficulty, therefore, has to be avoided. The
          Burning-Glass promptly brings on a decomposition of the salt,
          evolving, on the one hand, Chlorine, and disengaging a metal
          on the other. Supposing the experiment to last two or three
          entire hours, the effect will then be equal to a continuous
          midday sun of some 72 hours. The Metal becomes disengaged very
          well. But what is it? It cannot be silver, since Nitric acid
          has no action on it. It burnishes in an Agate Mortar, but its
          reflection is not like that of silver, for it is yellowish,
          like that of Gold.<br>
          <br>
          "The Light must therefore have so transmuted the original
          silver as to enable it to exist in the presence of Nitric
          Acid."</p>

          midst of the effervesence the reunion of pure parts, their new
          arrangement being irreducible. In this manner, starting from a
          metal close to gold -- preferably silver -- it is possible to
          produce a small quantity of the precious metal. Here is, in
          this order of research, an elementary operation whose success
          we guarantee, providing the instructions are carefully
          followed.<br>
          <br>
          "Empty into a glass retort, tall and tubular, one-third of its
          capacity in pure nitric acid. Adapt to the receiver an escape
          tube and arrange the apparatus in a sand bath.<br>
          <br>
          "Gently heat the apparatus short of reaching the boiling point
          for the acid (83o C). Turn off the fire, open the tube, and
          introduce a small portion of virgin silver, or of cupel, free
          from gold traces. When the emission of peroxide of azote has
          stopped and when the effervesence has quieted, let drop into
          the liquor a second portion of pure silver. Repeat introducing
          metal, with no hurry, until the boiling and issuing of red
          vapors manifest little energy, which is indicative of the
          property of saturation. Add nothing more. Let it rest for half
          an hour, then cautiously decant your clear solution into a
          beaker while it is still warm. You will find a thin deposit in
          the form of black sand. Wash this with lukewarm water, and let
          it fall into a small porcelain capsule. You will recognize by
          making the assays that the precipitate is insoluble in
          hydrochloric acid, just as it also is in nitric acid. Aqua
          regia will dissolve it and yields a magnificent yellow
          solution, exactly like gold trichloride. Use distilled water
          to dilute this liquor; precipitate from a zinc blade. An
          amorphous powder will be obtained, very fine, matte, of
          reddish brown coloration, identical to that given by natural
          gold reduced in the same manner. Wash well and dessicate this
          pulvurent precipitate. By compression on a sheet of glass or
          marble, it will give you a brilliant, coherent lamina with a
          beautiful yellow sheen by reflection, green by transparence,
          having the look and superficial characteristics of the purest
          gold.<br>
          <br>
          "To increase with a new quantity this miniscule deposit, you
          may repeat the operation as many times as you please. In this
          case, take up again the clear solution of silver nitrate
          diluted from the first washing water; reduce the metal with
          zinc or copper. Decant this silver into a powder and use it
          for your second dissolution."</p>

        Francois Jollivet-Castelot (1974-1937) was an eminent French
        alchemist who developed a system of chemical methods of
        transmutation for which he coined the term "hyperchemistry". He
        presented a detailed report of his "wet" and "dry" methods in
        "La Fabrication Chimique de L'Or" (1920):
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"By means of
          catalytic action I have succeeded in manufacturing gold
          chemically by acting on silver with arsenic and antimony
          sulfides, tellurium, and tin.<br>
          <br>
          "This process gives a very high yield which has already been
          confirmed by several chemists…&nbsp; <br>
          "I made a mixture composed of 3 gr of chemically pure silver
          and 1 gr of chemically pure orpiment and placed it in 36º
          nitric acid for several months cold and then brought it to
          ebullition. The liquid was kept at the boiling point for
          several days. A small quantity of the material became detached
          at this moment and formed a pulvurent black deposit. When no
          further action took place, I decanted off the solution and
          collected the insoluble residue. This residue was attacked by
          aqua regia at the boiling point until it was almost completely
          dissolved; the liquor when decanted and filtered was analyzed
          and gave all the characteristic reactions for gold."</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The "dry" method resembles that described
          by Martin Ruland:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"I acted on 22 gr
          of chemically pure silver ... and on 3.5 gr of chemically pure
          orpiment... The mixture was heated to about 1600º C in a metal
          smelting furnace for about three quarters of an hour. The
          residue obtained was again melted with the addition of
          orpiment. After having hammered for half an hour and remelted
          with the addition of small quantities of orpiment every ten
          minutes, it was withdrawn.<br>
          <br>
          "After cooling and the addition of chemically pure antimony
          sulfide, it was again put back into the furnace, small
          quantities of orpiment being thrown in every five minutes. The
          residue obtained had a dark metallic tint. After hammering it
          became slightly golden.<br>
          <br>
          "The reactions of gold were quite characteristic; the
          reactions of platinum also seemed to reveal its presence.<br>
          <br>
          "The quantity of gold obtained in this experiment was about
          one gramme.<br>
          <br>
          "I submit the hypothesis that the arsenic acts as a catalyst
          and the sulfur as a ferment in this transmutation." &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          "As a sequel to my previous work on the artificial synthesis
          of gold, I have introduced tin into these new tests as it is
          also often associated with gold in Nature. The following is a
          description of this new process, thanks to which the
          percentage of gold obtained destroys all the objections that
          are raised with regard to impurities.<br>
          <br>
          "I made an intimate mixture of 6 gr of chemically pure
          silver... 2 gr of antimony sulfide, 1 gr of orpiment, and one
          gr of tin... I then added the usual fluxes and then heated the
          whole in a crucible in the furnace to about 1100º C for about
          one hour, twice adding a small quantity of antimony sulfide.<br>
          <br>
          "The residue obtained was treated for a long time in nitric
          acid... The liquor when filtered and subjected to the reagents
          of gold showed the presence of this metal in the form of
          abundant deposits which may be estimated at 0.05 gr in all,
          which is very high considering the 6 gr of silver employed.
          The deposits when collected and dried had a yellow green
          metallic color and possessed all the characteristics of
          gold...<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          "It would be very easy to show that, given the respective
          prices of gold and of the other substances that are used in my
          process to produce it, a profit could be obtained if the
          process were worked industrially, all the more so as the
          greater part of the silver employed can be recovered at each
          test..<br>
          <br>
          "I believe I now hold the key to the regular and even
          industrial manufacture of gold.<br>
          <br>
          "But the industrial question is voluntarily put aside from my
          thoughts, for my only object is the search for pure scientific
          truth."</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">In a
          correspondence, a Mr. Ballandras reported on "How I Succeeded
          In Making Gold According To The Process of Mr.
          Jollivet-Castelot: Dosage of Gold Obtained by the Second
          Method", using 10 gr silver and 3 gr each of tin, orpiment,
          and antimony sulfide:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"I will not
          conceal the fact that I have often heard ironical remarks
          about processes by which he succeeded in manufacturing gold. I
          determined to check his tests with the greatest possible
          accuracy...<br>
          <br>
          "These reactions are sufficiently characteristic and clearly
          prove the existence in the last liquor of a metal which, even
          if it is not gold, must nevertheless be placed very close to
          the latter... the metal obtained and gold must be perfectly
          isotopic.<br>
          <br>
          "I have repeated this test several times and I have observed:
          1) That the production of gold is a function of the rapidity
          with which the necessary heat is obtained; 2) That it is also
          a function of the degree of tightness of the crucible. A
          crucible that is closed as tightly as possible gives better
          results; 3) That the amount of gold obtained was not always
          uniform; some of the tests were absolutely sterile and I
          inferred that this was due to some defect in the mounting.<br>
          <br>
          "I think there must be a certain temperature that should not
          be exceeded and that the external conditions of pressure and
          electricity must be of considerable importance."<br>
          <br>
          "After having operated as previously, I obtained a quantity of
          gold corresponding to 0.05 gr per gram of silver employed...
          This I consider to be a highly interesting result."<br>
          <br>
          "The quantity of gold which was obtained was 0.476 gr for 10
          gr of silver employed, or 0.0476 gr of gold per gr of silver."</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">On 6 June 1926, Jollivet-Castelot read a
          memorandum about "A Recent Experiment In Transmutation" to the
          Academie Royal des Sciences (Belgium):</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"All my research
          work on transmutation since 1908 has started from the fact
          that gold is found in nature associated with antimony and
          arsenic sulfides as well as with tellurium, which is
          considered as a mineralizer of gold. I therefore considered
          that it was logical to introduce tellurium into the artificial
          combination of silver and arsenic and antimony sulfides that I
          make...</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Mr. Louis Outon, a pharmaceutical

          have repeated the experiments... in my laboratory and am
          amazed at the results. For the moment, it is only the

          obtained is often greater than the value of the metal..."<br>

        Early in 1897, the British inventor Stephen Henry Emmens, then
        residing in New York, announced the discovery of a new element
        which fills the "vacant space existing in the sub-group of Group
        I", and which he thought to be the intermediate matter from
        which silver and gold are formed:
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"Our claim is that
          the element in question is therefore neither silver nor gold,
          but which may, by our new physical methods, be converted into
          gold." </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Emmens' process comprised stages of
          mechanical treatment, fluxing and granulation, more mechanical
          treatment, "modified nitric acid", and refining. The
          mechanical treatment was accomplished by means of his "Force
          Engine", which exerted pressures in excess of 500 tons psi at
          very low temperatures.<br>
          <br>
          His Argentaurum Laboratory on Staten Island produced over 660
          ounces of gold from silver and sold it to the U.S. Assay
          Office in 1897. He revealed a few historical and technical
          details of his transmutation process in his book "Argentaurum
          Papers #1: Some Remarks Concerning Gravitation":</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"Our work, which
          converts silver into gold, had its origin in the course of
          certain investigations which I undertook for the purpose of
          preparing chemically pure nickel... in 1892...<br>
          <br>
          "Our starting point, so far as silver and gold were concerned,
          was afforded by the remarkable discoveries of Mr. Carey Lea
          with regard to [colloidal silver]... It was found that... this
          subdivision of metallic silver was attended by very
          considerable changes in the physical properties of the
          substance...By certain physical methods and by the aid of a
          certain apparatus, we succeeded in bringing about a further
          subdivision of the silver. We were not surprised to find that
          the substance obtained differed so far from ordinary silver
          that it could no longer be regarded as the same elementary
          substance. It seemed to require a new name and a new chemical
          symbol. Inasmuch, therefore, as our theory was that this
          substance was common to both gold and silver, and in reality
          was the raw material out of which both gold and silver were
          constructed by the hand of nature, we named the substance
          Argentaurum...<br>
          <br>
          "The next step was to ascertain whether this substance could
          be so treated as to be grouped into molecules of greater
          density than those of silver... We found that... Argentaurum
          can be aggregated into molecules having a density considerably
          superior to that of ordinary gold molecules. Whether we are
          right as to this or not, the condensed Argentaurum presents
          the appearance and is endowed with the properties of ordinary
          metallic gold...<br>
          <br>
          "We do not consume any chemicals and other costly materials in
          our process; what we use is mainly energy in some of its
          various forms, such as heat, electricity, magnetism, gravity,
          cohesion, chemical affinity, x-rays and the like... Our chief
          source of expense is the time required for bringing about the
          desired molecular changes... One ounce of silver will produce
          three-quarters of an ounce of gold..."<br>
          <br>
          "I regard the mechanical treatment as the causa causans. The
          fluxing and granulation serve, I think, merely to render the
          molecular aggregate susceptible of displacement and
          rearrangement."</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">In May 1897, Dr. Emmens sent a sample of
          Argentaurum and instructions for its preparation to Sir
          William Crookes:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"Take a Mexican
          dollar and dispose it in an apparatus which will prevent
          expansion or flow. Then subject it to heavy, rapid, and
          continuous beating under conditions of cold such as to prevent
          even a temporary rise of temperature when the blows are
          struck. Test the material from hour to hour, and at length you
          will find more than the trace (less than one part in 10,000)
          of gold which the dollar originally contained."</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Sir Crookes was unable to replicate the
          experiment to his satisfaction. He reported:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"A specimen of
          Argentaurum sent me by Dr. Emmens has been examined with the
          spectrograph. It consists of gold with a fair proportion of
          silver and a little copper. No lines belonging to any other
          known elements, and no unknown lines, were detected."</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Ordinary
          bullion gold contains silver and copper to make it harder and
          more fusible than pure gold. Hmmm...<br>
          <br>
          In 1898, Emmens floated the syndicated&nbsp; Argentaurum
          Company, promising that for one ounce of silver (then worth
          about 50 cents) and payment of $4.50 per ounce for conversion
          costs, the investor would be repaid with 3/5 ounce of gold
          (then worth about $11). Dr. Emmens' application for a patent
          on his process was rejected, however, so production never
          began, since he would not have been able to protect his
          methods from unscrupulous competitors. <br

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">The German
          alchemist Franz Seraph Tausend (1884-1942) began to produce
          gold from mercury in the 1920s under the auspices of General
          Ludendorff. The fledgling Nazi Party invested heavily in the
          enterprise, which had great appeal during that period of
          hyper-inflation, but his partners wasted most of the money on
          extravagant lifestyles. Tausend himself had a penchant for
          castles and bought a few. In 1929 he was forced to demonstrate
          his process in a sensational court trial, and it proved true,
          though ultimately it was determined to be unprofitable.
          Tausend was convicted for misappropriation of investment funds
          and sentenced to 4 years imprisonment. After his release, he
          was arrested again in 1937 for check fraud, and he died in
          prison.<br>
          <br>
          Tausend's work was based on a circular table of 180 elements
          arranged according to a system of harmonic frequencies and
          atomic weights.<br>
          <br>
          The ingredients of his formula are known to be: Part 1) 111 gr
          lead chloride, 60 gr potassium hydroxide; Part 2) 76 gr
          potassium, 55 gr sodium amalgamated with 131 gr of mercury,

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">In 1931,
          Polish engineer Roman [?] Dunikovski announced that he could
          produce artificial gold by the action of "Z-rays" on a mixture
          of silica and feldspar melted in bronze crucibles under the
          influence of 110 kilovolts. Dunikovski claimed to have&nbsp;
          inherited the process from his father and grandfather who had
          developed it. He also theorized that all minerals contain
          "embryonal atoms" or "mineralites" that can be artificially
          matured in minutes.<br>
          <br>
          Several French investors syndicated and subscribed 2,000,000
          francs which Dunikovski used to build a laboratory in Paris.
          But when no gold was produced, he was charged with fraud. He
          demonstrated his process to the court, but the results were
          ambiguous and insufficient to prove his innocence. Dunikovski
          was sentenced to four years imprisonment, but his attorney
          secured his release after two years. He relocated to San Remo
          and renewed his experiments, improving the process and gaining
          significant increases in yields.<br>
          <br>
          When rumors began to spread that Dunikovski was selling small
          amounts of gold, his attorney Jean Legrand visited Dunikovski
          with the eminent chemist Albert Bonn to investigate. M. Bonn
          witnessed the process and repeated it himself. One type of
          sand, which contained 11 gr golg/ton before treatment, assayed
          859 gr/ton after treatment with the improved apparatus.<br>

        <p class="MsoNormal">At the 68th National Western Mining
          Conference in Denver CO (4 February 1965), Dr Thomas Henry
          Moray presented a progress report on the "Recovery of Minerals
          from Low Grade Ore by High Energy Bombardment" being studied
          at his Research Institute in Salt Lake City, UT:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"From 1950 to
          1953, our attention turned to the reactions involved in
          working with uranium ores... It was observed that as the raw
          uranium ore was irradiated and otherwise processed under
          proper conditions, fairly large amount of uranium could be
          recovered. For instance, on May 16, 1958, using a sample that
          ran 0.29% uranium oxide before irradiation, the assay was
          21.9% after... After Dr Marvin of the AEC spent several months
          investigating the sample we supplied, it was reported that no
          ore of the type we presented existed in the United States
          except by the process of aging which they admitted we seemed
          able to do. We proposed that a breeding type reaction could be
          accomplished by the bombardment of low grade ores with high
          energy particles or x-rays in the presence of a proper
          environment. At this time we were unsuccessful in obtaining a
          contract from the AEC. It was disclosed later that breeding
          reaction investigations were being conducted by the AEC in
          Arc, Idaho (Scientific American, January 1960). We still feel
          our method is cheaper and more efficient that the process used
          at Arco.<br>
          <br>
          "The study of uranium oxide, however, paid for itself in that
          it opened up new ideas in an approach top breeder reactions
          for other types of mineral bearing ores. In 1958 we altered
          the uranium breeding reaction process and specifically adapted
          it to the recovery of gold, silver and platinum ores..."</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Moray had rented time on the Varian
          Associates 8 MeV Linac (linear accelerator) and conducted a
          series of tests to determine the optimal conditions for their
          process. In her "History of the Research Project" (1966), Ruth
          L. Hendricks reported:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"These tests gave
          yields of from 50 to 100 ounces of gold per ton and as much as
          several hundred ounces of silver per ton. It must be mentioned
          at this time that when virtually no gold or silver values can
          be determined in the raw ore (i.e., they assay from trace to a
          few hundredths of an ounce of gold per ton), after irradiation
          and drying the gold and silver can be identified by standard
          fire assay or any other normal determination method...<br>
          <br>
          "The ores we have used fall into three main categories. All
          contain from trace to a few hundredths of an ounce of gold per
          ton. Although we have tried higher grade ores, they seem less
          adaptable to this process. The increase in values is much less
          than in low grade ores. One type of ore is simply low grade
          unprocessed gold ore. The second is mill tailings. This type
          has a number of advantages such as being inexpensive,
          available in large quantities, and already ground. For these
          reasons a great deal of work has been done with this type of
          ore with excellent results. The third variety of ore is
          natural sand. Although fewer different ores of this type have
          been tried, they also have usually given good yields...<br>
          <br>
          "These calculations show that with a small risk involved, a
          yield of around 15 ounces of gold per ton can be anticipated.
          We also found that a dose of 0.16, 0.5, 2.0 and 4.0 megarads
          gave the peaks on the sine curve for dose. A dose rate of 4
          megarads per minute gave the highest peak on the dose rate
          curve..."</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">In a telephone interview with Ken Jones
          (September 1981), Thomas Moray's son John said:</p>
        <blockquote>"The environmental material consists of a
          combination of chemicals whose atomic numbers add up to the
          atomic number of silver or gold and yield silver and gold upon
          irradiation [The formulas include arseno- and iron-pyrites in
          alkaline solution]. Antimony has peculiar properties -- it has
          floating electrons which come in very handy. It is believed
          that this environment furnishes particles similar to the
          cosmic ray reaction on the atmosphere. Research work indicates
          that the radiation must be composed of both high-speed
          electrons and x-rays. Consistent results under controlled
          methods were obtained with the addition of a catalyst (a flux
          or reduction agent, an environment) combined with bombardment
          of the material ... by an energy bombardment tube developed
          for the Research Institute."<br>

          the methods and with the apparatus... It has been found that

          after treatment in accordance with the above..."</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">T.R. Dolph published an article about the
          Moray process in Fate magazine (February 1976), wherein he

          device to the US Government... Transmutation of metals (yes,
          turning lead into gold) was demonstrated several times; the
          government supplied the lead and kept the gold."<br>
        </blockquote>
        John Moray denied this in a letter to Ken Jones (18 January
        1982):
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"The article by
          T.R. Dolph is one of those articles written by a crackpot that

        During the 1990s the modern alchemist Joe Champion developed a
        variety of novel techniques to produce gold, based on concepts
        originated by geologist Walter Lussage (1967). <br>
        <p class="MsoNormal"> Dr Bockris at Texas A.M. University
          replicated one of the experiments using this formula: 300 gr
          carbon, 900 gr potassium nitrate, 80 gr sulfur, 100 gr iron
          sulfate, 30 gr cadmium, 100 gr mercury chloride, 50 gr lead
          oxide, 5 gr silver, and 30 gr calcium oxide. The ingredients
          were mixed and ignited with a torch. The silver content
          increased from 5 to 8.7 gr, and a small amount of gold also
          was produced. X-ray flourescence and mass spectrometry
          examinations were made of the materials before and after the
          ignition. Though workable, the technique has little to
          recommend it due to the expense and danger, but greed,
          lawyers, and technocratic hubris can easily bypass such
          obstacles. <br>
          <br>
          In 1993, Joe Champion received patent WO9403905 (Method for
          Transmutation of Select Isotopes of Individual Elements from
          Compositions Containing Such). If you must know already, here
          is the formula given in Example 1: Heat Generator -- 100 gr
          ferrous sulfate, 80 gr sulfur, 300 gr carbon, 900 gr potassium
          nitrate; Resonance Generator -- 120 gr silica, 30 gr calcium
          oxide; Basic Metals -- 5 gr silver, 100 gr mercury chloride,
          50 gr lead oxide, 30 gr cadmium. The mixture is ignited in a
          steel vessel; the fire lasts about 3 minutes. The residue
          contains gold, platinum, palladium, and rhodium, which are
          separated by conventional means. <br>
          <br>
          Champion's research associate Greg Iseman used a microwave
          digestion process to perform analyses of the formula, and this
          method also produced transmutations.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"If the reaction
          mixture exceeds 15 kg, the yield is reduced because the
          transmutation cycle is too long and begins to produce base
          elements instead of precious metals. It was found necessary to
          add traces of the target elements to the starting mixture in
          order for the resonance of those elements (i.e., Au) to act as
          a "stopping agent".<br>
          <br>
          "The following reagents were required to produce synthetic
          precious metals by this process: silica, ferrous sulfate, lead
          oxide, calcium oxide, mercury sulfide, and cadmium. The
          mixture was combined with carbon, sodium or potassium nitrate,
          sulfur, mercury chloride, and silver. The formula produced
          synthetic gold, iridium, platinum, palladium, and rhodium...<br>
          <br>
          "When the chemical mixture is properly prepared, it has a
          reproductive factor of over 60%. This was later increased to
          90-plus percent when an error was determined in the
          crystalline structure of the ferrous sulfate. The differences
          dealt with a magnetic susceptibility at high temperature,
          i.e., greater than 750° C..."</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Mr. Champion also discovered an application
          of combined phonon resonance, magnetic moment, and exact
          temperatures to effect transformations:&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">"The isotope to be
          transmuted... is heated and subjected to a resonant frequency
          unique to the nucleus of the isotope for a time sufficient for
          the isotope to undergo an alpha fission to a new element of
          lower mass and atomic number... <br>
          <br>
          "In the formation of silver (or other elements) from a
          dimensional reaction, the conversion will occur without excess
          energies or nuclear signatures. The principle is
          straightforward and simple without toxicity, by utilizing a
          heat source that is stable and capable of heating in the range
          of 100-120° C. Allow the temperature of the silver to
          stabilize at 43.2° C. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          "Achievement of the maximum conversion of Ag to Au will depend
          on the dwell time at resonance temperature. Conversion of Ag
          to Au can occur in as little as six hours; 2% conversion takes
          up to 24 hours.<br>
          <br>
          "The conversion of one element (specifically one isotope) to
          another through a dimensional reaction occurs under select
          conditions of phonon resonance. Dimensional phonon resonance
          occurs when the space occupied by one isotope is exactly the
          same as that of another isotope in its rest state. This event
          only occur under the following two conditions: (1) the
          expansion of an isotope by heating; or, (2) the contraction of
          an isotope by cooling...<br>
          <br>
          "The conversion of Al to Au is an absolute application of
          dimensional science. In this reaction, gold is produced in its
          ultra-pure state on a continuous basis. This procedure may be
          utilized for most elements. The basis of this dimensional
          occurs in the collection of atomic size particles that form
          near the resonant metal (in this case aluminum). Due to the
          size of the particles they appear in what normal chemistry
          would consider a gas phase. The targeted element (isotope)
          forms in its singular state and due to the lack of energies
          present. There are insufficient energies to bind the atoms
          into a colloidal state...<br>
          <br>
          "In the production of gold from aluminum, the ideal
          temperature is 302.9° C. These temperatures are optimum for
          the Al (the Al must be allowed to come into equilibrium with
          the furnace). Once resonance is established, production is
          continuous. The Au is captured in the water as it is removed
          from a negative pressure applied to the furnace established by
          the vacuum pump. However, please be aware that Al will also
          convert to Ag107 at a temperature of 283.7° C."</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">The proper preparation of ORMEs is
          technically difficult, but many shameless entrepreneurs have
          adopted the name and applied it to dubious products made by
          crude processes larded with magical thinking, scientific
          method be damned. Such materials bear no resemblance to the
          ORMEs described in Hudson's patent.<br>
          <br>
          Milewski posits that the gaseous ORMEs can be released from
          crystal forms by heating and reconstituted in their solid form
          as they absorb electrons in the process.<br>

          To summarize: Lacking the Philosophers' Stone, it is
          nevertheless possible to manufacture gold from other elements,
          particularly silver, catalyzed by arsenic sulfide, in nitric
          acid, under UV light, at resonant frequencies, with
          nanobubbles, in a microwave oven!<br>

          For good measure, please consider too the equally improbable
          Sprink "Space Activator", which can reduce the time required
          for chemical reactions by 80% while using only half the
          calories (!).<br>
          <br>
          Leon Sprink was a Russian engineer who operated a cement
          manufacturing plant in France during the 1950s. He received
          several patents for a simple method to create a torsional form
          of electric field that accelerates chemical reactions. He
          mentions this example in his British Patent GB685522 (Method
          of and Apparatus for Carrying out Chemical Reactions):</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">“One month after
          the setting in operation of the apparatus, the duration of the
          reaction, which normally is 24 hours, had fallen down to 3
          hours and the saving in calories to be supplied for the
          reaction was 50%… The field also affects the states of matter
          such as solubility and crystallization, distillation,
          reduction of metallic ores, etc..."</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Leon Sprink
          died in poverty, but a 16-fold saving of time and energy in
          the "reduction of metallic ores, etc." might be profitable for
          another pioneering entrepreneur if applied to transmutation.<br>
          <br>
          "Spectral Catalysts" also could enhance the engineering of
          this new industry. The term (coined by Juliana Brooks) refers
          to specialized applications of electric and magnetic fields,
          select frequencies, and waveforms, etc. -- the usual suspects
          -- imposed upon chemical reactions at low levels of energy
          input to improve yields and quality.<br>
          <br>
          Surmising from this compilation of factoids, the manufacture
          of gold by transmutation of silver could become an established
          industry within a few decades, if civilization and the
          biosphere don't collapse first.<br>

          And there you have it -- a dazzling glimpse at The Next Bigly
          Thing in the Wonder World of WheneverLand !!!<br>
