        --</span> Externally charged electrodes of an electrostatic
      generator induce charges of opposite polarity on segments of a
      pair of confronting stators by means of electric fields within
      which a pair of rotors are confined during rotation to vary the
      charge binding field linkages between confronting rotors and
      stators by a shielding action of the rotors in a plane
      perpendicular to the field flux. A high electric potential
      difference induced between the stators resulting from such
      rotation of the rotors, is transformed by an output circuit into a
      reduced DC voltage applied to a load with a correspondingly
      increase current conducted therethrough. &nbsp; <br>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">BACKGROUND OF THE
      INVENTION </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This invention relates to the
      generation of electrical power by conversion of energy from an
      electrostatic field. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The conversion of energy from a static
      electric field into useful electrical energy by means of an
      electrostatic generator is already well known in the art as
      exemplified by the disclosures in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,522,106,
      3,013,201, 4,127,804, 4,151,409 and 4,595,852. Generally, the
      energy conversion process associated with such prior art
      electrostatic generators involves the input of mechanical energy
      to separate charges so that a considerable portion of the output
      is derived from the conversion of mechanical energy. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is therefore an important object of
      the present invention to provide an electrostatic generator in
      which electrical power is derived from the energy of static
      electric fields with a minimized input of mechanical power. </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">SUMMARY OF THE
      INVENTION </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In accordance with the present
      invention, static electric fields are established between
      electrodes externally maintained at charge levels of opposite
      polarity and a pair of internal stator discs having segmental
      surfaces that are dielectrically spaced to confine thereon charges
      induced by the electric fields. A pair of rotor discs are rotated
      within continuous electric fields in planes perpendicular to the
      field flux to locationally vary the charge linkage established by
      the electric fields between the electrodes and stator discs. Such
      changes in charge linkage are effected by rotation of electrically
      conductive segments of the rotor angularly spaced from each other
      to partially shield the stator discs from the electric fields. The
      segments of each rotor disc have charged faces confronting the
      electrodes in its field to shield the stator disc over a total
      face area that is one-half the total area of the confronting
      segment surfaces on the stator disc to which the induced charges
      are confined. Charges on the rotors and stators are equalized by
      electrical interconnections established through the rotor shafts.
      The stator discs are electrically interconnected with an
      electrical load through an output circuit transforming a high
      potential between the stator discs into a reduced dc voltage to
      conduct a correspondingly multiplied current through the load. </p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">DETAILED
      DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Referring now to the drawings in
      detail, FIG. 1 diagrammatically depicts the energy conversion
      system of the present invention generally referred to by reference
      numeral 10. As diagrammed in FIG. 1, the system includes a pair of
      electrostatic fields 12 and 14 established by electrostatic
      charges of opposite polarity applied to electrode plates 16 and 18
      from some external energy source. Thus, the electrostatic field 12
      is established between electrode 16 and a stator disc 20 while the
      electrostatic field 14 is established between electrode 18 and a
      stator disc 22. In accordance with the present invention,
      electrostatic charge linkages established by the flux of the
      fields between the electrodes and stators are periodically varied
      by displacement within continuous energy fields 12 and 14 in
      response to rotation of rotors 24 and 26 aligned with planes
      perpendicular to their common rotational axis and the field flux
      as will be hereinafter described. The rotors are mechanically
      interconnected with an electric motor 28, as diagrammatically
      illustrated in FIG. 1, for rotation about the common rotational
      axis. Electrical energy may be extracted from the electric fields
      12 and 14 during rotation of the rotors 24 and 26 by motor 28
      through an output circuit generally referred to by reference
      numeral 30. The output circuit 30 as shown, in FIG. 1 in a
      simplified fashion, includes two pair of current conducting diodes
      32A, 32B and 34A, 34B. The diodes of each pair are oppositely
      poled and each pair is connected in parallel to one of the stators
      20 and 22. The diodes of each pair are also electrically connected
      across an electrical load represented by resistors 36A and 36B
      with capacitor networks 38A and 38B interconnected between each
      pair of diodes by means of which the voltage potential between the
      stators 20 and 22 is reduced in favor of an increased current
      through the electrical load. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Referring now to FIGS. 2, 3 and 4 in
      particular, a physical embodiment of the energy conversion system
      diagrammed in FIG. 1 is shown. The electrodes 16 and 18 are in the
      form of circular plates or discs made of an electrically
      conductive metal having external surfaces 40 and 42 adapted to be
      charged from the external source as aforementioned. The internal
      surface 44 of electrode 18 is thereby adapted to maintain a
      positive charge opposite in polarity to the negative charge of the
      electrode 16 which is maintained in a stable ion form within a
      dielectric surface portion 46 of the electrode 16. The energy
      conversion system may be enclosed within an outer housing 48 to
      which the electrodes 16 and 18 are secured. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">With continued reference to FIG. 2,
      the stators 20 and 22 mounted by housing 48 in axially fixed
      spaced relation to the electrodes 16 and 18 are provided with
      bearings 50 and 52 establishing the aforementioned common
      rotational rotor axis journaling a powered shaft assembly having
      electrically conductive shaft sections 54 and 56 to which the
      rotors 24 and 26 are respectively connected. In the embodiment
      illustrated in FIG. 2, the drive motor 28 is mechanically
      interconnected with the shaft sections 54 and 56 through an
      electrically nonconductive shaft section 58 of the power shaft
      assembly for simultaneous rotation of both rotors 24 and 26 at the
      same speed and in the same direction about the common rotational
      axis perpendicular to parallel spaced planes with which the
      electrode and stator discs are aligned. The electrically
      conductive shaft sections 54 and 56 are respectively keyed or
      secured in any suitable fashion to hub portions 60 and 62 of the
      rotors and are provided with flange portions 64 and 66 forming
      electrical wipers in contact with confronting surfaces of the
      stators 20 and 22, which are inductively charged by the static
      electric fields 12 and 14 to equal levels of opposite polarity. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As more clearly seen in FIGS. 2 and 3,
      the rotor 24 has a plurality of angularly spaced, field linkage
      controlling segments 68 projecting radially outwardly from the hub
      portion 60. Each rotor segment 68 is made of an electrically
      conductive metal having a face 70 on one axial side confronting
      the adjacent electrode 16. The faces 70 confronting the electrode
      16 are charged positively by the electric field 12 extending
      between the dielectric surface portion 46 of electrode 16 and the
      stator disc 20. While the electric field 12 projects through the
      spaces 72 between the rotor segments 68, the rotor segments 68
      themselves shield portions of the stator disc 20 from the electric
      field. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The rotor 26 is similarly formed with
      rotor segments 74 angularly spaced from each other by spaces 76
      through which the electric field 14 extends between the positively
      charged surface 44 of electrode 18 and the stator 22. The rotor
      segments 74 of rotor 26 as shown in FIG. 2, are provided with
      dielectric surface portions 78 confronting the internally charged
      surface 44 of electrode 18. While the rotor segments 74 are
      negatively charged by the electric field 14 within the surface
      portions 78, they also shield portions of the stator disc 22 from
      the electric field as in the case of the rotor segments 68
      hereinbefore described. The internal dielectric surface portion 46
      of electrode 16 and dielectric surface portions 78 of rotor 26 act
      as a stabilizer to prevent eddy currents and leakage of negative
      charge. Further, in view of the electrical connections established
      between the rotors and the stator discs, the charge on each stator
      is equalized with that of the charge on its associated rotor. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, the stator
      disc 20 includes a plurality of segments 82 to which charges are
      confined, closely spaced from each other by dielectric spacers 80.
      The segments 82 are electrically interconnected with the rotor
      segments 68 through rotor shaft section 54. Similarly, the
      segments 84 of the stator 22 are electrically interconnected with
      the rotor segments 74 through rotor shaft section 56. The stator
      segments 82 and 84 are therefore also made of electrically
      conductive metal. Each of the segments 82 of stator 20 is
      electrically interconnected through the output circuit 30 with
      each of the segments 84 of the stator. The stator discs being
      fixedly mounted within the housing 48, centrally mount the
      bearings 50 and 52 through which the electrically nonconductive
      motor shaft section 58 is journaled as shown in the embodiment of
      the invention illustrated in FIG. 2. Further, the total area of
      the charged segment surfaces on each of the stator discs is
      greater than the total area of the faces 70 or 78 on the segments
      of each associated rotor disc 24 or 26. According to one
      embodiment, the total charged stator surface area is twice that of
      the rotor face area. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">According to the embodiment of the
      invention illustrated in FIG. 6, the output circuit 30 includes
      the two oppositely poled capacitive circuit networks 38A and 38B
      connected across each aligned pair of stator segments 82 and 84 on
      the stators 20 and 22 by means of the oppositely poled diodes 32A
      and 34A. Each of such capacitive circuit networks includes a
      capacitor 86, the opposite sides of which are connected by
      oppositely poled diodes 88 and 90 to positive and negative load
      terminals 92 and 94 across which a suitable electrical voltage is
      established for operating an electrical load. The diode 88 is
      connected to the junction 102 between diode 104 and one side of
      capacitor 106. The diode 88 is also connected to the junction
      between one side of capacitor 100 and the diode 32A. The diode 90,
      on the other hand, is interconnected with the junction 96 between
      diode 108 and capacitor 100. Also, diode 90 is connected to the
      junction between the other side of capacitor 106 and the diode
      34A. The foregoing circuit arrangement of capacitive network 38A
      is the same as that of network 38B by means of which aligned pairs
      of the stator segments 82 and 84 have the electrical potentials
      therebetween transformed into a lower voltage across the load
      terminals 92 and 94 to conduct a higher load current. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIG. 5A illustrates the distribution
      of charges established in the electric fields 12 and 14 between
      the electrodes and stators under static conditions in which each
      of the rotor segments 68 and 74 is positioned in alignment with
      one of the stator segments 82 and 84 to thereby shield alternate
      stator segments from the electric fields. The charges established
      by the electric fields are therefore confined to the faces of
      alternate stator segments confronting the electrodes and are
      equalized with the charges established on and confined to the
      shielding faces of the rotor segments confronting the electrodes
      by virtue of the electrical interconnection between the rotors and
      stators as aforementioned. As depicted in FIG. 5B, when rotation
      is imparted to the rotors, the charge linkages established by the
      electric fields between the electrodes and alternate stator
      segments 82 or 84 are interrupted by the moving rotor segments 68
      or 74 so that previously sielded stator segments become exposed to
      the fields to reestablish field energy linkages with the
      associated electrodes. Such action causes electrical potentials to
      be established between the stator segments 82 and 84. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It will be apparent from the foregoing
      description that the electrostatic energy fields 12 and 14 of
      opposite polarity are established maintained between the
      externally charged electrodes 16 and 18 and the internally charged
      stators 20 and 22 under static conditions as depicted in FIG. 5A.
      During rotation, the rotors 24 and 26 continuously disposed within
      such energy fields 12 and 14, exert forces in directions
      perpendicular to the field flux representing the energy linkages
      between electrodes and stators to cause interruptions and
      reestablishment of energy linkages with portions of different
      stator segments as depicted in FIG. 5B. Such energy linkage
      locational changes and the charge binding and unbinding actions
      between electrodes and stators creates an electrical potential and
      current to flow between stators through the output circuit 30.
      Thus, the output circuit when loaded extracts energy from the
      electric fields 12 and 14 as a result of the field linkage charge
      bindinbg and unbinding actions induced by rotation of the rotors.
      The stator segments 82 and 84 shielded from the electric fields by
      the moving rotor segments 68 and 74 as depicted in FIG. 5B, have
      electric potentials of polarity opposite to those of the external
      electrodes 16 and 18 because of the field linkage charge unbinding
      action. Previously shielded stator segments being exposed to the
      electric fields by the moving rotor segments, have the same
      electric potential polarity as those of the external electrodes
      because of field linkage binding action. Since the forces exerted
      on the respective rotors by the electric fields 12 and 14 of
      opposite polarity act on the common rotor shaft assembly
      perpendicular to said fields, such forces cancel each other. The
      energy input to the system may therefore be substantially limited
      to mechanical bearing losses and windage during conversion of
      electrostatic field energy to electrical energy as well as
      electrical resistance losses and other electrical losses
      encountered in the output circuit 30. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Based upon the foregoing operational
      characteristics, rotation of the rotors in accordance with the
      present invention does not perform any substantial work against
      the external electric fields 12 and 14 since there is no net
      change in capacitance thereby enabling the system to convert
      energy with a reduced input of mechanical energy and high
      efficiency, as evidenced by minimal loss of charge on the
      electrodes. It was therefore found that working embodiments of the
      present invention require less than ten percent of the electrical
      output energy for the mechanical input. Further, according to one
      prototype model of the invention, a relatively high output voltage
      of 300,000 volts was obtained across the stators. By reason of
      such high voltage, an output circuit 30 having a voltage reducing
      and current multiplying attribute as hereinbefore described was
      selected so as to render the system suitable for many practical
      applications. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The foregoing is considered as
      illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further
      since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to
      those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention
      to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and,
      accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be
      resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.<br>

          Generator Replication<br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      The Hyde generator is a device developed by William W. Hyde that
      puts out more energy than is used to run it (to me this means it
      must tap into some unexpected energy source.) It's basically a
      large high voltage capacitor with spinning rotor segments actually
      in between the capacitor plates, chopping the electric field at
      high speed (&gt; 6000 RPM.) Stator segments are also in between
      the capacitor plates and it is actually the electric field between
      the stator segments and the capacitor plates that is chopped. The
      resulting output energy is taken off of the stator plates using
      capacitor/diode networks.<br>
      <br>
      It's documented fairly well in US patent 4897592 - Electrostatic
      energy field power generating system. From private correspondance
      between William Hyde and Moray B. King (1), a prototype from 1987
      that contained around 2000 capacitors and diodes produced the
      following results:<br>
      <br>
      No. rotor segments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 240<br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">My 1st replication attempt</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      My 1st attempt was with a vacuum cleaner motor at one end and an
      18" long shaft with everything attached. The long shaft made it
      too unstable at high speed. The best I could safely do was around
      2700 RPM. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">My 2nd replication attempt</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      I first finished all parts for my 2nd attempt, assembled it and
      ran it for the first time on April 7, 2009. By April 23, 2009 I'd
      found I was unable to get the motor to spin the disks faster than
      4000 RPM. The motor is rated at 10,000 RPM no-load and can do that
      with featureless disks but can do only 4000 RPM with the completed
      disks. My guess is the disks with their radially cut slots and
      metal segments attached act like fans and the air load is too
      high. <br>
      <br>
      The construction details are below, following these updates.<br>
      <br>
      May 1, 2009 - Lowered air pressure to decrease load<br>
      <br>
      At the suggestion of Paul on overunity.com I sealed the box and
      lowered the pressure with a household vacuum cleaner motor. I
      managed to drop the pressure by about 0.5 PSI ( around 1 inch Hg).
      I didn't see any improvement in RPM, the best being around 3900
      RPM, so I would have to drop the air pressure even more. The outer
      acrylic window was seriously bowed inward so I don't think I'd
      want to do further improved sealing without replacing the window
      with a solid board. I'd also be afraid of going further out of
      fear of damaging my vacuum cleaner. It was worth a try though. <br>
      <br>
      May 5, 2009 - Sealed edges with packing tape - 4500 RPM!<br>
      <br>
      I guessed that maybe if I sealed the area where each rotor is,
      once the air gets moving, since it's enclosed in a circular
      pathway, it will keep most of its momentum and act like less of a
      load and I'd be picking up less new dead air. Plus, in the patent
      the rotors are sealed in a circular housing in the same manner. I
      got 4500 RPM, an encouraging improvement. I used clear packing
      tape so I wonder if I used something less crinkly if it would be
      even better. Still no HV spikes, but Hyde didn't get those until
      around 6000 RPM<br>
      <br>
      May 19, 2009 - Higher input voltage, sealed rest of housing, and a
      bang! - 5200 RPM!<br>
      <br>
      At Luc's suggestion I decided to run it with higher than the
      motor's rated input voltage of 110VAC, something I was previously
      reluctant to do but as Luc said "I was so close to the 6000 RPM".
      Luc pointed out to me how to get 2 phases out of my wall sockets
      to get up to 220VAC and even more using variacs (which I didn't
      realize variacs would do), but for starters I tried it with just
      one variac at its maximum output of 130VAC. I got 4660 RPM! My
      previous best at 4500 RPM at 110VAC so it looks like I'd get
      around 80 RPM for each 10VAC I add; not much.<br>
      <br>
      Then I decided that since I had big success on May 5 (reported
      above) with sealing just the area where the rotors were and since
      at 4660 RPM it was screaming like a banshee from the air coming
      out of the holes in the wooden box, I should seal the area where
      the motor was too, just as is done in the patent. Success, I got
      5200 RPM! Only 800 RPM to go. <br>
      <br>
      Here are some scope shots. The AC is expected and normal. It's HV
      spikes that I'm after but at no speed or voltage did I see any.
      The 757 Hz from the scope shot below is per segment, not per
      rotation of the entire rotor. There are 9 segments per rotor so to
      get RPM take the 757 Hz and divide by 9 to get rotations per
      second for the whole rotor. Then multiply by 60 to get rotations
      per minute (RPM), 5046 RPM. However, I did get 5200 RPM at one
      point, just no photo of the scope at the time. The voltage was set
      to 3kV when it was at 5200 RPM, the same voltage Hyde was using
      when he was doing 2 kW in and getting 20 kW out.<br>
      <br>
      And then there was a muffled bang and the whole box began to
      slowly slide across the floor. One of the segments had come off a
      rotor (the bang) and this unbalanced the whole thing (the slow
      sliding.) The only damage was a hole in the packing tape where the
      segment flew out from between the rotor/stator area and the
      mangled segment from when it hit the inside of the box in an
      awkward area which caused it to bounce around.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract :</span> The
      conventional twin-disc wimshurst type of electrostatic generator
      has considerably increased potential as a high voltage output
      sources when two additional stator discs are utilized on each side
      of the usual twin, counterrotating rotor discs. The emergence of
      the hyde type of electrostatic generator has spurred some interest
      in high voltage elect rostatic generators of this general type,
      but unfortunately the hyde E/S technology is not practical, and
      has a number of technical errors in it which make it unworkable.
      In the quad-disc electrostatic the basic principles of the
      wimshurst twin counterrotating E/S discs are preserved, and in
      addition a twin rotor-to-stator E/S generating factor is included
      in this composite quad-disc electrostatic generator. The twin,
      counterrotating rotor discs form the basic E/S components, and
      have both the non-contacting neutralizing brushes, and the
      non-contacting collector brushes. The positive and negative
      satator discs on each side of each rotor disc receive E/S transfer
      from the multiple conductive segments on the outer sides of each
      rotor disc. The normal E/S transfer occurs from the segments on
      the inner surfaces of each of the rotor discs. The number of
      conductive segments of each of the rotor and stator discs will
      range from a low of 30 segments, to a maximum of 60 segments,
      depending on the disc diameter and the voltage/amperage balance
      per segment. The voltage and current amplification function for
      the enhanced quad-disc E/S generator will be accomplished by twin,
      large capacitive transformers, similar to those used in the
      present Swiss M-L converter.<br>
      <br>
      The key components within these twin large captive transformers
      are the twin, large bi-filar wound coils over ferrite magnet
      stacks which transduce space energy into these polarized
      components. The wattage amplification factor is not generally
      recognized in present applied physics, but since the phenomena
      occurs in four F/E projects, past and present, it is an
      accomplished fact in advanced physics today! The enhanced quad-
      disc electrostatic generator design holds considerable promise for
      providing a useful high-voltage-to-normal wattage power source, as
      the concept is further evolved and developed. <br>
