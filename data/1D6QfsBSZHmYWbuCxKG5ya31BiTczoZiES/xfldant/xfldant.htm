        <i>Engineers Wonder if the Crossed-Field Antenna Could

      </center>
      <p>Imagine an AM antenna one-fiftieth of a wavelength long, that
        needs no radial ground system, occupies a small parcel of land,
        produces little or no RFI (Radio Frequency Interference), has
        great bandwidth and performs better than a full-sized vertical
        radiator. </p>
      <p>Does this sound like a fantasy? </p>
      <p>Until recently, it would have been. </p>
      <p>Now working models of such an antenna exist in the Middle East
        and at NAB99 (National Association of Broadcasters' 1999
        Convention in Las Vegas). </p>
      <p>( The "reversed form" (negative solution) of Maxwell's Fourth
        Equation, states that a magnetic field can be produced without
        current flowing in a wire.) </p>
      <p>On April 19, 1999, at the Las Vegas Convention Center, Brian
        Steward from the Department of Engineering at Glasgow Caledonian
        University presented a paper on what has been patented as the
        Crossed-Field Antenna. </p>
      <p><b>Synthesized field</b> </p>
      <p>Most of us have known since early in our electronics training
        that any conductor in which a radio frequency current flows can
        be an antenna. </p>
      <p>When an Radio Frequency current flows in a conductor, an
        electric (or E) field and a magnetic (or H) field are produced.
        These two fields are in quadrature (Their amplitude phases are
        90° from each other.) with one another, and at some distance,
        presumably { (increment) / 2 pi } combine into an
        electromagnetic field, which is the desired element. A
        conventional antenna, be it a dipole, a vertical radiator over a
        ground plane, a long wire or anything else, works on this
        principle. </p>
      <p>More than a decade ago, Maurice Hately, a college professor in
        Scotland, along with his then-student, Fathl Kabbary, began work
        on a completely different antenna design. The basic premise of
        this radical design is that a magnetic field can be produced
        without current flow in a wire. Hately and Kabbary claim that
        using the reversed (negative solution) form of Maxwell's fourth
        equation, they were able to prove that a magnetic field does
        exist between two capacitor plates to which a Radio Frequency
        voltage has been applied. </p>
      <p>From this beginning Hately and Kabbary report they were able to
        produce direct synthesis of the electromagnetic field using two
        large capacitor plates and two large cylinders of short length.
        The capacitor plates, called "D plates" for the term "D" in the
        Poynting theorem, were positioned parallel to one another to
        form a capacitor. The cylinders, called "E plates" were
        positioned one above and one below the D plates. When the
        cylinders were driven by a radio frequency power source, they
        produced high-frequency E-fields, thus the designation "E
        plates". </p>
      <p><b>Crossing effect</b> </p>
      <p>To synthesize the electromagnetic wave, radio frequency power
        is fed through a power divider / phasing network to the D and E
        plates. The resulting electric and magnetic fields are
        cross-stressed in phase to synthesize the Poynting vector and
        produce radiated power within the small area surrounding the
        antenna. This effect is what gives the Crossed-Field Antenna
        (CFA) its name. </p>
      <p>Several variations of the Crossed-Field Antenna were developed
        and tested. The barrel-shaped CFA was first: it featured the
        same radiation pattern as a dipole. The next evolution removed
        one of the cylinders and one of the plates, substituting a
        ground plane instead. </p>
      <p>Later, Kabbary returned to his native Egypt and continued
        experimenting with a ground plane antenna for broadcast. He
        successfully built and tested a couple of different
        configurations, settling on a design only 12-feet high over a
        ground plane of only 10 square meters. He has documented the
        successful testing of this antenna on 1161 kHz at a power level
        of 60 kW. </p>
      <p>In 1995, Kabbary made some radical design changes to the
        antenna, adding a funnel-shaped top (see photo). This design
        reportedly produced the same inverse distance field with 30 kW
        as the conventional one-quarter wavelength vertical it was
        intended to replace produced with 100 kW. The funnel-top CFA
        based in Egypt is only 21 feet tall, less than 0.025 wavelengths
        long. The vertical antenna it replaced was 211 feet long. Test
        results show up to a 9 dB (800%) advantage over the one-quarter
        wavelength vertical antenna. </p>
      <p>Reported advantages of the CFA over conventional radiators
        include: Very small size, typically around a one-fiftieth
        wavelength; High efficiency, with a 6 dB (400%) gain typical
        relative to a conventional one-quarter wavelength vertical
        radiator; Little induction field, which produces very little
        coupling between adjacent antennas; Broad bandwidth. </p>
      <p>Today, four such antennas are reported on the air and operating
        in broadcast service in Egypt. Two are at Tanta, operating from
        a rooftop at 22 kW and 100 kW respectively and separated by less
        than 20 feet. One is in operation at Barnis at 110 kW and the
        other operates in Halaieb at 5 kW. </p>
      <p>If the Crossed-Field Antenna proves to be everything the
        inventors claim, it could revolutionize the state-of-the-art in
        AM transmission systems, which has changed little since the days
        of Marconi. </p>

        --- Digital and Analog" (1-5 p.m. Monday, April 19, at the Las
        Vegas Convention Center). </p>
      <p>Patent 2,215,524 was issued in Great Briton, 626,210 in
        Australia and others issued in Europe and Japan. In 1992 the
        U.S. issued Patent Number 5,155,495. </p>

      <p>The final paper of the session featured Manohar Lal, chief
        engineer of "All India Radio", New Delhi India. </p>
      <p>Lal presented theoretical details of a new concept antenna,
        which produces high efficiency and high gain with small
        dimensions. The concept is derived from the modification of
        Maxwell's displacement current. </p>
      <p>In the 1860s, James Maxwell formulated the equations upon which
        the laws of electromagnetic radiation are based. Lal states in
        his paper that Maxwell identified a displacement current from
        the extrapolation of Ampere's law. It was merely a charging
        current such as that which exists between the plates of a
        capacitor and did not radiate a magnetic field. Its current was
        uniform in the whole area between the plates. </p>
      <p>Lal suggests that this displacement current can be modified to
        flow only at the periphery of the plates and thereby produce a
        magnetic field around it. </p>
      <p>He claims to have tested the hypothesis and can launch a signal
        with gain, bandwidth and directivity properties, which could
        revolutionize the science of building antennas. </p>

        FIELD OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates to antennas for the transmission and
        reception of radio waves for telecommunications, broadcasting
        sound and television, radar, satellite communications and the
        like. </p>
      <p>Known antennas usually have a single feeder connected to either
        a single conductor element of approximately half a wavelength,
        or to a single driven element within a group of parasitic
        elements as in the Yagi-Uda array. By means of added reactive
        components such as inductors, end capacitors, resonant traps and
        such, antennas have been constructed with somewhat smaller
        dimensions than the basic half wavelength element. Loop antennas
        are also known and are useful in direction finding. However most
        antennas of reduced dimensions have disappointing transmission
        efficiency due to the necessarily increased circulation currents
        which cause large conductor losses and or magnetic core losses.
      </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND ART <br>
        The Poynting Theorem states that for any superimposed electric
        and magnetic fields there must be energy flowing in the medium
        and thus the phenomenon of radio wave propagation has been
        explained in the presently accepted theory as the radiation of
        electromagnetic energy in the form of an electric field E and a
        magnetic field H in a cross-product Poynting vector E.times.H=S
        watts per meter squared. The perpendicular geometric
        relationship and the time synchronism implied by the above
        formula must be produced by any antenna which is to radiate
        efficiently. Presently known antennas are probably achieving the
        requirements in an uncontrolled or accidental manner. </p>
      <p>Due to extended physical dimensions and high location above the
        ground, it is probable that there is fortuitously provided in
        the large volume of space a means of setting the necessary
        perpendicularity and simultaneity as well as a degree of
        rotationality for the fields, although the absence of these
        conjectures from the present texts ought not to be used to
        condemn the validity of the concept. From the large surrounding
        and lightly stressed volume the comparatively weak Poynting
        vector progresses outwards to infinity. </p>
      <p>THE INVENTION <br>
        In accordance with one aspect of the invention a radio antenna
        in which electromagnetic waves are radiated from a small volume
        comprises two first and second separate element systems
        respectively excited for producing high frequency electric and
        magnetic fields. Separate feeder means drives each of the
        element systems. Each of the element systems is positioned in
        adjacent interactive relationship to cross stress a common
        interaction zone of both fields to create a source from which
        electromagnetic waves radiate. The element system in which the
        electric field is originated establishes a radio frequency
        potential difference across an interaction zone between two
        conducting surfaces. The element system for establishing the
        magnetic field includes two other conducting surfaces for
        establishing an intense radio frequency displacement current. A
        radio frequency potential difference of the same frequency is
        applied between two of the conducting surfaces for establishing
        an intense circulating magnetic field to cross the interaction
        zone. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment a phasing unit splits an output of a
        radio transmitter into two parts having separate delay
        arrangements to produce synchronized electric and magnetic
        fields at the interaction zone. The phasing unit preferably
        includes fixed and variable phase delay circuits and at least
        one tapped transformer and a switch for adjusting each part of
        the output of the radio transmitter. The phasing unit also
        preferably has a wideband constant phase different circuit for
        low power operation for driving either of the separate units.
        Two separate power amplifiers develop sufficient power to
        provide separate feeds to the two separate element systems of
        the antenna so that within the interaction zone radio wave power
        is synthesized. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment a single feeder is connected to one
        element system and a second feeder drives the other element
        system with a phase and magnitude to synthesize a radio
        frequency wave at a predetermined frequency band. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment, the two separate element systems are
        constructed as half structures with a conducting surface of
        sufficient area that the other half structure is defined by a
        virtual image thereof. </p>
      <p>In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, an
        antenna comprises a first set of at least two spaced elements
        defining surface lying an end to end relationship with each
        other. Radio frequency power is fed to the set of elements for
        producing an E-field between the set of elements. A second set
        of at least two spaced elements defines surfaces in face to face
        parallel planes. Radio frequency power produces a displacement
        current between the second set of spaced elements establishes an
        H field around the second set. The first and second spaced
        elements and means for feeding the radio frequency power are
        arranged so there is interactive coupling between the E and H
        fields to produce a propagating electromagnetic radio wave. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one embodiment the surfaces of the second
        set of elements are positioned between the surfaces of said
        first set of elements and perpendicular thereto. In one
        arrangement, the first set of elements comprises parallel
        circular plates. In another arrangement the first set of
        elements comprises plates and the second set of elements
        comprises parallel plates. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment one of the fields is produced by a feed
        including a coaxial feeder cable coupled through a transformer
        including a ferrite toroidal core. The first and second sets of
        elements are preferably secured and spaced by electrically
        insulating support members. A ground-plane structure may be
        provided wherein one of each of the spaced set of elements is
        constituted by a virtual image of the other element on the other
        side of a ground plane element electrically bisecting the
        antenna. </p>
      <p>In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, an
        antenna for wide bandwidth electromagnetic field polarized in a
        predetermined position at right angles to the field propagation
        direction comprises plural metal first elements that are not
        resonant in the bandwidth. The first elements are excited to
        transduce an electric field in the polarization direction over
        the bandwidth and have an extent in the polarization direction
        no greater than an order of magnitude less than the shortest
        wavelength in the wide bandwidth range. Means between the
        elements transduces a magnetic field having lines of flux
        between the elements at right angles to the polarization and
        propagation directions. The elements and means are arranged and
        the electric and magnetic fields are excited by power from the
        same source with phases so there is an interaction region of the
        fields between a pair of the metal elements to provide E.times.H
        synchronism and a radiation Poynting vector having rotational E
        and H fields to transduce the electromagnetic field. The
        elements include first and second metal plates having spaced
        planar faces substantially at right angles to the electric
        field. The plates are excited with voltages displaced in phase
        by 180.degree. so the electric field is established between said
        planar faces. A coil disposed between the plates has windings
        positioned to excite the lines of flux. The coil is excited with
        current from the same source which excites the plates with a
        current displaced in phase by 90.degree. relative to the
        voltages which excite the plates. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment, the faces of the plates diverge from a
        central region where the coil is located so curved electric
        field lines extend between the plates. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment, the elements include first, second,
        third and fourth metal plates having spaced planar faces
        substantially at right angles to the electric field. The first
        and second plates are excited with a first voltage having the
        same phase while the third and fourth plates are excited with a
        second voltage having the same phase. The first and second
        voltages are from the same source and displaced in phase from
        each other by 180.degree.. A coil disposed between the plates
        has windings positioned to excite the lines of flux. The coil is
        excited with current from the same source which excites the
        plates with a current displaced in phase by 90.degree. relative
        to the voltages which excite the plates. Preferably, the faces
        of the plates diverge from a central region where the coil is
        located so curved electric field lines extend between the first
        and third plates and between the second and fourth plates. </p>
      <p>In a further embodiment, at least one of the metal elements has
        a first surface extending (a) in substantially the same
        direction as the electric field, (b) at substantially right
        angles to the magnetic lines of flux and (c) at substantially
        right angles to the propagation direction so the electric field
        is curved as it propagates from the first surface to a second
        surface of another of the metal elements. The elements including
        the first and second surfaces are excited with voltages from the
        same source that are displaced 180.degree. from each other.
        Preferably, the another element including the second surface is
        configured so the first and second surfaces extend in
        substantially the same direction. In one embodiment the first
        and second surfaces are substantially planar and substantially
        aligned. In a second embodiment the first and second surfaces
        are cylindrical and have substantially the same radii and
        substantially common axes. The another second element may be a
        planar surface extending in a plane substantially parallel to
        the propagation direction. In this case, the first surface is
        cylindrical and the first surface has an axis substantially at
        right angles to the plane of the second element. In the further
        embodiment, the magnetic field is transduced by a coil disposed
        between the elements and having windings positioned to excite
        the lines of flux. The coil is excited with current from the
        same source which excites the elements with a current displaced
        in phase by 90.degree. relative to the voltages which excite the
        elements. In this arrangement the another element is
        configurated so the first and second surfaces extend in
        substantially the same direction and the first and second
        surfaces are preferably substantially planar and substantially
        aligned. </p>
      <p>In still another embodiment the magnetic field is transduced by
        a capacitor having first and second substantially parallel
        planar electrodes extending substantially in the direction of
        propagation and substantially at right angles to the electric
        field lines. The electrodes are excited so voltages phase
        displaced from each other by 180.degree. are applied to the
        first and second electrodes so a displacement current correlated
        with the magnetic field subsists. In this arrangement,
        preferably at least one of the metal elements has a first
        surface extending (a) in substantially the same direction as the
        electric field, (b) substantially at right angles to the
        magnetic lines of flux and (c) substantially at right angles to
        the propagation direction so the electric field is curved as it
        propagates from the first surface to a second surface of another
        of the metal elements. The elements are excited by a means
        including the first and second surfaces with voltages from the
        same source that are displaced 180.degree. from each other. The
        another element is preferably configured so the first and second
        surfaces extend in substantially the same direction and the
        first and second surfaces are substantially planar and
        substantially aligned. </p>
      <p>The first and second surfaces are cylindrical in still another
        arrangement wherein the first and second surfaces have
        substantially the same radii and substantially common axes. The
        second element may include a planar surface that extends in a
        plane substantially parallel to the propagation direction, in
        which case the second element preferably includes the second
        electrode. A first cable includes a first feed line extending
        through a central aperture of the first electrode. The first
        line is connected to the first element and a second line
        connected to the second element. A second cable including third
        and fourth lines is connected to terminals of a primary winding
        of a transformer having a secondary winding having opposite
        terminals respectively connected to the first electrode and the
        second element. The cables may be coaxial so the first and third
        lines are respectively center conductors of the first and second
        cables and the second and fourth lines are respectively shields
        of the first and second cables. </p>
      <p>The invention is further described and illustrated with

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 is a plan view of an elementary form of a twin feeder
        crossed field antenna according to this invention. The
        horizontal coil 1 is fed by feeder 2 via matching and isolating
        transformer 3 and carries a radio frequency current shown by
        arrows indicating an anticlockwise maximum in the cycle time.
        Thus upwardly directed in the center of the coil there is high
        magnetic field density H from J+D'=.gradient.XH which returns
        downwards all around the periphery of the coil. There are two
        pairs of conducting plates 4 and 5, 6 and 7, with planes
        standing vertically which are insulated from everything else but
        are fed with antiphase voltage of the same frequency in pairs as
        shown, by power in feeder 8 via matching and isolating
        transformer 9. At the same instant in the cycle the plate pair 4
        and 5 are electrically positive relative to the plate pair 6 and
        7. Thus due to the very small dimension of the whole antenna,
        the propagation delay across the interaction zones marked X and
        Y is negligible and so the correct simultaneity, orthogonality
        and rotationality exists and Poynting vector synthesis occurs
        and radio power radiates away with the velocity of light in the
        directions marked S. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 is a diagram of the same antenna in elevation. </p>
      <p>Detailed consideration of the phase requirement may be deduced
        as follows. Sinusoidal carrier waves are being applied and
        electric field E is in phase with the voltage across the plate
        pairs. The retardation due to size is negligible as is the
        magnetic field retardation around the coil. Thus the field H is
        in synchronism with the current causing it, that is the magnetic
        field is in phase with the current. Current in a coil is however
        always lagging by about 90.degree. relative to the voltage
        across the coil due to self inductance. So, in order to obtain
        phase synchronism of the fields interacting in the crossed field
        antenna, the feed voltage to the coil needs to be approximately
        90.degree. advanced on the feed voltage between the electrical
        plates. If both transformers have identical phase
        characteristics, the signal to feeder 2 must to be phase
        advanced by 90.degree. compared with the voltage supplied to
        feeder 8. Cable lengths are only significant if different, so
        for a single frequency application an electrical quarter
        wavelength extra in feeder 8 would fulfil the phase requirement.
        By providing a power divider so that a single transmitter
        supplies approximately half the power to each of the twin
        feeders, the interaction zone radiates the total power in the
        synthesised Poynting vector An antenna for general radio
        communications requiring many operational frequency changes must
        to have a phase adjusting unit. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 is a circuit diagram of a simple phasing unit with which
        the said phase adjustment could be provided The transmitter
        power is split partly into the upper capacitive path and partly
        into the lower inductive path. Setting the capacitor 10 to some
        value will give 45.degree. advance; setting the inductor to
        another value will result in a corresponding 45.degree. delay
        which will ensure that after stimulating the two fields the
        radio wave will be correctly synthesised in the interaction
        zones. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 shows a more sophisticated form of phasing unit which
        will provide phasing for any kind of twin feeder crossed field
        antenna under almost any circumstances over a wide frequency
        range. A switched auto transformer 12 is connected to feeder
        output 88 and is preceded by phase adjustment arrangements
        switchable into either sense by switch 14, of which coarse
        settings are provided by the dual gang switch 13A, 13B and a
        selection of cable lengths 15, and a fine adjustment by the
        variable capacitor 16. </p>
      <p>A more complex phase adjustment system, (not shown) would have
        a series of two-pole change-over switches able to connect any
        total combination of delay cables selected from a sequence of
        lengths incremented in a 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
        metersystem. Such a scheme would allow a user to correct the
        phase of the feed to a crossed field antenna such that a single
        device could be radiating successfully at any frequency in the
        whole HF spectrum. </p>
      <p>In a further preferred arrangement the phasing unit has a
        wideband constant phase difference circuit for low power
        operation and followed, either inside the unit or outside as two
        separate units, by two separate power amplifiers which develop
        sufficient power to provide separate feeds to the two electrode
        systems of the antenna so that within the interaction zone
        sufficient radio wave power is synthesised. </p>
      <p>An alternative twin feeder crossed field antenna which will
        radiate vertically polarized waves instead of horizontal, is
        shown in FIG. 5. The antenna consists of a narrow vertical coil
        17 fed from cable 2C via matching transformer 18, and two
        conducting plates 19 and 20 fed by feeder 8C via matching and
        isolating transformer 21. A widespread electric field E is
        created in arcs from the top plate to the lower plate and
        produces a cross-product with the magnetic field H rotating in
        the directions indicated and thus synthesises intense Poynting
        vectors S which radiate outwards in broad azimuthal angles to
        space. The said antenna having several advantageous features
        namely a reduced number of components and also a larger
        interaction volume than has the first type according to FIGS. 1
        and 2. The first feature reduces costs and simplifies the
        structure. The second advantage gives enhanced signal voltages
        when used in the receive mode. Furthermore, since any one of the
        four input terminals (two plates and two coil terminals) may be
        connected to earth it will be optimal to have the lower plate
        earthed for safety as well as providing an opportunity to bond
        the screens of the coaxial feeders thereto. </p>
      <p>It is possible for transformer 21 to be dispensed with, and
        direct feed from the inner conductor of feeder 8C to be
        connected to the upper plate 19 with the screen remaining
        connected to plate 20. </p>
      <p>As a further development of the twin feeder crossed field
        antenna types which use a coil to generate the magnetic field, a
        further arrangement is proposed called the Maxwell type, in
        which the magnetic field is produced from an electric field
        displacement current located within a capacitor. It is an
        arrangement which has many advantages theoretically and
        practically, and allows the construction of a truly
        omnidirectional vertically polarised antenna. Examination of the
        Maxwell law D'=.gradient.XH where D'=.delta.D/.delta.t shows
        that a changing displacement field causes a rotational magnetic
        field. As the displacement current density is simply related in
        space (or in air) by the formula D'=.epsilon.E' where E is the
        electric field intensity and .epsilon. is the dielectric
        constant, it is easy to calculate that this will be a very
        useful technique for HF crossed field antennas of small size.
        Also it can be seen that as before, the S= E.times.H
        relationship of the Poynting vector demands geometric
        perpendicularity synchronism and rotational form to both fields
        The differentiation with respect to time within the Maxwell law
        again inserts a 90.degree. phase change but in this type it is
        of the opposite sign. There is a 90.degree. advance of magnetic
        field relative to the voltage gradient and so there must be a
        90.degree. delay in the voltage fed to the plates of the said
        capacitor. The Maxwell type of crossed field antenna requires
        two separate electric field stimulator plates; one pair as in
        the first type to initiate the E field, and the other pair to
        initiate the magnetic field by the Maxwell law The second pair
        are called therefore, the D plates. In total there are four
        phases of electric potential within the antenna structure:
        0.degree. and 180.degree. of the E plates; 90.degree. and
        270.degree. of the D plates </p>
      <p>FIG. 6 is a diagram of a basic form of the Maxwell type of twin
        feeder crossed field antenna. Two flat plates 22 and 23,
        standing vertically are insulated from other electrodes and
        ground and are fed by coaxial cable 26 via matching and
        isolating transformer 27, thereby producing the electric field E
        shown in the downwards phase. Two insulated flat elliptical
        plates 24 and 25, disposed horizontally are also insulated from
        earth and other electrodes and constitute the capacitor within
        which a large displacement current density D' is produced by
        radio frequency power arriving from feeder 28 via matching and
        isolating transformer 29. The rapidly changing displacement
        current is then the origin of the considerably curved H around
        the whole antenna in the direction shown. In the wide
        interaction zones at mid height, in front of and behind the
        structure, copious field crossing is present and so considerable
        Poynting vector power density is generated and radio waves
        propagate away at the velocity of light in the directions shown
        S. The waves are vertically polarised; the horizontal polar
        diagram is a figure of eight. The lower plate may be earthed and
        the screens of the coaxial feeders bonded to it. The transformer
        27 may be dispensed with and a direct connection made between
        the inner of the feeder 26 and the plate 23. </p>
      <p>Many variants of the Maxwell type are conceivable and they
        constitute a generic family of twin feeder crossed field
        antennas disclosed herein. For instance the form described in
        FIG. 6 could be turned through 90.degree. and it will then
        generate horizontally polarised waves and have a radiation polar
        diagram which is a figure of eight in the horizontal plane. </p>
      <p>Two further antennas of this family will b described as they
        are important in having a robust structural shape as well as a
        vertically polarised omnidirectional radiation which is often
        required in broadcasting and communicating to mobiles </p>
      <p>FIG. 7 is a diagram of the cylindrical form of Maxwell type
        crossed field antenna. The downwards electric field E is
        initiated by voltage between the hollow cylindrical conducting
        electrodes 30 and 31 which are fed from feeder via matching
        transformer 33 The lower cylinder may stand safely on the ground
        or could be formed as a flat plate on site. The displacement
        current D' is stimulated upwards at the same time in the cycle
        by feeding the appropriate phase voltage between the two
        horizontal disc conductors 34 and 35 (having their central area
        removed for space to mount transformers, feeders etc.) using
        feeder 36 via matching and isolating transformer 37. Should
        there be a requirement to reduce weight or wind resistance, the
        said electrodes and conductors may be made with alternative
        materials such as conducting wire mesh, or a conducting surface
        applied to a plastics or other non-conducting structural
        component. </p>
      <p>FIG. 8 is a diagram of a ground plane (or half symmetry) form
        of the cylindrical twin feeder crossed field antenna of the
        Maxwell type. The downwards electric field E is produced by
        applying a voltage between the hollow conducting cylinder 37 and
        the large conducting earth plane 38 with the upwards
        displacement current D' from the said earth plane to the
        circular conducting plate 39 with a central missing area marked
        39a in order to create the required rotational magnetic field H
        to interact with the said E field and synthesise the Poynting
        vector S radiating all round to space. </p>
      <p>In a practical construction for the frequency range 3.6 to 30
        MHz, the cylinder 37 has a height of 25 cm and a diameter of 20
        cm with the base spaced 10 cm from the plate 39. Plate 39 has a
        diameter of 40 cm and is positioned coplanar to and 5 cm
        distance from plane 38. The parts may be mechanically connected
        by insulating pillars or foamed plastics blocks. </p>
      <p>The feed arrangement is shown in FIG. 9 and this has the
        E-field feeder 90 connected between ground plane 38 and cylinder
        37 and the H-field feeder 91 terminating in toroidal ferrite
        coupling transformer 92 feeding between ground plane 38 and
        plate 39. It is important that the outer conductor of feeder 91
        is not electrically connected with any part of the structure. </p>
      <p>For weatherproofing the structure may be encased for protection
        but in a preferred embodiment a louvred or apertured screen is
        used in conjunction with a top cover to provide air through
        flow. </p>
      <p>Twin feeder crossed field antennas of the above forms or other
        forms may be made almost as small as desired. With correct time
        phasing, the power radiated from the interaction zones can be
        made as large as desired and is limited only by the necessary
        voltages at the electrodes and the ultimate possibility of
        corona discharge. However since the plates are large in area
        compared with the surface areas for wire antennas the problem is
        of comparative insignificance. Antennas of these types only
        1/200 th of a wavelength in length (and less in diameter) have
        been able to radiate 400 watts on HF with no perceptible
        problems of electrode distress Calculations show that for the
        magnitudes of voltage used in wire antennas, teraWatt
        capabilities will be possible with crossed field antennas. There
        are no large circulating currents in any conductor since nothing
        is in resonance. It is a major advantage of the twin feeder
        crossed field antenna system that it is broadband, and low Q.
        For any given antenna radiating efficiently because it is
        correctly phased, the bandwidth is very broad, firstly because
        of the phase-sense of frequency change acting by the Maxwell Law
        is the same sense as change due to a wave on the delay cable,
        secondly because the two fields are both originated from
        capacitor stimulus and also change in the same phase sense,
        thirdly the two fields interact in such a way as to provide a
        lower input impedance in each capacitor and therefore
        self-optimise the synthesis. Thus an antenna which is say 1/400
        th of a wavelength height may be expected to have a small
        depreciation of efficiency by a frequency change of about plus
        and minus 15%. </p>
      <p>Many of the electrical properties of the system described are
        not critical. For instance the adjustments needed in the phasing
        unit to produce a low VSWR in the common feeder leading will be
        found in practice to be self-optimising. The magnetic field
        generated around the displacement current capacitor is in the
        direction of curvature to reduce the impedance experienced by
        the electric field generator since the synthesised Poynting
        vector takes away power from the radio wave continuously, and at
        no part of the cycle does the E field find its path as impedant
        as normal space; it is always presented to the field lines as a
        power sink as long as the magnetic field H is synchronous For
        the same reasons, the H field lines flow into a low reluctance
        interaction zone of a similar power sinking nature due to the
        cross-curved E field in phase at all times. Only in the
        unproductive zones around the antenna do the fields experience
        the normal path impedance and reluctances. The crossed field
        antenna system is almost an efficient "open frequency" antenna
        It will also receive radio signals and so may be used in two
        way-radio systems. </p>
      <p>In fact the new device is such a small sized source that many
        techniques not before possible are now within easy achievement.
        When used in a reflecting or phasing arrangement, the crossed
        field antenna allows perceptible directivity to be attained in
        either transmit or receive modes even when the waves concerned
        are much larger than the reflector or array diameter. </p>
      <p>The radio antenna may be used to radiate or receive
        electromagnetic waves when mounted within or along with other
        conductors, or conducting surfaces in order to reflect, direct,
        focus or enhance the said radiation or fed with either constant
        phase related power in parts, or varying phase power in parts so
        that a shaped radiation pattern is produced by the array and may
