      <p>Edward H Lanier and son (Edward M), Miami and Jacksonville FL,
        Covington KY. 1943: (E M) Lanier Aircraft Corp, Marlton NJ. </p>
      <p>1908-22 - Of interest is that the elder Lanier was also
        inventor of the ice cream cone, which he created while an
        exhibitor at the 1898 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Although
        he had a profitable business selling patented cone-making
        machines, his real fascination was with flight. </p>
      <p>NOTE: if interested in Lanier's theories and applications, an
        incredibly detailed and scholarly 32-page research project is
        presently (2007) online as a downloadable PDF file. A 23-page
        version is also available in HTML format via Google search but
        lacks all graphics pertaining to the text. </p>
      <p>&nbsp; Lanier Paraplane PL-8 [N4157A] (Lanier via Ron Dupas
        coll) </p>
      <p>110 Paraplane Commuter PL-8 1958 = 1-2pClwM; 150hp Lycoming
        O-320; span: 20'7" length: 21'5" load: 500# v: 165/151/30 range:
        625 ceiling: 23,000'. Controllable slow-flight at 20-25 mph;
        take-off and land in 60'. [N4157A]. (The name, Paraplane, fell
        out of copyright and was adopted for powered parachutes c.2000.)

      <p>120 Paraplane I, Paraplane II 1949 = 1pClwM; 90hp Continental
        A-90; span: 20'5" length: 22'0" load (prototype): 455# v:
        120/30-120/28; ff: ?? (p: Leo Riley). POP: 1 test-bed used by
        Office of Naval Research in STOL evaluation [N9060H]. <b>Inverted






          "Vacucell" gull-wing with an air scoop below and vacuum-slots
          on top—operated by a hand-crank in the cockpit—enabled slow
          flight at 19mph, take-off in 100', a 30° climb angle and 40°
          descent angle, and was spin- and stall-proof. Modified
          Paraplane II showed up in 1949 with a 22'6" wing and was
          capable of nearly hovering.</b> </p>
      <p>443 Paraplane 1949 = Little data were found, but this was
        apparently a larger, possibly high-wing, reconstruction of the
        previous with 180hp Lycoming O-320; v: 171/x/30. POP: 1 [N9060H]
        (transferred from 120 Paraplane?). Project abandoned c.1955
        after failing to attract a market. </p>
      <p>Vacuplane 1928-33 - A series of experiments to explore Lanier's
        ideas on low-speed flight. Relative US patents from 1930-33:
        #1,750,529, #1,779,005, #1,803,805, #1,813,627, #1,866,214, and
        #1,913,809. <b>The idea was to adopt the vacuum principle for
          inherent stability, especially at stalling conditions. Low
          speed was achieved by placing an upwardly-open concave cell
          ("vacuum cell") in the center section of the aircraft, most
          often blending into the fuselage. Slots were also involved.
          Hence reduced air pressure evolved in the cell which, of
          course, had a positive influence on the lift. </b>Most
        Vacuplanes involved the University of Miami aeronautics
        department and its director, Prof F H Given, to some
        degree—details are sketchy. Vacuplane documentation is chaotic,
        and likely no one will ever sort it out, so the following
        information on the XLs should be regarded as a mixture of facts
        with some added educated guesses. (— Lennart Johnsson) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XL-1 1928 = 1pOlwM; Anzani; span: 8'10"(?).
        The wings were spaced away from the fuselage to allow the air to
        flow against the vacuum cell. [3505] c/n 1. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XL-2 1930 = 1pCmwM; 85hp LeBlond 5DF. Here
        the vacuum cell was mounted as a separate box on top of the
        fuselage. Full-cantilever wing with a span of at least 25',
        reportedly a modified Durand 13 airfoil. Twin fins and rudders.
        Pilot in an enclosed cabin under the wing. [X816Y] c/n XL-2. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XL-3 c.1931 = 1pChwM; span: 13'10" v:
        90/x/25; take-off in about 50'. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XL-4 1931 = 1pChwM; LeBlond. XL-3 modified
        with stabilizing wingtip "winglets"; v: 110/x/25. The wing was
        mounted as a parasol on top of a central pillar which also
        housed the pilot. [11512] c/n X-141. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LVF (XL-5) 1932 = 1p or 2pOmwM; 36hp
        Aeronca; span: 14'4" load: 225# v: 96/80/30 range: 250. Take-off
        run: 90'. A<b> number of pilots found it stable enough not to
          slip or dive in a stall. In landing it had a tendency to favor
          a steep descent with control maintained at minimum forward
          speed.</b> [X12865] c/n XL-5. Some data refer to it as
        XL-5&gt; from its c/n. A mysterious, Roman-numbered XL-III
        referred to in some documents might be identical with this one.

        a flap 74 pivoted on this lower portion which moves from a
        closed position flush with the aerofoil, Fig. 1, to an open
        position projecting below the scoop. Fig. 2. There may be a
        further flap 29 on the upper aerofoil surface, and a further
        converging passage 17 further forward on the aerofoil. The
        movable rear wall may comprise a flexible surface 63, 53 of
        which the upper part is pulled open by a link 66, 58, the lower
        part only being attached to ribs 64, 43 which pivot at 66, 56 to
        open the inlet of the passage. The scoop 62 and the flap 74,
        Fig. 4, both assist in increasing the airflow through the
        passage, where it is accelerated and then added to the boundary
        layer on the upper aerofoil surface. It is stated that an
        aircraft with wings of a cross-section as shown flew at 19 miles
        per hour without loss of height. Actuation,-The linkage may be
        controlled by torque tubes 19, 21 which in turn control either
        rods, as shown, or cables, and/or possibly hydraulic circuitry
        or electric servomotors. Actuation of torque tube 21 alone will
        move spoiler flap 29 only (by links 23 and 28), the compensatory
        mechanisms 24, 26 imparting no movements to arms 47, 69 until
        arms 46, 68 are moved by torque tube 19. Movement of torque tube
        19 opens both the passages 17, 18, the throat of the front
        passage 17 being controlled by link 34, bellcrank 36 and link
        58, and link 32, crank 33 and link 42 controlling the movement
        of rib 54 pivoting at 56, links 34, 37 transmitting control to
        similar linkages for the rear passage 18. As the front passage
        is opened crank 33 transmits via rod 44 a movement to arm 46 of
        the compensating mechanism 24. This transmits a portion of this
        movement to arm 47, the portion depending on the position of arm
        31. Movement of arm 47 controls flap 57 by link 48, bellcrank 49
        and link 51. The rear flap 74 is similarly controlled via
        compensating mechanism 26. </p>
