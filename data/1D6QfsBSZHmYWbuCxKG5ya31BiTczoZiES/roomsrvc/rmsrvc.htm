        In the final stages of dehydration the body shrinks, robbing
        youth from the young as the skin puckers, eyes recede into
        orbits, and the tongue swells and cracks. Brain cells shrivel
        and muscles seize. The kidneys shut down. Blood volume drops,
        triggering hypovolemic shock, with its attendant respiratory and
        cardiac failures. These combined assaults disrupt the chemical
        and electrical pathways of the body until all systems cascade
        toward death.
        <p>Such is also the path of a dying species. Beyond a critical
          point, the collective body of a unique kind of mammal or bird
          or amphibian or tree cannot be salvaged, no matter the first
          aid rendered. Too few individuals spread too far apart, or too
          genetically weakened, are susceptible to even small natural
          disasters: a passing thunderstorm; an unexpected freeze;
          drought. At fewer than 50 members, populations experience
          increasingly random fluctuations until a kind of fatal
          arrhythmia takes hold. Eventually, an entire genetic legacy,
          born in the beginnings of life on earth, is removed from the
          future. </p>
        <p>Scientists recognise that species continually disappear at a
          background extinction rate estimated at about one species per
          million per year, with new species replacing the lost in a
          sustainable fashion. Occasional mass extinctions convulse this
          orderly norm, followed by excruciatingly slow recoveries as
          new species emerge from the remaining gene-pool, until the
          world is once again repopulated by a different catalogue of
          flora and fauna. </p>
        <p>From what we understand so far, five great extinction events
          have reshaped earth in cataclysmic ways in the past 439
          million years, each one wiping out between 50 and 95 per cent
          of the life of the day, including the dominant life forms; the
          most recent event killing off the non-avian dinosaurs.
          Speciations followed, but an analysis published in Nature
          showed that it takes 10 million years before biological
          diversity even begins to approach what existed before a
          die-off. </p>
        <p>Today we're living through the sixth great extinction,
          sometimes known as the Holocene extinction event. We carried
          its seeds with us 50,000 years ago as we migrated beyond
          Africa with Stone Age blades, darts, and harpoons, entering
          pristine Ice Age ecosystems and changing them forever by
          wiping out at least some of the unique megafauna of the times,
          including, perhaps, the sabre-toothed cats and woolly
          mammoths. When the ice retreated, we terminated the long and
          biologically rich epoch sometimes called the Edenic period
          with assaults from our newest weapons: hoes, scythes, cattle,
          goats, and pigs. </p>
        <p>But, as harmful as our forebears may have been, nothing
          compares to what's under way today. Throughout the 20th
          century the causes of extinction - habitat degradation,
          overexploitation, agricultural monocultures, human-borne
          invasive species, human-induced climate-change --- increased
          exponentially, until now in the 21st century the rate is
          nothing short of explosive. The World Conservation Union's Red
          List --- a database measuring the global status of Earth's 1.5
          million scientifically named species --- tells a haunting tale
          of unchecked, unaddressed, and accelerating biocide. </p>
        <p>When we hear of extinction, most of us think of the plight of
          the rhino, tiger, panda or blue whale. But these sad sagas are
          only small pieces of the extinction puzzle. The overall
          numbers are terrifying. Of the 40,168 species that the 10,000
          scientists in the World Conservation Union have assessed, one
          in four mammals, one in eight birds, one in three amphibians,
          one in three conifers and other gymnosperms are at risk of
          extinction. The peril faced by other classes of organisms is
          less thoroughly analysed, but fully 40 per cent of the
          examined species of planet earth are in danger, including
          perhaps 51 per cent of reptiles, 52 per cent of insects, and
          73 per cent of flowering plants. </p>
        <p>By the most conservative measure - based on the last
          century's recorded extinctions - the current rate of
          extinction is 100 times the background rate. But the eminent
          Harvard biologist Edward O Wilson, and other scientists,
          estimate that the true rate is more like 1,000 to 10,000 times
          the background rate. The actual annual sum is only an educated
          guess, because no scientist believes that the tally of life
          ends at the 1.5 million species already discovered; estimates
          range as high as 100 million species on earth, with 10 million
          as the median guess. Bracketed between best- and worst-case
          scenarios, then, somewhere between 2.7 and 270 species are
          erased from existence every day. Including today. </p>
        <p>We now understand that the majority of life on Earth has
          never been --- and will never be --- known to us. In a
          staggering forecast, Wilson predicts that our present course
          will lead to the extinction of half of all plant and animal
          species by 2100. </p>
        <p>You probably had no idea. Few do. A poll by the American
          Museum of Natural History finds that seven in 10 biologists
          believe that mass extinction poses a colossal threat to human
          existence, a more serious environmental problem than even its
          contributor, global warming; and that the dangers of mass
          extinction are woefully underestimated by almost everyone
          outside science. In the 200 years since French naturalist
          Georges Cuvier first floated the concept of extinction, after
          examining fossil bones and concluding "the existence of a
          world previous to ours, destroyed by some sort of
          catastrophe", we have only slowly recognised and attempted to
          correct our own catastrophic behaviour. </p>
        <p>Some nations move more slowly than others. In 1992, an
          international summit produced a treaty called the Convention
          on Biological Diversity that was subsequently ratified by 190
          nations - all except the unlikely coalition of the United
          States, Iraq, the Vatican, Somalia, Andorra and Brunei. The
          European Union later called on the world to arrest the decline
          of species and ecosystems by 2010. Last year, worried
          biodiversity experts called for the establishment of a
          scientific body akin to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
          Change to provide a united voice on the extinction crisis and
          urge governments to action. </p>
        <p>Yet, despite these efforts, the Red List, updated every two
          years, continues to show metastatic growth. There are a few
          heartening examples of so-called Lazarus species lost and then
          found: the wollemi pine and the mahogany glider in Australia,
          the Jerdon's courser in India, the takahe in New Zealand, and,
          maybe, the ivory-billed woodpecker in the United States. But
          for virtually all others, the Red List is a dry country with
          little hope of rain, as species ratchet down the listings from
          secure to vulnerable, to endangered, to critically endangered,
          to extinct. </p>
        <p>All these disappearing species are part of a fragile membrane
          of organisms wrapped around the Earth so thinly, writes
          Wilson, that it "cannot be seen edgewise from a space shuttle,
          yet so internally complex that most species composing it
          remain undiscovered". We owe everything to this membrane of
          life. Literally everything. The air we breathe. The food we
          eat. The materials of our homes, clothes, books, computers,
          medicines. Goods and services that we can't even imagine we'll
          someday need will come from species we have yet to identify.
          The proverbial cure for cancer. The genetic fountain of youth.
          Immortality. Mortality. The living membrane we so recklessly
          destroy is existence itself. </p>
        <p>Biodiversity is defined as the sum of an area's genes (the
          building blocks of inheritance), species (organisms that can
          interbreed), and ecosystems (amalgamations of species in their
          geological and chemical landscapes). The richer an area's
          biodiversity, the tougher its immune system, since
          biodiversity includes not only the number of species but also
          the number of individuals within that species, and all the
          inherent genetic variations --- life's only army against the
          diseases of oblivion. </p>
        <p>Yet it's a mistake to think that critical genetic pools exist
          only in the gaudy show of the coral reefs, or the cacophony of
          the rainforest. Although a hallmark of the desert is the
          sparseness of its garden, the orderly progression of plants
          and the understated camouflage of its animals, this is only an
          illusion. Turn the desert inside out and upside down and
          you'll discover its true nature. Escaping drought and heat,
          life goes underground in a tangled overexuberance of roots and
          burrows reminiscent of a rainforest canopy, competing for
          moisture, not light. Animal trails criss-cross this
          subterranean realm in private burrows engineered, inhabited,
          stolen, shared and fought over by ants, beetles, wasps,
          cicadas, tarantulas, spiders, lizards, snakes, mice,
          squirrels, rats, foxes, tortoises, badgers and coyotes. </p>
        <p>To survive the heat and drought, desert life pioneers
          ingenious solutions. Coyotes dig and maintain wells in
          arroyos, probing deep for water. White-winged doves use their
          bodies as canteens, drinking enough when the opportunity
          arises to increase their bodyweight by more than 15 per cent.
          Black-tailed jack rabbits tolerate internal temperatures of
          111F. Western box turtles store water in their oversized
          bladders and urinate on themselves to stay cool. Mesquite
          grows taproots more than 160ft deep in search of moisture. </p>
        <p>These life-forms and their life strategies compose what we
          might think of as the "body" of the desert, with some species
          the lungs and others the liver, the blood, the skin. The trend
          in scientific investigation in recent decades has been toward
          understanding the interconnectedness of the bodily components,
          i.e. the effect one species has on the others. The loss of
          even one species irrevocably changes the desert (or the
          tundra, rainforest, prairie, coastal estuary, coral reef, and
          so on) as we know it, just as the loss of each human being
          changes his or her family forever. </p>
        <p>Nowhere is this better proven than in a 12-year study
          conducted in the Chihuahuan desert by James H Brown and Edward
          Heske of the University of New Mexico. When a kangaroo-rat
          guild composed of three closely related species was removed,
          shrublands quickly converted to grasslands, which supported
          fewer annual plants, which in turn supported fewer birds. Even
          humble players mediate stability. So when you and I hear of
          this year's extinction of the Yangtze river dolphin, and
          think, "how sad", we're not calculating the deepest cost: that
          extinctions lead to co-extinctions because most living things
          on Earth support a few symbionts, while keystone species
          influence and support myriad plants and animals. Army ants,
          for example, are known to support 100 known species, from
          beetles to birds. A European study finds steep declines in
          honeybee diversity in the past 25 years but also significant
          attendant declines in plants that depend on bees for
          pollination --- a job estimated to be worth £50bn worldwide.
          Meanwhile, beekeepers in 24 American states report that
          perhaps 70 per cent of their colonies have recently died off,
          threatening £7bn in US agriculture. And bees are only a small
          part of the pollinator crisis. </p>
        <p>One of the most alarming developments is the rapid decline
          not just of species but of higher taxa, such as the class
          Amphibia, the 300-million-year-old group of frogs,
          salamanders, newts and toads hardy enough to have preceded and
          then outlived most dinosaurs. Biologists first noticed
          die-offs two decades ago, and, since then, have watched as
          seemingly robust amphibian species vanished in as little as
          six months. The causes cover the spectrum of human
          environmental assaults, including rising ultraviolet radiation
          from a thinning ozone layer, increases in pollutants and
          pesticides, habitat loss from agriculture and urbanisation,
          invasions of exotic species, the wildlife trade, light
          pollution, and fungal diseases. Sometimes stressors merge to
          form an unwholesome synergy; an African frog brought to the
          West in the 1950s for use in human pregnancy tests likely
          introduced a fungus deadly to native frogs. Meanwhile, a
          recent analysis in Nature estimated that, in the past 20
          years, at least 70 species of South American frogs had gone
          extinct as a result of climate change. </p>
        <p>In a 2004 analysis published in <i>Science</i>, Lian Pin Koh
          and his colleagues predict that an initially modest
          co-extinction rate will climb alarmingly as host extinctions
          rise in the near future. Graphed out, the forecast mirrors the
          rising curve of an infectious disease, with the human species
          acting all the parts: the pathogen, the vector, the Typhoid
          Mary who refuses culpability, and, ultimately, one of up to
          100 million victims. </p>
        <p>"Rewilding" is bigger, broader, and bolder than humans have
          thought before. Many conservation biologists believe it's our
          best hope for arresting the sixth great extinction. Wilson
          calls it "mainstream conservation writ large for future
          generations". This is because more of what we've done until
          now - protecting pretty landscapes, attempts at sustainable
          development, community-based conservation and ecosystem
          management --- will not preserve biodiversity through the
          critical next century. By then, half of all species will be
          lost, by Wilson's calculation. </p>
        <p>To save Earth's living membrane, we must put its shattered
          pieces back together. Only "megapreserves" modelled on a deep
          scientific understanding of continent-wide ecosystem needs
          hold that promise. "What I have been preparing to say is
          this," wrote Thoreau more than 150 years ago. "In wildness is
          the preservation of the world." This, science finally
          understands. </p>
        <p>The Wildlands Project, the conservation group spearheading
          the drive to rewild North America - by reconnecting remaining
          wildernesses (parks, refuges, national forests, and local land
          trust holdings) through corridors --- calls for reconnecting
          wild North America in four broad "megalinkages": along the
          Rocky Mountain spine of the continent from Alaska to Mexico;
          across the arctic/boreal from Alaska to Labrador; along the
          Atlantic via the Appalachians; and along the Pacific via the
          Sierra Nevada into the Baja peninsula. Within each
          megalinkage, core protected areas would be connected by
          mosaics of public and private lands providing safe passage for
          wildlife to travel freely. Broad, vegetated overpasses would
          link wilderness areas split by roads. Private landowners would
          be enticed to either donate land or adopt policies of good
          stewardship along critical pathways. </p>
        <p>It's a radical vision, one the Wildlands Project expects will
          take 100 years or more to complete, and one that has won the
          project a special enmity from those who view environmentalists
          with suspicion. Yet the core brainchild of the Wildlands
          Project --- that true conservation must happen on an
          ecosystem-wide scale --- is now widely accepted. Many
          conservation organisations are already collaborating on the
          project, including international players such as Naturalia in
          Mexico, US national heavyweights like Defenders of Wildlife,
          and regional experts from the Southern Rockies Ecosystem
          Project to the Grand Canyon Wildlands Council. Kim Vacariu,
          the South-west director of the US's Wildlands Project, reports
          that ranchers are coming round, one town meeting at a time,
          and that there is interest, if not yet support, from the
          insurance industry and others who "face the reality of
          car-wildlife collisions daily". </p>
        <p>At its heart, rewilding is based on living with the monster
          under the bed, since the big, scary animals that frightened us
          in childhood, and still do, are the fierce guardians of
          biodiversity. Without wolves, wolverines, grizzlies, black
          bears, mountain lions and jaguars, wild populations shift
          toward the herbivores, who proceed to eat plants into
          extinction, taking birds, bees, reptiles, amphibians and
          rodents with them. A tenet of ecology states that the world is
          green because carnivores eat herbivores. Yet the big
          carnivores continue to die out because we fear and hunt them
          and because they need more room than we preserve and connect.
          Male wolverines, for instance, can possess home ranges of 600
          sq m. Translated, Greater London would have room for only one.
        </p>
        <p>The first campaign out of the Wildlands Project's starting
          gate is the "spine of the continent", along the mountains from
          Alaska to Mexico, today fractured by roads, logging, oil and
          gas development, grazing, ski resorts, motorised back-country
          recreation and sprawl. </p>
        <p>The spine already contains dozens of core wildlands,
          including wilderness areas, national parks, national
          monuments, wildlife refuges, and private holdings. On the map,
          these scattered fragments look like debris falls from
          meteorite strikes. Some are already partially buffered by
          surrounding protected areas such as national forests. But all
          need interconnecting linkages across public and private lands
          --- farms, ranches, suburbia --- to facilitate the travels of
          big carnivores and the net of biodiversity that they tow
          behind them. </p>
        <p>The Wildlands Project has also identified the five most
          critically endangered wildlife linkages along the spine, each
          associated with a keystone species. Grizzlies already pinched
          at Crowsnest Pass on Highway Three, between Alberta and
          British Columbia, will be entirely cut off from the bigger
          gene pool to the north if a larger road is built. Greater sage
          grouse, Canada lynx, black bears and jaguars face their own
          lethal obstacles further south. </p>
        <p>But by far the most endangered wildlife-linkage is the
          borderland between the US and Mexico. The Sky Islands straddle
          this boundary, and some of North America's most threatened
          wildlife --- jaguars, bison, Sonoran pronghorn, Mexican wolves
          --- cross, or need to cross, here in the course of their
          life's travels. Unfortunately for wildlife, Mexican workers
          cross here too. Men, women, and children, running at night,
          one-gallon water jugs in hand. </p>
        <p>The problem for wildlife is not so much the intrusions of
          illegal Mexican workers but the 700-mile border fence proposed
          to keep them out. From an ecological perspective, it will
          sever the spine at the lumbar, paralysing the lower continent.
        </p>
        <p>Here, in a nutshell, is all that's wrong with our treatment
          of nature. Amid all the moral, practical, and legal issues
          with the border fence, the biological catastrophe has barely
          been noted. It's as if extinction is not contagious and we
          won't catch it. </p>
        <p>If, as some indigenous people believe, the jaguar was sent to
          the world to test the will and integrity of human beings, then
          surely we need to reassess. Border fences have terrible
          consequences. One between India and Pakistan forces starving
          bears and leopards, which can no longer traverse their feeding
          territories, to attack villagers. </p>
        <p>The truth is that wilderness is more dangerous to us caged
          than free --- and has far more value to us wild than consumed.
          Wilson suggests the time has come to rename the
          "environmentalist view" the "real-world view", and to replace
          the gross national product with the more comprehensive
          "genuine progress indicator", which estimates the true
          environmental costs of farming, fishing, grazing, mining,
          smelting, driving, flying, building, paving, computing,
          medicating and so on. Until then, it's like keeping a ledger
          recording income but not expenses. Like us, the Earth has a
          finite budget. </p>

          <p>The practice of slacking off when the 'end is in sight' is
            so common that HR managers call it short-timers disease.
            Almost everyone has either experienced or seen the results
            of Short Timers' Disease. It's the 'why should I give a
            rat's ass' approach to work those last few days/weeks on the
            job. Note that academia is at least smart enough to get
            things wrapped up rapidly after finals are complete. Short
            timers' disease is so frequently seen in business that whole
            courses in 'counseling' for it are provided to the HR
            industry. Odd that industries by and large foster the whole
            syndrome by demanding a 2 week or more notice period. One
            would think that if short timers disease was as destructive
            to the bottom line and larger morale as the HR training
            industry believes then the thing to do would be to get the
            departing employee gone as quick as is feasible. </p>
          <p>But no, industry/corporations decide that notice is the way
            to 'manage' the separation phase of the business
            relationship. </p>
          <p>Universe has given humans their notice. No, not a firing,
            but rather a notice to quit the premises. It might not be
            two weeks notice, and might be several years notice, but it
            is unlikely that given recent solar system events, it is
            decades notice or even 'many years' notice. </p>
          <p>A great many articles in mainstream science publications,
            and even popular culture publications are referencing this
            notice, but always with the qualifiers somewhere with the
            content, that the notice is decades long. This is probably
            done as an unconscious response to short timers disease.
            After all, we wouldn't want humans to really grasp the
            probabilities for struggle, or the whole planet might start
            not giving a rat's ass. </p>
          <p>Take for instance the article citing the rise in carbon
            dioxide to levels not seen in 55 million years, and the
            expected result of global glacial meltdown and a rise in sea
            level of 120+ METERS (393.6 feet). Now we must note that
            such a sea level rise takes away approximately 8% of all
            usable land in North America alone. The NOAA graphic below
            shows the impact of an 8 meter (26feet) rise in sea level on
            the east coast of N. America. </p>
          <center>
            <p><img src="8meters.gif" height="215" width="281"></p>
          </center>
          <p>And note that this is 8 meters or less than one 15th the
            expected level of rise of sea level. Now the two maps below
            show (crudely) the expected level of 393 feet in higher sea
            level and its impact on Puget Sound, WA State, USofA. </p>
          <center>
            <p><img src="mapwapu2.jpe" height="495" width="329"></p>
          </center>
          <p>Puget Sound, as it is today, with 3790 kilometers of
            shoreline and almost all of the major population centers
            occupying some portion of that shoreline.. Average depth of
            the water is 140 meters with the average dry land height ten
            miles in from the edge of the sound being 345.9 feet. Now if
            we add another 120+ meters we get a wholly new configuration
            of the sound. </p>
          <center>
            <p><img src="mapwapu2too.jpe" height="495" width="329"></p>
          </center>
          <p>Although crude, the 120 meter increase line on the graphic
            above represents the new coast line of Puget Sound and was
            calculated by consultation with recent topological maps from
            DNR (Dept. Of Natural Resources, WA State). The point of
            course, is that this 8 per cent land loss, at least as
            illustrated by Puget Sound, includes MOST of the populated
            land within Puget Sound. Further, this sea level rise will
            impact over 65% of the population of the state. </p>
          <p>So, when the 120 meter increase in sea level is applied to
            the North American continent, we will see an amazing change
            relative to human habitation where something over 40% of the
            population of the whole continent will be forced to
            relocate. The picture is even more staggering though when
            examined on a population center basis as such a sea level
            rise will inundate 90% of the population centers of the
            country (city by population count analysis). </p>
          <p>Of course, sea level rise is but one impact of our current
            climatic period. As we note from the Guardian article: </p>
          <p>Dr King described how the ice caps like those on Mount
            Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, had been continuous for hundreds of
            thousands of years and survived through successive warm
            periods but were now expected to disappear in 30 to 40
            years. </p>
          <p>He said that the realisation of the scale of the crisis was
            what prompted him to say in January that climate change was
            a bigger threat than global terrorism. "We are moving from a
            warm period into the first hot period that man has ever
            experienced since he walked on the planet." </p>
          <p>But even this article, which, for a mainstream publication,
            is pretty 'doomish', still references a multi-decade time
            period for the planet's notice to humans. And of course,
            there is the obligatory 'hope-full' language at the end of
            the article, but still, as these go, the hope element is
            small, and evidently forlorn. This is pretty much an
            in-your-face statement that humans are going to face
            extinction threats, without using those words. Nonetheless,
            the threat level has been tone down by the author through
            the multi-decade timeline. So humans are short-timers, just
            that the time frame is beyond what most humans will use for
            decision making, i.e. greater than 14 years. </p>
          <p>It is necessary for the observant reader to note that this
            article and underlying studies do *NOT* take into account
            that the process affecting earth is also affecting all the
            other planets and planetary bodies within the solar system.
            Nor does this article (as with all that will show up in
            mainstream publications) take into account the probability
            that the process itself is accelerating. Nor does the
            article take into account events which are logically likely
            to occur which would also dramatically speed up the process
            under discussion. </p>
          <p>With now several references and studies showing carbon
            dioxide at multi million year highs, one must note several
            points. First, we don't have a clue as to how high carbon
            dioxide levels can go as our sampling tool is ice, which was
            not to be found in anywhere on the planet the last time that
            carbon dioxide levels were this elevated. So there are no
            methods available to guide us in how the rise of carbon
            dioxide affects the planet after all the ice is gone.
            Second, we find that the current expectations for carbon
            dioxide rise are considering humans to be the prime source
            for the gas, and do not recognize the impact that
            sudden-release events within either the frozen methane
            fields within the oceans, nor the permafrost will have on
            CO2 levels. In point of fact, there are already measurements
            of methane levels increasing over all the areas of formerly
            permafrost now that both Alaska, and the Siberian north are
            melting. </p>
          <p>What is conceived of as a multi-decade process has every
            potential and probable likelihood of 'tipping' over into a
            sub-decade process with any number of events. Evidence of
            sub-sea quakes 'stirring' the release of methane already
            exists. And as noted within the daily pages here at HPH, the
            instances of earth cracking are increasing. As are points of
            evidence for the shutting down of the Gulf Stream (a
            catastrophic climate event), and the alteration of other
            ocean currents. </p>
          <p>We even find that the projections of increase in global
            warming which is expected to 'set off' a trigger event such
            as the collapse of the supporting structure of the North
            Pacific Deep Methane Field (which would nearly double CO2 in
            the atmosphere) are likely predictable based on trends
            already observed. </p>
          <center>
            <p><img src="fig1.gif" height="791" width="1024"></p>
          </center>
          <p>As we can see from the graph, actual/observed CO2 levels
            are both ahead of, and at higher levels than those predicted
            by the computer models. </p>
          <p>When overlayed with the range of temperatures at which many
            of the geo-scientists expect/predict a trigger event such as
            the release of methane (or glacial collapse), we arrive at
            the following graph. </p>
          <center>
            <p><img src="fig2.gif" height="791" width="1024"><br>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">As we can see from the chart
              above, reaching the 'trigger point' will not be a
              multi-decade process. Further, this chart and the computer
              model from which it is derived do *not* take into account
              pan-solar system effects, nor even the observable increase
              in radiation from the sun (nor the increase in the rate of
              increase). Nor of course is any computer model reacting to
              increased meteor impacts (which transfer energy to the
              atmosphere/planet), nor the rise in acidity of the oceans,
              which itself may help break down benthic methane
              structures. Or precipitate the shift of the Antarctic
              glacier (a new article coming on how that will occur). </p>
          </center>
          <p>Boiled down to a thick and syrupy mass, the evidence points
            to humans having received their short term notice to quit
            the premises....or? Perhaps the current period is best
            thought of as the short term notice to humans to change. NOT
            that change by humans will in any way divert, ameliorate,
            nor postpone, nor cancel the rapid approach of extinction of
            the species (amongst many many many other species also
            doomed), but rather a courtesy note from Universe to start
            fighting like hell, the survival of the species is at stake.
            Change by some humans may assist in their individual
            survival. And if enough smart humans survive (this time) the
            manifesting planetary change, then perhaps, the species will
            have enough remnants to reach the carry point and humans
            will survive into the second, and even third decade of the
            21st century. </p>
          <p>Funny, but somehow, didn't humans used to believe it would
            be their own arrogance and abuse of power (like nuclear war)
            that would take them out? Now the consensus emerging is that
            weather/climate, of all things, will be the species undoing.
            Of course, weather/climate is but a symptom of energy
            transfers, and as we observe now (since 1975), energy just
            keeps pouring into the solar system as it marches ever
            closer to the alignment with the galactic arm on December 23
            of 2012. At some time between now and then, and likely to be
            found when the blue line trend (in the graph above) reaches
            a convergence with the left most third of the red box, all
            hell will break loose as all of humans, more or less all at
            once, learn they have Short Timer's Disease. </p>
          <p>At that point, the species will exhibit two broad forms of
            behavior: there will those who get serious about species
            level survival (and all that implies), and those who just
            won't give a rat's ass. </p>
          <p>Which will you be? </p>

                in the Galaxy Center is Predicted to Affect Conditions
                Here on Earth</font></b></center>
          <p>The Galaxy Center, which had been relatively stable for at
            least the past 30,000 years or so, had apparently undergone
            a drastic change on about December 5, 1986, according to
            information obtained from a gravity signal detection system
            invented by Gregory Hodowanec of Newark, NJ, a retired
            research physicist. The system is based on a new cosmology
            developed by the inventor and depends upon electrogravitic
            effects for its operation. The units, according to the
            inventor, detect variations in the Earth’s gravity field due
            to perturbations of this field by various gravitational
            effects in the universe such as the dynamic mass movements
            caused by novae, oscillating, rotating, or otherwise moving
            large masses, as well as the dense static masses, such as
            apparent ‘black hole’ structures which can cause
            gravitational ‘shadows’ to appear in the system’s response.
            According to the inventor’s theories, these gravitational
            signals are of longitudinal type and ‘propagate’ essentially
            instantaneously and not at the speed of light as is
            predicted for the Einstein quadrature-type signals. </p>
          <p>The inventor had been ‘observing’ the Galaxy Center
            recently in order to obtain some recorded strip chart scans
            of the structure there which could be helpful to some
            amateur radio astronomers who were interested in these
            techniques. On December 1 and 2, 1986, the inventor noted
            what appeared to be a movement of a mass in that structure
            towards the central mass in the structure. This may have
            been initiated by what appeared to be a close-by supernova
            event also noted on December 1 and 2, 1986. Unfortunately,
            the Center was not scanned again until December 6, 1986, at
            which time it was noted that the original Galaxy Center
            structure (which was relatively unchanged during the past
            5-6 years of observation) had disappeared and a new very
            deep ‘black hole and accretion ring’ type of structure now
            appeared here! Operation of the detection system in its
            gravity ‘noise’ mode at this time indicated a sharp and very
            turbulent increase in noise response, probably due to the
            outward-moving shock wave induced ‘debris ring’ proceeding
            from this supernova-type event that occurred at the Galaxy
            Center. Because of the violence and rapid velocity of these
            gravitational ‘winds’, the scientific community was alerted
            on December 8, 1986 (through the National Science
            Foundation) to look for possible reactions here on Earth,
            mainly changes in the atmosphere in the northern hemisphere
            around the 60 N Latitude which could affect the weather
            patterns in those latitudes. A request was also made to look
            for possible effects in the atmospheres of the sun and
            pertinent planets. While further observations and the
            development of the new Center were noted and reported to
            NSF, it is not known if those inputs were heeded by that
            agency. However, as is well known now, the weather patterns
            in the northern hemisphere have been highly unusual since
            about the middle of December 1986, and that could well be
            attributable to the very strong ‘gravity winds’ which
            introduced a new horizontal component of gravity in those
            latitudes. The winds which are proceeding from the direction
            of the Galaxy Center are probably affecting the normal jet
            stream patterns. </p>
          <p>In addition to the prediction that weather conditions
            around the 60 N Latitude regions (much land mass there)
            could be affected by this event at the Galaxy Center, it was
            also predicted that any unstable Earth structures in the
            region of 30 S Latitude could also be affected as possible
            increases in earthquake activity. Since the vertical
            component of the gravity ‘winds’ would apparently increase
            the normal gravity force there. Another prediction was that
            starlight traveling through ‘disturbed’ gas clouds could
            result in an increased ‘twinkling’ effect. Such effects
            would be initially noted by the effects of ‘nearby’ clouds,
            but should become more pronounced in time as the more
            distant clouds become effective (due to the finite time for
            propagaton of light signals). At the present time, the
            inventor has noted a possible increase for the ‘twinkling’
            of the star Sirius. </p>
          <p>The observational techniques of the inventor are very
            simple and are very low in cost and have been released to
            some experimenter and amateur radio astronomer publications,
            as well as directly to some interested private researchers.
            The conventional (orthodox) scientific community has, thus
            far, chosen largely to ignore these techniques. The inventor
            will leave it to independent observations of the predicted
            ‘observable’ results of the event in the Galaxy Center to
            confirm the reality and validity of his gravity detection
            methods, and thus the possible long-range effects of the
            event on conditions here on our Earth as well as other
            planets (as well as the Galaxy itself). </p>
          <p><b>Note added (August 15, 1987):</b> </p>
          <p>It is believed tat the Galaxy Center event of about Dec. 5,
            1986, also triggered at the same time a supernova much
            closer-by which lay on the same meridian as the Galaxy
            Center. These events were observed on Dec. 6, 1986 and the
            resulting ‘black holes and accretion rings’ have been
            present since that time. The two events can be separated
            when observing the Galaxy Center through the Earth. The
            other event, which appears to be in-line with the star
            Betelgeuse in Orion, might have been the demise of
            Betelgeuse. The strong ‘gravity winds’ which have caused so
            much abnormal weather changes since about Dec. 5, 1986, may
            have come from the Betelgeuse event, rather than from the
            Galaxy Center event. More important, if Betelgeuse did go
            supernova, the Earth can expect a ‘firestorm’ of EM
            radiations in about 300 years time! </p>
          <p><b>Note added (October 8, 1987):</b> </p>
          <p>A supernova event from the general direction of Betelgeuse
            in the constellation of Orion could also result in an
            increase in gravity in the general region of 30 N Latitude.
            Perhaps, a slight increase in gravity levels was responsible
            for the recent series of California earthquakes? While the
            event at the Galaxy Center would have the effect of reducing
            gravity, the closeness of the Betelgeuse event would
            prevail, resulting in a net increase of gravity levels
            there. </p>
          <p><b>Note added (April 30, 1988):</b> </p>
          <p>A new supernova-type event was noted on the same meridian
            as the Galaxy Center on March 31, 1988. This new event
            ‘swamped’ the scan of the Center and did not move off for
            many days. After about two weeks time, the ‘interloper’ was
            not longer ‘seen’. However, very strong gravity ‘winds’ from
            this event are still present at this date. GW detectors,
            weight scales, and l/f noise detectors, including the gas
            tube device are much noisier than they have ever been!
            Perhaps, this may have been a more ‘local’ event than at the
            Galaxy Center region. </p>

            additional carbon dioxide locks up two oxygen atoms, the
            free oxygen decline is greater than the carbon dioxide
            lock-up. The greater than expected overall free oxygen
            decline is proof that the Earth's photosynthetic capacity
            has declined. And since there has been no measurable decline
            in plankton, and consequently, in marine photo synthesis, as
            long expected and measured due to the increase of hard UV-B
            radiation at surface level, the decline points straight at

            continuing to decline and many large cities now have oxygen
            levels as low as 12%. Medical researchers say that if falls

            estimated to have been at 30%. In the 1940's the oxygen in

          <p>Current PlanetoPhysical alterations of the Earth are
            becoming irreversible. Strong evidence exists that these
            transformations are being caused by highly charged material
            and energetic non-uniformity's in anisotropic interstellar
            space which have broken into the interplanetary area of our
            Solar System. This "donation" of energy is producing hybrid
            processes and excited energy states in all planets, as well
            as the Sun. Effects here on Earth are to be found in the
            acceleration of the magnetic pole shift, in the vertical and
            horizontal ozone content distribution, and in the increased
            frequency and magnitude of significant catastrophic climatic
            events. There is growing probability that we are moving into
            a rapid temperature instability period similar to the one
            that took place 10,000 years ago. The adaptive responses of
            the biosphere, and humanity, to these new conditions may
            lead to a total global revision of the range of species and
            life on Earth. It is only through a deep understanding of
            the fundamental changes taking place in the natural
            environment surrounding us that politicians, and citizens a
            like, will be able to achieve balance with the renewing flow
            of PlanetoPhysical states and processes. </p>
          <p><b><font size="+1">INTRODUCTION</font></b> </p>
          <p>Current, in process, geological, geophysical, and
            climatical alterations of the Earth are becoming more, and
            more, irreversible. At the present time researchers are
            revealing some of the causes which are leading to a general
            reorganization of the electro-magnetosphere (the
            electromagnetic skeleton) of our planet, and of its climatic
            machinery. A greater number of specialists in climatology,
            geophysics, planetophysics, and heliophysics are tending
            towards a cosmic causative sequence version for what is
            happening. Indeed, events of the last decade give strong
            evidence of unusually significant heliospheric and
            planetophysic transformations [1,2]. Given the quality,
            quantity, and scale of these transformations we may say
            that: </p>
          <p><i>The climatic and biosphere processes here on Earth
              (through a tightly connected feedback system) are directly
              impacted by, and linked back to, the general overall
              transformational processes taking place in our Solar
              System. We must begin to organize our attention and
              thinking to understand that climatic changes on Earth are
              only one part, or link, in a whole chain of events taking
              place in our Heliosphere.</i> </p>
          <p>These deep physical processes, these new qualities of our
            physical and geological environment, will impose special
            adaptive challenges and requirements for all life forms on
            Earth. Considering the problems of adaptation our biosphere
            will have with these new physical conditions on Earth, we
            need to distinguish the general tendency and nature of the
            changes. As we will show below,<i>these tendencies may be
              traced in the direction of planet energy capacity growth
              (capacitance), which is leading to a highly excited or
              charged state of some of Earth's systems.</i>The most
            intense transformations are taking place in the planetary
            gas-plasma envelopes to which the productive possibilities
            of our biosphere are timed. Currently this new scenario of
            excess energy run-off is being formed, and observed: </p>
          <p>In the ionosphere by plasma generation. </p>
          <p>In the magnetosphere by magnetic storms. </p>
          <p>In the atmosphere by cyclones. </p>
          <p>This high-energy atmospheric phenomena, which was rare in
            the past, is now becoming more frequent, intense, and
            changed in its nature. The material composition of the
            gas-plasma envelope is also being transformed. </p>
          <p>It is quite natural for the whole biota of the Earth to be
            subjected to these changing conditions of the
            electromagnetic field, and to the significant deep
            alterations of Earth's climatic machinery. These fundamental
            processes of change create a demand within all of Earth's
            life organisms for new forms of adaptation. <i>The natural
              development of these new forms may lead to a total global
              revision of the range of species, and life, on Earth .</i>
            New deeper qualities of life itself may come forth, bringing
            the new physical state of the Earth to an equilibrium with
            the new organismic possibilities of development,
            reproduction, and perfection. In this sense <i>it is
              evident that we are faced with a problem of the adaptation
              of humanity to this new state of the Earth;</i> new
            conditions on Earth whose biospheric qualities are varying,
            and non-uniformly distributed. Therefore the current period
            of transformation is transient, and the transition of life's
            representatives to the future may take place only after a
            deep evaluation of what it will take to comply with these
            new Earthly biospheric conditions. Each living
            representative on Earth will be getting a thorough
            "examination," or "quality control inspection," to determine
            it's ability to comply with these new conditions.<i>These
              evolutionary challenges always require effort, or
              endurance, be it individual organisms, species, or
              communities.</i> Therefore, it is not only the climate
            that is becoming new, but we as human beings are
            experiencing a global change in the vital processes of
            living organisms, or life itself; which is yet another link
            in the total process. We cannot treat such things
            separately, or individually. </p>

          <p>We will list the recent large-scale events in the Solar
            System in order to fully understand, and comprehend, the
            PlanetoPhysical transformations taking place. This
            development of events, as it has become clear in the last
            few years, <i>is being caused by material and energetic
              non-uniformity's in anisotropic interstellar space</i>[2,3,4].
            In its travel through interstellar space, the Heliosphere
            travels in the direction of the Solar Apex in the Hercules
            Constellation. On its way it has met (1960's)
            non-homogeneities of matter and energy containing ions of
            Hydrogen, Helium, and Hydroxyl in addition to other elements
            and combinations. This kind of interstellar space dispersed
            plasma is presented by magnetized strip structures and
            striations. The Heliosphere [solar system] transition
            through this structure has led to an increase of the shock
            wave in front of the Solar System from 3 to 4 AU, to 40 AU,
            or more. This shock wave thickening has caused the formation
            of a collusive plasma in a parietal layer, which has led to
            a plasma overdraft around the Solar System, and then to its
            breakthrough into interplanetary domains [5,6]. <i>This

          <p>In response to this <i>"donation of energy/matter,"</i> we

            which excited the Jovian magnetosphere, thus inducing
            excessive plasma generation [12] and it's release in the
            same manner as Solar coronal holes [15] inducing an
            appearance of radiation belt brightening in decimeter band
            (13.2 and 36 cm), and the appearance of large auroral
            anomalies and a change of the Jupiter - Io system of

                Towards an Increase in Its Interplanetary and
                Solar-Planetary Transmitting Properties.</u></b> </p>
          <p>When speaking of new energetic and material qualities of
            interplanetary space, we must first point out the increase
            of the interplanetary domains energetic charge, and level of
            material saturation. This change of the typical mean state
            of interplanetary space has two main causes: </p>
          <p>1.2.1 The supply/inflow of matter from interstellar space.
            (Radiation material, ionized elements, and combinations.)
            [19,20,21]. </p>
          <p>1.2.2 The after effects of Solar Cycle 22 activity,
            especially as a result of fast coronal mass ejection's
            [CME's] of magnetized solar plasmas. [22]. </p>
          <p>It is natural for both interstellar matter and
            intra-heliospheric mass redistribution's to create new
            structural units and processes in the interplanetary
            domains. They are mostly observed in the structured
            formation of extended systems of magnetic plasma clouds
            [23], and an increased frequency of the generation of shock
            waves; and their resulting effects [24]. </p>
          <p>A report already exists of two new populations of cosmic
            particles that were not expected to be found in the Van
            Allen radiation belts [25]; particularly an injection of a
            greater than 50 MeV dense electron sheaf into the inner
            magnetosphere during times of abrupt magnetic storms
            [CME's], and the emergence of a new belt consisting of ionic
            elements traditionally found in the composition of stars.
            This newly changed quality of interplanetary space not only
            performs the function of a planetary interaction
            transmission mechanism, but it (this is most important) <i>exerts
              stimulating and programming action upon the Solar activity
              both in it's maximal and minimal phases.</i>The seismic
            effectiveness of the solar wind is also being observed
            [26,27]. </p>
          <p><b><u>1.3 The Appearance of New States and Activity Regimes
                of the Sun.</u></b> </p>
          <p>As far as the stellarphysical state of the Sun is
            concerned, we must first note the fact that significant
            modifications have occurred in the existing behavioral model
            of the central object of our solar system. This conclusion
            comes from observations and reportings of unusual forms,
            energetic powers, and activities in the Sun's functions
            [20,21], as well as modifications in it's basic fundamental
            properties [28]. Since the end of the Maunder minimum, a
            progressive growth of the Sun's general activity has been
            observed. This growth first revealed itself most definitely
            in the 22nd cycle; which posed a real problem for
            heliophysicists who were attempting to revise their main
            explanatory scenarios: </p>
          <p>1.3.1 Concerning the velocity of reaching super-flash
            maximums. </p>
          <p>1.3.2 Concerning the emissive power of separate flashes. </p>
          <p>1.3.3 Concerning the energy of solar cosmic rays, etc. </p>
          <p>Moreover, the Ulysses spacecraft, traversing high
            heliospheric latitudes, recorded the absence of the magnetic
            dipole, which drastically changed the general model of
            heliomagnetism, and further complicated the magnetologist's
            analytic presentations. The most important heliospheric role
            of coronal holes has now become clear; to regulate the
            magnetic saturation of interplanetary space. [28,30].
            Additionally, they generate all large geomagnetic storms,
            and ejection's with a southerly directed magnetic field are
            geo-effective [22]. There is also existing substantiation
            favoring the solar winds effects upon Earth's atmospheric
            zone circulation, and lithospheric dynamics [31]. </p>
          <p>The 23rd cycle was initiated by a short series of sunspots
            in August 1995 [32], which allows us to predict the solar
            activity maximum in 1999. What is also remarkable, is that a
            series of class C flares has already happened in July 1996 .
            The specificity and energy of this cycle was discussed at
            the end of the 1980's. [23]. The increased frequency of
            X-Ray flux flares which occurred in the very beginning of
            this cycle provided evidence of the large-scale events to
            come; especially in relation to an increase in the frequency
            of super-flashes. The situation has become extremely serious
            due to the growth in the transmitting qualities of the
            interplanetary environment [2 3, 24] and the growth of
            Jupiter's systems heliospheric function; with Jupiter having
            the possibility of being shrouded by a plasmosphere
            extending over Io's orbit [13]. </p>
          <p><i>As a whole, all of the reporting and observation
              facilities give evidence to a growth in the velocity,
              quality, quantity, and energetic power of our Solar
              System's Heliospheric processes.</i> </p>
          <p><b>Update Note 1/8/98:</b> The unexpected high level of Sun
            activity in the later half of 1997, that is continuing into
            present time, provides strong substantiation of the above
            statement. There were three "X" level Goes 9 X-Ray Flux
            events in 1997 where one was forecasted; a 300% increase.
            The most dramatic of these, a X-9.1 coronal mass ejection on
            November 6, 1997, produced a proton event here on Earth of
            approximately 72 hours in duration. The character, scale,
            and magnitude of current Sun activity has increased to the
            point that one official government Sun satellite reporting
            station recently began their daily report by saying,
            "Everything pretty much blew apart on the Sun today, Jan.
            3,1998." </p>

          <p><b><u>2.1 The Geomagnetic Field Inversion.</u></b> </p>
          <p>Keeping clearly in mind the known significant role of the
            magnetic field on human life, and all biological processes,
            we will outline the general features of this changing state
            of the Earth's geomagnetic field. We have to remind
            ourselves of the many spacecraft and satellites that have
            registered the growth of heliospheric magnetic saturation in
            recent years [11,18,35]. The natural response of the Earth
            to this increased saturation level reveals itself in its
            dipole intensity, its magnet "c" poles localization, and in
            its electromagnetic field resonance processes[36]. Earth is
            number one among all of the planets in the Solar System with
            respect to its specific ability regarding the magnetization
            of matter [6]. </p>
          <p>In recent years we have seen a growth of interest by
            geophysicists and magnetologists, in general, to geomagnetic
            processes [37-40], and specifically, to the travel of
            Earth's magnetic poles [41,42]. They are particularly
            interested in observing the facts surrounding the directed,
            or vectored, travel of the Antarctic magnetic pole. In the
            last 100 years this magnetic pole has traveled almost 900 km
            towards, and into, the Indian ocean. This significant shift
            by the magnetic poles began in 1885. The most recent data
            about the state of the Arctic magnetic pole (which is moving
            towards the Eastern Siberian world magnetic anomaly by way
            of the Arctic Ocean) reveals that this pole "traveled" more
            than 120 km during the ten year period 1973 through 1984,
            and 150 km during the same interval, 1984 through 1994. This
            estimated data has been confirmed by direct measurement ( L.
            Newwitt. The Arctic pole coordinates are now 78.3 deg. North
            and 104.0 deg. West) [42]. </p>
          <p>We must emphasize that this documented polar shift
            acceleration (3 km per year average over 10 years), and its
            travel along the geo-historic magnetic poles inversion
            corridor (the corridor having been established by the
            analysis of more than 400 paleoinversion sites) necessarily
            <i>leads us to the conclusion that the currently observed
              polar travel acceleration is not just a shift or
              digression from the norm, but is in fact an inversion of
              the magnetic poles; in full process.</i>It is now seen
            that the acceleration of polar travel may grow to a rate of
            up to 200 km per year. This means that a polar inversion may
            happen far more rapidly than is currently supposed by those
            investigators without a familiarity with the overall polar
            shift problem. </p>
          <p>We must also emphasize the significant growth of the
            recognized world magnetic anomalies (Canadian,
            East-Siberian, Brazilian, and Antarctic) in the Earth's
            magnetic reorganization. Their significance is due to the
            fact that these world anomalies constitute a magnetic source
            that is almost independent from Earth's main magnetic field.
            Most of the time, the intensity of these world magnetic
            anomalies substantially exceeds all of the residual
            non-dipole component; which is obtained by the subtraction
            of the dipole component from the total magnetic field of the
            Earth.[48]. It is the inversion of the magnetic fields
            process which is causing the various transformations of
            Earth's geophysical processes and the present state of the
            polar magnetosphere. </p>
          <p>We also have to take into account the factual growth of the
            polar cusp's angle (i.e. The polar slots in the
            magnetosphere; North and South), which in the middle 1990's
            reached 45 degrees (by IZMIRAN data). [Note: The cusp angle
            was about 6 degrees most of the time. It fluctuates
            depending upon the situation. During the last five years,
            however, it has varied between 25 and 46 degrees.] The
            increasing and immense amounts of matter and energy
            radiating from the Sun's Solar Wind, and Interplanetary
            Space, by means previously discussed, has began to rush into
            these widened slots in the polar regions <i>causing the
              Earth's crust, the oceans, and the polar ice caps to warm</i>[27].
          </p>
          <p><i>Our study of geomagnetic field paleoinversions, and
              their after effects, has lead us to the unambiguous, and
              straight forth, conclusion that these present processes
              being observed are following precisely the same scenarios
              as those of their distant ancestors. </i>And additional
            signs of the inversion of the magnetic field are becoming
            more intense in frequency and scale. For example: During the
            previous 25 million years, the frequency of magnetic
            inversions was twice in half a million years while the
            frequency of inversions for the last 1 million years is 8 to
            14 inversions [43], or one inversion each 71 to 125 thousand
            years. What is essential here is that during prior periods
            of maximum frequency of inversions there has also been a
            corresponding decrease in the level of oceans world-wide (10
            to 150 meters) from contraction caused by the wide
            development of crustal folding processes. Periods of lessor
            frequency of geomagnetic field inversions reveals sharp
            increases of the world ocean level due to the priority of
            expansion and stretching processes in the crust. [43-44].
            Therefore, the level of World's oceans depends on the global
            characteristic of the contraction and expansion processes in
            force at the time. </p>
          <p>The current geomagnetic inversion frequency growth phase
            may not lead to an increase in oceanic volume from polar
            warming, but rather to a decrease in ocean levels. Frequent
            inversions mean stretching and expansion, rare inversions
            mean contraction. Planetary processes, as a rule, occur in
            complex and dynamic ways which require the combining and
            joining of all forces and fields in order to adequately
            understand the entire system. In addition to the
            consideration of hydrospheric redistribution, <i>there are
              developing events which also indicate a sudden and sharp
              breaking of the Earth's meteorological machinery.</i> </p>
          <p><b><u>2.2 Climate Transformations.</u></b> </p>
          <p>Since public attention is so closely focused on the
            symptoms of major alterations, or breakdowns, in the
            climatic machinery, and the resulting and sometimes severe
            biospheric effects, we shall consider these climatic
            transformations in detail. Thus, while not claiming to
            characterize the climatic and biospheric transition period
            completely, we will provide a recent series of brief
            communications regarding the temperature, hydrological
            cycle, and the material composition of the Earth's
            atmosphere. </p>
          <p>The temperature regime of any given phase of climatic
            reorganization is characterized by contrasts, and
            instabilities. <i>The widely quoted, and believed,
              "Greenhouse Effect" scenario for total climatic changes is
              by far the weakest explanation, or link, in accounting for
              this reorganization.</i>It has already been observed that
            the growth in the concentration of CO2 has stopped, and that
            the methane content in the atmosphere has began to decrease
            [45] while the temperature imbalance, and the common global
            pressure field dissolution has proceeded to grow. </p>
          <p>There were reports of a global temperature maximum in 1994,
            and the almost uninterrupted existence of an "El-Nino" like
            hydrological effect. Satellite air surface layer temperature
            tracking [49,50] allowed the detection of a 0.22 degrees C
            global temperature variation (within a typical specific time
            period of about 30 days) that correlated with recorded
            middle frequency magnetic oscillations. <i>The Earth's
              temperature regime is becoming more, and more, dependent
              on external influences.</i> The representative regulating
            processes, or basis, of these general climatic
            rearrangements are: </p>
          <p>2.2.1. A new ozone layer distribution. </p>
          <p>2.2.2. Radiation material (plasma) inflows and discharges
            through the polar regions, and through the world's magnetic
            anomaly locations. </p>

            relationship between the Earth's meteorological (weather),
            magnetic, and temperature fields. </p>
          <p><i>There is a growing probability that we are moving into a
              rapid temperature instability period similar to the one
              that took place 10,000 years ago.</i> This not so ancient
            major instability was revealed by the analysis of ice
            drilling core samples in Greenland [51]. The analysis of
            these core samples established: </p>
          <p>2.2.4.<i>That annual temperatures increased by 7 degrees
              centigrade.</i> </p>
          <p>2.2.5.<i>That precipitation grew in the range of 3 to 4
              times.</i> </p>
          <p>2.2.6.<i>That the mass of dust material increased by a
              factor of 100.</i> </p>
          <p>Such high-speed transformations of the global climatic
            mechanism parameters, and its effects on Earth's physical
            and biospheric qualities has not yet been rigorously studied
            by the reigning scientific community. <i>But, researchers
              are now insisting more, and more, that the Earth's
              temperature increases are dependent upon, and directly
              linked to, space-terrestrial interactions [</i>52,53]; be
            it Earth-Sun, Earth-Solar System, and/or Earth-Interstellar.
          </p>
          <p>At the present time there is no lack of new evidence
            regarding temperature inversion variations in the
            hydrosphere [oceans]. In the Eastern Mediterranean there
            have been recordings of a temperature inversion in depths
            greater than two kilometers from a ratio of 13.3 to 13.5
            degrees centigrade to a new ratio of 13.8 to 13.5; along
            with a growth in salinity of 0.02% since 1987. The growth of
            salinity in the Aegean Sea has stopped, and the salt water
            outflow from the Mediterranean Basin to the Atlantic has
            diminished. Neither of these processes, or their causes, has
            been satisfactorily explained. It has already been
            established that evaporation increases in the equatorial
            regions causes a water density increase which results in an
            immediate sinking to a greater depth. Ultimately this would
            force the Gulfstream to reverse its flow. A probability of
            this event happening is confirmed by other signs as well as
            multiparameter numeric models [53]. Therefore the most
            highly probable scenario for the European Continent is a
            sharp and sudden cooling. Elsewhere, the Siberian region has
            been experiencing a stable temperature increase [58] along
            with reports from the Novosibirsk Klyuchi Observatory of a
            constant growth of up to 30 nanoteslas per year of the
            vertical component of the magnetic field. This growth rate
            increases significantly as the Eastern Siberian magnetic
            anomaly is approached. </p>
          <p><b>Update Note 1/8/98:</b> The National Oceanic and
            Atmospheric Administration reported today, 1/8/98, that 1997
            was the warmest year on record since records began in 1880,
            and that nine of the warmest years since that time have
            occured in the last eleven years. </p>
          <p><b><u>2.3 Vertical and Horizontal Ozone Content
                Redistribution.</u></b> </p>
          <p>Vertical and horizontal ozone content redistribution is the
            main indicator, and active agent, of general climatic
            transformations on Earth. And, evidence exists that ozone
            concentrations also have a strong influence upon Earth's
            biospheric processes. Widespread models for "ozone holes"
            being in the stratosphere [7 to 10 miles above Earth]
            (Antarctic and Siberian) are receiving serious corrective
            modifications from reports of vertical ozone redistribution,
            and its growth in the troposphere [below 7 miles]. It is now
            clear that the decrease in our atmosphere's total ozone
            content is caused by technogeneous [industrial, human
            designed, pollution], and that the total ozone content in
            general has serious effects upon the energy distribution
            processes within Earth's gas-plasma [atmospheric] envelopes
            [54]. </p>
          <p>Stratospheric, tropospheric, and surface layer ozone's are
            now being studied [55,56]. Photodissociation [the process by
            which a chemical combination breaks up into simpler
            constituents] of ozone, controls the oxidizing activities
            within the troposphere. This has created a special
            atmospheric, physio-chemical, circumstance by which the
            usual tropospheric concentrations, and lifetimes, of carbon
            monoxide, methane, and other hydrocarbon gases are modified
            and changed. So, with the established fact that a
            statistically significant rise in the ozone concentrations
            has taken place in the tropospheric layers between 5 and 7
            miles, and with the addition, and full knowledge, of ozone's
            oxidizing properties, <i>we must conclude that a basic and
              fundamental alteration of the gas composition and physical
              state of Earth's atmosphere has already begun.</i> </p>
          <p>There are continuing reports of diminishing regional
            stratosphere ozone concentrations [25 to 49% or more above
            Siberia (57)], and of global decreases of ozone content in
            altitudes of 20-26 miles; with the maximal decrease of 7%
            being at 24 miles [55]. At the same time, there is no direct
            evidence of a growth of UV radiation at the ground surface
            [58]. There are, however, a growing number of "ozone alerts"
            in large European cities. For example, in 1994 there were
            1800 "ozone alerts" in Paris. In addition, remarkably high
            concentrations of surface layer ozone were registered in the
            Siberian Region. There were ozone concentration splashes in
            Novosibirsk that exceeded 50 times the normal level. We must
            remember that ozone smell is noticeable in concentrations of
            100 mkg/m3; i.e. at 2 to 10 times the normal level. </p>
          <p>The most serious concern of aeronomists comes from the <u>detection
of

              H02 that is being produced at an altitude of 11 miles by a
              completely unknown source or mechanism</u>. This source of
            HO2 was discovered as a result of the investigation of
            OH/HO2 ratios in the interval between 4.35 and 21.70 miles
            in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. This significant
            growth of HO2, over the course of time, will create a
            dependence on this substance for the ozone transfer and
            redistribution process in the lower stratosphere[56]. </p>
          <p>The submission of the ozone's dynamic regime and space
            distribution to the above unknown source of HO2, signifies a
            transition of Earth's atmosphere to a new physico-chemical
            process. This is very important because non-uniformity's in
            the Earth's ozone concentrations can, and will, cause an
            abrupt growth in temperature gradients, which in turn do
            lead to the increase of air mass movement velocities, and to
            irregularities of moisture circulation patterns[46,59].
            Temperature gradient changes, and alterations, over the
            entire planet would create new thermodynamic conditions for
            entire regions; especially when the hydrospheres [oceans]
            begin to participate in the new thermal non-equilibrium. The
            study [53] supports this conclusion, <i>and the
              consideration of a highly possible abrupt cooling of the
              European and North American Continents.</i> The
            probability of such a scenario increases when you take into
            account the ten year idleness of the North Atlantic
            hydrothermal pump. <i>With this in mind, the creation of a
              global, ecology-oriented, climate map which might reveal
              these global catastrophes becomes critically important.</i>

            In addition, we must point out the abrupt growth of
            meteorological/weather catastrophes in recent years. In the
            Atlantic region alone there were 19 cyclones in 1994; 11 of
            which became hurricanes. This is a 100 year record [ 60].
            The current year, 1996, is especially laden with reports of
            flooding and other types of meteocatastrophes. The dynamic
            growth of significant catastrophes shows a major increase in
            the rate of production since 1973. And in general, the
            number of catastrophes has grown by 410% between 1963 and
            1993. Special attention must be focused on the growing
            number and variety of catastrophes, and to their
            consequences. <br>

          <p>One must keep in mind that the growing complexity of
            climatic and weather patterns signals a transformation
            tending towards a new state, or as Academician Kondratyev
            says, data indicates that we are moving in the direction of
            climatic chaos. In reality this transition state of our
            climatic machinery is placing new requirements upon Earth's
            entire biosphere; which does include the human species. In
            particular, there are reports from Antarctica that show a
            dramatic reaction by vegetation to the recent changes in
            climate; there were 700 species found growing in 1964 and
            17,500 in 1990 [61]. This increase in Earth's vegetative
            cover provides evidence of the biosphere's reaction to the
            ongoing process of climatic rearrangement. </p>
          <p>The overall pattern of the generation and movement of
            cyclones has also changed. For example, the number of
            cyclones moving to Russia from the West has grown 2.5 times
            during the last 10 years. Increased ocean levels caused by
            the shedding of ice from the polar regions will lead to
            sharp changes in coast lines, a redistribution of land and
            sea relationships, and to the activation of significant
            geodynamic processes. This is the main characteristic of
            those processes leading to a new climatic and biospheric
            order. </p>
          <p><b><u>3.2 The Non-Manifest or Implicit Consequences.</u></b>
          </p>
          <p>Implicit consequences are those processes which are below
            the threshold of usual human perception, and are therefore
            not brought to our common attention. Instrument recordings,
            and even direct observations, of these phenomena throughout
            Earth's electromagnetic field provides evidence that <i>an
              immense transformation of Earth's environment is taking
              place.</i> This situation is aggravated by the fact that
            in the 1990's anthropogeneous (human) power production/usage
            increased to (1-9)E+26 ergs/per year which means it reached
            the conservative energetic production/usage values of our
            planet. For example, Earth's annual energy consumption is
            comprised of (1-9)E+26 ergs for earthquakes, (1-9)E+24 for
            geomagnetic storms, and (1-9)E+28 for heat emission [54]. </p>
          <p>There already are technogeneous effects upon the functional
            state of Earth's electromagnetic skeleton being registered
            and recorded. A seven-day technogeneous cycle for
            geomagnetic field dynamic parameter variations was revealed
            in 1985 [62,63]. This cycle has affected many of the short
            cycles in Solar-terrestrial relationships. More than 30% of
            middle magnetosphere disturbances are caused by power
            production, transmission, and consumption. The Van Allen
            radiation belt has abruptly lowered above the East Coast of
            the US from 300 km to 10 km. This process is associated with
            electricity transmission from the Great Lakes to the South
            along a magnetic meridian, and usage of the
            ionosphere-resonance frequency (60Hz) of energy consumption
            [63]. There is also a registered coherence between the
            gutter qualities of the Brazilian magnetic anomaly, and the
            "Hydro-Quebec" power production system. Combined
            techno-natural electromagnetic processes in megalopolises
            are very complex and as yet unstudied. A 1996 study of
            mortality from cardiovascular diseases in St. Petersburg,
            Russia uncovered a direct connection between the city's
            power consumption and mortality. </p>
          <p>Moreover, the increase in the frequency, and scope, of <i>natural

              self-luminous formations</i> in the atmosphere and
            geospace forces us to wake up, and take notice [64,65,66].
            The processes of generation, and the existence of such
            formations, spreading all over the Earth, represents a
            remarkable physical phenomenon. What is most unusual about
            these natural self-luminous formations is that while they
            have distinct features of well-known physical processes,
            they are in entirely unusual combinations, <i>and are
              accompanied by process features which cannot be explained
              on the basis of existing physical knowledge.</i>Thus,
            features of intense electromagnetic processes are being
            found in the space inside and near these natural
            self-luminous objects. These features include: </p>
          <p>3.2.1. Intense electromagnetic emissions ranging from the
            micrometer wave band through the visible diapason, to
            television, and radio wavelengths. </p>
          <p>3.2.2. Electric and magnetic field changes such as electric
            breakdowns, and the magnetization of rocks and technical
            objects. </p>
          <p>3.2.3. Destructive electrical discharges. </p>
          <p>3.2.4. Gravitation effects such as levitation. </p>
          <p>3.2.5. Others. </p>
          <p><i>All of the qualities of this class of phenomena are
              requiring the development of new branches of modern
              physics; particularly the creation of a "non-homogeneous
              physical vacuum model".</i>[67]. An advancement of the
            sciences in this direction would allow us to reveal the true
            nature of these objects, which are acting apparently, and
            latently, upon our geological-geophysical and biospheric
            environment, and on human life [68]. </p>
          <p>Therefore, we must first take into account all of the newly
            developed processes and states of our geological-geophysical
            environment. These processes, for the most part, manifest
            themselves in the hard-to-register, and observe, qualities
            of the Earth's electromagnetic skeleton. This data also
            concerns the geophysical and climatic meanings of
            Solar-terrestrial and planetary-terrestrial interactions.
            This is especially true of Jupiter which is magnetically
            conjugate to our planet. The totality of these
            planet-transforming processes develops precipitately,
            ubiquitously, and diversely. It is critical that politicians
            be informed and trained to understand these global
            relationships between the totality of natural and
            anthropogeneous activities, and there fundamental causes and
            effects [69]. <i>A compelling need exists to commence a
              scientific study which would delineate the problems
              associated with Earth's current transformational
              processes, and the effects they will have on global
              demographic dynamics.</i>[70]. The sharp rise of our
            technogeneous system's destructive force on a planetary as
            well as a cosmic scale, <i>has now placed the future
              survival of our technocratic civilization in question</i>[33,7].

            Additionally, the principle of Natures supremacy [72] over
            that of humanities current integral technogeneous and
            psychogenic activities and results, becomes more, and more,
            apparent. </p>

          </center>
          <p>The situation that has been created here in our Heliosphere
            is of <i>external, Interstellar, cosmic space origin,</i>and
            is herein assumed to be caused by the underlying fundamental
            auto-oscillation, space-physical, processes of continuous
            creation that has shaped, and continues to evolve our
            Universe. The present excited state of our Heliosphere
            exists within the whole, or entire, organism that makes up
            the Solar System; the Sun, Planets, Moons, Comets, and
            Asteroids, as well as the plasmas, and/or electromagnetic
            mediums, and structures, of Interplanetary Space. The
            response to these Interstellar energy and matter injections
            into our Heliosphere has been, and continues to be, a series
            of newly observed energetic processes and formations on all
            of the Planets; between the Planets and their Moons, and the
            Planets and the Sun. </p>
          <p>Earth's ability to adapt to these external actions and
            transference's is aggravated, made more difficult, by the
            technogeneous alterations we have made to the natural
            quality, or state, of our geological-geophysical
            environment. <i>Our Planet Earth is now in the process of a
              dramatic transformation;</i>by altering the
            electromagnetic skeleton through a shift of the geomagnetic
            field poles, and through compositional changes in the ozone,
            and hydrogen, saturation levels of its gas-plasma envelopes.
            These changes in the Earth's physical state are being
            accompanied by resultant climatic/atmospheric, and
            biospheric, adaptation processes. These processes are
            becoming more and more intense, and frequent, as evidenced
            by the real time increase in "non-periodic transient
            events"; ie., catastrophes. There are reasons favoring, or
            pointing to, the fact that a growth in the ethical, or
            spiritual quality, of humanity would decrease the number and
            intensity of complex catastrophes. <i>It has become vitally
              important that a world chart be prepared setting forth the
              favorable, and the catastrophic, regions on Earth taking
              into account the quality of the geologic-geophysical
              environment, the variety and intensity of cosmic
              influences, and the real level of spiritual-ethical
              development of the people occupying those areas.</i> </p>
          <p>It is reasonable to point out that our Planet will soon be
            experiencing these new conditions of growing energy
            signifying the transition into a new state and quality of
            Space-Earth relationship. The living organisms of those
            regions of Earth having the major "inlets", or attractions,
            for cosmic influences will be taking the lead in evolving
            life's appropriate reactions, or processes, to these new
            conditions. These zones of vertical commutations and energy
            transfers are already becoming the heart, or hotbeds, in the
            search for new systems of adaptation and mutual
            transformation. The general list of these zones includes the
            polar regions, the eastern continental extremities of the
            equatorial regions [Caribbean, Madagascar, Philippines,
            Yellow Sea, etc.], and the inner continental zones tending
            to folding and uplifting [Himalayas, Pamir-Hindukush,
            Altay-Sayan systems, etc.] </p>
          <p>The most significant of these areas are the helio-sensitive
            zones which have intense responses to geoeffective solar
            activities [Note #1]; responses that include the very
            dramatic and unusual manifestation of non-homogeneous
            vacuum, or classical non-mechanical ether, domain
            structures. These structures, or objects, then interact with
            the heliosensitive zones producing deep and powerful effects
            upon the environment such as the alteration of seismic
            activities, and chemical compositions. Because these
            non-homogeneous vacuum domain objects display
            not-of-this-physical-world characteristics such as "liquid
            light" and "non-Newtonian movement" it is difficult not to
            describe their manifestations as being "interworld
            processes". It is important to note that those
            heliosensitive zones that exhibit middle and large scale
            processes are also those that are closely associated with
            these "interworld processes" produced by physical vacuum
            homogeneity disturbances. </p>
          <p>Such disturbances cause, and create, energy and matter
            transfer processes between the ether media and our
            three-dimensional world. The multitude of such phenomena,
            which is rich in it's quality and variety, is already
            growing quickly. Hundreds of thousands of these natural
            self-luminous formations are exerting a increasing influence
            upon Earth's geophysic fields and biosphere. <i>We suggest
              that the presence of these formations is the mainstream
              precedent to the transformation of Earth;</i>an Earth
            which becomes more and more subject to the transitional
            physical processes which exist within the borderland between
            the physical vacuum and our material world. </p>
          <p>All of this places humanity, and each one of us, squarely
            in front of a very difficult and topical problem; the
            creation of a revolutionary advancement in knowledge which
            will require a transformation of our thinking and being
            equal to this never-before-seen phenomena now presencing
            itself in our world. There is no other path to the future
            than a profound internal experiential perception and
            knowledge of the events now underway in the natural
            environment that surrounds us. It is only through this
            understanding that humanity will achieve balance with the
            renewing flow of the PlanetoPhysical States and Processes. </p>

          <p>1. Since the Earth is a large very highly organized
            organism, each of its structural units or territories such
            as, mountain systems, rivers, tectonic faults, ore deposits,
            oil fields etc. plays a certain functional role in its life,
            and in its connections with the outer world. For example,
            iron ore deposits support the climate stability because they
            perform the connection between the electrical activity in
            the atmosphere, and the electrical activity beneath the
            Earth's surface. </p>
          <p>2. Nowadays we all know the works of Tschizhevsky who
            discovered, and proved in the 1920's, that deep and various
            connections exist between Solar activity and various life
            processes. Using vast historical and statistical material he
            showed that Solar activity acts as an accelerator and
            moderator upon the whole biosphere, which manifests in the
            frequency and quantity of : births, deaths , harvests,
            epidemics, heart attacks, emergencies, bank crashes,
            catastrophes, suicides, populations growths and decreases,
            etc., etc. </p>
          <p>3. Since different zones of Earth have different functions
            in the Earth organism, their response to Solar activity is
            also different. For example, the polar regions are first to
            react to Solar disturbances, which we know well in the form
            of magnetic storms, auroras, and nowadays, in ocean warming
            at the 75 degree North latitudes. We also know other places
            which demonstrate intense reactions to different kinds of
            solar activity; that's what we call heliosensitive
            zones.Such reactions include local electromagnetic
            disturbances, low-latitude auroras, and specific changes in
            the pattern of magnetic field variations on the short term
            scale. There are also long-term reactions in the state of
            the biosphere. One of our colleagues, Ildar Mingazov, found,
            in studying the distribution and frequency of different
            types of diseases in various regions, that the intensity of
            disease frequency in correlation with solar activity varies
            between regions, and is maximal for heliosensitive zones
            (for example, cardiovascular diseases). </p>

            <p><b>By Andrew G. Marshall</b></p>
          </center>
          <p><b>Global Research, August 7, 2008</b> <br>
            &nbsp; </p>
          <p>The purpose of this report is to examine the science behind
            climate change so as to better understand the issue at hand,
            and thus, to be able to make an informed decision on how to
            handle the issue. The primary aim here is to examine climate
            change from a perspective not often heard in media or
            government channels; that of climate change being a natural
            phenomenon, not the result of man-made carbon emissions. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;<b>The “Science” of Consensus</b> </p>
          <p>When addressing the issue of climate change, it is
            important to understand that climatic change is an important
            field of study in science. However, it is not an exact
            science, like all sciences. Our understanding of the
            climatic sciences is always changing, just as our
            understanding of all sciences changes. If our understanding
            of science does not change, we would still think that the
            Earth was flat and the Sun revolved around our little
            planet. When these great achievements in science were first
            discovered, the scientists who discovered them were
            attacked, denounced, or even imprisoned. </p>
          <p>There is an enormous political, social and economic
            interest in a scientific consensus, because it determines
            our understanding of our environment and all that is in it,
            including humanity, itself. A challenge to a perceived
            consensus is a challenge to all the powers in human society,
            as it can take a person’s understanding of the world we live
            in, and flip it upside down. This encourages people to think
            “outside the box,” fosters creativity and to be critical
            thinkers. This can ultimately threaten any power structure,
            as people may come to understand the forces that seek to
            control our lives. A consensus is an amazing tool in the
            hands of elites to control and manipulate people. And
            challenging a consensus is an amazing tool for people to
            remain free and independent thinkers. </p>
          <p>This does not mean that any perceived consensus is
            inaccurate or completely manipulated. But it is important to
            understand how such a consensus can be used. It is also
            vital to understand that without questioning and challenging
            a scientific consensus, science would never advance. The key
            to scientific discovery is being able to change your
            perspective as the science changes. This is why debate on
            climate change must not be simply reduced to a one-sided
            debate; those who “know there is a problem,” and those who
            are “deniers.” All sides must be heard, so that we can come
            to a better understanding of the issue. </p>
          <p>We hear consistently the one side of the debate, that
            climate change is caused by increased Carbon dioxide (CO2)
            in the atmosphere, and that humans are the greatest
            contributor of this toxic greenhouse gas, and thus, the
            greatest contributor to climate change, and that there will
            be catastrophic consequences as a result. I hope to give
            voice to the other side of the debate. </p>
          <p><b>A Brief Climate History</b> </p>
          <p>First of all, it is important to note that climate change
            is not new. There has always been climate change, and there
            will always be climate change. After all, there was a period
            known as the Ice Age, which was a long-term period of
            reduction in global temperatures. This expanded the
            continental ice sheets and glaciers. The Greenland and
            Antarctic ice sheets were created in this period. The ice
            age left its imprint upon our environment, forming valleys,
            fjords, rock formations, and the like as glaciers advanced
            across the continents. As they receded when the ice age
            passed, it left the landscape altered and free for plant
            growth and life to flourish. The Great Lakes between Canada
            and the United States were carved out by ice. Following the
            Ice Age, the Halocene period began roughly 12,000 B.C. All
            human civilization has occurred within the Halocene period.
          </p>
          <p>During the Halocene period, there was both global warming
            and cooling periods, which have lasted until today. During
            the period of 10,000 to 8500 BC, there was a slight cooling
            period known as the Younger-Dryas. However, that passed, and
            between 5000 and 3000 B.C., temperatures increased to a
            level higher than today. This period is referred to as the
            Climatic Optimum. It was during this warming period in
            history that Earth’s first great human civilizations began
            to flourish, such as ancient African civilizations around
            the Nile.[1] </p>
          <p>Between 3000 and 2000 B.C., a cooling period occurred,
            resulting in a drop in sea levels, from which islands such
            as the Bahamas emerged. There was a subsequent warming
            period between 2000 and 1500 B.C., again followed by a cool
            period, which led to glacial growth. The Roman Empire (150
            B.C. – 300 A.D.) occurred during a cooling period, which
            went until roughly 900 A.D. During the period of 900 A.D.
            until 1200 A.D., a warming period occurred known as the
            Medieval Warming Period, or Little Climatic Optimum, which
            was warmer than today, allowing settlements to flourish in
            Greenland and Iceland. </p>
          <p>Then a cooling period followed and between 1550 and 1850,
            temperatures were colder than at any other time since the
            end of the previous Ice Age, leading to what has been called
            the Little Ice Age. Since 1850, there has been a general
            warming period.[2] </p>
          <p><b>CO2 and Temperature</b> </p>
          <p>This latest warming period has also coincided with the
            Industrial Revolution, which saw the greatest output of
            human induced CO2, leading many, like Al Gore, to compare
            the rise in CO2 levels with the rise in temperatures,
            drawing a conclusion that the rise in CO2 in the earth’s
            atmosphere was the determining factor in the rise in
            temperatures. However, if one studies statistics and how to
            read and interpret stats and graphs, one of the primary
            lessons is that correlation does not imply causation. Simply
            put, two factors lining up on a graph, does not necessarily
            imply that there is a cause and effect relationship. One
            could take a graph of increases in temperatures and
            increases in the consumption of peanuts, and they may line
            up. However, common sense will tell us that eating peanuts
            does not increase global temperatures. Simply because there
            appears to be a correlation between the two, that does not
            imply that there is a cause and effect relationship. </p>
          <p>When it comes to CO2, however, there is a much more
            important factor to analyze than simply statistical
            interpretation. Al Gore popularized the CO2/temperature
            connection in his movie, An Inconvenient Truth, in which he
            showed the correlation between the two on a graph. However,
            he interpreted the graph as evidence of a cause and effect
            relationship. His information came from an ice core sample
            related to CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. However,
            paleoclimatologist and earth sciences professor at USC,
            Lowell Stott, released findings of a study in September of
            2007, which concluded that, “Deep-sea temperatures warmed
            about 1,300 years before the tropical surface ocean and well
            before the rise in atmospheric CO2” at the ending of the
            last ice age, which “suggests the rise in greenhouse gas was
            likely a result of warming,” not the cause of warming.[3]
            [Emphasis added] </p>
          <p>As well as this, an ice core sample of air bubbles in 2003,
            “revealed a precise record of atmospheric greenhouse gas
            concentrations” and concluded that, “the CO increase lagged
            Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 +/- 200 years and
            preceded the Northern Hemisphere deglaciation.” Simply put,
            the analysis of the ice core samples, published in Science
            Magazine, reported that CO2 increases lagged behind
            temperature increases by roughly 800 years.[4] </p>
          <p>In statistics, this is what is called a “lurking variable,”
            meaning a hidden variable that can have an outcome on the
            results of a statistic without having been taken into
            consideration in the statistic’s interpretation. For
            example, Al Gore’s graph showed a correlation between CO2
            increases and temperature increases. The interpretation he
            gave was that the correlation implied causation; that
            because they lined up, there was an established
            relationship, and that relationship was defined as CO2
            increases driving temperature. However, the lurking variable
            was that he did not take into consideration whether CO2
            followed temperature increases, as the ice core samples have
            shown, but he rather chose to conclude that because they
            line up on a graph, CO2 is therefore the driver. This is bad
            science and statistical analysis at best, or intentional
            political deception at worst. </p>
          <p><b>A Lesson in Weather and Carbon</b> </p>
          <p>I want to briefly cover what factors affect our weather on
            Earth and what greenhouse gases are so that we can better
            understand the science of climate change. Weather takes
            place in the atmosphere, which is the layer of air directly
            surrounding the Earth. Air is simply a mix of gases, the
            most plentiful of which is nitrogen, making up 78% of the
            air we breathe. Oxygen is 21% of the air we breathe, and the
            other 1% is a variety of different gases. </p>
          <p>Weather tends to occur in the lowest level of the
            atmosphere, the troposphere. Air temperature, air pressure
            and humidity are the three factors that determine weather in
            the troposphere. The most important factors in determining
            temperature in the atmosphere are radiation arriving from
            the Sun and flowing from the Earth. </p>
          <p>The Sun sends energy into space in a variety of ways. There
            is visible light, infrared heat rays and ultraviolet rays.
            Roughly 30% of solar radiation coming into the Earth’s
            atmosphere is reflected back out to space by clouds, while
            the remaining 70% is absorbed into the atmosphere,
            increasing the temperature. This is what is known as the
            greenhouse effect. Air temperature changes from day to night
            and season to season, as the amount of radiation from the
            Sun changes, largely determined by our planet’s tilt towards
            the Sun. The equator is the exception to the changing
            temperature with seasons, because it generally receives
            equal radiation from the Sun year-round. </p>
          <p>Air pressure, the second determining factor in weather, is
            “the weight per unit of area of a column of air that reaches
            to the top of the atmosphere,” with pressure decreasing the
            higher you get, because there is less air above you.
            Humidity, the third main factor in determining weather, is a
            measure of the amount of water vapor in the air. The amount
            of water vapor that air can hold increases with temperature
            increases and decreases as temperatures decrease. When
            relative humidity is at 100%, water vapor condenses and
            forms droplets, changing from a gas to a liquid.[5] </p>
          <p>We often hear of “greenhouse gases” as being bad things.
            Yet, water vapor is the largest greenhouse gas of all.
            Carbon dioxide follows, with methane, nitrous oxide, ozone
            and many smaller gases. Water vapor is by far the largest
            greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, making up a much greater
            percentage than the gases that follow it. </p>
          <p>CO2, or Carbon Dioxide, is produced by all plants, animals,
            fungi and microorganisms, and it is then absorbed by plants.
            As people breathe in oxygen, we then breathe out carbon
            dioxide, plants take it in through photosynthesis, and
            thusly emit oxygen for us to breathe in. </p>
          <p>Carbon dioxide cannot be so simply classified as a toxin.
            In fact, it is a life accelerant. Recent research has shown
            that “shifts in rainfall patterns, cloud cover, and warming
            temperatures triggered a 6 percent increase in the amount of
            carbon stored in trees, grass, shrubs, and flowers,” in
            particular in the Amazon rain forests, which saw the
            greatest growth rates in the world.[6] The study, conducted
            from 1982 to 1999, showed that “global climate change has
            eased climatic constraints on plant life around the globe,
            allowing vegetation to increase 6 percent.”[7] Vegetation
            was taking in increasing amounts of CO2 in North America
            between 1982 and 1998, and “increased atmospheric CO2 and
            climate change are the primary causes of the recent U.S.
            vegetation increases.”[8] </p>
          <p>A NASA study revealed in 2001, that, “when the atmosphere
            gets hazy, like it did after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in
            the Philippines in June 1991, plants photosynthesize more
            efficiently, thereby absorbing more carbon dioxide from the
            atmosphere,” as volcanoes emit massive amounts of CO2 during
            an eruption.[9] Another study conducted in 2006 revealed
            that, “Diversity increases as the planet warms and decreases
            as it cools,” yet, deforestation can reverse this effect,
            simulating the effects of a global cooling trend.[10] </p>
          <p>In 2007, a new study revealed that as icebergs break off
            from Antarctica, “some as large as a dozen miles across –
            are having a major impact on the ecology of the ocean around
            them, serving as ‘hotspots’ for ocean life, with thriving
            communities of seabirds above and a web of phytoplankton,
            krill, and fish below,” and that the icebergs “can serve as
            a route for carbon dioxide drawdown” as it sinks into the
            sea.[11] </p>
          <p>In 2002, it was reported that, “The southern Saharan desert
            is in retreat, making farming viable again in what were some
            of the most arid parts of Africa,” and that, “dunes are
            retreating right across the Sahel region on the southern
            edge of the Sahara desert. Vegetation is ousting sand across
            a swathe of land stretching from Mauritania on the shores of
            the Atlantic to Eritrea 6000 kilometres away on the Red Sea
            coast,” which was largely attributed to increases in
            rainfall.[12] A scientific study conducted in the
            Netherlands predicted that global warming “could
            significantly increase rainfall in Saharan Africa within a
            few decades, potentially ending the severe droughts that
            have devastated the region,” which could in effect cause a
            “greening of the Sahara.”[13] </p>
          <p><b>What Causes Climate Change?</b> </p>
          <p>If CO2 increases lag behind temperature increases, it does
            not make sense that CO2 can be the cause of temperature
            increases. It would be the equivalent of saying that growing
            older is caused by the graying of hair; there appears to be
            a cause and effect relationship, it is just of vital
            importance to understand which is the cause and which is the
            effect. So, from here we must examine what some major causes
            of climatic change can be. </p>
          <p>The most important factor in climatic changes is what is
            called solar variations. This refers to radiation emitted
            from the Sun and its variations, in particular, the sunspot
            cycle. Sunspot cycles are the irregular rises and drops in
            the number of sunspots, which are regions on the Sun’s
            surface, which have lower temperatures than its surrounding
            area and strong magnetic fields.&nbsp; The cycles tend to
            last 11 years. </p>
          <p>An important thing to note is that Earth is not the only
            planet that experiences climate change, as in 2002, it was
            reported that Pluto was “undergoing global warming in its
            thin atmosphere,” likely due to it’s orbit, which,
            “significantly changes the planet's distance from the Sun
            during its long ‘year,’ which lasts 248 Earth years.”[14] In
            2006, it was reported that a new storm on Jupiter could
            indicate that the planet is “in the midst of a global change
            that can modify temperatures by as much as 10 degrees
            Fahrenheit.”[15] As far back as 1998, it was reported that
            Neptune’s largest moon, Triton, “has been undergoing a
            period of global warming,” since 1989.[16] This could have
            much to do with the fact that, as reported in 1997, the “Sun
            is getting hotter,” leading some scientists to say that
            Earth’s global warming “is part of a natural cycle for the
            planet.”[17] </p>
          <p>In 2004, the Telegraph reported that, “Global warming has
            finally been explained: the Earth is getting hotter because
            the Sun is burning more brightly than at any time during the
            past 1,000 years, according to new research.” The study,
            conducted by Swiss and German scientists, “suggests that
            increasing radiation from the sun is responsible for recent
            global climate changes.” Interestingly, the Sun “is brighter
            than it was a few hundred years ago and this brightening
            started relatively recently - in the last 100 to 150 years,”
            coinciding with the warming trend experienced since the
            Industrial Revolution.[18] This is what can be referred to
            as a “lurking variable” in Al Gore’s analysis of his graphs
            of carbon and temperature increases since the Industrial
            Revolution. It is a lurking variable because though the
            temperatures and carbon emissions match up on a graph, it
            doesn’t take into account other factors that may influence
            the statistics, such as increasing radiation from the Sun,
            which also correlates with increasing temperatures. </p>
          <p>National Geographic News quoted a scientist in 2007 that,
            “Simultaneous warming on Earth and Mars suggests that our
            planet's recent climate changes have a natural—and not a
            human-induced—cause.” Mars’ ice caps had been diminishing
            for three years in a row, and the scientist, “Habibullo
            Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's
            Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars
            data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is
            being caused by changes in the sun.” He further stated that,
            “changes in the sun's heat output can account for almost all
            the climate changes we see on both planets.”[19] A NASA
            study in the same year also reported that Mars warmed since
            the 1970s, “similar to the warming experienced on Earth over
            approximately the same period,” which, they conclude,
            “suggests rapid changes in planetary climates could be
            natural phenomena.”[20] A study in 2007 on climatic changes
            on Earth and Neptune suggested that, “some planetary climate
            changes may be due to variations in the solar system
            environment.”[21] </p>
          <p>In 2006, a study was conducted regarding Venus being the
            “solar system’s most inhospitable planet.” A planetary
            scientist at Oxford University stated, “It's very disturbing
            that we do not understand the climate on a planet that is so
            much like the Earth,” and that, “It is telling us that we
            really don't understand the Earth. We have ended up with a
            lot of mysteries.” Venus was “unbelievably hot, dense, and
            had virtually no oxygen.” Venus has a very pronounced
            greenhouse effect, as its “thick atmosphere traps solar
            radiation and heats the world to boiling point.” Scientists
            say that Venus being closer to the Sun than Earth is a
            factor, yet, there may be other factors. One brought up was
            that Venus’ atmosphere is almost entirely made up of CO2,
            which is effective at trapping heat. CO2 is roughly 95% of
            Venus’ atmosphere, compared to Earth’s atmosphere, which is
            0.038% CO2, so it is extremely understandable that CO2 would
            have a greater effect upon Venus than Earth. The question as
            to why Venus has so much CO2 may be because it lost its
            water, whereas on Earth, “carbon dioxide is absorbed by the
            oceans, where it forms carbonate minerals and over the
            millennia is deposited as rock. That process was arrested
            early on Venus when it lost its oceans.”[22] Perhaps we
            should put more focus into preserving and protecting our
            oceans. </p>
          <p><b>Get Your Parka, Here Comes Global… “Cooling”?</b> </p>
          <p>There is a little problem with the whole “global warming”
            consensus, in that recent scientific research has shown
            that, “A study of sea temperature changes predicts a lull as
            traditional climate cycles cancel out the heating effect of
            greenhouse gases from pollution,” and that, “Global warming
            will be ‘put on hold’ over the next decade because of
            natural climate variations.”[23] In other words, the natural
            climate cycles that Earth goes through, and always has gone
            through, has changed once again, just as a political
            consensus was reached. This is very significant because if
            CO2 was the prime cause for recent warming, and CO2
            consumption has not gone down, yet, the Earth’s climate has
            engaged on a cooling trend, this appears to pose a problem
            for the CO2 hypothesis. </p>
          <p>This cooling trend is supported by many recent events. In
            2008, “Snow cover over North America and much of Siberia,
            Mongolia and China is greater than at any time since 1966,”
            and China went through its most brutal winter in a century.
            Also, when we are told that the Artic Sea ice is melting to
            its “lowest levels on record,” it is important to note that
            the records date back to 1972, and “that there is
            anthropological and geological evidence of much greater
            melts in the past.” As it turns out, the ice itself has not
            only recovered from melting, but has grown thicker in many
            places. With the previous melting of the Arctic, we have
            been told it was caused by human activity and will result in
            catastrophe. However, climate modelers, predicting the
            future climate with computer models based upon information
            they provide, such as CO2 consumption, are highly
            inaccurate, as, “Climate models until now have not properly
            accounted for the wind's effects on ocean circulation, so
            researchers have compensated by over-emphasizing the role of
            manmade warming on polar ice melt.”[24] </p>
          <p>Many places have experienced unusual cold and snowfalls in
            the last year. Argentina got its first snowfall in Buenos
            Aires since 1918,[25] Johannesburg, South Africa,
            experienced snow for the first time in 26 years,[26] Baghdad
            experienced snow for the “first time in living memory,”[27]
            and Saudi Arabia went through sub-zero temperatures and snow
            storms, making it the coldest winter in over 20 years.[28] </p>
          <p>Even the BBC reported that temperatures will decrease, “as
            a result of the cold La Nina current in the Pacific,”[29]
            which is a natural phenomenon, and has a large effect on
            increasing cyclonic activity in the Atlantic. It’s
            interesting how La Niña and El Niño have disappeared from
            discussion on climate and hurricanes. Today, whenever there
            is a hurricane or natural disaster, it is instantly blamed
            on global warming and having been accelerated by human
            activity. Even Al Gore’s movie poster pictured a smoke stack
            with a hurricane coming out the top. An MIT climate
            scientist, who previously wrote about the link between
            hurricane energy and warming, produced a study in 2008 where
            he changed his pervious claims, saying that its not a
            clearly defined connection, saying there is a “lot of
            uncertainty,” and he was quoted as stating, “It’s a really
            bad thing for a scientist to have an immovable, intractable
            position.”[30] </p>
          <p>In March of 2008, NPR reported that after a survey of the
            ocean by 3,000 scientific robots, information was retrieved
            that showed that, “the oceans have not warmed up at all over
            the past four or five years. That could mean global warming
            has taken a breather.” The article quotes a NASA scientist
            as saying that, “the oceans are what really matter when it
            comes to global warming.”[31] </p>
          <p>In July of 2008, a major peer-reviewed journal of the
            American Physical Society, Physics and Society, concluded
            that the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
            report “overstated” the effects of CO2 on temperature in
            their climate models by between 500 and 2000%. The paper
            concluded that there is no “climate crisis.” The paper
            further reported that CO2 will add “little more than 1°F
            (O.6°C) to global mean surface temperature by 2100;” that
            the IPCC report took their predictive information from four
            published papers, not 2,500, as was claimed; that “global
            warming” stopped ten years ago; the IPCC overstated the
            “effect of ice-melt by 1000%”; that 50 years ago, it was
            proved that “predicting climate more than two weeks ahead is
            impossible”; and that an important factor in explaining the
            previous warming was that, “In the past 70 years the Sun was
            more active than at almost any other time in the last 11,400
            years.”[32] </p>
          <p><b>What About the Consensus?</b> </p>
          <p>We are often told, (especially by Al Gore), that on the
            issue of the effects of human activity on climate change,
            there is a “scientific consensus” on humans being the
            primary cause. If the above information does not provide
            some proof as to a lack of consensus on the subject, perhaps
            the fact that for the UN-organized 1992 Rio Earth Summit,
            which concluded that, “global warming and other
            environmental insults were threatening the planet with
            catastrophe,” was countered with a petition of scientists
            decrying, “the unsupported assumption that catastrophic
            global warming follows from the burning of fossil fuels and
            requires immediate action.” The number of signatories to the
            petition eventually reached 4,000 scientists, including 72
            Nobel Prize winners. In 2000, to counter the Kyoto Protocol,
            a petition was made up of “1,500 clergy, theologians,
            religious leaders, scientists, academics and policy experts
            concerned about the harm that Kyoto could inflict on the
            world’s poor.”[33] </p>
          <p>A current petition makes the statement that, “There is no
            convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon
            dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or
            will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating
            of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's
            climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence
            that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many
            beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal
            environments of the Earth.” This petition has been signed by
            over 31,000 scientists.[34] </p>
          <p>The former editor of New Scientist magazine, Nigel Calder,
            wrote that, “When politicians and journalists declare that
            the science of global warming is settled, they show a
            regrettable ignorance about how science works.” He explained
            how roughly 20 years ago, “climate research became
            politicized in favour of one particular hypothesis,” and
            that the media, “often imagine that anyone who doubts the
            hypothesis of man-made global warming must be in the pay of
            the oil companies. As a result, some key discoveries in
            climate research go almost unreported.” He also explained
            the results of a scientific study conducted in 2001 in
            Denmark, which found that, “cloudiness varies according to
            how many atomic particles are coming in from exploded stars.
            More cosmic rays, more clouds. The sun’s magnetic field bats
            away many of the cosmic rays, and its intensification during
            the 20th century meant fewer cosmic rays, fewer clouds, and
            a warmer world. On the other hand the Little Ice Age was
            chilly because the lazy sun let in more cosmic rays, leaving
            the world cloudier and gloomier.”[35] So not only is the Sun
            a determining factor, but so are cosmic rays. </p>
          <p><b>Conclusion</b> </p>
          <p>I won’t state exactly what is causing climate change on our
            planet, as the reality is that there are many answers to
            that question; the Sun, cosmic rays, ocean currents and
            other natural phenomena, etc. However, it is safe to say
            that the wealth of science points to a natural change in our
            climate, and the entire history of the world and of all
            humanity supports this hypothesis. Throughout history, as in
            the earliest African civilizations, it was the ability of
            different peoples to change and adapt to climate change,
            which determined their survival as a civilization. </p>
          <p>Today, we are trying to fight it. This is a dangerous road
            to walk, and history will not look kindly upon our
            scientific ignorance and politically fear-driven society.
            How will we be viewed in the future? How have we viewed the
            people of the past who thought the Earth was flat, or the
            Sun revolved around Earth? </p>
          <p>Trying to fight and stop a natural phenomenon is possibly
            one of the most ignorant and dangerous things humanity has
            ever engaged in. How would history view a civilization that
            tried to reverse the spinning of the Earth, or the blowing
            of wind? It is a recipe for the fall of a civilization. </p>
          <p>Much of the people in the world have been riled up with
            predictions of a catastrophic end to mankind and the world
            unless we don’t do something about so-called “man-made”
            climate change. Ironically enough, our refusal to adapt to a
            changing world, and instead a determination to fight it with
            our efforts to “go green” and “carbon neutral” may, in fact,
            cause the catastrophic end of our civilization. And sadly,
            in this instance, it would undeniably be a man-made
            disaster. </p>
