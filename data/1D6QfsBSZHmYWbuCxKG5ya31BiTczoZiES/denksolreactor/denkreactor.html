      <b> </b><br>
      An aerospace engineer has developed a solar reactor that could
      allow astronauts to make their own water and oxygen on the moon.<br>
      <br>
      The system can extract water from lunar soil, and would only
      require hydrogen brought from Earth for its initial use – after
      the first few hours, hydrogen would be recycled from then on.<br>
      <br>
      As hydrogen is far lighter than oxygen, the system could
      dramatically cut down on the weight of a mission to the moon.<br>
      <br>
      The machine has now completed a six-month test run, and according
      to the creator, it could make enough oxygen and water to supply up
      to eight astronauts.<br>
      <br>
      The solar-powered system can extract water from lunar soil, and
      would only require hydrogen brought from Earth for its initial use
      – after the first few hours, hydrogen would be recycled from then
      on.<br>
      <br>
      <b>THE NEW MACHINE </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The process uses the <b>iron-titanium oxide ilmenite (FeTiO3)</b>,
      which is found in the ‘dark’ areas of the moon.<br>
      <br>
      This could be dug up by a lunar robot, and carried over to the
      reactor, according to Denk.<br>
      <br>
      Lunar soil, unlike soil on Earth, does not experience weathering,
      as the moon does not have an atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      So, the particles are oddly shaped and have jagged edges.<br>
      <br>
      Before use, they would need to be pre-treated to smooth them out,
      then sieved to obtain the right grain size.<br>
      <br>
      And, it would only require hydrogen brought from Earth for the
      initial processing.<br>
      <br>
      Afterwards, this would be recycled.<br>
      <br>
      According to Denk, the machine can process a 25kg particle load in
      under an hour.<br>
      <br>
      In just one hour, it can make 700kg of water – and, in four hours,
      it could produce 2.5 kg of oxygen, all using under 10 kW of
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers have been working for decades to come up with ways to
      make oxygen on the moon.<br>
      <br>
      ‘From the beginning people were thinking this probably has to be
      done with a solar furnace, because on the moon there is not very
      much to heat a system that you can use; photovoltaics with
      electricity or a nuclear reactor or concentrated solar radiation,’
      said Thorsten Denk, who worked on the device for 10 years at the
      Plataforma Solar de Almeria (CIEMAT).<br>
      <br>
      ‘After the Apollo missions, scientists had a lot of ideas of how
      to make oxygen on the moon, because every material that you bring
      from Earth costs money.<br>
      <br>
      ‘For every kilogram of payload you need hundreds of kilograms of
      fuel.’<br>
      <br>
      Denk’s reactor can split water from the lunar soil, which can then
      be further split into oxygen and hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      And, the machine he’s built is the real size of what could be
      built on the moon to support a crew of 6-8 people.<br>
      <br>
      It currently weights 400 kilograms, but could be reduced with
      further refinement, Denk says.<br>
      <br>
      ‘The hydrogen would be just for the first few hours. Then that
      would be recycled with the electrolyzer,’ he explained.<br>
      <br>
      ‘Even if you bring hydrogen from Earth and get oxygen from the
      Moon for making rocket fuel, you save nearly 90% of the weight.<br>
      <br>
      ‘Hydrogen is the lightest element. Oxygen is much heavier.’<br>
      <br>
      The moon experiences long periods of sunlight, followed by long
      periods of darkness - and, the conditions are ‘ideal’ for making
      solar fuel, according to Denk.<br>
      <br>
      ‘Daylight is 2 weeks without interruption, and then you have the
      same half-month of dark as night. So if you need three hours to
      turn it on, it's not a big problem,’ Denk said.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      ‘There is no atmosphere on the Moon, and there is no weather, no
      clouds, so you really can operate from sunrise to sunset at full
      power for each half-month.’<br>
      <br>
      Solar furnaces require very high temperatures – but, they can’t be
      too high as to make the lunar soil ‘gum up’ and stick together, in
      what’s known as sintering, the creator explain.<br>
      <br>
      ‘The chemical reaction starts to be working from 800°C but
      sintering starts to be a problem at 1,050°C degrees, so my goal
      was not to surpass the 1000°C,’ he explained.<br>
      <br>
      ‘I achieved a bit more than 970°C and the maximum was hardly above
      1000°C.<br>
      <br>
      ‘So I had a temperature in the bed of not more than 30° up and
      down, for the highest possible average temperature without
      sintering.’ <br>

        <b> </b><b>CONCENTRATED SOLAR RADIATION ASSEMBLY</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      Radiation receiver incorporates a radiation entry window which is
      installed into the boiler wall in such a way that mechanical
      stresses in it are reduced by its displacement relative to the
      boiler wall<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This invention relates to a solar energy concentrating and
      collecting assembly, that is to closed central assembly systems
      for concentrated solar radiation, even more particularly, to a
      refrigerated window for a large-scale concentrated solar radiation
      assembly or structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] Concentrated solar power systems focus direct solar
      radiation through optical devices onto an area where a assembly is
      located. The assembly transforms the radiation into heat. Since
      concentrated solar power systems produce both heat and
      electricity, they can replace all or part of the energy
      requirements in some industrial applications. On the small scale,
      they also have durability and low operating costs.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Various solar energy collection arrangements are known.
      Many utilize an assembly with a receiver located at the focus. The
      receiver or central solar radiation assembly absorbs concentrated
      sunlight at high temperatures, commonly about 700°-1500° C. and
      transfers the heat generated by the solar absorber to a working
      fluid, which either serves as a heat carrier fluid or is designed
      to perform a thermochemical process. In one known kind of central
      solar assembly, a so-called tubular assembly, the working fluid
      flows inside tubes located usually near the inner periphery of the
      solar assembly housing. In such a assembly, solar radiation is
      absorbed at the outer surface of the tubes and is transmitted as
      heat to the working fluid, which is thus heated. The overall
      resistance to heat transfer and the ensuing heat loss in such
      tubular central solar assemblys is relatively high.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] High temperature closed solar assemblies generally have a
      cylindrical housing. Closed solar assemblies are closed at one
      side by a transparent window to form a sealed recipient capable of
      holding a working fluid or a chemical reaction mixture in direct
      contact with the absorber while avoiding physical contact between
      the working fluid and the ambient air. The sealed recipient also
      protects against temperature loss. In operation, the working fluid
      or reaction mixture is forced to flow across the assembly chamber
      whereby heat is transferred from the absorber to the fluid and is
      utilized for the chemical reaction or is transported outside the
      assembly.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The transparent window that shields the absorber in a solar
      assembly must be capable of sustaining the extreme conditions of
      high solar flux, high temperature and in some applications
      pressure associated with the conditions of operation. Solar
      assemblies designed for large-scale solar energy conversion
      systems need large transparent windows. These windows with the
      necessary dimensions and the required optical/thermo mechanical
      qualities are not readily available. Since large pieces must be
      made to order and the requirements concerning mechanical stability
      increase with size, these windows are extremely expensive or even
      impossible to manufacture. As a result, there is a need for
      improved large-scale solar assembly windows and large-scale
      concentrated solar power systems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0006] The primary object of the present invention is the creation
      of an improved solar assembly window for a central solar assembly
      that fulfills the requirements of a large central assembly in
      terms of efficiency, thermal and mechanical loads.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] It is a further object of the present invention to provide
      a concentrated solar radiation assembly.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In accordance with the present invention, a large-scale
      concentrated solar radiation assembly is disclosed. The
      concentrated solar radiation assembly comprises a housing divided
      into segments by housing trusses; window blocks positioned within
      the segments supported by the housing trusses; and, internal
      trusses positioned on top of the window blocks and within the
      segments. The housing trusses and internal trusses are hollow and
      define cooling channels for flow of cooling liquid, such as water
      or the like.<br>

        <br>
      </b><b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0015] The invention relates to a refrigerated window for a
      large-scale concentrated solar radiation assembly or structure.
      The window is divided into several segments that are shaped to
      keep the assembly hermetically sealed. The hermetically sealed
      assembly, including the window, is able to withstand thermal and
      mechanical loads caused by the highly concentrated solar
      radiation, very high temperatures, and the pressure difference
      between the interior and the exterior. Outside trusses define the
      shape of the window segments. Window segments are held within the
      segments by a housing and the outside trusses. The outside trusses
      apply the force needed to hermetically seal the assembly. In
      addition, the outside trusses are shaped to resist mechanical load
      and are water cooled to resist thermal load.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] FIG. 1 depicts a non-limiting embodiment of the present
      invention. FIG. 1 shows an exploded view of a large-scale
      segmented refrigerated or water-cooled window assembly 20 for
      highly concentrated solar radiation. Solar radiation enters from
      the left of assembly 20 and the structure is on the right of
      assembly 20. The window for a large-scale concentrated solar
      radiation assembly or structure is divided into several segmented
      window blocks 7, which can be made of glass, such as quartz glass,
      or other suitable materials that are well known within the art.
      Large-scale as used herein may be defined as an assembly having a
      window where size makes durability of the window assembly an
      issue, for example, where the window diameter or similar dimension
      is larger than about 400 mm. In order to withstand the unavoidable
      mechanical loads and to solve the fabrication problems associated
      with larger sizes, the window is divided into several segments
      that are refrigerated by liquid cooled trusses.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] High mechanical load as defined herein is a function of
      pressure difference and temperature level. Pressure differences of
      2 bar, such as from ambient (1 bar) to 3 bar is considered a high
      mechanical pressure load. Temperature above about 1000° C. is
      considered high mechanical temperature load. The mechanical
      pressure and temperature load can be increased up to an unknown
      limit by reducing the spacing between the trusses and/or
      increasing the thickness of the trusses and glass-blocks. In
      theory, the window blocks of the present invention can handle
      mechanical loads that reach beyond the practical limitations of
      the window blocks, i.e. window blocks as big as football fields
      may be manufactured to withstand high mechanical loads; however
      depending upon their intended use, window blocks of such size may
      not be practical.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Continuing on FIG. 1, the window blocks 7 are supported by
      outer trusses shown here as horizontal and vertical housing
      trusses 3. The horizontal and vertical orientation of the housing
      trusses 3 helps to sustain mechanical load possibly caused by the
      pressurized surface of the windows. An annular liquid-cooled
      flange 1 is divided into segments 2 by the housing trusses 3. A
      cooling liquid enters the housing trusses 3 through housing truss
      liquid inlets 4. The cooling liquid, such as water, may be any
      liquid that is well known within the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The housing trusses 3 are shaped to include a support
      surface 5. The support surface 5 supports the window gaskets 6,
      the window blocks 7 and an upstanding rib 8. Upstanding rib 8
      provides support for the internal trusses 9 and spacing for the
      window blocks 7. The internal trusses 9 are connected to the rib 8
      of the external trusses 3 with countersunk screws 14. As shown in
      FIG. 5, the window blocks 7 are captured between support surface 5
      of the housing trusses 3 on one side and internal trusses 9 on the
      other side. The countersunk screw 14 into upstanding rib 8 applies
      sufficient force between housing truss 3 and internal truss 9 to
      hermetically seal the window 7. The hermetic seal is also
      effectuated by a soft ceramic material (not shown) between inner
      truss 9 and window block 7. The soft ceramic material equalizes
      the pressure on the window blocks 7 exerted by the support surface
      5. The soft ceramic material may be any soft ceramic that is well
      known within the art, such as ceramic fabric.<br>

      [0020] Attached to the internal trusses 9 are liquid inlets 10.
      The liquid inlets 10 of the internal trusses 9 are connected to
      liquid inlet holes 11 in flange plate 12. Housing truss liquid
      inlets 4 and flange plate liquid inlets 11 allow a cooling liquid
      to flow through the hollow housing trusses 3 and hollow internal
      trusses 9. The advantageously orientated trusses are thus cooled
      by liquid flow. The cooled trusses are able to withstand the
      increased thermal load and temperature caused by the highly
      concentrated solar radiation.<br>

      [0021] The solar radiation assembly of the present invention may

      sizes and/or orientation. For example, the window segments can be
      round, square, rectangular and hexagonal. The corresponding
      internal and external trusses may be orientated around the shape
      of the window segments. Further, the window segments of the
      present invention can be used in large-scale systems as described
      above, and also in small-scale systems. The accompanying figures

      unlimited amount of necessary dimensions. The shapes of the
      components illustrated in FIGS. 1-4 are the preferred embodiments

          </b><b> Apparatus and process for carrying out endothermic
            chemical reactions</b></font><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In order to create an apparatus for carrying out endothermic
      chemical reactions involving participation of particles,
      comprising a reaction vessel in which the particles can be heated
      by electromagnetic radiation, in such a manner that an optimised
      matching of the absorbed radiation power to an essentially
      complete gasification of the carbon-containing material is
      possible, it is proposed that the reaction vessel has a heating
      zone in which absorber particles or absorber particles and the
      particles can be heated by direct absorption of the radiation and
      that the reaction vessel has a delay zone in which the absorber
      particles give off heat to the particles in order to maintain the
      chemical reaction.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a device for carrying out endothermic
      chemical reactions involving particles, comprising a reaction
      vessel in which the particles can be heated by electromagnetic
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      In the context of research projects, for example, the gasification
      of oil shale using electromagnetic radiation as a carbonaceous
      material in stationary fluidized beds on a laboratory scale was
      studied, the fluidized bed apparatuses were irradiated from the
      outside.<br>
      <br>
      The problem with these known solutions is that they are less
      efficient on an industrial scale.The invention is therefore based
      on the object to provide a device of the generic type, in which an
      optimized adaptation of the absorbed radiation power to a
      substantially complete gasification of the carbonaceous material
      is possible.<br>
      <br>
      This object is achieved in a device of the type described above
      according to the invention that the reaction vessel has a heating
      zone in which absorber particles or absorber particles and
      particles can be heated by direct absorption of the radiation and
      that the reaction vessel has a residence zone in which the
      absorber particles heat to the Particulate to sustain the chemical
      reaction.<br>
      <br>
      The solution according to the invention is thus to be seen on the
      one hand to absorb the radiation in a suitable manner and on the
      other hand then to make the heat so long available to the
      particles that they are capable of the best possible chemical
      reaction.<br>
      <br>
      The advantage of the solution according to the invention is in
      particular the fact that on the one hand in the heating zone,
      heating of absorber particles or absorber particles and particles
      takes place and then the stored heat in the absorber particles is
      a sufficiently long time available to the endothermic reaction
      process with the particles sufficient To provide large amount of
      heat available and thereby achieve a substantially fully
      continuous reaction with the particles.<br>
      <br>
      The heating zone can be designed differently. For example, it
      would be possible to convey the absorber particles over a
      horizontal distance in the heating zone.<br>
      <br>
      However, it is particularly advantageous if the heating zone has a
      falling section through which the radiation passes for the
      absorber particles or the absorber particles and particles. The
      advantage of a heating zone formed in this way is the fact that
      the particles fly freely through the drop zone and thus there is
      no need to keep the particles strongly heating up in the heating
      zone in thermal contact with a complex, temperature-resistant
      conveyor and thus lose heat.<br>
      <br>
      In principle, it would be in the case in which absorber particles
      and particles pass through the heating zone, conceivable to lead
      them so that they separated, that is, for example, in the form of
      separate case stretch the heating prevail.<br>
      <br>
      However, it is particularly advantageous if the particles and the
      absorber particles mixed with each other pass through the heating
      zone and thus before the heating of both the absorber particles
      and the particles, a mixing thereof, so that after the heating
      zone in a simple manner, without further measures, the further
      reaction the particles in the residence zone due to the uniform
      mixing with the absorber particles can be done.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, mixing of the absorber particles and the particles is
      achieved in that the absorber particles and the particles are
      mixable in a mixing zone arranged upstream of the heating zone.
      The mixing zone is preferably formed by a mixer which converts the
      two free-flowing particle streams into one another.<br>
      <br>
      In principle, the solution according to the invention could work
      in such a way that the absorber particles and the particles or
      residues thereof leave the reaction vessel together after the
      residence zone.<br>
      <br>
      It is particularly useful, however, if the absorber particles are
      guided in the reaction vessel in a cycle through the heating zone
      and the residence zone, since this eliminates the need to supply
      large amounts of absorber particles through suitable locks, for
      example, to the reaction vessel and remove it.<br>
      <br>
      For this purpose, it is preferably provided that the absorber
      particles can be brought to the heating zone from a discharge
      following the dwell zone in a return conveyor device.<br>
      <br>
      This feedback can be formed in various ways. For example, this
      return conveyor can work mechanically. However, it is even more
      advantageous if the return conveyor device works with a conveying
      gas, because this avoids the problems of moving parts at high
      temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, it is provided in the case of working with conveying
      gas return conveyor that the return of the absorber particles
      leads to a separator which separates the conveying gas from the
      absorber particles.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the separator is arranged following the return
      conveyor and produces a free-falling absorber particle layer.<br>
      <br>
      In order additionally to achieve a preheating of the absorber
      particles in the return conveyor, it is preferably provided that
      the return conveyor is also heated by the radiation.<br>
      A particularly advantageous embodiment provides that the return
      conveyor has a radiation absorber surface.<br>
      <br>
      In theory, the radiation absorber surface could be arranged so
      that it is acted upon separately from radiation, while at another
      point in the reaction vessel, the absorber particles alone or as a
      mixture with the particles are also exposed to radiation.<br>
      <br>
      However, it is particularly advantageous if the absorber particles
      or the absorber particles form an absorber curtain with the
      particles in front of the radiation absorber surface of the return
      conveyor device.<br>
      <br>
      This absorber curtain is preferably selected to be so thin that
      the radiation which does not impinge on the absorber particles or
      particles strikes the radiation absorber surface of the return,
      and heats the&nbsp; absorber particles returned in the recycling
      so that no radiation energy is lost.<br>
      <br>
      In the simplest case, the return conveyor is designed such that it
      has a return duct whose front side facing the radiation forms the
      radiation absorber surface at least in the heating area.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to the formation of the dwell, no further details have
      been given in connection with the previous explanation of
      individual embodiments. Thus, an advantageous embodiment provides
      that the&nbsp; residence zone is formed in the reaction vessel of
      a dwell, this dwell is preferably designed so that it traps the
      moving through the heating zone absorber curtain, formed from the
      absorber particles or the&nbsp; absorber particles and the
      particles.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, this dwell is designed so that in this the absorber
      particles and the particles form a bed in which the absorber
      particles and the particles are directly in preferably köperlichem
      thermal contact with&nbsp; each other.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, however, it is also conceivable to provide the
      dwell zone as a further drop or conveyor line for absorber
      particles and particles in which they move.<br>
      <br>
      Since the residence zone constantly new absorber particles and
      particles are supplied, it is necessary to remove them again from
      the dwell zone.<br>
      <br>
      For this purpose, preferably a discharge for the absorber
      particles and the remainder of the particles remaining after the
      gasification is provided.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of an indwelling container in the simplest case, the
      discharge is designed so that it forms a channel leading away from
      this, preferably a channel following the direction of gravity.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, in order to be able to feed absorber particles back
      to the recycling device after the residence zone, a separator is
      preferably provided downstream of the residence zone which removes
      at least part of the residues of the particles after the chemical
      reaction.<br>
      <br>
      The particles can either themselves carry a substance that
      undergoes an endothermic chemical reaction. However, it is also
      conceivable that the particles themselves constitute a catalyst
      which, when heated by the electromagnetic radiation, serves to
      catalyze chemical reactions.<br>
      <br>
      The solution according to the invention is particularly well
      suited when the chemical reaction is a gasification reaction in
      which a product gas is formed.<br>
      <br>
      As materials for the particles, preference is given to
      carbonaceous materials whose carbon is gasified.<br>
      <br>
      A particularly advantageous embodiment of the solution according
      to the invention provides that the absorber particles are ash
      particles, for example gassed particles, so that no exact
      separation between the residues of the particles and the absorber
      particles is carried out, but the ash collecting in the dwell zone
      is discharged to the same extent in the measure in that new ash is
      formed in the residence zone, while the remainder of the ash
      particles are passed as absorber particles via the return to the
      heating zone where they heat up due to the radiation and then
      transfer their heat to the particles in the residence zone, for
      example to maintain the gasification process of the particles to
      obtain.<br>
      <br>
      In the solution according to the invention, for example, the
      conveying gas for the absorber particles could be an inert gas.
      However, this would have the disadvantage that the inert gas is
      always in turn to be separated from the product gas produced
      during the gasification of the particles.<br>
      <br>
      For this reason, it is particularly advantageous if product gas is
      used as conveying gas, so that no complicated separation between
      the conveying gas and the product gas in the reaction vessel is
      required, but a common discharge of product gas can be provided,
      from which in turn conveying gas is recovered.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to the heating zone, it has hitherto only been stated
      that the absorber particles or the absorber particles and
      particles are heated in this by electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      It is particularly advantageous, however, if the heating zone is
      designed such that the absorber particles or particles and
      particles passing through it directly absorb the solar radiation
      reflected from the mirror systems to the reaction vessel. In this
      case, can be obtained in a particularly simple manner from solar
      radiation energy, namely the fact that they are reflected directly
      from a mirror system or a large mirror array on the reaction
      vessel and in the heating zone inside. Preferably, the mirror
      system is designed so that it focuses the solar radiation on the
      heating zone, wherein the size of the heating zone is dependent on
      the focus.<br>
      <br>
      In order to shield the heating zone against undesired external
      influences and in particular also to make it possible to collect
      the product gas in a simple manner, it is preferably provided that
      the radiation enters the reaction vessel through a window so that
      the interior of the reaction vessel is closed through the window.<br>
      <br>
      In order to prevent the window from being contaminated by absorber
      particles or particles which clog on it because of the high
      temperatures, the window is preferably provided with a flushing
      device which prevents settling of absorbent particles or particles
      on an inner side of the window. In this case, especially the
      provision of the fall distance in the heating zone proves to be
      advantageous, since the purge gas requirement can be kept
      significantly lower, in contrast to transported in a conveying gas
      flow absorber particles and particles, since the turbulence is
      lower.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the flushing device is designed so that it generates a
      flushing gas flow, which flushes the window on its side facing the
      absorber particles or particles inside.<br>
      <br>
      As purge gas, for example, an inert gas can be used. In order to
      avoid a complicated separation of purge gas and product gas in
      this case, it is advantageously provided that the purge gas of the
      purge device, the product gas is used, so that this can be removed
      again via the already provided for the reaction vessel product gas
      removal.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the invention relates to a method for carrying out
      endothermic chemical reactions involving particles, in which in a
      reaction vessel, the particles are heated by electromagnetic
      radiation to run the chemical reaction. The object mentioned in
      the introduction is achieved in a method of the aforementioned
      type according to the invention in that the electromagnetic
      radiation impinges in a heating zone, in which of these absorber
      particles or absorber particles and particles are heated directly
      by the radiation, and that provided on the heating zone following
      dwell in which the heated absorber particles release heat to the
      particles to sustain the chemical reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Further advantageous embodiments of the method according to the
      invention are already mentioned in connection with the
      advantageous embodiments of the device according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      As materials for the material particles are preferably oil shale,
      lignite, hard coal, biomass or similar materials used.<br>
      <br>
      The temperatures in the heating zone are preferably more than 300
      ° C, more preferably more than 1000 ° C, depending on the nature
      of the chemical reaction, in particular the gasification.<br>
      <br>

      A designated as a whole with 10 embodiment of a gasification
      device according to the invention comprises a solar collector
      system 12, which reflects solar radiation in the direction of a
      designated as a whole with 14 reaction vessel.<br>
      <br>
      This reaction vessel 14, shown as a whole in FIG. 2, comprises a
      thermally insulated housing 16 having a radiation window 18
      arranged therein, through which radiation 20 focused by the solar
      collector system 12 enters an interior of the reaction vessel 14.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, the radiation 20 strikes an absorber curtain 24,
      which drops over a drop section 22 due to the effect of gravity,
      from absorber particles and material particles of the material to
      be gasified. The absorber curtain 24 is heated while passing
      through a heating zone 26 of the focused radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The heated particles of the absorber curtain 24 pass after the
      heating zone 26 in a residence zone 28, which is formed by a dwell
      30. In this retention tank 30, the absorber particles and the
      material particles of the material to be gasified are collected
      and in thermal contact with each other, so that the absorber
      particles have the opportunity to give off heat to the material
      particles, so long as already begun in the heating zone 26
      endothermic gasification reaction in the material particles can be
      maintained until the material particles are substantially
      completely gassed while absorbing heat from the absorber particles
      substantially.<br>
      <br>
      From the preferably designed as a thermally insulated container
      retention tank 30 passes the mixture of absorber particles and
      substantially gasified material particles via a standpipe 31,
      which serves to compensate for the pressure conditions, to a
      designated as a whole with 32 separator, in which by a gas supply
      34, the absorber particles be promoted large part in a return
      conveyor 36 and to a small extent to an ash removal 38th<br>
      <br>
      The return conveyor 36 comprises a return channel 37 in which via
      a conveying gas supply 40 additionally conveying gas is supplied,
      which promotes the absorber particles from the separator 32 to a
      separator 42 in the return passage 37. In this case, the return
      channel 37 preferably runs, starting from the separator 32, along
      a rear side 44 of the housing 16 opposite the radiation window 18
      as far as the separator 42 arranged above the heating zone 26. In
      the separator 42 there is a separation between the conveying gas
      and the absorber particles, which form an absorber particle layer
      48 falling down along a front side of the return channel 37 facing
      the radiation window 18, which falls into a mixer 50 in which
      material particles are added to the absorber particle layer via a
      feed device 52 these are mixed so that the aforementioned absorber
      curtain 24 exits the mixer 50 and also falls along the front side
      46 of the return channel 37 via the drop section 22 through the
      heating zone 26.<br>
      <br>
      The front side 46 of the return channel 37 is formed in the region
      of the heating zone 26 as a radiation absorber surface 54, which
      in turn absorbed by the absorber curtain 24 not completely
      absorbed radiation 20, contributes to a heating of the return
      channel 37 in this area and thereby already preheating the in the
      return channel 37 promoted absorber particles causes so that they
      arrive already preheated in the separator 42.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of the heating of the absorber particles and material
      particles forming the absorber curtain 24, the gasification
      reaction in the material particles begins already in the heating
      zone 26 and product gas is produced. The gasification reaction
      continues even after leaving the heating zone 26 and is still
      maintained in the residence zone 28 by heat transfer from the
      absorber particles to the material particles, so that in the
      residence zone 28, the material particles gasify substantially.
      The occurring product gas preferably exits from an absorber
      curtain 24 receiving opening 56 of the retention tank 30 and flows
      through the interior of the reaction vessel 14 to a arranged in
      the bottom part 60 of the housing 16 Produktgasabfuhr 62nd From
      the product gas removal 62, the product gas is fed to a particle
      separator 64, preferably a cyclone, which separates remaining ash
      particles from the product gas and then feeds the product gas to a
      product gas buffer 66, preferably still cooling into a zone
      provided between the particle separator 64 and the product gas
      buffer 66 Radiator 68 is done.<br>
      <br>
      Even before leaving the reaction vessel 14, the product gas is
      cooled in a heat exchanger 70, which is arranged in the bottom
      part 60, wherein the heat exchanger 70 has a heat exchanger
      element 72 penetrated by the conveying gas to the conveying gas
      supply 40, which already heat the product gas flowing off and the
      discharged ash removes and heats the conveying gas to the feed gas
      flowing 40 accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      Product gas from the product gas intermediate store 60, which is
      supplied to the heat exchanger element 72 via a compressor 74, is
      preferably also used as conveying gas. Likewise, a compressor 76
      is provided, which also compresses product gas from the product
      gas buffer 66 and the gas supply 34 of the separator 32 supplies,
      whereby this gas stream can be heated via a heat exchanger.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, preferably, the gasification device according to the
      invention is operated so that used as absorber particles in the
      gasification of the material particles remaining ash particles are
      used, so that automatically form after the gasification reaction
      from the material particles absorber particles. In each case as
      much ash is to be removed via the ash removal 38, that the amount
      of absorber particles in the reaction vessel remains approximately
      the same size.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 3, the radiation window 18 is further provided
      with a free-purging device 80, which allows a purging gas film 82
      to flow over an inner side of the radiation window 18 facing the
      absorber curtain 24, in particular to keep the radiation window 18
      free of the radiation window 18, in particular on its side facing
      the absorber curtain 24 , wherein this purge gas film prevents the
      adhesion of absorber particles or material particles on the inside
      84 of the radiation window 18. This purge gas film 82 is fed via a
      purge gas 86, which is also supplied by the compressor 76 or by an
      additional compressor, so that product gas is also used as purge
      gas. Again, a heating via a heat exchanger is possible.<br>
      <br>
      The entire reaction vessel 14 is thus penetrated in its interior
      only by product gas, on the one hand arises in this and on the
      other hand supplied to circulate a defined amount of absorbent
      particles in the circuit and on the other hand in the separator 32
      to separate the resulting according to the supplied material
      particles amount of ash and at the same time also to operate the
      flushing device 80 for the radiation window 18.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, as shown in Fig. 3, the return passage 37 extends as
      arcuate flat channel formed over the back 44 of the housing 16 and
      engages with its Strahlungsabsorberfläche 54, the curved or flat
      inside 84 of the radiation window 18, thereby characterized over
      the distance of the radiation window 18th a homogenization of the
      temperature is possible because each point of the radiation window
      18 "sees" a large part of the radiation absorber surface 54 and
      thus receives the thermal radiation from almost the entire area of
      ??the radiation absorber surface 54 and the absorber curtain 24,
      so that a local and adverse overheating of the Radiation window 18
      is avoided.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, advantageously, the absorber curtain 24 is formed so
      that always a predetermined fraction of the radiation 20 strikes
      the radiation absorber surface 54, is absorbed by this and thus
      leads to a defined heating of the funded by the conveying gas
      through the return channel 37 absorber particles.<br>
      <br>
      The curvature of the radiation absorber surface 54 also ensures
      that the occurring radiation flux density of the radiation 20 over
      the entire radiation absorber surface 54 is substantially
      homogeneous.<br>
      <br>
      In order to be able to start the gasification device according to
      the invention without already produced product gas, an inert gas
      reservoir 90 is preferably additionally provided, with which inert
      gas of the conveying gas feed 40 can be supplied via the
      compressor 74 for circulating the absorber particles. This inert
      gas can also be used to flush the system. <br>

            Radiation receiver incorporates a radiation entry window...</font></b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The radiation receiver (10) comprises a pressurized boiler (12)
      with a radiation entry window (18) which by means of a bearing
      system is installed into the boiler wall (14) in such a way that
      mechanical stresses in the entry window are reduced by
      displacement of the window relative to the boiler wall.<br>
      <br>
      [0001]<br>
      The invention relates to a radiation receiver, which comprises a
      pressure vessel through which a working medium for energy
      absorption from coupled into the pressure vessel radiation is
      feasible, wherein the pressure vessel is provided with an entrance
      window for the radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0002]<br>
      Such radiation receivers are also referred to as volumetric
      radiation receivers.<br>
      <br>
      [0003]<br>
      Corresponding radiation receivers are known, for example, from DE
      197 13 598 A1, DE 197 10 986 A1, WO 96/12981, WO 96/25633 or US
      Pat. No. 5,421,322.<br>
      <br>
      [0004]<br>
      In the pressure vessel prevail in operation high temperatures of,
      for example, 800 ° C to 900 ° C. It is intended to drive in the
      future even at temperatures of the order of 1200 ° C or more. In
      the pressure vessel working pressures of the order of 15 bar to 20
      bar or more prevail.<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      Due to the high pressures and temperatures during operation, the
      entrance window is heavily loaded. In addition, a chemical load of
      the entrance window through the working medium and other
      substances may also occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      Based on this, the present invention seeks to provide a radiation
      receiver, which works safely even at high pressures and
      temperatures and has the longest possible maintenance intervals.<br>
      <br>
      [0007]<br>
      This object is achieved according to the invention in the
      radiation receiver mentioned above in that the inlet window is
      mounted on a pressure vessel wall movable by means of a bearing
      device that mechanical stresses in the entrance window by movement
      of the entrance window relative to the pressure vessel wall are
      degraded.<br>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      High mechanical stresses in the entrance window, which is usually
      made of quartz glass, arise from the fact that a
      Fensterfußdurchmesser reduced when pressurized and the pressure
      vessel wall thermally expands. Such changes in length may be on
      the order of a few tenths of a millimeter. Furthermore, the
      pressure vessel wall, on which the inlet window is mounted, can
      buckle under pressure as well as by thermal expansion. As a
      result, bearing surfaces of the entrance window on the associated
      pressure vessel wall are no longer plane-parallel, which can cause
      voltage spikes. Although glass usually has a high stability to
      compressive stresses, but is less stable to tensile stresses. The
      mechanical stresses that can build up in the entrance window due
      to the described processes, can lead to a destruction of the
      entrance window.<br>
      <br>
      [0009]<br>
      Characterized in that the entrance window is mounted according to
      the invention by means of a bearing device movable on the pressure
      vessel wall so that mechanical stresses in the entrance window by
      movement of the entrance window relative to the pressure vessel
      wall are degraded, a stress build-up in the material of the
      entrance window can be kept low or even largely avoided. By a
      specifically set mobility of the entrance window thus the life of
      the radiation receiver according to the invention is greatly
      increased and corresponding maintenance intervals are increased.
      The fact that the voltages in the entrance window are "degraded in
      situ", the radiation receiver according to the invention can also
      drive at high pressure and in particular high temperature. In
      turn, the radiation receiver in a power plant can be specifically
      adapted to, for example, a gas turbine; Gas turbines usually have
      a nominal pressure at which the efficiency is optimized.<br>
      <br>
      [0010]<br>
      From the prior art, it is known to weld to the entrance window a
      glass flange, which serves to hold the entrance window to the
      pressure vessel wall. The corresponding manufacturing process for
      the entrance window is therefore complicated and expensive. When
      operating the pressure vessel can be generated by deformations on
      the glass flange mechanical stresses that can act as break germs.
      According to the invention, because of the non-rigid mounting of
      the entrance window on the pressure vessel, no glass flange needs
      to be welded to the entrance window, so that in addition to the
      more cost-effective production, the risk of breakage is further
      reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]<br>
      It is particularly favorable if the entrance window is movably
      supported by the bearing device transversely to an entrance window
      axis. In this way, in particular tensile stresses can be reduced
      in the entrance window; Glass has a reduced tensile strength
      compared to compressive stresses.<br>
      <br>
      [0012]<br>
      In a first embodiment of the device according to the invention the
      mobility of the entrance window is ensured by the fact that the
      bearing device has a sliding layer on which the entrance window is
      mounted. <br>
      <br>
      The sliding layer is a layer in which the sliding friction
      coefficient is lowered, so that movement preferably takes place on
      this layer. The sliding layer thus forms the defined location for
      the mobility of the entrance window with respect to the pressure
      vessel. In particular, it can be achieved that is destroyed by the
      movement of the window by an otherwise undefined movement of the
      window, a seal which seals the interior of the pressure vessel
      from the outer space at the bearing of the entrance window.<br>
      <br>
      [0013]<br>
      It is particularly advantageous if the sliding layer is arranged
      between an end face of the inlet window and the pressure vessel
      wall. As a result, a mobility and in particular mobility of the
      entrance window can be achieved transversely to an entrance window
      axis in order to be able to reduce mechanical stresses in the
      entrance window.<br>
      <br>
      [0014]<br>
      Conveniently, a seal is arranged between the sliding layer and the
      inlet window in order to achieve a fluid-tight seal of the
      interior of the pressure vessel with respect to the exterior
      space.<br>
      <br>
      [0015]<br>
      Advantageously, the seal is designed as a multi-layer seal. In
      such a multi-layer seal can be achieved by the appropriate
      arrangement and design of the layers high temperature resistance
      and mechanical strength. In a preferred embodiment, the
      multi-layer seal comprises graphite layers with metal foil liners.
      The graphite layers, which in particular comprise precompressed
      graphite, ensure the high temperature resistance and the high
      sealing effect, and the metal foils, which are in particular thin
      stainless steel foils, provide the mechanical strength.<br>
      [0]<br>
      <br>
      It is particularly advantageous if the sliding layer is formed so
      that it has a reduced coefficient of sliding friction for the
      movement of the window. This prevents the entrance window slides
      on the seal or slide in a multi-layer seal individual gasket
      layers on each other. On the other hand, however, the mobility of
      the entry window is secured with respect to the pressure vessel
      wall, since just the sliding layer is provided. <br>
      <br>
      For example, the sliding friction coefficient for the sliding with
      sliding layer is about 0, 05th The coefficient of sliding friction
      for the sliding friction of the entrance window on the gasket, the
      sliding of the gasket on the pressure vessel wall (if no sliding
      layer is provided) or for the sliding of gasket layers relative to
      one another is usually of the order of 0.1. The sliding layer then
      makes it preferable to slide on this same layer. This prevents the
      seal from being destroyed. In addition, it is prevented that can
      build up by an undefined slippage of the entrance window, for
      example against the pressure vessel wall voltage spikes, which can
      lead to breakage of the entrance window.<br>
      <br>
      [0017]<br>
      In a variant of one embodiment, the sliding layer is formed by a
      lubricant. This may be, for example, high-viscosity silicone
      grease. Such a high-viscosity silicone grease has a coefficient of
      sliding friction of the order of 0.05, has a good sealing effect,
      good temperature, pressure, weather and chemical resistance and a
      long service life under normal operating conditions of a
      volumetric radiation receiver. It is also unlike normal fats free
      of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals that could contaminate
      the entrance window.<br>
      <br>
      [0018]<br>
      It is favorable if a depot is provided for the subsequent delivery
      of lubricant to the sliding layer. As a result, a
      "self-lubrication" of the sliding layer can be formed, so that the
      radiation receiver according to the invention has a long service
      life, since lubricant losses can be compensated.<br>
      <br>
      [0019]<br>
      In an alternative embodiment, the sliding layer is formed by a
      low-friction coating of the pressure vessel wall.<br>
      <br>
      [0020]<br>
      In a further embodiment, the storage device has a storage bed of a
      deformable material in which the entry window is mounted.
      Characterized a mobility of the entrance window is ensured in the
      storage bed, wherein the entrance window is fixed simultaneously
      in the storage bed. The storage bed with the storage bed material
      can thus serve to fix the entrance window, to ensure its mobility
      and to seal the interior of the pressure vessel from the outside.
      In particular, no glass ring needs to be welded to the entrance
      window as a retaining flange. As a result, a seal between the
      interior and exterior space is ensured and in particular already
      when the interior of the pressure vessel is depressurized.<br>
      <br>
      [0021]<br>
      It is particularly advantageous if the bearing bed material is
      elastically deformable. The elasticity of the bed material ensures
      the mobility of the entrance window to reduce stresses and on the
      other hand, a good fixation of the entrance window can be achieved
      on the pressure vessel wall. In addition, the bearing bed material
      due to its elastic deformability compensate for deviations of
      bearing surfaces between the pressure vessel wall and the entrance
      window, so that mechanical stress peaks are avoided or at least
      reduced. Such stress peaks in non-plane-parallel bearing surfaces
      can be caused by uneven thermal expansion, for example due to
      inhomogeneous temperature distribution, by manufacturing
      tolerances and / or introduced mechanical stresses. Local voltage
      peaks can be so great that the breakage threshold of the entrance
      window is exceeded. By the storage bed according to the invention
      such spikes are compensated.<br>
      <br>
      [0022]<br>
      It is particularly favorable if the storage bed material is
      designed and arranged in the storage bed so that the shear modulus
      is reduced transversely to the entrance window axis in comparison
      to the modulus of elasticity parallel to the entrance window axis.
      As a result, the mobility of the entrance window is ensured
      relative to the entrance window axis, d. H. There may be a
      relative movement between the entrance window and the pressure
      vessel wall. This in turn can reduce mechanical stresses.<br>
      <br>
      [0023]<br>
      One possible material for the bedding material is high temperature
      silicone.<br>
      <br>
      [0024]<br>
      It is favorable if the storage bed is arranged around an area of
      ??the entry window facing an interior of the pressure vessel and
      an opposite area of ??the entry window facing an exterior space.
      As a result, the entrance window is fixed in the storage bed and
      secured the mobility in the storage bed for a relative movement
      between the inlet window and pressure vessel wall.<br>
      <br>
      [0025]<br>
      Furthermore, it is advantageous if the storage bed material is
      arranged between one of the pressure vessel wall facing end face
      of the inlet window and the pressure vessel wall. This makes it
      possible to compensate for uneven bearing surfaces between the
      inlet window and pressure vessel wall, which are caused for
      example by uneven thermal expansions, by manufacturing tolerances
      and / or by mechanical stresses. This in turn can avoid high
      voltage spikes, which can lead to a breakage of the entrance
      window.<br>
      <br>
      [0026]<br>
      It is advantageous if the bearing bed is formed in a holding
      element which is connected to the pressure vessel wall. The
      holding element can be particularly rigidly connected to the
      pressure vessel wall. The relative movement between the pressure
      vessel wall and the entrance window and thus between the entrance
      window and the retaining element is ensured by the bearing bed.
      Conveniently, the retaining element is connected to the pressure
      vessel, so as to provide a secure fixation of the entrance window.<br>
      <br>
      [0027]<br>
      In an advantageous variant of an embodiment, a device for
      measuring mechanical stresses is arranged in a foot region of the
      entry window. It may in particular be one or more strain gauges.
      It can then be read whether high mechanical stresses prevail in
      the foot area of ??the entrance window. Such high mechanical
      stresses may, for example, have their cause in that the lubricant
      of the sliding layer has been consumed or the sliding layer has
      been destroyed or that the relative movement between inlet window
      and pressure vessel wall is limited in the bearing bed. The
      tension measuring device then indicates that maintenance must be
      performed. It can be prevented that build up in case of failure of
      the bearing device with respect to the relative movement between
      the inlet window and pressure vessel wall such high mechanical
      stresses in the entrance window, leading to a break.<br>
      <br>
      [0028]<br>
      It is particularly advantageous if the entrance window is fixed to
      the pressure vessel by means of an elastic adhesive material. In
      particular, no glass flange then has to be welded to the entrance
      window with the disadvantages and problems already described. Due
      to the elastic adhesive joint, the relative movement between inlet
      window and pressure vessel wall is ensured at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      [0029]<br>
      Advantageously, the adhesive material is high temperature
      silicone.<br>
      <br>
      [0030]<br>
      It is advantageous if an adhesive layer is adhesively connected to
      a holding element, by means of which the inlet window is fixed to
      the pressure vessel. The retaining element then does not have to
      be connected directly to the entrance window - as is the case with
      the glass flange known from the prior art as the retaining element
      - but a non-rigid connection between the retaining element and the
      entrance window can be formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0031]<br>
      It is advantageous if the holding element is connected via a
      clamping connection with the pressure vessel wall. For example,
      can be arranged in a corresponding clamping element of the
      clamping connection corresponding means for supplying detergent
      and coolant in the interior of the pressure vessel. Such devices
      are usually only a small amount of wear. The retaining element,
      however, which is adhesively connected to the entrance window, at
      least with respect to the adhesive layer is subject to high wear.
      In an exchange then does not have to be replaced with its coolant
      devices the entire clamping element, but it is sufficient to
      replace only the retaining element.<br>
      <br>
      [0032]<br>
      In a variant of one embodiment, an adhesive layer facing the
      interior of the pressure vessel is connected to the inlet window.<br>
      <br>
      [0033]<br>
      It is advantageous if the holding element is connected in the
      interior of the pressure vessel with this.<br>
      <br>
      [0034]<br>
      In another embodiment, an adhesive layer is connected to the
      entrance window facing an exterior space. This has the advantage
      that the adhesive layer is not acted upon by the working medium
      and the like in the interior of the pressure vessel and is more
      easily accessible for maintenance or replacement. However, it can
      also be provided that, for example, in a storage bed, an adhesive
      layer is arranged both in the interior and exterior space.<br>
      <br>
      [0035]<br>
      In an advantageous variant of an embodiment, the holding element
      outside the interior of the pressure vessel is connected thereto.
      In this way, an adhesive layer for fixing the entrance window to
      the pressure vessel can be formed, which is arranged outside of
      the interior, so as to reduce the temperature of the adhesive
      layer and to prevent the Arbeitsmediumbeaufschlagung.<br>
      <br>
      [0036]<br>
      It is particularly advantageous if the storage bed material is an
      adhesive material, so that the storage bed also provides for
      fixing the entrance window to the pressure vessel.<br>
      <br>
      [0037]<br>
      It is advantageous if a holding element, by means of which the
      inlet window is connected to the pressure vessel via an adhesive
      layer, has an undercut space for receiving adhesive material. As a
      result, a fixation between the inlet window and the holding
      element and thus with respect to the pressure vessel can be
      achieved, even if the adhesive layer decreases or fails in its
      adhesive action, because through the undercut room can form a
      positive connection between the holding element and adhesive
      layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0038]<br>
      It is favorable if an adhesive layer facing the interior of the
      boiler has one or more interruptions in the direction of an
      entrance window foot. This allows a pressure equalization between
      an upper side and a lower side of the adhesive layer, so as to
      reduce the force load of the adhesive layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0039]<br>
      In order to increase the life of the adhesive layer, in particular
      by reducing the temperature load, a heat radiation protection
      device for an adhesive layer is provided according to the
      invention. Infrared radiation from the interior of the pressure
      vessel and in particular from an absorber forth and from the
      coupling into the window in principle acts on the adhesive layer.
      By a heat radiation protection device, this admission is at least
      reduced. For example, a reflective layer or a reflective element
      can be arranged on the adhesive layer so as to reduce the
      radiation absorption by the adhesive layer and thus its heating.
      For example, additionally or alternatively, a shield element can
      be arranged above the adhesive layer in order to shield at least a
      part of the heat radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0040]<br>
      It is advantageous if the shield element is arranged and designed
      so that a pressure equalization between adhesive layer and shield
      element with respect to an interior of the boiler is possible, so
      that the shield element is not too heavily loaded with force.<br>
      <br>
      [0041]<br>
      It is structurally favorable when the shield element is seated on
      a clamping element, by means of which a retaining element is held
      by clamping on the pressure vessel, wherein the adhesive layer is
      connected to the retaining element.<br>
      <br>
      [0042]<br>
      In a variant of one embodiment, the shield element is arranged as
      a cover on the adhesive layer and in particular is designed to be
      reflective in order to at least partially reflect back infrared
      radiation and thus to reduce the absorption.<br>
      <br>
      [0043]<br>
      To increase the service life, d. H. To increase maintenance
      intervals, it is particularly advantageous if one or more coolant
      channels are arranged in the pressure vessel wall in the region of
      a Eintrittsfensterfußes. <br>
      <br>
      As a result, the entrance window in the area of ??his foot can
      then be cooled and, in particular, an adhesive layer can be cooled
      in this area. In turn, the service life of the radiation receiver
      according to the invention is increased because the life of the
      adhesive layer is increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0044]<br>
      Furthermore, it is particularly advantageous if a flushing device
      for flushing the inlet window is provided on an inner surface
      facing the interior of the boiler. In the operation of a radiation
      receiver often the problem arises that water condenses at the foot
      of the inlet window when the working medium is water
      vapor-containing and the temperature in the region of the window
      foot below the condensation temperature. This water condensation
      has in particular the disturbing effect that an inner insulation
      is soaked in the pressure vessel. By flushing the entrance window
      on its inner surface (the pressurized side), water condensation at
      the window in this area can be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      [0045]<br>
      It is advantageous if the rinsing agent can be introduced into the
      interior of the pressure vessel in the region of an entry window
      foot, since the greatest risk of water condensation exists in this
      area in particular.<br>
      <br>
      [0046]<br>
      It is advantageous, when the rinsing agent is introduced into the
      interior of the pressure vessel, that an adhesive layer, by means
      of which the inlet window is fixed in the pressure vessel, is
      coolable. The rinsing agent then acts simultaneously as a rinsing
      agent and coolant, with which - also in addition - the adhesive
      layer can cool, so as to increase their service life.<br>
      <br>
      [0047]<br>
      It is advantageous if the rinsing agent is passed through a grid
      to create a pressure loss and to effect a uniform flow profile and
      thus to ensure a uniform distribution.<br>
      <br>
      [0048]<br>
      In particular, to avoid water condensation, it is advantageous if
      a flushing gas free of steam is used as the rinsing agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0049]<br>
      Furthermore, it is favorable if a flushing device is provided for
      flushing an outer surface of the inlet window facing the outer
      space of the pressure vessel. This outer surface is the side of
      the window opposite to the pressurized side. As a result, the
      window, which is heavily thermally stressed by the coupled-in
      radiation, can be cooled and also cleaned, for example by dust.<br>
      <br>
      [0050]<br>
      It is advantageous if one or more coolant channels for supplying
      coolant to the inlet window between an aperture insert and the
      pressure vessel wall are arranged for this purpose. It can then be
      a detergent or Lead coolant over the corresponding window area,
      which can then escape through the aperture. As a result, the inlet
      window can be actively cooled and, by suitable design of
      corresponding outlet openings, it is possible to selectively blow
      on locations that are particularly subject to thermal stress, such
      as, for example, a vertex area of ??the entrance window. By a
      suitable control and measurement, the detergent or Dose coolant
      depending on the operating state of the radiation receiver to the
      place of loading and loading amount to optimally cool the entrance
      window.<br>
      <br>
      [0051]<br>
      In particular, it is favorable if a nozzle, by means of which
      coolant can be fed to the inlet window from the outside space, is
      designed as a swirl nozzle in order to ensure a surface loading of
      the inlet window.<br>
      <br>
      [0052]<br>
      It is particularly advantageous if a front flange of the pressure
      vessel, on which the inlet window is mounted, is bendable and, in
      particular, elastic. When pressurizing the pressure vessel
      experiences the pressure vessel wall (and thus the front flange) a
      deflection, d. H. she can get deformed. If the face of the
      entrance window is not flat, the front flange can adapt to the
      entrance window due to its deformability. Although the uneven
      stress distribution generated on its end face due to a non-planar
      design of the entrance window is not remedied thereby, but the
      differences between minimum values ??and maximum values ??are
      reduced, ie. H. Voltage peaks are reduced because the front flange
      can adapt. In turn, the risk of breakage of the entrance window is
      substantially reduced, since just high voltage spikes are avoided.<br>
      <br>
      [0053]<br>
      Due to the deformability of the front flange is a change in shape
      of the same when pressurized. With appropriate design of the front
      flange, this shape change can be compensated. In particular, it is
      advantageous if a bearing surface of the front flange for the
      inlet window has a tendency in the unloaded state in the radial
      direction. With appropriate design then a support surface is the
      entrance window in the operating state just.<br>
      <br>
      [0054]<br>
      It is advantageous if the front flange is formed so that the ratio
      of its deflection to the diameter based on the operating condition
      of the pressure vessel at least 2. 10 &lt;-4&gt; is. For example,
      with an internal pressure of 15 bar and a bowl diameter of 1 m,
      the deflection should be of the order of 0.3 mm or more so as to
      reduce stress peaks in the bearing of the entrance window on the
      front flange in the entrance window.<br>
      <br>
      [0055]<br>
      It is particularly advantageous if the entrance window is
      dome-shaped, so that a high compressive strength is ensured.<br>
      <br>
      [0056]<br>
      In an advantageous variant of an embodiment, an insert element is
      arranged in an aperture of the entry window. The insert element
      then serves in particular to protect the pressure vessel wall and
      the bearing device from the radiation. Conveniently in the insert
      element thereby formed as a secondary concentrator to couple
      radiation into the interior of the pressure vessel, which is
      reflected at the insert element.<br>
      <br>
      [0057]<br>
      It is structurally favorable when the insert element is
      circumferentially formed as a polygon, for example, as eighteen.<br>

      [0063]<br>
      An embodiment of a radiation receiver according to the invention,
      which is designated in Fig. 1 as a whole with 10, comprises a
      pressure vessel 12 through which a working medium for receiving
      energy from solar radiation can be guided under pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0064]<br>
      The pressure vessel 12 comprises a pressure vessel wall as a front
      flange 14; the pressure vessel 12 is positioned so that the front
      flange 14 faces concentrated solar radiation 16. The solar
      radiation 16 is coupled via a mounted on the front flange 14
      entrance window 18 in an interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12.
      The interior 20 is formed within the front flange 14 and of
      pressure vessel walls 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0065]<br>
      The entrance window 18 is dome-shaped with an entrance window axis
      24, with respect to which the entrance window 18 is rotationally
      symmetrical. The entrance window axis 24 is oriented perpendicular
      to the front flange 14, and preferably, the pressure vessel 12 and
      in particular the interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12 is
      rotationally symmetrical with respect to this axis 24 is formed. A
      vertex 26 of the entrance window 18 is facing the interior 20
      behind an aperture 28 in the front flange 14th Solar radiation 16
      passes through the aperture 28 to and through the entrance window
      18, which is in particular a quartz glass window.<br>
      <br>
      [0066]<br>
      In the aperture 28, an aperture insert 30 is inserted so that an
      end face 32 of the front flange 14 is covered. For this purpose,
      the aperture insert part 30 has a frustoconical ring element 32,
      wherein the (imaginary) cone tip is set back relative to the front
      flange 14 in the direction of the interior 20 of the pressure
      vessel 12. Furthermore, the aperture insert part 30 comprises an
      example cylindrical portion 34, which lies around a foot portion
      36 of the entrance window 18 and is thus arranged behind the
      aperture 28. The aperture insert 30 serves to protect the front
      flange 14 from solar radiation. In particular, the aperture insert
      part 30 is designed as a secondary concentrator in order to
      concentrate radiation reflected at the aperture insert part 30
      through the entrance window 18 into the interior 20 of the
      pressure vessel 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0067]<br>
      The aperture insert 30 is not annular in cross-section in a
      variant of an embodiment, but has the shape of a polygon such as a
      achtzehnecks circumferentially.<br>
      <br>
      [0068]<br>
      In the interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12, a designated as a
      whole with 38 absorber is arranged, which can be acted upon via
      the entrance window 18 by the solar radiation 16 and can be
      heated. By the absorber 38, the working medium for energy
      absorption is feasible, d. H. the working fluid heats up during
      the guide through the absorber 38. The absorber 38 is accordingly
      a volumetric absorber, i. H. the absorber absorbs the radiation
      substantially over its entire volume. For this purpose, the
      absorber 38 is made for example of a porous material or wire mesh.
      The radiation receiver is therefore a volumetric radiation
      receiver.<br>
      <br>
      [0069]<br>
      The absorber 38 includes an inlet absorber 40 through which an
      inlet stream is led to preheat. For this purpose, an inner jacket
      42 is disposed in the interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12, which
      is formed substantially parallel to the pressure vessel wall 22
      and between the pressure vessel wall 22 and an inlet stream 44 is
      feasible. In the interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12, a flow
      space 46 is formed around the inlet window 18, through which the
      working fluid flows to an outlet absorber 50 after flowing through
      an inlet flow space 48 and flow through the inlet absorber 40. The
      flow space 46 is thereby formed between the inlet absorber 40, the
      inlet window 18 and the outlet absorber 50.<br>
      <br>
      [0070]<br>
      The Auslaßabsorber 50 is arranged with respect to the entrance
      window 18 and formed so that a high radiation power is absorbed
      and a high volume flow through the outlet absorber 50 is feasible,
      so that the working fluid can absorb a high heat output.<br>
      <br>
      [0071]<br>
      An outlet stream 52 is removed from the interior 20 after
      absorption of heat in the absorber 38.<br>
      <br>
      [0072]<br>
      In the interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12, in the variant of an
      embodiment of a pressure vessel 12 according to the invention
      shown in FIG. 1, a further inner jacket 54 is arranged which has a
      wall 56 which is parallel spaced from a corresponding wall 58 of
      the inner jacket 42. Characterized a particular annular opening 60
      is formed in the interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12 through
      which a partial stream 62 of the outlet stream 52 via a return
      space 64 in the inlet flow space 48 is traceable.<br>
      <br>
      [0073]<br>
      By such a partial recirculation of an outlet flow from the
      Auslaßstromführung to an inlet flow in the inlet flow, a
      Durchgangsmassestrom the working medium flow can be increased so
      as to reduce in particular fluctuations in a mass flow
      distribution of a fluid flow in the absorber 38 and thereby
      possibly occurring temperature peaks, which can cause instability.
      Such a device and a corresponding method is described in DE 197 10
      986 A1, which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0074]<br>
      Between the pressure vessel wall 22, the front flange 14 and the
      inlet flow space 48, a thermal inner insulation 66 is arranged,
      which comprises at least one layer of insulating material and in
      particular includes pressure compensation means for pressure
      equalization between the insulating material and a boiler
      interior, which are arranged over a large area relative to a layer
      surface of the insulating material. Such an insulation system is
      described in DE 197 13 598 A1, which is hereby incorporated by
      reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0075]<br>
      In particular, it may be provided that the insulation system of
      the inner insulation 66 has a filter which is arranged between the
      pressure compensation means and a layer surface of the insulating
      material and serves to retain Dämmaterialpartikeln.<br>
      <br>
      [0076]<br>
      The entrance window 18 is mounted on the front flange 14 by means
      of a bearing device. In a first embodiment of a bearing device
      according to the invention, which is designated as a whole by 68
      in Fig. 2,the front flange 14 on its end face 32 has an annular
      recess 70 through which a support surface 72 is formed, on which
      the entrance window 18 with an end face 74 rests. Between the end
      face 74 while a seal 76 is arranged, which serves to seal the
      interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12 relative to the outer space.
      The seal 76 is in particular a multi-layer seal with layers of
      precompressed graphite and intermediate layers of thin stainless
      steel foils. The graphite serves to achieve a high temperature
      resistance and the intermediate layers to achieve a high
      mechanical strength.<br>
      <br>
      [0077]<br>
      Between the seal 76 and the bearing surface 72 of the front flange
      14, a sliding layer 78 is arranged, which has a reduced
      coefficient of sliding friction, so that the inner window 18 with
      the seal 76 on the sliding layer transversely to the entrance
      window axis 24 is movable and this movement takes place on the
      sliding layer 78 itself , In particular, the sliding friction
      coefficient for the sliding friction of the entrance window 18
      with the seal 76 on the sliding layer 78 must be lower than the
      sliding friction coefficient for the sliding friction of the
      entrance window 18 on the seal 76 or for the sliding movement of
      sealing layers relative to each other. A typical value for the
      coefficient of sliding friction of quartz glass on graphite is
      0.1. Preferably, then, the sliding friction coefficient of the
      sliding layer 78 is of the order of, for example, <br>
      <br>
      0.05. It is then achieved that the relative movement of the
      entrance window 18 takes place with respect to the front flange 14
      via sliding on the sliding layer 78, d. H. takes place at the
      location defined by the sliding layer 78.In particular, by the
      destruction of the seal 76 is avoided, for example by separation.<br>
      <br>
      [0078]<br>
      By the movement of the entrance window 18 relative to the front
      flange 14, mechanical stresses in the entrance window 18 can be
      reduced, as they can arise in particular by the pressurization of
      the entrance window 18 and by the temperature of the inlet window
      18 and the front flange 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0079]<br>
      In a variant of one embodiment, the sliding layer 78 is formed by
      applying a lubricant to the support surface 72 in a defined area.
      As a lubricant, for example, high-viscosity silicone grease can be
      used. In addition to a good sealing effect, this material also has
      good temperature, pressure, weather and chemical resistance as
      well as a long service life under operational use conditions. In
      addition, high-viscosity silicone grease is free of alkali metals
      and alkaline earth metals. As a result, the risk of contamination
      of the entrance window 18 is avoided.<br>
      <br>
      [0080]<br>
      It can also be provided a depot for the lubricant to get at
      Gleitmittelverlusten the lubricity of the sliding layer 78 by
      appropriate lubricant subsequent delivery (not shown in FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      [0081]<br>
      In an alternative variant of an embodiment, the front flange 14 is
      provided at its bearing surface 72 with a corresponding
      low-friction coating to form the sliding layer 78, by which the
      sliding friction coefficient between the inlet window and the seal
      76 with respect to sliding on the sliding layer 78 relative to the
      sliding friction coefficient between the inlet window 18 and Seal
      76 with respect to sliding on the seal 76 is reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0082]<br>
      In order to be able to monitor a failure of the sliding layer 78,
      a tension measuring device 80 is arranged in the foot region 36,
      by means of which mechanical stresses in the inlet window 18 can
      be measured in this region, in order in particular to be able to
      indicate a failure of the sliding layer 78 as a defined sliding
      surface. In particular, the stress measuring device 80 includes
      one or more strain gauges. Such a strain gauge indicates strain
      and thus the presence of mechanical stresses in the region where
      the strain gauge is seated at the entrance window 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0083]<br>
      At one of the interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12 facing inner
      wall 82 of the front flange 14 is seated in particular positively
      connected, for example by screw 84, a clamping ring 86th By this
      clamping ring 86, a retaining ring 88 is clamped to the front
      flange 14 in the interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12 is held.
      The retaining ring 88 serves as a holding element for the entrance
      window 18 and has a cross-sectionally L-shaped configuration,
      wherein a first wing 90 between the clamping ring 86 and the inner
      wall 82 of the front flange 14 is clamped and a second wing 92 in
      the recess 70 the Entrance window 18 is arranged facing.<br>
      <br>
      [0084]<br>
      Between the entrance window 18 and the second wing 92 sits an
      adhesive layer 94 so that the entrance window 18 is fixed by this
      adhesive layer on the front flange 14. The adhesive material of
      the adhesive layer 94 is a highly elastic adhesive material, such
      as high-temperature silicone, so that the mobility of the entrance
      window 98 is retained on the sliding layer 78 in particular
      transversely to the entrance window axis 24 and also by the
      adhesive material of the adhesive layer 94 no significant forces
      on the entrance window 18 exercised.<br>
      <br>
      [0085]<br>
      In the variant of an embodiment shown in Fig. 2, the retaining
      ring 88 has been glued before introduction of the entrance window
      18 into the recess 70 in the manufacture of the radiation receiver
      10 according to the invention so that when clamping the retaining
      ring 88, the adhesive layer 94 is slightly down in the direction
      of Support surface 72 is pressed. This results in a shear
      deformation in the adhesive layer 94, so that even without
      pressurization of the interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12, a
      contact pressure of the entrance window 18 acts on the support
      surface 72.<br>
      <br>
      [0086]<br>
      Preferably, the adhesive layer 94 facing second wing 92 of the
      retaining ring 88 has an undercut 96, which is formed for example
      as an annular groove. This serves to increase the contact area
      between the adhesive layer 94 and the retaining ring 88. In
      addition, thereby a kind of positive connection between the
      adhesive layer 94 and the retaining ring 88 is made so that even
      with loss of adhesive contact between the adhesive layer 94 and
      the second wing 92 of the retaining ring 88, the entrance window
      18 remains fixed to the front flange 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0087]<br>
      In the recess 70, a cavity 98 is formed between the entrance
      window 18, the adhesive layer 94 and the retaining ring 88. To
      allow pressure equalization of the interior space 20 with this
      cavity 98, the adhesive layer 94 is circumferentially intermittent
      with respect to the entrance window axis 24 substantially parallel
      to that axis (not visible in FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      [0088]<br>
      To protect the adhesive layer 94 from heat radiation from the
      interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12, a heat radiation protection
      device is provided. For example, this may be a highly reflective
      shielding element arranged on the surface of the adhesive layer 94
      facing the interior 20 or a ceramic cord. In the embodiment shown
      in Fig. 2, the clamping ring 86 has a nose-shaped shield member
      100, which extends so far to the entrance window 18 that still a
      pressure equalization between the interior 20 of the pressure
      vessel 12 and the adhesive layer 94 is made possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0089]<br>
      According to the invention, a flushing device 204 is provided, by
      means of which the inlet window 18 faces the interior 20 of the
      pressure vessel 12 (pressurized side) and can be formed on the
      inlet window 18 <br>
      <br>
      to form a flushing film for cooling the entrance window 18. To go
      through the front flange 14 feed channels 206, which are continued
      in the clamping ring 86. In the clamping ring 86 corresponding
      transverse <br>
      <br>
      channels 208 are then arranged, which open into a distribution
      space 210. At the distributor space 210 sits a grid 212 for
      swirling the rinsing agent at the exit from the distributor space
      210. Through a gap 214 between the shield element 100 and the
      entrance window 18, the detergent reaches the interior 20. A
      surface 216 of the inner insulation 66 is arranged so that the
      entry of the detergent into the interior 20 of the pressure vessel
      12 is not hindered.<br>
      <br>
      [0090]<br>
      In an alternative embodiment (not shown in the drawing) supply
      channels for detergent in the cavity 98 and the detergent can pass
      through interruptions in the adhesive layer 94 in the interior 20
      of the pressure vessel 12 pass.<br>
      <br>
      [0091]<br>
      As rinsing agent in particular a steam-free purge gas is used. In
      particular, the purge gas is conducted over the adhesive layer 94
      or through the adhesive layer 94 so that it is actively cooled.<br>
      <br>
      [0092]<br>
      Furthermore, a flushing device 218 is provided for flushing a
      surface of the entrance window 18 facing the exterior. For this
      purpose, supply channels 220 are arranged between the aperture
      insert part 30 and the end face 32 of the front flange 14, which
      continue into a foot region 36 of the entry window 18. A feed
      channel 220 opens via a nozzle 222 in a space behind the aperture
      28th For example, a supply channel 220 may be formed as an annular
      channel or circumferentially distributed tubes or tubes or the
      like may be provided. Via the flushing device 218, the inlet
      window 18 can be acted upon with rinsing agent in the space 224
      (FIG. 1) which is open to the atmosphere, and in particular
      thermally particularly stressed areas of the inlet window can be
      specifically blown and thus cooled separately. It can be cleaned
      in this way, the entrance window 18 of impurities such as dust.<br>
      <br>
      [0093]<br>
      Conveniently, it is provided that the front flange 14 is formed
      elastically deformable at least in the region of the support
      surface 72. In this way, unevenness of this support surface 72 can
      be compensated. <br>
      <br>
      When not level bearing surface, the problem arises that in the
      entrance window 18 voltage spikes can be present. By ensuring an
      elastic deformability of the front flange 14, such voltage peaks
      can be reduced and thus the risk of breakage for the entrance
      window 18 can be reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0094]<br>
      It is particularly provided that the support surface 72 has a
      slight inclination in the radial direction transverse to the
      entrance window axis 24 in the pressureless state of the pressure
      vessel 12. When pressure load in the operating state with an
      appropriate design of such an inclined support surface 72 then
      this, when an elastic deformation occurs, again substantially
      perpendicular to the entrance window axis 24th<br>
      <br>
      [0095]<br>
      In particular, it is provided that in the operating state of the
      radiation receiver 10, the deflection of the front flange 14 at
      the bearing surface is at least greater than 2. 10 &lt;-4&gt; the
      boiler diameter. For example, with an internal pressure of 15 bar
      and a bowl diameter of 1 m, the deflection should be more than 0.3
      mm.<br>
      <br>
      [0096]<br>
      The radiation receiver 10 according to the invention functions as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0097]<br>
      Highly concentrated solar radiation 16 is coupled via the entrance
      window 18 into the interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12 and heats
      the absorber 38 there. The working medium introduced via the flow
      space 46 heats up and passes through the inlet absorber 40, is
      thereby preheated and then passes through the outlet absorber 50
      for the final heating. In the variant shown in FIG. 1, a partial
      flow 62 is branched off and returned by an outlet flow 52.<br>
      <br>
      [0098]<br>
      By pressurizing the working medium, a window foot diameter of the
      entrance window 18 is reduced. Due to the heating, the front
      flange 14 expands. Furthermore, the front flange 14 warps under
      pressure and under heating, so that the parallelism between the
      end face 74 of the entrance window 18 and the support surface 72
      is deteriorated. This creates mechanical stresses and in
      particular bending stresses in the entrance window 18 and in
      particular in the foot region 36 there.<br>
      <br>
      [0099]<br>
      According to the invention, these stresses are at least partially
      degradable in that a movement of the entrance window 18 on the
      sliding layer 78 is made possible. In particular, the invention
      ensures that the entrance window 18 does not slide on the seal 76,
      but just on the defined location of the sliding layer 78th<br>
      <br>
      [0100]<br>
      About the flushing device 204, the pressurized side of the inlet
      window 18 can be rinsed and cooled and the flushing device 280,
      the atmosphere-facing side of the entrance window 18 can be
      flushed and cooled. The adhesive layer 94 can be cooled via the
      coolant channel 202, which can also be cooled by means of the
      flushing device 204.<br>
      <br>
      [0101]<br>
      A second embodiment of a bearing device according to the
      invention, which is designated in FIG. 3 as a whole by 226, is
      basically the same as described above. The same components
      therefore bear the same reference numerals. A retaining ring 228
      as a holding element for the inlet window 18 is clamped on the
      inner wall 82 of the front flange 14 is held. The retaining ring
      228 has an annular trough portion 230, on which radially outwardly
      with respect to the entrance window axis 24, a tab 232 is seated.
      By means of this tab 232, the retaining ring 228 between the
      clamping ring 86 and the inner wall 82 of the front flange 14 is
      clamped. For fluid-tight sealing, a seal 234, for example in the
      form of an O-ring, is arranged between the tab 232 and the inner
      wall 82.<br>
      <br>
      [0102]<br>
      The trough portion 230 of the retaining ring 228 is positioned in
      the recess 70 of the front flange 14. The trough portion 230
      itself has an annular groove 236 which serves to form a storage
      bed 238 for supporting the entrance window 18 in the retaining
      ring 228. For this purpose, a bearing bed material 240 is arranged
      in the groove 236 between the entrance window 18 and the retaining
      ring 228, which is deformable and in particular elastically
      deformable to allow movement of the entrance window 18 in the
      bearing bed 238 transverse to the entrance window axis 24 relative
      to the front flange 14. Further, bedding material 240 is disposed
      on a floor 242 of the channel 236 so that the entrance window 18
      rests on bedding material 240.<br>
      <br>
      [0103]<br>
      The bedding material is a material which has a high (compressive)
      modulus of elasticity parallel to the entrance window axis 24 and
      a low shear modulus transverse thereto. In particular, the bedding
      material 240 has an adhesive effect to provide additional adhesive
      fixation of the entrance window 18 to the retainer ring 228. To
      produce a positive connection between the bed material 240 and the
      trough portion 230 of this is provided with an example,
      circumferential undercut 244, can penetrate into the bed material.<br>
      <br>
      [0104]<br>
      For example, high-temperature silicone 240 is used as the bearing
      bed material.<br>
      <br>
      [0105]<br>
      In order to prevent the bedding material 240 from escaping and in
      particular extruding out of the channel 236, it may be provided
      that a cover, for example in the form of a ring, is arranged above
      the fill level of the bedding material 240 in the channel 236 (not
      shown in the figure). ,<br>
      <br>
      [0106]<br>
      The elastic bearing bed material 240 assumes a holding function
      for the entrance window 18 in the retaining ring 228, d. H. fixes
      the entrance window, allows movements of the entrance window 18 in
      particular transversely to the entrance window axis 24 so as to be
      able to break down shear stresses in the entrance window 18, seals
      the interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12 from the outside and due
      to its elastic deformability is uneven at the bottom 242 and the
      end face 74 of the entrance window 18, so that voltage peaks in
      the entrance window 18, which may be caused by such bumps, are
      largely avoided or at least reduced and partially reduced. By the
      storage of the entrance window 18 in the storage bed 238, the
      tightness of the interior 20 with respect to the exterior space is
      ensured even in the unpressurized state of the pressure vessel 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0107]<br>
      To protect against heat radiation from the interior 20 of the
      pressure vessel 12, as described in connection with FIG. 2,
      shielding elements for the bearing bed material 240 may be
      arranged.<br>
      <br>
      [0108]<br>
      Incidentally, the bearing device 226 functions as the bearing
      device 68 described in connection with FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0109]<br>
      In a third embodiment of a bearing device according to the
      invention, which is designated in FIG. 4 as a whole by 246, a
      distributor ring 248 is positively connected in the interior 20 of
      the pressure vessel 12 to the front flange 14. This distribution
      ring 248 is substantially the same structure as the clamping ring
      86 according to the first and the second embodiment of a bearing
      device according to the invention and serves to distribute the
      detergent, but it does not act as a clamping device for a holding
      element.<br>
      <br>
      [0110]<br>
      In the bearing device 246 according to the invention, a holding
      element 250 is provided for fixing the inlet window 18, which is
      connected to the front flange 14 outside the interior 20 of the
      pressure vessel 12. <br>
      <br>
      In a variant of an embodiment, the holding element 250 comprises
      an annular portion 252, for example, which is arranged in the
      space 224. This section is followed by a widening annular portion
      254, which is <br>
      <br>
      adapted to the end face 32 of the front flange 14 and adjoins
      this. This section 240 is followed by an annular strap section
      256, which rests against an outer wall 258 of the front flange 14
      and which is connected to the front flange 14 in a form-fitting
      manner, for example by means of a screw connection 260. As a
      result, the holding element 250 is held on the front flange 14. It
      can be provided that the portion 254 is connected to the end face
      32, for example by gluing or by a positive connection.<br>
      <br>
      [0111]<br>
      The annular portions 252, 254 and 256 are formed, for example, by
      spaced tabs which are bendable. During assembly, the entrance
      window 18 can then be placed on the front flange 14, and for the
      final positioning and in particular fixation of the entrance
      window 18, the tabs of the sections 252, 254 and 256 are bent into
      their holding position.<br>
      <br>
      [0112]<br>
      In the recess 70 of the front flange 14, the inlet window 18 is
      mounted on the seal 76 on a sliding layer 78, as has already been
      described in connection with the first embodiment of a storage
      device according to the invention shown in FIG.<br>
      <br>
      [0113]<br>
      Between the retaining ring 228 and an outer surface 262 of the
      entrance window 18, which faces the outer space, sits an adhesive
      layer 264 for fixing the entrance window 18 to the support member
      250th <br>
      <br>
      The adhesive layer 264 thus sits in the outer space and not as in
      the storage device 68 in the interior 20 of the pressure vessel
      12th This arrangement of the adhesive layer 264, the accessibility
      to this layer from the outside is possible and it is avoided that
      the adhesive layer 264 comes into contact with the working fluid,
      which is passed through the interior 20 of the pressure vessel 12.
      Also, the thermal stress of the adhesive layer 264 is reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0114 <br>
      By a shield member 266 such as a ceramic cord, the adhesive layer
      264 is shielded from heat radiation, so as to protect them from
      overheating.<br>
      <br>
      [0115]<br>
      The retaining member 250 may also include a plurality of
      circumferentially spaced retaining plates. In a variant of one
      embodiment, the retaining element 250 is integrated into the
      aperture insert part 30.<br>
      <br>
      [0116]<br>
      Otherwise, the bearing device 246 according to the invention
      functions as already described above in connection with the
      further embodiments of a bearing device according to the
      invention.<br>
