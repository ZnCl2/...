      <p>A method of producing energy is described. The method comprises
        providing a container for receiving an electrolyte composition,
        a cathode and an anode. An electrolyte composition is formed
        comprising deuterium oxide and an ionizable acid. A sufficient
        amount of the electrolyte composition is placed in the container
        to at least partially cover a cathode made from a metal selected
        from the group consisting of nonhydride forming metals and to at
        least partially cover an inert anode situated inside the
        container. The cathode and anode are connected to a source of
        electricity and a voltage is applied across the cathode and
        anode. The present invention can be used to reprucibly produce
        heat energy. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>Aspects of the present invention include a
        non-metal, a hydrogen absorbing metal, a selected isotope to be
        exposed to ions of hydrogen or ions of isotopes of hydrogen, and
        a hydrogen source. The hydrogen source can be an electrolytic
        solution, a gas or plasma. In some embodiments the hydrogen
        absorbing metal covers the non-metal to form a microsphere. The
        hydrogen absorbing metal is positioned to contact the hydrogen
        source. Further, the hydrogen absorbing metal can be made of
        multiple layers of dissimilar metals with different Fermi energy
        levels. The multiple layers of metals have interfaces where
        swimming electron layers exist. Interfaces between the
        non-metal, hydrogen absorbing metal, and the hydrogen source
        also exist with swimming electron layers. The selected isotope
        is placed in these regions of swimming electron layers to be
        exposed to the ions of hydrogen and its isotopes from the
        hydrogen source. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>Several layers of different elements, alloys
        or cpds. are generated by sputtering process using deuterium,
        and at least some have high absorption capacity for hydrogen or
        its isotopes. The layers can be of titanium, iron, palladium,
        zircon etc., with intermediate layers of silicon or other
        non-metallic material increasing the adhesiveness. The layer
        surfaces can be roughened, either by prodn. process or further
        mechanical, electrical or chemical action. For atomic sputtering
        deuterium can be used, and mixts. with argon or heavier inert
        gases, also further deuterium-ion sources during and after the
        sputtering process. <i>Advantage</i> - Improved penetration of
        lighter deuterium particles into metal deposited layer. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>In an arrangement for prodn. of cold fusion,
        with liberation of energy, layers of at least two different
        metals with high absorption for deuterium are produced. Pref.
        combinations of Pd, Ti, Ta, V, Tl, Zr, Ce, Th, Fe, Co, and Ni
        are used. Alloys of these elements can be used, where alloy
        concn. is constant or vanes in a controlled way with distance
        from the interface. Layers are formed by molecular beam epitaxy
        in ultra-high vacuum. ADVANTAGE - Reproducibility of energy
        generation. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>Source uses host materials for storing high
        concns. of deuterium (D2) in layers, in the form of a laminate
        of chemically different materials. Pref. materials are Fe, Co,
        Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt, Ti, Zr, Hf or the elements
        immediately adjacent to these. Xe135 is included in concn. of up
        to 10%. The materials are in thin films or plates and D2 is
        introduced between them in gas form or electrolytically opt.
        with applied electric field. The supply of D2 and/or abstraction
        of the thermal energy generated is controlled. USE/ADVANTAGE -
        D2 between layers of material minimises deterioration of the
        surfaces, esp. contamination, in cold fusion reactors. The
        generator can give an energy of 100 kW/cc. Its size can be
        varied widely, from large generators to small sources in houses
        or cars. For a car used for a few hrs. a day, ca. 10-100 g
        D2/year are needed. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>The invention relates to a method and an
        arrangement in which nuclear reactions can be brought about in a
        condensed (solid or liquid) material (cold fusion), which
        reactions do not in any case have to be identical with the
        normal reactions of nuclear fusion at high temperatures in a
        plasma and which are generated in that isotopes of hydrogen at
        high concentration are taken up in the condensed material.
        According to the invention, for a concentrated generation of
        energy or for an intensive generation of radioactive radiation,
        a large surface of the condensed material, maintained
        particularly clean according to the invention, is used. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>The invention relates to a method and an
        arrangement in which nuclear reactions can be brought about in a
        condensed (solid or liquid) material (cold fusion), which
        reactions do not in any case have to be identical with the
        normal reactions of nuclear fusion at high temperatures in a
        plasma and which are generated in that isotopes of hydrogen at
        high concentration are taken up in the condensed material.
        According to the invention, for a concentrated generation of
        energy or for an intensive generation of radioactive radiation,
        a large surface of the condensed material, maintained

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> <i>Problem</i>: To produce a positron
        emission isotope M through controllable nuclear reaction by
        performing electrolysis of an electrolytic system, e.g. a gas
        phase containing a simple substance gas, compound molecules or
        ions, water, a waste water solvent or an electrolyte of fused
        salt using an electrode causing normal temperature nuclear
        fusion chain reaction. <i>Solution</i>: When a light water
        solution of carbonate of Li Na, K, Rb or Cs having a specified
        concentration is subjected electrolysis using a porous Ni
        electrode causing normal temperature nuclear fusion chain
        reaction and emitted ? -rays are observed through a germanium ?
        -ray spectral analyzer, the peak is increased at 510keV in any
        solution, for example. The peak is a ? -ray of 510keV being
        emitted at the time of 'positron annihilation' of Cu64. Through
        electrolysis in such a reaction system, even the metal of
        electrode material reacts on a nucleon or the like generated
        through the reaction of electrolysis and thereby a nuclear
        conversion takes place. Conditions of electrolysis can be
        controlled accurately by controlling the current and only a
        target substance can be produced accurately. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> <i>Problem</i>: To obtain an electrode for
        cold nuclear fusion which can manufacture isotopes, precious
        metals, rare elements or thermal energy through nuclear
        transformation by containing as a material for the electrode a
        substance which can cause nuclear transformation. <i>Solution</i>:
        Radioactive or nonradioactive isotopes are manufactured by the
        nuclear transformation in an electrode and the combination of
        nuclear reactions such as neutron capture and natural nuclear
        disintegration of products made through the nuclear reactions.
        The kinds of manufactured isotopes are very numerous, and it is
        especially easy to obtain non-single isotopes. Since the
        conditions of electrolysis can be controlled very precisely, it
        is possible to manufacture only target substances precisely. For
        an electrode for cold nuclear fusion, an element whose atomic
        number is close to that of a precious metal or a rare element is
        chosen as a substance which can cause nuclear transformation, or
        a material for the nuclear transformation of a precious metal
        and a rare element. For example, W, Ag, Sn and Pt are cited as
        materials for platinum-family metals and gold. As materials for
        rare elements, chemical species such as the halogen family,
        alkaline metals, Po and W are chosen. </p>
