          <div align="left"> Disclosed is a radioactive waste treatment
            process for transmuting long-lived radioisotopes into
            short-lived radioisotopes through applied nuclear physics.
            Nuclear reactions, specifically of the (gamma, n) type, also
            known as photodisintegration, are utilized to accomplish
            this transmutation from troublesome, long-lived radioactive
            waste isotope(s) of given atomic mass to shorter-lived or
            stable materials of lower atomic mass, by exposing the
            troublesome isotopes to a high energy photon flux for a
            sustained time. Generally speaking, the target nucleus of
            the radioisotope(s) to be treated is irradiated by gamma
            photons of an energy greater than the binding energy of the
            neutron in the target nucleus. This causes the irradiated
            nucleus to absorb the gamma rays, thereby placing the
            nucleus in an excited state. Upon relaxation, the nucleus
            ejects a neutron through the (gamma, n) reaction, thereby
            transmuting the element to an isotope of lower atomic mass
            and shorter half-life<br>

            A method for generating high energy 32He particles includes
            the steps of accumulating protons and deuterons in intimate
            contact with a lattice structure storage member and
            repeatedly reacting one proton and one deuteron to produce
            32He particles and excess energy greater than 6 MeV for each
            of the 32He particles. A method for controlling an energy
            production reaction of isotopic hydrogen atoms includes
            steps for storing a first isotope of hydrogen and a second
            isotope of hydrogen in contact with a lattice structure to
            produce a first ratio of the first isotope to the second
            from a mixture having a second ratio of the first isotope to
            the second isotope, adjusting the energy of the lattice
            structure to initiate the energy production reaction caused
            by the interaction of one nucleus of the first isotope with
            one nucleus of the second isotope and controlling the second
            ratio to control the rate of the energy production reaction
            based on the interaction of the first isotope with the

            A method for transmuting spent fuel from a nuclear reactor
            includes the step of separating the waste into components
            including a driver fuel component and a transmutation fuel
            component. The driver fuel, which includes fissile materials
            such as Plutonium.sup.239, is used to initiate a critical,
            fission reaction in a reactor. The transmutation fuel, which
            includes non-fissile transuranic isotopes, is transmuted by
            thermal neutrons generated during fission of the driver
            fuel. The system is designed to promote fission of the
            driver fuel and reduce neutron capture by the driver fuel.
            Reacted driver fuel is separated into transuranics and
            fission products using a dry cleanup process and the
            resulting transuranics are mixed with transmutation fuel and

            (long-lived FP nuclides such as technetium-99 or iodine-129)
            which was produced in the nuclear reactor. Wire-type members
            of a long-lived radioactive material comprised of metals,
            alloys or compounds including long-lived FP nuclides are
            surrounded by a moderator material and installed in cladding
            tubes to form FP pins. The FP pins, and nothing else, are
            housed in a wrapper tube to form a transmutation assembly.
            The wire-type members can be replaced by thin ring-type
            members. The transmutation assemblies can be selectively and
            at least partly loaded into a core region, a blanket region

            relates to field of liquid radioactive wastes recycling.
            Long-living radionuclides are isolated from nitric acid
            solution of used nuclear fuel (UNF) into solid phase in form
            of acetates, oxides and other compounds, which do not

            The invention discloses a solution reactor used for the
            plutonium combustion and the neptunium-237 or the
            americium-241 transmutation. The solution reactor adopts
            plutonium or plutonium and americium in the spent fuel of
            the nuclear power plant as the fuel, and adopts
            neptunium-237 or americium-241 as the target. By adopting
            the solution reactor, the minor actinides which have long
            half life and high toxicity and can not be stored for a long
            time, such as the neptunium-237 or the americium-241, can be
            changed into nuclides with short half life and low toxicity
            through transmutation. Because the solution reactor adopts
            the spent fuel and can generate electricity at the low
            temperature, the cost-effectiveness and the security are
            high; the neutron provided by the plutonium combustion can

            An apparatus and method is described for transmuting higher
            actinides, plutonium and selected fission products in a
            liquid-fuel subcritical assembly. Uranium may also be
            enriched, thereby providing new fuel for use in conventional
            nuclear power plants. An accelerator provides the additional
            neutrons required to perform the processes. The size of the
            accelerator needed to complete fuel cycle closure depends on
            the neutron efficiency of the supported reactors and on the
            neutron spectrum of the actinide transmutation apparatus.
            Treatment of spent fuel from light water reactors (LWRs)
            using uranium-based fuel will require the largest
            accelerator power, whereas neutron-efficient high
            temperature gas reactors (HTGRs) or CANDU reactors will
            require the smallest accelerator power, especially if
            thorium is introduced into the newly generated fuel
            according to the teachings of the present invention. Fast
            spectrum actinide transmutation apparatus (based on
            liquid-metal fuel) will take full advantage of the
            accelerator-produced source neutrons and provide maximum
            utilization of the actinide-generated fission neutrons.
            However, near-thermal transmutation apparatus will require
            lower standing inventories of plutonium and higher
            actinides. Uranium, presently the largest volume constituent
            in nuclear waste, is fully utilized and not discharged as
            waste. Since no plutonium, higher actinides or fission
            products are present in the reconstituted fuel elements, the
            present processes can be used repeatedly. Since the
            performance of the existing reactors is not changed, full
            utilization of both thorium and uranium resources is

            including a driver fuel component and a transmutation fuel
            component. The driver fuel, which includes fissile materials
            such as Plutonium&lt;239&gt;, is used to initiate a
            critical, fission reaction in a reactor. The transmutation
            fuel, which includes non-fissile transuranic isotopes, is
            transmuted by thermal neutrons generated during fission of
            the driver fuel. The system is designed to promote fission
            of the driver fuel and reduce neutron capture by the driver
            fuel. Reacted driver fuel is separated into transuranics and
            fission products using a dry cleanup process and the
            resulting transuranics are mixed with transmutation fuel and
            re-introduced into the reactor.; Transmutation fuel from the
            reactor is introduced into a second reactor for further
            transmutation by neutrons generated using a proton beam and
            spallation target.<br>

            to provide particles whereof the kinetic energy is

            The invention is a plasma torch for insertion through an

            plasma torch of the invention is characterized by comprising
            a coaxial sleeve having an upper end and a lower end. The
            sleeve surrounds at least the portion of the outer surface
            of the torch that is located in the opening, thereby forming
            an insulating chamber between the outer surface if the torch
            and the inner surface of the sleeve. At least a portion of
            the portion of the coaxial sleeve that surrounds at least
            the portion of the outer surface of the torch that is
            located in the opening in the wall of the processing chamber
            is porous or permeable to a heat exchanging fluid. The torch
            comprises an inlet for introducing the heat exchanging fluid

            inserted through the opening, a gap exists between the
            processing chamber wall and the coaxial sleeve. Thus the

            A material is exposed to a neutron flux by distributing it
            in a neutron-diffusing medium surrounding a neutron source.
            The diffusing medium is transparent to neutrons and so
            arranged that neutron scattering substantially enhances the
            neutron flux to which the material is exposed. Such enhanced
            neutron exposure may be used to produce useful
            radioisotopes, in particular for medical applications, from
            the transmutation of readily-available isotopes included in
            the exposed material. It may also be used to efficiently
            transmute long-lived radioactive wastes, such as those
            recovered from spent nuclear fuel. The use of heavy
            elements, such as lead and/or bismuth, as the diffusing
            medium is particularly of interest, since it results in a
            slowly decreasing scan through the neutron energy spectrum,

            Abstract -- A new transmutation assembly permits an
            efficient transmutation of a long-lived radioactive material
            (long-lived FP nuclides such as technetium-99 or iodine-129)
            which was produced in the nuclear reactor. Wire-type members
            of a long-lived radioactive material comprised of metals,
            alloys or compounds including long-lived FP nuclides are
            surrounded by a moderator material and installed in cladding
            tubes to form FP pins. The FP pins, and nothing else, are
            housed in a wrapper tube to form a transmutation assembly.
            The wire-type members can be replaced by thin ring-type
            members. The transmutation assemblies can be selectively and
            at least partly loaded into a core region, a blanket region
            or a shield region of a reactor core in a fast reactor. From
            a viewpoint of reducing the influence on the reactor core
            characteristics, it is optimal to load the transmutation
            assemblies into the blanket region.<br>

            using an intense accelerator-generated thermal neutron flux.
            High thermal neutron fluxes generated from the action of a
            high power proton accelerator on a spallation target allows
            the efficient burn-up of higher actinide nuclear waste by a
            two-step process. Additionally, rapid burn-up of fission
            product waste for nuclides having small thermal neutron
            cross sections, and the practicality of small material
            inventories while achieving significant throughput derive
            from employment of such high fluxes. Several nuclear
            technology problems are addressed including 1. nuclear
            energy production without a waste stream requiring storage
            on a geological timescale, 2. the burn-up of defense and
            commercial nuclear waste, and 3. the production of defense
            nuclear material. The apparatus includes an accelerator, a
            target for neutron production surrounded by a blanket region
            for transmutation, a turbine for electric power production,
            and a chemical processing facility. In all applications, the
            accelerator power may be generated internally from fission
            and the waste produced thereby is transmuted internally so
            that waste management might not be required beyond the human
            lifespan. <br>

            The present invention addresses the problems outlined above.
            An accelerator based on a combination of a high repetition
            rate high energy pulsed power supply (RHEPP) and a
            magnetically-injected anode plasma (MAP) source diode is
            used to provide pulsed particle beams having intermediate
            energy (0.2-20 MeV) and average power levels of hundreds of
            kilowatts to megawatts. This will increase the rate of
            isotopic production by 2-3 orders of magnitude over
            processes based on conventional accelerators. Any gaseous
            ion can be accelerated with this technology (proton,
            deuteron, and helium beams are of special interest). This
            capability can be applied to transmute target nuclei
            selectively into desired isotopes. RHEPP/MAP accelerators
            are also extremely power efficient and relatively small in
            size, making application of small units practical in, for
            example, major local or regional medical facilities.
            Finally, the use of relatively low beam particle energies
            reduces or eliminates the problem of undesired products and
            the subsequent generation of radioactive waste. Although the
            invention is being discussed in terms of embodiment via the
            RHEPP/MAP system, any pulsed ion beam generator having
            sufficient ion kinetic energy and total average beam current
            can be used in the same manner.<br>

            Accelerated decay of radioactive materials is used for power
            production. In the method of this invention an
            alpha-emitting radioactive material is placed in a region.
            The region is selected so that when a negative potential is
            applied to the region, enhanced alpha decay of the
            radioactive material results. The energy of the alpha decay
            particles is captured and converted to thermal energy.<br>

            isotopes. Substance: transmutation of long-living
            radioactive isotopes into short-living or stable ones is
            conducted under the action of electromagnetic radiation. In
            the process, highly ionized atoms with energy- resolved hole
            of accelerated beta-decay are produced from atoms of
            long-living radioactive isotope and held in ionized state
            until transmutation of mother nuclei to daughter
            short-living or stable ones takes place. With coefficient of
            operating time k preset for daughter nuclei, atoms of
            long-living radioactive isotope are held in highly ionized
            state for at least time beta, where beta is lifetime of
            mother nuclei under accelerated beta-decay conditions.
            Electromagnetic radiation may be effected by beams of
