      <p><b>by James Allen</b> </p>
      <p>He could drive it, but he was not allowed to sell any, or
        manufacture his discovery in the State of Tennessee. Why not? </p>
      <p>Herman's special patented sparkplugs, similar to Stan Meyer's
        plugs. </p>
      <p>Herman has consulted with Nasa and the US Airforce on some of
        our country's most important Top Secret Projects including the
        first US satellite in space, the SR-71 Blackbird, the Stealth
        Fighter/Bomber and Starwars. Herman worked closely with Dr.
        Wernher von Braun testing hydrogen powered rocket engines, and
        he also worked with engineers at the now famous Skunk Works, the
        Jet Propulsion Laboratory, JPL, and Cal Tech. While in the Air
        Force during WWII, Herman served as a fighter pilot, a flight
        instructor and bombardier trainer. He was certified in and flew
        23 different airplanes during this period. </p>
      <p>Herman believed in a Hydrogen Future and FREE fuel! </p>
      <p>Herman's 1971 Ford LTD converted to run on hydrogen or
        gasoline, on display in the Water Fuel Museum in Lexington, KY.
        In a video interview with the inventor, he explains that ambient
        air is mixed with hydrogen (not oxygen) and a micron-sized fog
        of water mist (to mimic gasoline's burn), introduced in the same
        way propane gas is on a propane conversion. In fact, the LP
        regulator and LP aircleaner assembly are the same as on a
        propane vehicle. The butterfly in the carb, as in an LP system,
        now serves as the intake air control. The rest of the function
        of the gasoline carb is not used. He claimed greater power than
        gasoline, and 38 miles per gallon of water. As far as quantity
        of hydrogen produced, he produced enough gas from his
        electrolytic chamber to need a cut-off switch connected to a
        pressure gauge to stop gas production when it was no longer
        needed while driving. In other words, instead of producing more
        or less gas on demand, as some systems do, it appears his system
        always produced the same amount, but was turned on and off as
        needed. He emphasized that deuterium (heavy water) was essential
        to his approach, doubling the density of the hydrogen, making it
        twice as powerful. He also used high voltage, 70,000 volts to be
        exact, from two custom-made coils, to effect rapid separation of
        the component gases, a process which he calls 'radiolysis.' The
        70,000 volts constitute what he calls a 'soft' x-ray, not
        radioactive but in need of shielding, in-between a microwave
        oven and a 'hard' x-ray. He was authorized by the state of
        Tennessee to drive his car as they recognized that he knew what
        he was doing with such technology. I view his prototype LTD as
        good proof of a watercar for those who doubt that the technology
        is even possible, but not necessarily the best approach for you
        and me to pursue. He accomplished his invention along the lines
        of his expertise, the field of ionics; others have approached it
        differently with less controversial technology and have been
        equally successful. </p>
      <p><i>My thoughts about Herman</i> </p>
      <p>Herman's 1978 Fort LTD came to be known as The Green Machine.
        Using a modified propane carburetor, Herman converted the LTD to
        run on hydrogen in 1980. Due to the low mass energy density of
        hydrogen, Herman was only able to get a little more than half
        power from the engine with this traditional induction system. </p>
      <p>Because Herman only used a single cell, I believe you need to
        do the 3 cells hooked up in series like Archie Blue, Dingel's
        and Peter's design. Use - 3 - 4"dia. SS tubes , 8" long (cells)
        welded together. Put your series of SS plates inside each cell.
        gas lines coming out the top through a check value to the bottom
        of the next cell. Use rubber caps ends with hose clamps so if it
        ever blows it just blows the caps off and the water is drained
        and your mild explosion is over with. </p>
      <p>You need more molecules of hydrogen clustered together as they
        pass thru 3 cells then into the IMPCO propane fuel injection
        carburetor. In gasoline SAE words a higher octane of hydrogen
        (ortho hydrogen) before it enters the fuel injection chamber.
        first H2 and O, then H4 and O2 then H8 and O4?? Who is the
        mathematician here? I'm not him. Peter can tell you. </p>
      <p>There is para-hydrogen and ortho-hydrogen molecules.
        Ortho-hydrogen molecules will cluster and stick together, as
        they pass through 3 cells or more they cluster together more and
        more, their proton travels in the same direction, when finally
        sent to the combustion chamber they have 2-1/2 times the
        explosive power than gasoline! </p>
      <p>Para-hydrogen are hydrogen molecules that will run together but
        have repelling protons to each other, therefore the clustering
        does not happen, they are less combustive than ortho-hydrogen.
        If you produce ortho hydrogen, then this also creates deuterium
        in which is what you want. deuterium build up on the cylinder
        walls, values helps oxidation from happening. </p>
      <p>Now Stan used one tall wide cell with 3 tubes inside one large
        tube. 12" diva. and about 24" tall. Go look at his files. </p>
      <p>To increase the power of the hydrogen, he irradiated it making
        deuterium. The extra proton was more than enough to allow the
        engine to achieve full power. It is good to get Deuterium built
        up in your piston walls, from the hydrogen so the water exhaust
        will not rust out the motor. They say AMSCO synthetic oil helps
        deal with the water in the oil better, helps it vaporize the
        water molecules. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, state officials decided the radioactive source
        under the hood would not be safe for widespread use. They did
        however allow Herman to continue driving the car and he put
        nearly 30, 000 miles on the car running on hydrogen. Realizing
        the technology could be improved, Herman went back to the
        drawing board. </p>
      <p>It is kinda of ironic in that is exactly what a Ballard fuel
        cell is also doing, when in use in the new Hybrid Cars. The
        Ballard Fuel Cell is radioactively produce hydrogen to burn
        mixed with the air and the gasoline. The new hybrid cars are
        just as safe, except they use 1/2 gas and 1/2 electric. The
        Hybrids also contain radioactive batteries. The only difference
        was Herman's Wonderful car ran for FREE and with the new hybrid
        cars, you still have to PURCHASE the GASOLINE. </p>
      <p>Yes the Mean Green Dancing Herman Machine was in the heart of
        every reader passing by with a BRAIN. Addicted to oil you drive
        to work, paying the largest corp. the largest profit in American
        history ever! Last quarter of 2004's profit from Exxon/Mobil
        exceeded the record for the largest quarter profit of 8 billion
        dollars. We are all guilty, unless you walk to work ride a bike,
        or enjoy an electric train. </p>
      <p>The Green Machine also employed onboard electrolysis, meaning
        that to fill the gas tank, Herman would pour in distilled water.
      </p>
      <p>and a little se cert Electrolyte KOH (1-5% solution to water,
        is all) </p>
      <p>Yes there is a car that "runs on water." The car is now parked
        in the research facilities at MTSU. </p>
      <p>Just like the TESLA statue at Niagara Falls, NY, it is way off
        to the side. And Edison's bust is real big in the middle with
        lights shinning on him. and he didn't even invent AC
        electricity, he was angry with Tesla's invention of AC, because
        it made his DC look non efficient. Today in all our households,
        we use AC electricity. It could have also been FREE wireless
        electricity. J.P. Morgan quit funding Tesla's FREE electricity
        Tower, because he could not find where to put the meter. </p>
      <p>Next 10,000 people with water powered cars can join the STAN
        MEYERS 10.000 DUNE BUGGY PLANET MARATHON CLUB. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract </b>-- The internal combustion engine fuel system
        described includes a structure for mixing the alternative fuel,
        preferably hydrogen, with oxygen in ambient air to stratify the
        fuel. The system includes an adapter, and the adapter includes a
        housing mounted between spark plug and cylinder of the internal
        combustion engine. A plug is placed within the housing. The plug
        has ridges or grooves on its outer surface that act as mixing
        structures. Thus, when hydrogen is introduced into the adapter
        housing it is mixed with ambient oxygen within the chamber as it
        flows over the plug. The mixing structures in the housing create
        a vortexing action as the hydrogen flows over the plug and
        towards the cylinder of the engine. An electrode protrudes from
        the plug towards the cylinder. The electrode is preferably
        platinum and generates the necessary spark to create combustion
        of the hydrogen/air mixture adjacent to the cylinder to thereby
        power the cylinder in the engine. A platinum electrode is
        preferably used because it enhances a catalytic conversion of
        combustion by-products to more environmentally compatible
        products. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates generally to a fuel system for
        internal combustion engines that enables the invention to
        utilize alternative fuels; and, more particularly to an improved
        fuel system for an internal combustion engine and an adapter for
        use in same. </p>
      <p>The problems of air pollution caused by automobiles, lawn
        mowers and other vehicles that have internal combustion engines
        powered by gasoline is well documented. This problem is
        particularly described in an article in the San Diego Union
        Tribune, Wednesday, Sep. 25, 1996 and in Popular Science,
        August, 1996. Indeed, under the Clean Air Act, in the next few
        years cars that do not run on standard fossil fuels like
        gasoline will be required in several states. Currently, there
        are no vehicles available to meet this need. </p>
      <p>Thus, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that
        there has been a push to seek other fuels for use in internal
        combustion engines. These fuels include methane, propane and
        gasohol. </p>
      <p>Hydrogen has also been characterized as a promising fuel
        source. See Department of Energy publication entitled "Hydrogen
        Fuel", printed in 1978, U.S. Government Printing Office, U.S.
        Department of Energy, Office of Public Affairs, Washington, D.C.
        20585. Particularly, the graph presented in FIG. 6, which is
        copied from this publication, shows the potential for hydrogen
        in BTUs/Lb. However, the mass energy density for hydrogen is
        low; and thus, hydrogen needs to be compressed before its energy
        potential can be realized. No prior art fuel system has been
        able to capture the energy of hydrogen. </p>
      <p>Several fuel systems for use with hydrogen have been proposed.
        Examples are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,167,919; 4,253,428;
        4,016,836; 4,178,882; 5,222,993; 5,085,176; and 5,085,176. The
        problem with these prior art fuel systems is they cannot can
        take advantage of the alternative fuels to generate sufficient
        power from the fuels to drive an internal combustion engine for
        use in a lawn mower, automobile or other vehicle. As noted
        above, this is a particular problem when hydrogen is used as a
        fuel. Additionally, the prior art systems do not address the
        problem of back fire, i.e. undesired explosion of the fuel in
        the cylinder during the exhaust stroke of the internal
        combustion engine. </p>
      <p>What is needed, then, is a fuel system for an internal
        combustion engine that provides a way to generate sufficient
        power from the alternative fuels and that reduces backfire
        problems. Such a system is lacking in the prior art. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of this invention to provide an improved fuel
        system for use with alternative fuels. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of this invention to provide an improved
        fuel system for use particularly with hydrogen, and particularly
        to enhance the mass energy density of hydrogen. </p>
      <p>It is still a further object of this invention to provide an
        adapter for use in a fuel system for an internal combustion
        engine that enhances the power obtained from the alternative
        fuels. </p>
      <p>It is still a further object of this invention to provide an
        improved fuel system for an internal combustion engine that does
        not present the environmental hazards of a standard gasoline
        engine by providing reduced or zero emission of environmentally
        harmful gases. </p>
      <p>It is yet a further object of this invention to provide an
        improved fuel system for an internal combustion engine that can
        use an alternative fuel and can use gasoline to facilitate the
        transition from gasoline to alternative fuels. </p>
      <p>It is yet a further object of this invention to provide an
        improved fuel system for an internal combustion engine that
        reduces backfire problems. </p>
      <p>It is yet a further object of this invention to provide an
        improved fuel system for an internal combustion engine that
        reduces backfire problems by cooling the electrode in the spark
        plug with the hydrogen gas fuel. </p>
      <p>It is still a further object of this invention to provide an
        adapter for use in a fuel system for an internal combustion
        engine that enhances the power obtained from the alternative
        fuels. </p>
      <p>It is yet a further object of this invention to provide a
        direct injection fuel system wherein fuel is injected directly
        into the cylinder. </p>
      <p>It is yet a further object of this invention to provide a way
        to convert the standard induction fuel system of a lawnmower to
        a direct injection fuel system wherein fuel is injected directly
        into the cylinder. </p>
      <p>It is yet a further object of this invention to provide a way
        to convert the indirect injection fuel system of an automobile
        to a direct injection fuel system wherein fuel is injected
        directly into the cylinder. </p>
      <p>The internal combustion engine fuel system of this invention
        includes a structure for mixing the alternative fuel, preferably
        hydrogen, with oxygen in ambient air to stratify the fuel. The
        term "alternative fuels" is known in the art and is meant to
        refer to fuels other than conventional gasoline. </p>
      <p>The invention comprises an adapter, the adapter including a
        housing mounted between spark plug and cylinder of the internal
        combustion engine. A plug is placed within the housing. The plug
        has ridges or grooves on its outer surface that act as mixing
        structures. Thus, when hydrogen is introduced into the adapter
        housing it is mixed with ambient oxygen within the chamber as it
        flows over the plug. The mixing structures on the plug create a
        vortexing action as the hydrogen flows over the plug and towards
        the cylinder of the engine. </p>
      <p>An electrode protrudes from the plug towards the cylinder. The
        electrode is preferably platinum and generates the necessary
        spark to create combustion of the hydrogen/air mixture adjacent
        to the cylinder to thereby power the cylinder in the engine. A
        platinum electrode is preferably used because it enhances a
        catalytic conversion of combustion by-products to more
        environmentally compatible products. </p>
      <p>Thus, the combination of the compression action generated by
        the conventional piston and push rod within the cylinder of the
        engine in conjunction with the hydrogen/air mixing structure
        that vortexes the hydrogen/air create compressed hydrogen that
        is mixed with a combustion facilitator, i.e. oxygen in the
        ambient air to enable the system of this invention to capture
        the abundant energy found in hydrogen fuel. </p>
      <p>The enhanced mixing capabilities of this invention is also
        adaptable for use with other alternative fuels such as natural
        gas, alcohol, propane and the like. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals
        refer to like parts throughout, the fuel system is referred to
        generally at 10. The fuel system of this invention is
        contemplated for use with an internal combustion power system,
        such as an internal combustion engine or such as a home heating
        system. Fuel system 10 is portrayed in this case as connected to
        a standard lawn mower. The lawn mower is shown in phantom at 12
        in FIG. 1. The lawn mower is a conventional lawn mower as can be
        purchased from a company such as Murray of Ohio. The internal
        combustion engine in the lawn mower is a standard 4-cycle engine
        with two cylinders and develops 18 horsepower. A suitable
        example can be purchased from Briggs &amp; Stratton, Milwaukee,
        Wis., 53201. </p>
      <p>Referring particularly to FIG. 1, system 10 includes fuel tank
        14 that is mounted to lawn mower 12 via mounting assembly 15. In
        the preferred embodiment, fuel tank 14 includes hydrogen gas.
        Accordingly, for the purposes of the foregoing detailed
        description, hydrogen gas will be described. </p>
      <p>A line 22 begins at fuel tank 14 and proceeds to back-flow
        valve 16. Back-flow valve 16 is a standard valve and is
        available from AirCo Gases Company, 575 Mountain Avenue, Murray
        Hill, N.J. 07974, part no. WCS CV-4M. PSI tank gauge 19 is
        inserted in line 22 between back-flow valve 16 and flow pressure
        gauge 18. PSI tank gauge 19 is available from AirCo Gases
        Company also, part no. WCS CV-5M, and serves as an indicator of
        fuel remaining in the tank 14. Flow pressure gauge 18 is used to
        monitor the flow of the hydrogen in pressure units. The flow is
        started using valve 16. The optimal flow pressure is 25 pounds
        of flow pressure from the tank 14 to the cylinder of the engine.
      </p>
      <p>The flow of hydrogen is regulated via valve 20 that is part of
        gauge 18. Thus, when valve 20 is opened, hydrogen proceeds
        through line section 22 to hydrogen flow solenoid 26A. The user
        can access the hydrogen fuel by flipping hydrogen flow switch
        24A into the "on" mode so that hydrogen gas in line 22 can
        proceed through hydrogen flow solenoid 26A and into line section
        28. </p>
      <p>Throttle 30 regulates the flow of hydrogen from line section 28
        into line section 29 and ultimately, to engine 13. Throttle 30
        is connected to throttle pedal 50 via includes throttle cable
        48. Throttle pedal 50 also operates the butterfly valves in the
        carburetor in engine 13 in a conventional manner. </p>
      <p>As an option, the throttle can be controlled electronically by
        a digital fuel controller product. Such a product is
        commercially available from Autotronic Controls Corp., 1490
        Henry Brennan Drive, El Paso, Tex. 79936. </p>
      <p>Line portion 29 proceeds through splitter 32 and is split into
        upper line 34 and lower line 36. Lines 34 and 36 proceed to
        adapters 38. Additional back-flow prevention valves 39 and 41
        are mounted between lines 34 and 36 and adapters 38. Braided
        Teflon.RTM. is the preferred material for the fuel lines of the
        system. </p>
      <p>Battery 42 is connected via battery cable 43 to magneto 44.
        Magneto 44 then controls the current through spark plug lines 46
        to adapters 38 in a conventional manner. Thus, the regulation of
        the spark that ignites the fuel in the cylinder of engine 13 is
        conventional. Additionally, the intake of air into the engine 13
        is accomplished through the standard carburetor system of engine
        13. In a car, the sparking of the spark plugs can be controlled
        by the standard distributor/battery ignition system. </p>
      <p>A second solenoid 26B controls the flow of gasoline from tank
        23 through gasoline line 52. Solenoid 26B is controlled by
        switch 24B. Throttle 30 is connected to gasoline line 52 and can
        also be used to control the flow of gasoline to engine 13. Thus,
        this invention can be used with both an alternative fuel and
        gasoline. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 2, 3 and 4, the adapter 38 of this
        invention is shown in more detail. Adapter 38 includes housing
        60. A threaded port 62 is formed into housing 60 through port
        block 64. Hydrogen lines are threadably connected to the adapter
        38 via port 62. Port 62 is also referred to as an entrance port.
      </p>
      <p>Adapter 38 also includes spark plug 66 which is effectively a
        standard spark plug except for the modification to the electrode
        as described below. Spark plug 66 includes a threaded end 68
        which is threadably received in the threaded upper end 70 of
        housing 60. Spark plug wires 46 (as seen in FIG. 1) are
        connected to connector end 72 of spark plug base 66. </p>
      <p>Electrode 76 protrudes from spark plug 66 and is of a length
        sufficient so that the threaded tip 77 (best seen in FIGS. 3 and
        4) of the electrode 76 is proximate to the cylinder of the
        internal combustion engine when the adapter 38 is mounted. In
        one embodiment the electrode 76 is co-terminus with an exit port
        88 of the adapter 38. This is most clearly shown in FIG. 4.
        Electrode 76 is preferably platinum to enhance catalysis of
        combustion by-products, as will be more fully discussed below. </p>
      <p>Adapter 38 also includes plug 79. Plug 79 includes an axial
        internal void space 80. Thus, plug 79 fits over electrode 76 via
        internal void space 80. Plug 79 preferably comprises a ceramic
        material that acts as a good insulator. A suitable source for
        ceramic plug 79 is AM/PRO Machinery, Inc. 134 Church Street,
        Plain City, Ohio 43064-1321. </p>
      <p>An important aspect of this invention is found on the external
        surface of plug 79. An annular groove 82 is formed on the
        surface of plug 79 near its distal end 81 so as to be proximal
        to the port 62 where hydrogen enters housing 60. Two stratifying
        grooves 84 proceed along the surface of plug 79 until they reach
        its distal end 83. It is these mixing structures, i.e. annual
        groove 82 and stratifying grooves 84, that facilitate the
        improved power generation from alternative fuels as provided by
        this invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the
        analogous arts that the mixing structure may be formed on an
        inner surface 60i of the adapter housing 60. Alternatively, a
        combination of vortex producing structures may be attached to,
        and preferably integral with, both the plug 79 and the adapter
        housing inner surface 60i. Also, any conventional vortex
        producing means would be sufficient, i.e. grooves, per se, are
        not required. An entrance area 62a proximate the entrance port
        62 is typically defined between the housing inner surface 60i
        and the external surface of plug 79. The external surface of
        plug 79 typically includes the grooves 84. So, the entrance area
        62a is the volume of space within the housing, proximate the
        entrance port 62, which the gas will be able to occupy. This is
        most clearly shown in FIG. 4. </p>
      <p>On threaded tip 77 of electrode 76, there are mounted a spacer
        nut 78 and a spark gap nut 85. As best seen in FIG. 2, the spark
        gap nut 85 includes a protrusion 85a that provides the spark gap
        between electrode 76 and periphery 89 of the exit port 88 of
        housing 60. The exit port 88 includes an exit area 88a. This is
        shown most clearly in FIGS. 2 and 4. The exit area 88a is no
        larger than the entrance area 62a. If the exit area 88a is
        smaller than the entrance area 62a, the pressure on the gas will
        increase. This increases the rate at which the gas is expelled
        from the plug 79, typically out through grooves 84. The
        electrode 76 is substantially co-terminus with the plug distal
        end 83 (seen most clearly in FIG. 2). Thus, the electrode 76 is
        substantially co-terminus with the exit port 88 or exit area
        88a. Note that tip of the electrode 77 is preferably proximate
        with the exit area 88a because this is the location of greatest
        mixing. This is most clearly seen in FIG. 4. Preferably, the
        spark gap nut 85 is brass and the preferred spark gap distance
        is 25/1000 of an inch. </p>
      <p>As best seen in FIG. 4, where arrows represent gas flow,
        hydrogen gas flows into chamber 60 via port 62. The hydrogen gas
        cools electrode 76, which facilitates combustion. Stratifying
        grooves 84, preferably there are two, act to mix the hydrogen
        that is flowing into housing 60 with ambient air therein.
        Though, more or less vortex creating grooves (a.k.a. stratifying
        grooves) may be desired. Typically, this will depend on the
        relative dimensions of the grooves and diameter of the plug as
        well as the pressure and velocity of the mixture in the housing.
        The mixing occurs within void space 86 of housing 60 and creates
        a vortexing or tornado action. Plug 79 tapers as it proceeds
        from its distal end 81 to its proximal end 83. Thus, proximal
        end 83 is smaller in diameter than distal end 81. This provides
        additional space within void space 86 for the mixing of the
        hydrogen and air. The stratified hydrogen/air are twisting in a
        vortex fashion when leaving housing 60 via exit port 88. The
        vortexing action produced by grooves 84 on the plug 79 creates a
        "tornado" 110 of hydrogen/air with a hollow center that
        generates a vacuum. Similar effect, or vortex flow path, would
        result were the grooves to be placed on the housing. The vacuum
        propels the hydrogen/air mixture into the cylinder of the engine
        for combustion. Such mixing cannot be accomplished in a
        conventional induction system. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 5, a schematic of the system of this
        invention is portrayed, with arrows representing gas flow.
        Hydrogen flows in through port 62 through adapter 38 and into
        cylinder 92. Air enters cylinder 92 through air intake 90 and
        air intake valve 91. The stratified hydrogen/air mixture is
        compressed in the compression stroke of the engine via piston 94
        and push rod 96, which are standard structures in an internal
        combustion engine. In the power stroke shown in FIG. 5-C, a
        spark is generated in the compressed stratified hydrogen/air
        mixture ignites and drives piston 94 and push rod 96 to power
        the engine. </p>
      <p>The mass energy density of hydrogen is enhanced through the
        increased pressure on the hydrogen exerted by piston 94 on the
        hydrogen/air mixture within the cylinder 92 in the uptake stroke
        in an internal combustion engine. The pressurized and well-mixed
        hydrogen/air mixture is rapidly ignited through the spark
        because hydrogen has a fast flame front. This reduces problems
        with timing. Thus, the energy store found in hydrogen is
        captured through this system via the compression of the hydrogen
        gas within cylinder 92 and via the thorough mixing of hydrogen
        and air provided by adapter 38. </p>
      <p>In addition, in the exhaust phase in a four cycle engine a
        second spark is generated from the plug to ensure complete
        combustion of by-products. This is enhanced by using an
        electrode made of platinum. Exhaust leaves cylinder 92 through
        exhaust port 98. Exhaust port 98 is closed during other phases
        by exhaust outlet valve 100. </p>
      <p>In the exhaust stroke, because air valve 91 is closed, the
        substantial component of the gases in cylinder 92 is hydrogen.
        This is also accomplished due to the fact that in the system of
        this invention, the hydrogen is continuously flowing. When this
        spark interacts with what is predominately hydrogen, a plasma is
        formed. This plasma blocks back-flow of air from exhaust port
        98. Prevention of back-flow of air prevents the hydrogen fuel
        system from backfiring, which is another common problem of
        hydrogen fuel systems. In effect, then, the plasma formed by the
        hydrogen acts as a virtual valve in that the plasma blocks the
        back-flow of air. </p>
      <p>When the plasma of the hydrogen is generated as described
        above, UV radiation is generated which also facilitates
        consumption of combustion by-products. This increases the
        environmental friendliness of the system. </p>
      <p>In addition to hydrogen the following fuels can be used in this
        system: natural gas; alcohol; gasohol; propane and buthane. A
        mixture of hydrogen and natural gas can also be used. As noted
        above, gasoline can be used in this system when solenoid 26 is
        used to stop the flow of hydrogen. </p>
      <p>Further, it is contemplated that an adapter that is described
        herein for use with an internal combustion engine can also be
        used with a home heating system such as a home heating system
        that may currently use natural gas. The vortexing action created
        by the plug would enable appropriate power to be captured from
        the hydrogen fuel so as to effectively heat a home. </p>
      <p>Thus, the apparatus and system of this invention provides an
        effective means to use alternative fuels. The use of alternative
        fuels can enhance the environment by reducing the use of
        conventional gasoline and the environmentally detrimental
        by-products caused by the consumption thereof. </p>
      <p>Thus, although there have been described particular embodiments
        of the present invention of a new and useful "Fuel System For
        Internal Combustion System And Adapter For Use In Same", it is
        not intended that such references be construed as limitations
        upon the scope of this invention except as set forth in the
        following claims. Further, although there have been described
        certain dimensions used in the preferred embodiment, it is not
        intended that such dimensions be construed as limitations upon
        the scope of this invention except as set forth in the following
        claims.<br>

      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>The internal combustion engine fuel system
        described includes a structure for mixing the alternative fuel,
        preferably hydrogen, with oxygen in ambient air to stratify the
        fuel. The system includes an adapter, and the adapter includes a
        housing mounted between spark plug and cylinder of the internal
        combustion engine. A plug is placed within the housing. The plug
        has ridges or grooves on its outer surface that act as mixing
        structures. Thus, when hydrogen is introduced into the adapter
        housing it is mixed with ambient oxygen within the chamber as it
        flows over the plug. The mixing structures in the housing
        creates a vortexing action as the hydrogen flows over the plug
        and towards the cylinder of the engine. An electrode protrudes
        from the plug towards the cylinder. The electrode is preferably
        platinum and generates the necessary spark to create combustion
        of the hydrogen/air mixture adjacent to the cylinder to thereby
        power the cylinder in the engine. A platinum electrode is
        preferably used because it enhances a catalytic conversion of
        combustion by-products to more environmentally compatible
        products. The present invention also teaches a spark plug
        producing a hotter spark for a hydrogen fuel system. Also taught
        is a hydrogen powered vehicle with reduced emissions by
        producing a spark during the power stroke and the exhaust
        stroke. Methods for reducing exhaust pollution are also taught.
        Methods of reducing exhaust pollution by generating a plasma are
        taught as well. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates generally to a fuel system for
        internal combustion engines that enables the invention to
        utilize alternative fuels; and, more particularly to an improved
        fuel system for an internal combustion engine and an adapter and
        spark plug for use in same. </p>
      <p>The problems of air pollution caused by automobiles, lawn
        mowers and other vehicles that have internal combustion engines
        powered by gasoline is well documented. This problem is
        particularly described in an article in the San Diego Union
        Tribune, Wednesday, Sep. 25, 1996 and in Popular Science, August
        1996. Indeed, under the Clean Air Act, in the next few years
        cars that do not run on standard fossil fuels like gasoline will
        be required in several states. Currently, there are no vehicles
        available to meet this need. </p>
      <p>Thus, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that
        there has been a push to seek other fuels for use in internal
        combustion engines. These fuels include methane, propane and
        gasohol. </p>
      <p>Hydrogen has also been characterized as a promising fuel
        source. See Department of Energy publication entitled "Hydrogen
        Fuel", printed in 1978, U.S. Government Printing Office, U.S.
        Department of Energy, Office of Public Affairs, Washington, DC
        20585. Particularly, the graph presented in FIG. 6, which is
        copied from this publication, shows the potential for hydrogen
        in BTUs/Lb. However, the mass energy density for hydrogen is
        low; and thus, hydrogen needs to be compressed before its energy
        potential can be realized. Hydrogen is a "dry fuel" that is more
        difficult to ignite than "wet fuels." It becomes more difficult
        to ignite when it is cooled. However, cooling is preferred in
        most systems to avoid premature ignition of the fuel. Other
        systems deliver the hydrogen under pressure to prevent ignition
        in the supply line, which is a form of pre-ignition. No prior
        art fuel system has been able to capture the energy of hydrogen.
      </p>
      <p>Several fuel systems for use with hydrogen have been proposed.
        Examples are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,167,919; 4,253,428;
        4,016,836; 4,178,882; 5,222,993; 5,085,176; and 5,085,176. The
        problem with these prior art fuel systems is they cannot take
        advantage of the alternative fuels to generate sufficient power
        from the fuels to drive an internal combustion engine for use in
        a lawn mower, automobile or other vehicle. As noted above, this
        is a particular problem when hydrogen is used as a fuel.
        Additionally, the prior art systems do not address the problem
        of back fire, i.e. undesired explosion of the fuel in the
        cylinder during the exhaust stroke of the internal combustion
        engine. </p>
      <p>Premature ignition or backfire is often a problem with hydrogen
        fueled systems. U.S. Pat. No. 4,383,198 (Hosking) teaches a fuel
        injection spark plug with a pre-cooling chamber to avoid
        premature ignition indentination of a gaseous fuel supplied to
        the spark plug. U.S. Pat. No. 4,383,198, Hosking, entitled "Fuel
        Injection Spark Plug", issued May 10, 1983, is hereby
        incorporated herein by reference. However, cooling hydrogen
        makes it more difficult to ignite. This is because hydrogen is a
        dry fuel whereas gas is generally considered a wet fuel. Thus to
        reduce fuel pollution one prefers to utilize a fuel such as
        hydrogen and ignite it with a hotter spark. </p>
      <p>One patent discussing very high energy (VHE) ignition systems
        is U.S. Pat. No. 5,207,208 issued to Ward, entitled "Integrated
        Convertor High Power CD Ignition", issued May 4, 1993. U.S. Pat.
        No. 5,207,208 is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Pat.
        '208 teaches very high energy ignition systems, for instance on
        the order of 36K volts. It teaches voltage doubling utilizing
        pulsating sparks of peak current on the order of two amps. While
        36K volts may at times be adequate, it is preferable to achieve
        a higher voltage in the ignition chamber when using hydrogen. </p>
      <p>It is known in the art to use a direct ignition system, also
        referred to as a distributorless ignition system, to increase
        the spark plug voltage. Such direct ignition systems use a
        "waste spark" method of spark distribution. Each cylinder is
        paired with its opposing cylinder in the firing order (1-4, 2-3,
        on a four cylinder, 1-4, 2-5, 3-6 on a V6) so that one cylinder
        on compression fires simultaneously with its opposing cylinder
        on exhaust stroke. Since the cylinder on exhaust stroke requires
        very little of the available voltage to fire its plug, most of
        the voltage is used to fire the cylinder on the compression
        stroke. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 4,462,380 discusses a distributorless ignition
        system. U.S. Pat. No. 4,462,380 entitled "Enhanced Spark Energy
        Distributorless Ignition System" issued Jul. 31, 1984 by Asik is
        hereby incorporated herein by reference. Pat. '380 teaches a
        distributorless ignition system of an internal combustion engine
        which has a supplementary spark energy module to increase spark
        energy. Each high voltage terminal is connected to a single
        spark plug and each ignition coil primary is alternately
        energized and quickly de-energized, producing opposite polarity
        ignition voltages at each coil terminal. As a result, pairs of
        spark plugs are alternately fired, with each firing pair
        occurring in a compression or exhaust stroke and thereby
        providing the proper ignition to the engine. Asik asserts that
        firing a spark plug does not affect engine performance or
        emissions. As taught by the instant invention this is incorrect
        for hydrogen fuels when the exhaust is sparked at a sufficient
        voltage. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,146,882 (Brinkman) teaches use of specific wet
        fuel mixtures in conjunction with direct ignition systems
        (D.I.S.). It teaches that technical breakdown voltages for
        typical spark plugs are on the order of 15-20 kV and DIS
        typically yield between 30 kV-40 kV. U.S. Pat. No. 5,146,882,
        entitled "Method And Apparatus For Cold Starting A Spark Ignited
        Internal Combustion Engine Fueled With An Alcohol-Based Fuel
        Mixture", by Brinkman, et al., issued Sep. 15, 1992, is hereby
        incorporated herein by reference. The previously referenced
        prior art discusses alternate fuels and fuel systems but does
        not teach a method of achieving a sufficient voltage with a
        hydrogen system. </p>
      <p>What is needed, then, is a fuel system for an internal
        combustion engine that provides a way to generate sufficient
        power from the alternative fuels and that reduces backfire
        problems. Such a system is lacking in the prior art. Also
        lacking in prior art is a system utilizing alternate fuels with
        reduced pollution capabilities. Also lacking is a way of
        generating sufficient voltage spark to ignite the alternate
        fuel. </p>
      <p>The following U.S. Patents discuss spark plugs designed for gas
        internal combustion engines to reduce radio frequency noise and
        interference. U.S. Pat. No. 4,224,554, entitled "Spark Plug
        Having A Low Noise Lever" issued to Nishio et al., Sep. 23, 1980

      <p>It is an object to reduce backfire by providing hydrogen at a
        sufficient pressure to reduce backfire and igniting it with a
        hotter spark (i.e. a higher voltage). </p>
      <p>It is still a further object of this invention to provide an

        wherein the fuel is ignited during the power stroke and the

      <p>It is yet a further object of this invention to provide a way
        to convert the standard induction fuel system of a lawnmower to
        a direct injection fuel system wherein fuel is injected directly
        into the cylinder. </p>
      <p>It is yet a further object of this invention to provide a way
        to convert the indirect injection fuel system of an automobile
        to a direct injection fuel system wherein fuel is injected
        directly into the cylinder. </p>
      <p>The internal combustion engine fuel system of this invention
        includes a structure for mixing the alternative fuel, preferably
        hydrogen, with oxygen in ambient air to stratify the fuel. The
        term "alternative fuels" is known in the art and is meant to
        refer to fuels other than conventional gasoline. </p>
      <p>The invention in one embodiment comprises an adapter, the
        adapter including a housing mounted between spark plug and
        cylinder of the internal combustion engine. A plug is placed
        within the housing. The plug has ridges or grooves on its outer
        surface that act as mixing structures. Thus, when hydrogen is
        introduced into the adapter housing it is mixed with ambient
        oxygen within the chamber as it flows over the plug. The mixing
        structures on the plug create a vortexing action as the hydrogen
        flows over the plug and towards the cylinder of the engine. </p>
      <p>An electrode protrudes from the plug towards the cylinder. The
        electrode is preferably platinum and generates the necessary
        spark to create combustion of the hydrogen/air mixture adjacent
        to the cylinder to thereby power the cylinder in the engine. A
        platinum electrode is preferably used because it enhances a
        catalytic conversion of combustion by-products to more
        environmentally compatible products. </p>
      <p>Thus, the combination of the compression action generated by
        the conventional piston and push rod within the cylinder of the
        engine in conjunction with the hydrogen/air mixing structure
        that vortexes the hydrogen/air create compressed hydrogen that
        is mixed with a combustion facilitator, i.e. oxygen in the
        ambient air to enable the system of this invention to capture
        the abundant energy found in hydrogen fuel. </p>
      <p>The enhanced mixing capabilities of this invention is also
        adaptable for use with other alternative fuels such as natural
        gas, alcohol, propane and the like. </p>
      <p>One embodiment of the present invention is for a hydrogen
        powered vehicle including an internal combustion engine operably
        connected to power the vehicle and adapted to connect to a
        hydrogen supply line. The internal combustion engine comprises a
        cylinder operably connected to the supply line; a piston
        operably disposed in the cylinder; and a spark plug having an
        electrode assembly in operable sparking communication with the
        cylinder, wherein the spark plug is capable of producing a spark
        of at least 45 kV. </p>
      <p>Preferably the spark plug comprises a housing having a sparking
        end and a hollow chamber containing the electrode assembly. The
        electrode assembly comprises an electrode having a connector end
        and a sparking end, wherein the sparking end is positioned
        adjacent to the housing sparking end. The electrode assembly
        preferably comprises a coil electrically connected to the
        electrode connector. </p>
      <p>Preferably the housing comprises a fuel inlet port in fluid
        communication with the supply line, and an insulator surrounding
        the electrode assembly, wherein the insulator is positioned in
        the hollow chamber. Preferably the insulator comprises an outer
        surface defining a first fuel channel having a first respective
        fuel exit port, wherein the first fuel channel is in fluid
        communication with the fuel inlet port and the fuel exit port
        exits into the cylinder. </p>
      <p>The present invention also includes a method of operating an
        internal combustion engine comprising supplying hydrogen fuel to
        the engine and creating a spark in the cylinder during the power
        stroke and the exhaust stroke, wherein the spark created during
        the power stroke is at least 45 kV. In one embodiment the spark
        is at least 70 kV. In certain embodiments the method comprises
        generating plasma during the exhaust stroke. The exhaust fuel
        converts to an exhaust emission and coalesces with the plasma,
        thereby reducing fuel pollution. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is an object in the invention to provide a
        spark plug producing a sufficiently hot spark to ignite hydrogen
        fuel, including cooled hydrogen fuel. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a device
        for reducing fuel exhaust emissions. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a cleaner
        burning engine. </p>
      <p>Another object is to provide a spark plug for reducing
        emissions. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a device
        functional with dry fuels. Use of the term hydrogen, as
        discussed herein, is intended to encompass such dry fuels.
        However the term as used excludes such wet fuels as gas and
        alcohol. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide an
        integrated fuel system adapted to provide these and objectives.
      </p>
      <p>Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be
        apparent to those of skill in the art by reference to the
        teachings disclosed herein, including the attached drawings,
        detailed description of exemplary embodiments, and claims. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals
        refer to like parts throughout, the fuel system is referred to
        generally at 10. The fuel system of this invention is
        contemplated for use with an internal combustion power system,
        such as an internal combustion engine or such as a home heating
        system. Fuel system 10 is portrayed in this case as connected to
        a standard lawn mower. The lawn mower is shown in phantom at 12
        in FIG. 1. The lawn mower is a conventional lawn mower as can be
        purchased from a company such as Murray of Ohio. The internal
        combustion engine in the lawn mower is a standard 4-cycle engine
        with two cylinders and develops 18 horsepower. A suitable
        example can be purchased from Briggs &amp; Stratton, Milwaukee,
        Wis. 53201. </p>
      <p>Referring particularly to FIG. 1, system 10 includes fuel tank
        14 that is mounted to lawn mower 12 via mounting assembly 15. In
        the preferred embodiment, fuel tank 14 includes hydrogen gas.
        Accordingly, for the purposes of the foregoing detailed
        description, hydrogen gas will be described. </p>
      <p>A line 22 begins at fuel tank 14 and proceeds to back-flow
        valve 16. Back-flow valve 16 is a standard valve and is
        available from AirCo Gases Company, 575 Mountain Avenue, Murray
        Hill, N.J. 07974, part no. WCS CV-4M. PSI tank gauge 19 is
        inserted in line 22 between back-flow valve 16 and flow pressure
        gauge 18. PSI tank gauge 19 is available from AirCo Gases
        Company also, part no. WCS CV5M, and serves as an indicator of
        fuel remaining in the tank 14. Flow pressure gauge 18 is used to
        monitor the flow of the hydrogen in pressure units. The flow is
        started using valve 16. The optimal flow pressure is 25 pounds
        of flow pressure from the tank 14 to the cylinder of the engine.
      </p>
      <p>The flow of hydrogen is regulated via valve 20 that is part of
        gauge 18. Thus, when valve 20 is opened, hydrogen proceeds
        through line section 22 to hydrogen flow solenoid 26A. The user
        can access the hydrogen fuel by flipping hydrogen flow switch
        24A into the "on" mode so that hydrogen gas in line 22 can
        proceed through hydrogen flow solenoid 26A and into line section
        28. </p>
      <p>Throttle 30 regulates the flow of hydrogen from line section 28
        into line section 29 and ultimately, to engine 13. Throttle 30
        is connected to throttle pedal 50 via includes throttle cable
        48. Throttle pedal 50 also operates the butterfly valves in the
        carburetor in engine 13 in a conventional manner. </p>
      <p>As an option, the throttle can be controlled electronically by
        a digital </p>
      <p>fuel controller product. Such a product is commercially
        available from Autotronic Controls Corp., 1490 Henry Brennan
        Drive, El Paso, Tex. 79936. </p>
      <p>Line portion 29 proceeds through splitter 32 and is split into
        upper line 34 and lower line 36. Lines 34 and 36 proceed to
        adapters 38. Additional back-flow prevention valves 39 and 41
        are mounted between lines 34 and 36 and adapters 38. Braided
        Teflon.RTM. is the preferred material for the fuel lines of the
        system. </p>
      <p>Battery 42 is connected via battery cable 43 to magneto 44.
        Magneto 44 then controls the current through spark plug lines 46
        to adapters 38 in a conventional manner. Thus, the regulation of
        the spark that ignites the fuel in the cylinder of engine 13 is
        conventional. Additionally, the intake of air into the engine 13
        is accomplished through the standard carburetor system of engine
        13. In a car, the sparking of the spark plugs can be controlled
        by the standard distributor/battery ignition system. </p>
      <p>A second solenoid 26B controls the flow of gasoline from tank
        23 through gasoline line 52. Solenoid 26B is controlled by
        switch 24B. Throttle 30 is connected to gasoline line 52 and can
        also be used to control the flow of gasoline to engine 13. Thus,
        this invention can be used with both an alternative fuel and
        gasoline. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 2, 3 and 4, the adapter 38 of this
        invention is shown in more detail. Adapter 38 includes housing
        60. A threaded port 62 is formed into housing 60 through port
        block 64. Hydrogen lines are threadably connected to the adapter
        38 via port 62. Port 62 is also referred to as an entrance port.
        The entrance port has an entrance area 62a. </p>
      <p>Adapter 38 also includes spark plug 66 which is effectively a
        standard spark plug except for the modification to the electrode
        as described below. Spark plug 66 includes a threaded end 68
        which is threadably received in the threaded upper end 70 of
        housing 60. Spark plug wires 46 (as seen in FIG. 1) are
        connected to connector end 72 of spark plug base 66. </p>
      <p>Electrode 76 protrudes from spark plug 66 and is of a length
        sufficient so that the threaded tip 77 (best seen in FIGS. 3 and
        4) of the electrode 76 is proximate to the cylinder of the
        internal combustion engine when the adapter 38 is mounted. In
        one embodiment the electrode 76 is coterminus with an exit port
        88 of the adapter 38. This most clearly is shown in FIG. 4.
        Electrode 76 is preferably platinum to enhance catalysis of
        combustion by-products, as will be more fully discussed below. </p>
      <p>Adapter 38 also includes plug 79. Plug 79 includes an axial
        internal void space 80. Thus, plug 79 fits over electrode 76 via
        internal void space 80. Plug 79 preferably comprises a ceramic
        material that acts as a good insulator. A suitable source for
        ceramic plug 79 is AM/PRO Machinery, Inc. 134 Church Street,
        Plain City, Ohio 43064-1321. </p>
      <p>An important aspect of this invention is found on the external
        surface of plug 79. An annular groove 82 is formed on the
        surface of plug 79 near its distal end 81 so as to be proximal
        to the port 62 where hydrogen enters housing 60. Two stratifying
        grooves 84 proceed along the surface of plug 79 until they reach
        its distal end 83. It is these mixing structures, i.e. annual
        groove 82 and stratifying grooves 84, that facilitate the
        improved power generation from alternative fuels as provided by
        this invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the
        analogous arts that mixing structure may be formed in the inner
        surface of the adapter housing 60. </p>
      <p>Alternatively a combination of vortex producing structures is
        integral with both the plug 79 and adapter housing 60. Also any
        conventional vortex producing means should be sufficient groves,
        per se, are not required. </p>
      <p>On threaded tip 77 of electrode 76, there are mounted a spacer
        nut 78 and a spark gap nut 85. As best seen in FIG. 2, the spark
        gap nut 85 includes a protrusion 85a that provides the spark gap
        between electrode 76 and periphery 89 of the exit port 88 of
        housing 60. The exit port 88 includes an exit area 88a.
        Preferably, the exit area 88a is no larger than the entrance
        area 62a, though this is not critical. Preferably, the spark gap
        nut 85 is brass and the preferred spark gap distance is 25/1000
        of an inch. Of course, the electrode may be coterminus with the
        plug distal end 83. </p>
      <p>As best seen in FIG. 4, where arrows represent gas flow,
        hydrogen gas flows into chamber 60 via port 62. The hydrogen gas
        cools electrode 76, which facilitates combustion. Stratifying
        grooves 84, preferably there are two, act to mix the hydrogen
        that is flowing into housing 60 with ambient air therein. Though
        more or less vortex creating grooves (stratifying grooves) may
        be desired. Typically this will depend on the relative
        dimensions of the grooves and diameter of the plug as well as
        the pressure or velocity of the mixture in the housing. The
        mixing occurs within void space 86 of housing 60 and creates a
        vortexing or tornado action. Plug 79 tapers as it proceeds from
        its distal end 81 to its proximal end 83. Thus, proximal end 83
        is smaller in diameter than distal end 81. This provides
        additional space within void space 86 for the mixing of the
        hydrogen and air. The stratified hydrogen/air are twisting in a
        vortex fashion when leaving housing 60 via exit port 88. The
        vortexing action produced by grooves 84 on the plug 79 creates a
        "tornado" 110 of hydrogen/air with a hollow center that
        generates a vacuum. Similar effect would result were t he
        grooves to be placed on the housing. The vacuum propels the
        hydrogen/air mixture into the cylinder of the engine for
        combustion. Such mixing cannot be accomplished in a conventional
        induction system. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 5, a schematic of the system of this
        invention is portrayed, with arrows representing gas flow.
        Hydrogen flows in through port 62 through adapter 38 and into
        cylinder 92. Air enters cylinder 92 through air intake 90 and
        air intake valve 91. The stratified hydrogen/air mixture is
        compressed in the compression stroke of the engine via piston 94
        and push rod 96, which are standard structures in an internal
        combustion engine. In the power stroke shown in FIG. 5-C, a
        spark is generated in the compressed stratified hydrogen/air
        mixture ignites and drives piston 94 and push rod 96 to power
        the engine. </p>
      <p>The mass energy density of hydrogen is enhanced through the
        increased pressure on the hydrogen exerted by piston 94 on the
        hydrogen/air mixture within the cylinder 92 in the uptake stroke
        in an internal combustion engine. The pressurized and well-mixed
        hydrogen/air mixture is rapidly ignited through the spark
        because hydrogen has a fast flame front. This reduces problems
        with timing. Thus, the energy store found in hydrogen is
        captured through this system via the compression of the hydrogen
        gas within cylinder 92 and via the thorough mixing of hydrogen
        and air provided by adapter 38. </p>
      <p>In addition, in the exhaust phase in a four cycle engine a
        second spark is generated from the plug to ensure complete
        combustion of by-products. This is enhanced by using an
        electrode made of platinum. Exhaust leaves cylinder 92 through
        exhaust port 98. Exhaust port 98 is closed during other phases
        by exhaust outlet valve 100. </p>
      <p>In the exhaust stroke, because air valve 91 is closed, the
        substantial component of the gases in cylinder 92 is hydrogen.
        This is also accomplished due to the fact that in the system of
        this invention, the hydrogen is continuously flowing. When this
        spark interacts with what is predominately hydrogen, a plasma is
        formed. This plasma blocks back-flow of air from exhaust port
        98. Prevention of back-flow of air prevents the hydrogen fuel
        system from backfiring, which is another common problem of
        hydrogen fuel systems. In effect, then, the plasma formed by the
        hydrogen acts as a virtual valve in that the plasma blocks the
        back-flow of air. </p>
      <p>When the plasma of the hydrogen is generated as described
        above, UV radiation is generated which also facilitates
        consumption of combustion by-products. This increases the
        environmental friendliness of the system. </p>
      <p>In addition to hydrogen the following fuels can be used in this
        system: natural gas; alcohol; gasohol; propane and buthane. A
        mixture of hydrogen and natural gas can also be used. As noted
        above, gasoline can be used in this system when solenoid 26 is
        used to stop the flow of hydrogen. </p>
      <p>Further, it is contemplated that an adapter that is described
        herein for use with an internal combustion engine can also be
        used with a home heating system such as a home heating system
        that may currently use natural gas. The vortexing action created
        by the plug would enable appropriate power to be captured from
        the hydrogen fuel so as to effectively heat a home. </p>
      <p>Another embodiment of the invention is a hydrogen powered
        vehicle 200 shown in FIG. 7. The hydrogen powered vehicle 200
        includes an internal combustion engine 210 operably connected to
        power the vehicle 200 and adapted to connect to a hydrogen
        supply 212 through a supply line 214. </p>

      <p>More generally the present invention includes an internal

        supply line 214; a first piston 94 disposed in the first
        cylinder 92 to move through a power stroke and an exhaust stroke
        (See FIGS. 10 and 11) in the first cylinder 92. The engine 210
        also comprises a spark plug 216 having a housing 222 including a
        sparking end 224 and an electrode assembly 218 located in the
        housing 222, wherein the sparking end 224 is in operable
        communication with the cylinder 92 and capable of producing a
        spark 220 of at least 45 kV. Preferably, the spark plug 216
        fires during the power stroke and the exhaust stroke. In one
        embodiment the housing sparking end 224 comprises a torridal
        ground electrode 254. The electrode assembly 218 comprises an
        electrode 228 having a sparking end 230 capable of sparking

        electrically connected to the electrode 228 opposite the

        15. Typically the spark plug 216 comprises an insulator 228
        surrounding the electrode assembly 218. Preferably the insulator
        228 includes a fuel channel 246 having a fuel exit port 248 near
        the electrode sparking end 232. </p>
      <p>It will be apparent to those with skill in the art that the
        present invention also comprises a method of operating an
        internal combustion engine 210 comprising the steps of supplying
        hydrogen fuel to the engine 210; moving a piston 94 in a
        cylinder 92 through a power stroke and an exhaust stroke;
        creating a spark 220 in the cylinder 92 during the power stroke
        and the exhaust stroke, wherein the spark created during the
        power stroke is at least 45 kV; and supplying the fuel to a
        location sufficiently near the spark to ignite the fuel. This is
        shown well in FIGS. 10, 15 and 19. </p>
      <p>The present invention also includes a method wherein the step
        of creating a spark 220 comprises passing an electric current
        (not shown) through an electrode assembly 218 including a coil
        234 electrically connected to an electrode 218 having a sparking
        end 232; insulating the electrode assembly 218; and arcing the
        electric current from the electrode sparking end 232 to a ground
        electrode 254. The ground electrode 254 as shown in FIGS. 15 and
        17 a toroidal ground electrode 254. </p>
      <p>In certain embodiments the step of creating a spark 220
        includes creating a spark 220 having at least 70 kV. Creating a
        spark of sufficient voltage will generally reduce the exhaust
        pollution. Typically this happens by generating a plasma or
        plasma field during the exhaust stroke. Thus, one method of the
        present invention further comprises the steps of generating
        plasma during the exhaust stroke; and allowing exhaust fuel
        converted to an exhaust state to coalesce with the plasma. This
        reduces exhaust pollution. </p>
      <p>Thus, the apparatus and system of this invention provides an
        effective means to use alternative fuels. The use of alternative
        fuels can enhance<br>
        the environment by reducing the use of conventional gasoline and
        the environmentally detrimental by-products caused by the
        consumption thereof. </p>
      <p>Thus, although there have been described particular embodiments
        of the present invention of a new and useful "Hydrogen Powered
        Vehicle, Internal Combustion Engine, And Spark Plug For Use In
        Same", it is not intended that such references be construed as
        limitations upon the scope of this invention except as set forth
        in the following claims. Further, although there have been
        described certain dimensions used in the preferred embodiment,
        it is not intended that such dimensions be construed as
        limitations upon the scope of this invention except as set forth
        in the following claims. </p>
