        <p><b><font size="+1">Torotrak: The Next CVT?</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>by Ian Norris</b> </p>
        <p>&nbsp;<i>Britain comes up with a new kind of infinitely
            variable transmission for the off-road crowd.</i></p>
      </center>
      <p>A British firm has developed a new form of automatic
        transmission that it says can cut fuel consumption on SUVs and
        trucks by 20 percent when compared with a conventional automatic
        gearbox. </p>
      <p>The company, Torotrak, says that the cost of its Infinitely
        Variable Transmission is comparable to a conventional auto box,
        and it is looking for an American company interested in building
        the units for sale to American manufacturers. GM has already
        tested the Torotrak system and approved it, and although the
        company is not prepared to build the transmissions itself, it
        would be prepared to look at proposals from any of its Tier 1
        component suppliers who were prepared to undertake manufacture
        of the gearboxes. </p>
      <p>The Torotrak transmission differs from a conventional automatic
        in that it has no torque converter. The torque converter
        transfers the drive from the engine to the gearbox by means of a
        fluid coupling that takes the place of the mechanical clutch
        used in manual transmissions. The fluid allows the drive from
        the engine to "slip" while the car is at rest or while shifts
        are being made, thus making it unnecessary to disengage the
        drive using the clutch. </p>
      <p><b>Slipping into economy</b> </p>
      <p>Torque converters are convenient for drivers, but are
        inherently inefficient because of the slippage, and this
        inefficiency makes itself felt in gas mileage. </p>
      <p>In place of the torque converter, the Torotrak has a system of
        two clutches in which the drive is transmitted by variators. The
        variators are discs that run in contact between two dished
        clutch plates, transferring the drive from the input plate to
        the output plate and performing the job carried out by the
        transmission fluid in a torque converter. Slippage is minimal,
        however, and the power losses and consequent fuel consumption
        associated with the torque converter are drastically reduced. By
        varying the angles of the variators, the drive ratio can be
        changed infinitely, and by using a system of lockable clutches
        and a planetary gearset, the drive transmitted to the road
        wheels is totally seamless, unlike that of a conventional
        automatic, in which fixed ratios are engaged as required. The
        Torotrak thus combines the advantages of the torque converter -
        clutchless drive - and the CVT, or Constantly Variable
        Transmission, which achieves seamless power transmission through
        belts - which can be prone to slippage - running on variable
        circumference pulleys. </p>
      <p>The Torotrak's increased fuel efficiency comes partly from the
        absence of the torque converter and partly from the fact that
        the gearbox is capable of sustaining very high overdrive ratios,
        with 70 mph per 1000 engine revolutions being easily achievable.
      </p>
      <p>Another advantage of the system is that it is capable of
        'slipping' without the overheating that comes from running a
        torque converter in this way for any extended period of time.
        Although a car with a conventional automatic can be held on a
        hill by leaving it in Drive and applying the throttle gently, if
        this is done for too long the transmission fluid will overheat.
        With no fluid present, the Torotrak can be held on the throttle
        for much longer periods. An advantage of this quality - which
        has great potential for off-road vehicles - is the fact that the
        gearbox can slow the vehicle on descents. This is done by
        engaging reverse and allowing the slippage of the clutches to
        work against the weight of the vehicle. The engine is
        effectively trying to drive the vehicle back up the hill, and
        the rate of descent can be controlled very precisely. </p>
      <p>In production vehicles, it would not be necessary to select
        reverse gear physically. Since the gearbox is completely
        controlled by software, it would be a simple matter to write the
        software in such a manner that when 'Hill Descent' is selected
        with a dashboard switch, the gearbox takes over automatically.
        Another advantage of software control is that the gearbox
        software settings can be controlled by a "smart key." In the
        same way that the keys of individual drivers can now set seat
        positions and radio selections to personal tastes, the gearbox
        can also be controlled for individual drivers. The possibility
        of setting maximum speeds for teenage drivers is an obvious
        advantage of this system. </p>
      <p><b>Principles in motion</b> </p>
      <p>Torotrak has been in existence as a company since 1998, and the
        Torotrak system has been under development since 1988, but up
        till now only a few industry engineers have had the opportunity
        to drive Torotrak-equipped vehicles. I was among the first
        journalists to sample the system, fitted to one of fifteen Ford
        Expedition SUVs that Torotrak has converted to demonstrate its
        capabilities. Torotrak has identified the SUV/truck market in
        the U.S. as a major opportunity, and it was to show how the
        system worked in such a vehicle that the firm chose to work with
        the Expedition. For the moment, the work is concentrated on
        rear-drive vehicles, which constitute the biggest proportion of
        the market, but an all-wheel-drive Torotrak system is feasible.
      </p>
      <p>On the road, the Torotrak behaves like any other automatic. The
        PrNDL selector is the same, and after selecting Drive the
        Expedition moved off quite normally. Acceleration is no swifter
        than a standard automatic, but the big vehicle, with its
        5.4-liter engine, was soon able to reach a good freeway cruising
        speed, blending in with other traffic from the entry-ramp easily
        and smoothly. Smoothness is the keyword with the Torotrak, which
        gave totally seamless acceleration, with none of the clunks or
        jumps that can come with a badly-adjusted automatic. </p>
      <p>Once at cruising speed on the freeway, it was fascinating to
        see the rev-counter hovering around the 1000 mark as the
        speedometer indicated 70+ mph. In town and on country roads, the
        drive was smooth, and torque was always available for moving off
        or acceleration. Where engine braking is required, the company's
        engineers have built in low-range locks similar to those found
        on conventional automatics. </p>
      <p>Torotrak has measured the consumption of the Expedition, not on
        the road, but in statutory fuel-consumption tests that are more
        reliable and repeatable, and has found that the Expedition
        equipped with the company's transmission is consistently 20
        percent more fuel-efficient than the standard vehicle. </p>
      <p><b>Descending power</b> </p>
      <p>Off the road and on the test track, I was able to sample the
        Torotrak's ability to control speed on a steep descent. With
        reverse selected, the big SUV could be held stationary on a
        25-percent downward incline just by gentle pressure on the
        accelerator. When the accelerator was released, and the
        vehicle's weight took over, the Expedition rolled slowly
        downhill. It was strange to see the way it started to reverse
        when it arrived on level ground. Naturally, in a production
        model, software would select reverse when required for this
        purpose and release it as soon as it was not needed. Going back
        up the 25-percent grade, the Expedition could again be held
        stationary on the throttle, this time with Drive selected. </p>
      <p>The Torotrak company has no plans to start producing gearboxes
        using its technology. It is structured purely as a technology
        provider, and it licenses specialist manufacturers to develop
        and produce their own gearboxes using Torotrak principles.
        Currently, Getrag of Germany and Japan's Aisin AW hold licenses,
        but no U.S. manufacturer has yet joined them, hence Torotrak's
        work on proving the feasibility of the transmission for SUVs and
        trucks, which are currently seen as the world's largest
        potential market for the unit. </p>

      <p>Around the world the giant car makers are pouring billions of
        pounds into designing the latest models. But it has taken a
        small, British hot-house developer to come up with potentially
        one of the most significant innovations in the motor industry. </p>
      <p>The Torotrak transmission system, the brainchild of the patent
        licensing group BTG, changes gear automatically without the use
        of a clutch, solving one of the motor industry's last
        unconquered technological problems. BTG claims it costs
        one-fifth less to produce than a normal automatic transmission,
        uses at least 15 per cent less fuel and, according to those
        allowed a test ride in prototype cars, gives an unbelievably
        smooth ride. So much so that the company is introducing an
        artificial lurch to remind drivers when they are racing up a
        hill. </p>
      <p>Transmissions, the parts on the underside of a car that we
        never see, are, crudely, what makes the engine drive the wheels.
        The area has been a graveyard for technological advance despite
        years of research effort. Engineers have long understood that
        fixed speed gearboxes are inefficient. To optimise fuel
        consumption drivers must be skilled enough to match engine speed
        with the car's speed, using the gears. In theory, the solution
        should be continuous variable transmissions (CVT), with an
        infinity of gear ratios. But despite decades of research there
        have been few successes. The best-known CVT, and still something
        of a joke in the motor world, was the infamous Daf, Holland's
        only independent car maker until its takeover by Volvo in the
        mid-Seventies. Launched in the 1950s, the Dafodil (later
        abbreviated to Daf), used rubber bands in its transmission,
        which became legendary for high-pitched whirring noises and
        delayed acceleration. In the 1980s car giants such as Ford and
        Fiat developed the idea using steel belts which expanded or
        shrank as the speed changed. According to BTG, Torotrak's
        so-called infinitely variable transmission (IVT) looks quite
        different, using discs and rollers to dispense with the clutch.
        For the first time the engine is directly connected to the
        wheels, dramatically improving efficiency. A car with Torotrak
        can be driving at 60 mph, but at such low revolutions that the
        engine is effectively idling. Though no car company has yet
        committed to produce a car fitted with Torotrak, Ford, Toyota
        and Getrag, which supplies BMW with transmissions, have all
        signed licences with full production in mind. General Motors
        should be next to sign. Ian Harvey, BTG's chief executive,
        predicts that Torotrak could become the industry standard by
        2010: "Fuel efficiency and low production costs are crucial to
        car manufacturers. And Torotrak gives the same handling as
        current cars. No other system has all that." The potential of
        Torotrak has not been lost on investors. Since BTG was floated
        at pounds 40m two years ago, its value has risen almost 20-fold.
        Some overexcited observers even estimate that Torotrak alone
        justifies BTG's current pounds 705m market valuation.
        Shareholders should not underestimate the difficulty of
        persuading the conservative car market to adopt such a radical
        new product. Maurice Martin, Torotrak's chief executive, admits
        that car manufacturers are formidably tough customers. He tells
        of painstaking instructions from one licensee to position the
        transmission at a precise distance from the engine casing. "We
        spent so much time and effort getting it just right. In the end,
        the distance was too big. They told us to readjust it by hitting
        it with a hammer. We had to grit our teeth," he laughs. "But no
        car maker wants even the remotest risk that they will have to
        recall their vehicles." Funding is another concern. BTG, yet to
        make sustained profits, is having to invest huge sums in
        research and in kitting out the factory at Leyland in
        Lancashire. Torotrak has cost more than pounds 10m to develop so
        far and will not be in production in a car before 2001. Half of
        BTG's recent pounds 25m placing proceeds are allocated to
        Torotrak to fund two years' research, yet, as Mr Martin admits,
        Torotrak's appetite for cash is growing. That Torotrak dominates
        BTG's valuation also raises a serious issue. BTG is
        fundamentally a patent licensing group, brimming with more than
        9,000 patented inventions. For investors wary of one-product
        biotechnology companies, BTG has been marketed as a safe and
        unique way to invest in UK technology. But the innovation has
        changed that. As Mr Harvey says: "Torotrak is some 40 per cent
        of our valuation, which exposes us to the risk of failure.
        Torotrak is also a development company, taking BTG out of just
        licensing." The solution, and an option under review, says Mr
        Harvey, is to demerge Torotrak. Whatever happens, Torotrak's
        progress is one roadshow to keep watching. </p>

      <p><b>DRIVING</b> </p>
      <p>Engine at 1200 rpm the big Ford Expedition moves forward or
        backwards at will, cm by cm on the 25 % grade. It could make it
        until it runs out of fuel without overheating or wearing its
        transmission. Full throttle: it rushes forward, the revs quickly
        rising to 3600 before stabilizing gradually at 4200, speed at
        which the big V8 already pumps out all his power. </p>
      <p>On the other hillside, the descent is as slow as wished,
        without brakes, shifter on R, the Ford even willingly and
        gradually restarting in reverse on demand. Then, on the oval of
        the Leyland Technical Center test track it accelerates as a
        plane taking off, its 265 hp not weakening until the wished
        speed is reached. When lifting the foot a 130 kph, the revs
        falls to 1100. They rise immediately again according to the
        required power, but without the slightest feel of delay in the
        pulling force. </p>
      <p>Torotrak do not intend to re-teach the driving to the drivers.
        The tested prototype has a single program only, which simulate
        the behavior of an hydrodynamic converter. A creep identical to
        that of the production Ford AOD is programmed. However the
        passage of D to R or conversely doesn't produce any jerk… of
        course! The shift lever under the steering wheel remains that of
        the production vehicle with the P-R-N-D-2-1 positions. The last
        two provide an effective engine brake, the deceleration
        occurring with a perfect progressiveness. Whether it's in the
        traffic or on the track, the Torotrak transmission is extremely
        pleasant. The engine winds up in revs only if the driver asks
        for real power. Most of the times it revs at less than 1500 rpm
        and becomes virtually inaudible, but stays ready to pounce like
        an eager cat if necessary. The computer constantly chooses the
        optimal ratio and the driver is freed of any concern about what
        the transmission does or is going to do. In brief: sensational!
      </p>
      <p><b>SOON IN PRODUCTION?</b> </p>
      <p>9 OEMs and transmission manufacturers acquired licenses, among
        which quite recently ZF Friedrichshafen AG and the Japanese
        tractor maker Iseki. It is said that several prototypes equipped
        with Torotrak transmissions are being tested on the road and the
        rumor runs that BMW might be the first car manufacturer to
        market the Torotrak IVT. The British firm equipped in 2001 some
        Chevrolet Suburban/Tahoe and Ford Expedition for evaluation by
        their OEMs, amongst them the one the author had the privilege to
        test drive. Those impressive SUV of 2.3 T are propelled by 5 to
        5,4 liters V8s; their trials were satisfactory in every
        respects. GM declared the concept production ready, but prefers
        to leave the manufacture to specialized Tier 1s like Aisin AW.
        At least Getrag and probably ZF might also produce the
        transmission under license. Ford and ZF seem convinced of the
        advantages of the Torotrak IVT as it sprang out of recent
        official declarations. </p>
      <p>The efficiency of this pre-production type would exceed the 91
        % with a slip in the order of 1 %. If the ratio span of the
        variator itself reaches 5, it is widened up to the infinite
        (vehicle stopped) and inversion by the regrouping epicyclical
        gear set. </p>
      <p><b>TOROTRAK</b> </p>
      <p>Founded in 1988 as a BTG department, the firm employs at
        present a hundred highly qualified persons and holds more than
        250 patents. It took up the technology developed separately by
        different teams – notably Leyland Trucks – brought together the
        engineers and the competent executives, invested in a building
        and brand new installations involving notably a workshop
        equipped to assemble simultaneously 10 transmissions, 7
        transmission test benches, 2 rollers test benches for vehicles,
        4 vehicles lifts and an assembly hall. Its funds results mainly
        from the £ 50 million obtained in 1998 at a stock exchange
        flotation during its demerger from BTG. </p>
      <p>Since the beginning of 2002 more than 300 engineers and
        executives of different OEMs and transmission manufacturers
        test-drove the prototypes during demonstrations in Germany, in

        their latest developments at the CVT 2002 Congress in Munich and
        at the SAE 2003 Transmission &amp; Driveline Systems Symposium
        in March 2003 at Detroit. They stated that the power

        <p><b><font size="+1">Formula 1 in New Technology Shock</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>At the risk of sounding like a scene from The Life of Brian I
        have to ask, “What has Formula 1 racing ever done for us?” </p>
      <p>It is a valid question; I cannot think of any significant
        technological advance that to come from Formula 1 racing. Anyone
        who knows different is welcome to leave a comment by way of a
        correction. </p>
      <p>There is always hope that one day Formula 1 will give the world
        of motoring something worthwhile; whether it is developing a new
        technology or embodying some desirable system. It may be that
        2009 will be the year for good to be done, as Formula 1 cars
        incorporate a Torotrak transmission within the driveline. </p>
      <p>What is a Torotrak drive? </p>
      <p>It is a vehicle transmission that does not rely on fixed gear
        ratios but offers a stepless spread of gear ratios between fixed
        upper and lower limits. It is not a new idea; the basic
        principles can be traced back to the 1930s, when it was known as
        the Perbury drive, but it needed materials and particularly
        lubricants that were not developed until the 1980s in order to
        work properly. To understand how the Torotrak works imagine an
        axle with two flat-faced discs mounted so that both are free to
        spin independently. Between the faces of the disks - parallel to
        the axle - is a roller, fixed in space but free to spin, with
        the circumference of the roller touching both disks. If you turn
        one disk the other disk will rotate in the opposite direction at
        the same speed. The principle is similar to the differential
        gear but relying on friction rather than meshing gears to
        transmit drive. </p>
      <p>If the roller was not parallel to the axle but at an angle so
        that the roller described a larger circle on the face of one
        disk than the other then the two disks will turn at different
        speeds and there will be a torque multiplication or reduction
        depending on which disk is driven. Flat-faced disks are no good
        for a variable ratio transmission so the opposing faces of the
        disks are machined with circular tracks of curved cross section.
        The curved tracks mean that the roller (usually the real
        Torotrak has 2 or 3 to reduce wear) remains in contact with the
        opposing faces as it is tilted. To reduce stress on the friction
        components the output disk has the curved tracks on both faces
        and is sandwiched between two sets of rollers and facing input
        disks. The Torotrak transmission also incorporates an epicyclic
        gear set and a couple of clutches (which can be engaged or
        disengaged but never slip). One of the input disks drives the
        planet carrier, the output disk drives the sunwheel and the
        annulus drives the car. </p>
      <p>It would be too much to hope that the Torotrak was going to
        replace the conventional transmission of a Formula 1 racing car.
        There is no reason why it wouldn’t work; back in 1994 or 5
        Williams tried a Van Doorne CVT drive in their then current F1
        car and David Coulthard lapped Silverstone two seconds faster
        than he managed in an identical car with conventional
        transmission. Two seconds, thanks to the oft derided “rubber
        band” transmission was a considerable and worthwhile advantage.
        Before Williams could incorporate the transmission in a racing
        car the rules were changed and such transmissions were banned.
        The Torotrak would offer similar advantages and probably enjoys
        similar prohibition. </p>
      <p>So how is the Torotrak to be incorporated? In some sort of
        effort to appeal to or appease the environmental movement
        Formula 1 want to be seen as more ecologically aware and
        incorporate energy saving devices into F1 cars. One idea is a
        kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) which is another old idea
        brought up to date. Rather than “wasting” energy converting
        kinetic energy to heat when braking, kinetic energy is used to
        spin up a flywheel which can be disconnected from the drive line
        and reconnected when the stored energy can be put to good use
        driving the car. It is an old idea because the Swiss used it in
        busses working in hilly areas; energy “gained” running down one
        hill could be stored and used to assist the climb up the next
        hill. By using a Torotrak drive rather than a simple clutch the
        energy sent to or recovered from the flywheel can be controlled
        with greater subtlety. </p>
      <p>Torotrak PLC (the name of the British company owning the rights
        to the Torotrak drive) have granted a license to Xtrax, the
        transmission specialists, to incorporate the Torotrak drive in a
        gearbox with a KERS. The idea is to provide a more compact,
        lighter, more efficient means of energy storage than electrical
        batteries. The hope is that not only will racing teams adopt the
        technology but that it will find its way into road cars too. </p>
      <p>My hope is that the publicity given to the Torotrak
        transmission as a result of the F1 association will act as a
        catalyst for someone to put a Torotrak transmission in a car
        that people can buy. Just imagine an automatic transmission that
        overcomes all the limitations of conventional automatics. With
        luxury cars adopting seven and eight speed automatics a
        transmission that can be in the right gear all the time by
        eschewing the established conventions of fixed ratios has to be
        a good idea. </p>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Application of Torotrak IVT to
          Optare Bus Delivers 19% Improvement in Fuel Economy</span></center>
      <br>
      Torotrak, a developer of full-toroidal traction drive technology,
      and Optare UK, one of Europe’s largest bus manufacturers, have
      recently achieved a 19% improvement in fuel economy in an Optare
      Solo Bus by replacing the standard fit 5-speed automatic
      transmission with a prototype Infinitely Variable Transmission
      (IVT).
      <p>Computer simulation of an optimized “production intent” IVT
        design demonstrates further efficiencies that increase the
        improvement in fuel economy to 23%. </p>
      <p>An Optare Solo European Midi-Bus was selected as the IVT test
        vehicle. The 11,300 kg gross design weight Solo accommodates up
        to 60 passengers and is fitted with a Euro-3 compliant
        four-cylinder diesel engine and a 5-speed automatic
        transmission. </p>
      <p>The standard fit 5 speed automatic transmission was replaced
        with a prototype IVT, originally developed for a Sports Utility
        Vehicle (SUV), with gearing modified to suit the Optare
        application. Testing was independently performed on the
        “Millbrook London Transport Bus” (MLTB) Cycle, at Millbrook
        Proving Ground, UK. The MLTB is an intensive stop-start cycle
        replicating a demanding urban bus route. </p>
      <p>The core of the IVT is Torotrak’s ‘variator’, which comprises
        four identically shaped discs, being two input discs (shaded
        green in figure above) and two opposing output discs (shaded
        yellow), that form two symmetrical cavities. Each disc is formed
        so that the space created between the opposing pair of input and
        output discs is doughnut shaped; that is, the toroidal surfaces
        on each disc form the toroidal cavity. </p>
      <p>Each cavity contains three rollers, positioned so that the
        outer edge of each roller is in contact with the toroidal
        surfaces of the input and the output discs. When power is
        supplied to the input disc, the disc rotates and the power is
        transferred via the rollers to the output disc, which rotates in
        the opposite direction to the input disc. </p>
      <p>The full-toroidal traction drive variator is torque controlled,
        meaning that the required system torque is set by hydraulic
        pressure and the variator follows the ratio automatically. Force
        is applied to the rollers via hydro-mechanical actuation which
        determines the output torque, and the variator is clamped
        together via a simple hydraulic end-load arrangement. </p>
      <p>The transfer of power through the contacting surfaces of the
        discs and rollers takes place via a microscopic film of traction
        fluid. This fluid separates the rolling surfaces of the discs
        and rollers at their contact points and prevents metal-to-metal
        contact, increasing the durability and life of the variator
        components. The hydraulic forces and clamping pressures act at
        the contact points between the rollers and discs to make the
        traction fluid highly viscous, creating an efficient traction
        drive mechanism for transferring power between the rotating
        discs and rollers, both smoothly and quietly. </p>
      <p>The variator alone cannot provide neutral and reverse drive,
        nor can it provide the ratio spread to achieve high overdrive.
        However, the torque control capability of Torotrak’s IVT allows
        the variator to be incorporated within a “two regime mechanical
        shunt” transmission arrangement to provide forward and reverse
        operation, generation of high output torques and extraordinary
        overdrive capabilities (approximately 60 mph / 1000 rpm). In
        addition, the IVT employs a geared neutral function which
        provides a zero output speed with the engine rotating so
        eliminating the need for an inefficient starting device such as
        a slipping clutch or torque converter. </p>
      <p>Due to the ratio range and the torque controlled nature of the
        transmission, the IVT is able to decouple engine speed from
        vehicle wheel speed while accurately defining the load demand
        placed upon the engine. These features enable the engine to be
        operated at its optimum engine speed and load condition,
        regardless of the vehicle speed or power demand, so maximizing
        fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. </p>
      <p>The result of this driveline control strategy is a vehicle
        which is simple to drive and that offers a smooth, gear shift
        free ride for the passengers, while delivering excellent fuel
        economy with a steadier and lower engine speed. </p>
      <p>In addition to the power train efficiency benefits, the IVT
        also provides additional functionality including: </p>
      <p>An automatic anti-rollback feature, without making use of the
        foundation brakes, where sufficient torque is applied to the
        wheels to ensure a stationary vehicle. A safety feature that can
        only be applied with a ‘geared neutral’ system. </p>
      <p>An enhanced engine braking feature mimicking the electric
        retarder fitted on the base vehicle—the IVT increases the engine
        speed to fully exploit the overrun torque absorbing capability
        of the engine whilst maintaining the desired vehicle speed.
        Hence the retarder can be deleted. </p>
      <p>The IVT decouples the engine speed from the vehicle speed
        enabling engine design to exploit new combustion regimes, such
        as HCCI, that are not easily accessed when using fixed ratio
        transmissions. </p>
      <p>By operating the engine at the most efficient point then,
        depending upon application, the IVT may enable downsizing of the
        engine leading to further efficiency, fuel economy and carbon
        improvements. <br>
        For ultimate fuel economy, the IVT can itself be incorporated
        into a hybrid driveline. With the torque controlled nature of
        the transmission and the ability to manage power flow in either
        direction, the IVT is able to transfer power to and from any
        energy storage system—not only an electrical hybrid arrangement
        but also enabling mechanical hybrid systems. </p>
      <p>Torotrak and Optare are now in exploratory discussions with
        partners regarding series production. </p>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Torotrak Infinitely Variable
          Transmission Finds Business in Outdoor Power, Targets Hybrids
          for the Future</span></center>
      15 December 2005
      <p>Torotrak, the UK developer of a fuel-efficient toroidal
        “infinitely variable transmission” (IVT), has formed a 50–50
        joint venture with MTD Holdings Inc to apply technology to the
        Outdoor Power Equipment (OPE) market. </p>
      <p>The new venture, named Infinitrak, will boost Torotrak’s
        revenue while the company continues to work on placing its IVT
        not just in conventional vehicles, but in new parallel-hybrid
        systems as well. An IVT-based parallel hybrid can, according to
        the company, provide a greater than 35% increase in fuel
        efficiency over conventional vehicles, thereby matching the fuel
        efficiency gains of more complex and expensive series-parallel
        hybrid drives. </p>
      <p><b>The outdoor power deal</b>. Under the terms of the joint
        venture, Torotrak will vest in Infinitrak exclusive global
        rights to IVT technology in the 0-25kw power range, and
        exclusive North American rights in the 25-45kW power range for
        certain products. </p>
      <p>Infinitrak expects to commence manufacture of IVT units in
        2006. Production in the first full year of manufacture is
        expected to exceed 100,000 units. The OPE Market includes annual
        sales of more than 2 million powered ride-on products in the
        United States alone. </p>
      <p><b>The automotive market</b>. Automotive, however, remains the
        key target market for Torotrak, which has been working with
        Equos and Koyo for a number of years to develop production
        prototypes of the IVT, although the company has yet to ink a
        volume distribution deal with an auto major. (Hence the
        importance of the outdoor power market as a revenue stream.) </p>
      <p>Equos is the company within the Aisin AW group that undertakes
        new product development. Aisin is the world&amp;rsquo;s largest
        tier 1 supplier of automatic transmissions, and a key early
        partner with Toyota in the development of the Hybrid Synergy
        Drive. </p>
      <p>According to Torotrak CEO Dick Elsy, the company is making
        progress with its automotive work. </p>
      <p>The current three-way project to develop a transmission with
        Equos and Koyo is now focused on the calibration of the compact
        IVT in the unnamed target customer&amp;rsquo;s vehicle. </p>
      <p><i>The calibration process is crucial to getting the best out
          of the transmission in the eyes of their customer, one of the
          world&amp;rsquo;s foremost car companies. This involves a
          comprehensive optimization of engine and transmission, to
          achieve the optimum combination of fuel economy, performance
          and driving feel. This is a normal but critical development
          process for any new transmission.</i> </p>
      <p><i>The continued extensive evaluation of IVT by another global
          car company has led to a program of work to understand the
          performance of IVT in a specific vehicle which they
          manufacture. This vehicle, which features a large diesel
          engine, already enjoys good fuel economy but we have been able
          to demonstrate that a further improvement of 9.5% is possible
          with the IVT design considered for this application.</i> </p>
      <p><i>The competitive bidding process started last year by a
          further car company has reached the point where that company
          has informed the bidders that it wishes to consider working
          with another car company using the same transmission
          manufacturer to build IVTs. Torotrak is assisting in this
          process to bring together interested parties to realize this
          goal.&nbsp; --- </i>Dick Elsy, CEO </p>
      <p>A decision by Toyota Motor in 2000 to terminate a licence
        agreement with Torotrak sent the company&amp;rsquo;s shares
        plummeting more than 60%. Toyota gave as its reason
        &amp;ldquo;unacceptable driveability&amp;rdquo; in the form of
        vibration in the Toyota IVT-equipped prototype. </p>
      <p>At the time, Torotrak's potential had pushed the
        company&amp;rsquo;s valuation to nearly £400 million (US$705
        million). A similar decision by GM early in 2002 had a similar
        effect, precipitously knocking down the stock price even
        further. </p>
      <p><b>The IVT</b>. Torotrak was created in 1998 out of the BTG
        Group, although work on what would become the Torotrak IVT began
        in 1988. This type of approach to a transmission has a long
        history, reaching back to an 1877 patent by Charles Hunt. </p>
      <p>Key elements of the IVT are: </p>
      <p><b>The input gearset</b>. The input gearset transmits the power
        from the engine via the low regime clutch to the planet gear in
        the epicyclic gear train. </p>
      <p><b>The variator</b>. The variator is the means by which the IVT
        can deliver an infinite range of ratios. It effects the speed of
        rotation of the sun gear in the epicyclic and is responsible for
        the smooth variation of ratios which the Torotrak transmission
        produces. </p>
      <p>Inside the variator are two pairs of discs. The space between
        each pair of discs forms a hollow doughnut shape or toroid.
        Within each toroidal space there are three rollers. These
        rollers transmit drive from the outer, engine driven, discs to
        the output discs located in the centre. The rollers transfer
        power between the input discs and the output discs via a <b>traction







          fluid</b>. </p>
      <p>Each roller is attached to a hydraulic piston. The pressure in
        the pistons can be increased or decreased to create a range of
        reaction torque within the variator. </p>
      <p>When the rotational velocities of the input and/or output discs
        change, the rollers automatically alter their inclination in
        order to adjust to the new operating conditions. </p>
      <p>By varying the angles of the variators, the drive ratio can be
        changed infinitely, and by using a system of lockable clutches
        and the epicyclic gearset, the drive transmitted to the road
        wheels is totally seamless, unlike that of a conventional
        automatic, in which fixed ratios are engaged as required. </p>
      <p><b>Traction fluid.</b> The traction fluid --- a special oil ---
        separates the rollers from the discs. Long chain molecules used
        in the traction fluid interlock with each other when the fluid
        is compressed, becoming highly viscous (glassy) under pressure.
        As pressure is exerted at the contact points between the rollers
        and the discs the oil resists the tendency to slide and
        transmits the power effectively. </p>
      <p>Thus, power transmission in the IVT is achieved by traction,
        (by shearing the thin, elasto-hydrodynamic fluid film) and not
        through metal-to-metal friction. </p>
      <p><b>Epicyclic (planetary) gearset</b>. The central gear (sun
        gear) is driven by the output of the variator. The planet gears
        are driven directly by the engine. The outer annulus gear is
        connected to the wheels. The change of ratio in the variator
        (the speed it transmits) alters the relative speeds of the sun
        and planet gears. </p>
      <p><b>Fixed ratio chain.</b> This takes the drive from the output
        discs and transmits it to the sun gear of the epicyclic gearset
        and the input of the <b>high regime clutch</b>. </p>
      <p><b>High regime clutch</b>. The Torotrak IVT operates in two
        regimes activated by the engagement and disengagement of
        clutches which act as on/off switches. In low regime the
        epicyclic gearset is included in the power path from the engine.
        In high regime the output from the variator is directly
        connected to the road wheels. </p>
      <p>The basic IVT offers four main benefits: </p>
      <p><b>Torque-Based Control</b>. The IVT is torque controlled,
        which essentially means that the required system torque is set
        by hydraulic pressure and the variator follows the ratio
        automatically. This control approach eliminates the need for a
        starting device such as a torque converter or friction clutch
        (also adding to the increased fuel efficiency). </p>
      <p><b>High Overdrive</b>. Very high levels of overdrive have been
        demonstrated in vehicles equipped with Torotrak-IVT -- the
        Expedition test vehicles have achieved 74mph @ 1,000 rpm. </p>
      <p><b>Optimized Engine Running</b>. The ratio range of the IVT
        provides an almost total decoupling of engine and vehicle speed.
        Thus a control line can be set which, for any given power
        demand, will operate the engine at a pre-determined torque and
        speed, largely independent of vehicle speed. This control line
        ensures that the engine always operates at minimum specific fuel
        consumption, i.e. at maximum efficiency. Typically, this means
        that the engine operates at low speed (reduced friction losses)
        and high torque (reduced throttling losses). </p>
      <p>Fixed ratio transmissions, with a smaller ratio range, must
        operate at higher speed and lower torque when delivering the
        same power to the wheels&amp;mdash;hence their inferior fuel
        economy. In practice, the control line is the result of a
        multi-variable optimization, to ensure emissions and NVH are
        also controlled to provide the optimum trade-off. The result is
        that the IVT delivers a validated fuel economy benefit of 20%
        over a conventional four-speed automatic transmission, and more
        than 10% over a six-speed automatic transmission with emissions
        well within requirements. </p>
      <p><b>Low-Speed Control</b>. The IVT is able to provide sensitive,
        safe control of vehicle speed under extreme conditions, without
        the need for a low range gearset. </p>
      <p>Torotrak has recently developed a lower-cost variator control
        mechanism&amp;mdash;Epicycloidal Roller Control
        (ERC)&amp;mdash;that promises further significant cost
        reductions for the transmission. </p>
      <p><b>The IVT in Hybrids</b>. On the hybrid front, Torotrak is
        collaborating with Cranfield University in developing a
        parallel-hybrid IVT applied in the Ford Expedition. </p>
      <p><i>We are able to offer a 20% fuel economy improvement from the
          fitment of IVT to a conventional vehicle growing to more than
          35% improvement with the parallel hybrid IVT derivative.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Our results also show that the hybrid IVT is capable of
          producing very significant fuel economy gains whilst the
          vehicle is cruising at speed --- an area where many current
          generation hybrid vehicles perform relatively poorly. These
          results bode well for "real-world" fuel economy
          improvement.&nbsp; --- </i>Dick Elsy. </p>
      <p>Achieving reductions in fuel consumption at highway speeds is
        one of the design rationales behind the GM-Chrysler-BMW work on
        a two-mode hybrid system. </p>
      <p>Basically, Torotrak's contention is that a parallel-hybrid
        drive (a "mild" hybrid where the electric motor provides
        additive traction but does not drive the vehicle on its own)
        built with an IVT could match the increased fuel efficiency
        benefit of a more complex, series-parallel ("power split")
        hybrid architecture (e.g., the Prius), but at lower cost and
        less complexity -- primarily through the efficiencies gained
        from the optimum control of the engine. </p>
      <p>In other words, Torotrak is suggesting that although its IVT
        hybrid wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have an all-electric mode, its
        increased base engine efficiency combined with the boost from
        the electric motor would match the fuel efficiency of
        series-parallel hybrids on the market (and be less expensive). </p>
      <p>To test this out, Torotrak is working with Cranfield University
        and Newage (an electric motor company) with support from UK
        Government program, Foresight Vehicle. The purpose of the
        project --- Electrically Assisted Infinitely Variable
        Transmission --- is to quantify the combined benefits in
        combining a mild parallel hybrid system with IVT, first through
        modelling and then in a physical vehicle. </p>

      <center>
        <p><b><font size="+1">What is an IVT</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The IVT moves away from the constraints of stepped ratio
        automatic transmissions and unlike Continuously Variable
        Transmissions there is no torque limitation. The ratio range is
        provided not by a system of gears, as found in a conventional
        automatic transmission, but by a variator which consists of a
        set of discs and rollers and is termed a 'full toroidal'
        variator (more information on how the variator works can be
        found here). </p>
      <p>The IVT technology allows control of the complete powertrain
        enabling optimisation of the efficiency of the engine. In
        conventional transmissions the engine and transmission are
        controlled separately. </p>
      <p>The IVT is torque controlled rather than ratio controlled. The
        software determines the torque required at the road wheels and
        then requests torque from the transmission rather than setting a
        specific ratio. The engine can then be used to deliver the power
        at its most efficient operating point. In conventional
        automatics where the gear ratios are fixed the engine only runs
        at its most efficient operating points for short periods of
        time. </p>
      <p>This optimisation of the entire powertrain brings about a fuel
        economy benefit in three ways: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Due to the geared neutral feature of the
        IVT the engine can be directly connected to the road wheels
        whilst the vehicle is stationary. There is no need for a
        separate starting device such as an inefficient torque
        converter. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Due to its wide ratio spread the IVT
        provides the ability for the engine to run at a high overdrive
        of 74mph/1000rpm. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Because the IVT does not have discrete
        ratio steps it can run the engine at optimum conditions for fuel
        economy and emissions. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Core IVT benefits</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Running an engine at optimum conditions</b> </p>
      <p>The exceptional ratio range of the IVT provides an almost total
        decoupling of engine and vehicle speed. For any given power
        demand the IVT will operate the engine at a pre-determined
        torque and speed, largely independent of vehicle speed. This
        ensures that the engine always operates at minimum specific fuel
        consumption, i.e. at maximum efficiency. Typically, this means
        that the engine operates at low speed (reduced friction losses)
        and high torque (reduced throttling losses). <br>
        ‘Geared neutral’ </p>
      <p>The IVT has a feature termed ‘geared neutral’ where the engine
        can be connected to the road wheels whilst the vehicle is
        stationary (for information on how this is achieved please see
        the epicyclic page in the ‘How It Works’ section). This feature
        delivers a number of benefits including: </p>
      <p><b>No need for an inefficient starting device such as a torque
          converter.</b> </p>
      <p>Continuous torque at the wheels. <br>
        Accurate control of the vehicle at low speeds. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Overview of the IVT system</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>A generic simplified layout of the IVT is shown below, this
        represents a layshaft layout, a coaxial layout is also possible.
        Beneath the diagram a brief description of each component is
        given. </p>
      <p><b>The variator</b> - is how the Torotrak IVT creates its
        continuous variation of ratio. </p>
      <p><b>The input gearset</b> - transmits the power from the engine
        via the low regime clutch to the planet gear in the epicyclic
        gear train. </p>
      <p><b>The epicyclic gearset</b> - is the means by which the
        running engine can be connected to the stationary road wheels
        without a slipping clutch or torque converter. </p>
      <p><b>Fixed ratio chain</b> - takes the drive from the output
        discs and transmits it to the sun gear of the epicyclic gearset
        and the input of the high regime clutch. An idling gear can be
        used instead of a chain. </p>
      <p><b>High regime clutch</b> - engaged for all forward speeds
        above the equivalent of a second gear. </p>
      <p>The IVT facilitates the optimum management of the engine by use
        of computer control. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Full Toroidal Variator</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Variator</b> </p>
      <p>Above is the Torotrak variator, it affects the speed of
        rotation of the sun gear and is responsible for the smooth
        variation of ratios, which the Torotrak transmission produces. </p>
      <p>Inside the variator are two pairs of discs. The space between
        each pair of discs forms a hollow doughnut shape or 'toroid'.
        Within each toroidal space there are three rollers. These
        rollers transmit drive from the outer, engine driven, discs to
        the output discs located in the centre. The rollers transfer
        power between the input discs and the output discs via a
        traction fluid. </p>
      <p>Each roller is attached to a hydraulic piston. The pressure in
        the pistons can be increased or decreased to create a range of
        reaction torque within the variator. </p>
      <p>The variator shown on this page is an inline piston design,
        where the packaging requirements require a compact lever
        arrangement can be used as shown in the picture below. </p>
      <p><b>Compact levers variator</b> </p>
      <p>A new even more compact version of the variator has recently
        been developed where the rollers are all controlled by one
        piston. Torotrak have termed this design 'Epicycloidal Roller
        Control' (ERC). A movie clip showing the basic operation can be
        accessed form the bottom of the related links section. More
        details on this new design will be added to this website early
        in 2006. </p>
