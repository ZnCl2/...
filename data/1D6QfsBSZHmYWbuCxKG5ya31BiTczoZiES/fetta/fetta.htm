      Nasa is a major player in space science, so when a team from the
      agency this week presents evidence that "impossible" microwave
      thrusters seem to work, something strange is definitely going on.
      Either the results are completely wrong, or Nasa has confirmed a
      major breakthrough in space propulsion.<br>
      <br>
      British scientist Roger Shawyer has been trying to interest people
      in his EmDrive for some years through his company SPR Ltd. Shawyer
      claims the EmDrive converts electric power into thrust, without
      the need for any propellant by bouncing microwaves around in a
      closed container. He has built a number of demonstration systems,
      but critics reject his relativity-based theory and insist that,
      according to the law of conservation of momentum, it cannot work.<br>
      <br>
      According to good scientific practice, an independent third party
      needed to replicate Shawyer's results. As Wired.co.uk reported,
      this happened last year when a Chinese team built its own EmDrive
      and confirmed that it produced 720 mN (about 72 grams) of thrust,
      enough for a practical satellite thruster. Such a thruster could
      be powered by solar electricity, eliminating the need for the
      supply of propellant that occupies up to half the launch mass of
      many satellites. The Chinese work attracted little attention; it
      seems that nobody in the West believed in it.<br>
      <br>
      However, a US scientist, Guido Fetta, has built his own
      propellant-less microwave thruster, and managed to persuade Nasa
      to test it out. The test results were presented on July 30 at the
      50th Joint Propulsion Conference in Cleveland, Ohio. Astonishingly
      enough, they are positive.<br>
      <br>
      The Nasa team based at the Johnson Space Centre gave its paper the
      title "Anomalous Thrust Production from an RF [radio frequency]
      Test Device Measured on a Low-Thrust Torsion Pendulum". The five
      researchers spent six days setting up test equipment followed by
      two days of experiments with various configurations. These tests
      included using a "null drive" similar to the live version but
      modified so it would not work, and using a device which would
      produce the same load on the apparatus to establish whether the
      effect might be produced by some effect unrelated to the actual
      drive. They also turned the drive around the other way to check
      whether that had any effect.<br>
      <br>
      Back in the 90s, Nasa tested what was claimed to be an antigravity
      device based on spinning superconducting discs. That was reported
      to give good test results, until researchers realised that
      interference from the device was affecting their measuring
      instruments. They have probably learned a lot since then.<br>
      <br>
      The torsion balance they used to test the thrust was sensitive
      enough to detect a thrust of less than ten micronewtons, but the
      drive actually produced 30 to 50 micronewtons -- less than a
      thousandth of the Chinese results, but emphatically a positive
      result, in spite of the law of conservation of momentum:<br>
      <br>
      "Test results indicate that the RF resonant cavity thruster
      design, which is unique as an electric propulsion device, is
      producing a force that is not attributable to any classical
      electromagnetic phenomenon and therefore is potentially
      demonstrating an interaction with the quantum vacuum virtual
      plasma."<br>
      <br>
      This last line implies that the drive may work by pushing against
      the ghostly cloud of particles and anti-particles that are
      constantly popping into being and disappearing again in empty
      space. But the Nasa team has avoided trying to explain its results
      in favour of simply reporting what it found: "This paper will not
      address the physics of the quantum vacuum plasma thruster, but
      instead will describe the test integration, test operations, and
      the results obtained from the test campaign."<br>
      <br>
      The drive's inventor, Guido Fetta calls it the "Cannae Drive",
      which he explains as a reference to the Battle of Cannae in which
      Hannibal decisively defeated a much stronger Roman army: you're at
      your best when you are in a tight corner. However, it's hard not
      to suspect that Star Trek's Engineer Scott -- "I cannae change the
      laws of physics" -- might also be an influence. (It was formerly
      known as the Q-Drive.)<br>
      <br>
      Fetta also presented a paper at AIAA on his drive, "Numerical and
      Experimental Results for a Novel Propulsion Technology Requiring
      no On-Board Propellant". His underlying theory is very different
      to that of the EmDrive, but like Shawyer he has spent years trying
      to persuade sceptics simply to look at it. He seems to have
      succeeded at last.<br>
      <br>
      Shawyer himself, who sent test examples of the EmDrive to the US
      in 2009, sees the similarity between the two.<br>
      <br>
      "From what I understand of the Nasa and Cannae work -- their RF
      thruster actually operates along similar lines to EmDrive, except
      that the asymmetric force derives from a reduced reflection
      coefficient at one end plate," he says. He believes the design
      accounts for the Cannae Drive's comparatively low thrust: "Of
      course this degrades the Q and hence the specific thrust that can
      be obtained."<br>
      <br>
      Fetta is working on a number of projects which he is not able to
      discuss at present, and Nasa's PR team was not able to get any
      comments from the research team. However, it's fair to assume that
      the results will be picked over very closely indeed, like CERN's
      anomalous faster-than-light neutrinos. The neutrino issue was
      cleared up fairly quickly, but given that this appears to be at
      least the third independent propellant-less thruster to work in
      tests, the anomalous thrust may prove much harder to explain away.<br>
      <br>
      A working microwave thruster would radically cut the cost of
      satellites and space stations and extend their working life, drive
      deep-space missions, and take astronauts to Mars in weeks rather
      than months. In hindsight, it may turn out to be another great
      British invention that someone else turned into a success.<br>

      <b>Theory of Operation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Cannae Drive is a resonating cavity with design features that
      redirect the radiation pressure exerted in the cavity to create a
      radiation pressure imbalance on the cavity. This differential in
      radiation pressure generates an unbalanced force that creates
      thrust. The cavity is accelerated without use of propellant...<br>

      <b>Abstract :</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This paper describes the
      eight-day August 2013 test campaign designed to investigate and
      demonstrate viability of using classical magnetoplasmadynamics to
      obtain a propulsive momentum transfer via the quantum vacuum
      virtual plasma. This paper will not address the physics of the
      quantum vacuum plasma thruster, but instead will describe the test
      integration, test operations, and the results obtained from the
      test campaign. Approximately 30-50 micro-Newtons of thrust were
      recorded from an electric propulsion test article consisting
      primarily of a radio frequency (RF) resonant cavity excited at
      approximately 935 megahertz. Testing was performed on a low-thrust
      torsion pendulum that is capable of detecting force at a
      single-digit micronewton level, within a stainless steel vacuum
      chamber with the door closed but at ambient atmospheric pressure.
      Several different test configurations were used, including two
      different test articles as well as a reversal of the test article
      orientation. In addition, the test article was replaced by an RF
      load to verify that the force was not being generated by effects
      not associated with the test article. The two test articles were
      designed by Cannae LLC of Doylestown, Pennsylvania. The torsion
      pendulum was designed, built, and operated by Eagleworks
      Laboratories at the NASA Johnson Space Center of Houston, Texas.
      Approximately six days of test integration were required, followed
      by two days of test operations, during which, technical issues
      were discovered and resolved. Integration of the two test articles
      and their supporting equipment was performed in an iterative
      fashion between the test bench and the vacuum chamber. In other
      words, the test article was tested on the bench, then moved to the
      chamber, then moved back as needed to resolve issues. Manual
      frequency control was required throughout the test. Thrust was
      observed on both test articles, even though one of the test
      articles was designed with the expectation that it would not
      produce thrust. Specifically, one test article contained internal
      physical modifications that were designed to produce thrust, while
      the other did not (with the latter being referred to as the "null"
      test article). Test data gathered includes torsion pendulum
      displacement measurements which are used to calculate generated
      force, still imagery in the visible spectrum to document the
      physical configuration, still imagery in the infrared spectrum to
      characterize the thermal environment, and video imagery. Post-test
      data includes static and animated graphics produced during RF
      resonant cavity characterization using the COMSOL Multiphysics®
      software application. Excerpts from all of the above are included
      and discussed in this paper. Lessons learned from test integration
      and operations include identification of the need to replace
      manual control of the resonant cavity target frequency with an
      automated frequency control capability. Future test plans include
      the development of an automatic frequency control circuit. Test
      results indicate that the RF resonant cavity thruster design,
      which is unique as an electric propulsion device, is producing a
      force that is not attributable to any classical electromagnetic
      phenomenon and therefore is potentially demonstrating an
      interaction with the quantum vacuum virtual plasma. Future test
      plans include independent verification and validation at other
      test facilities.<br>

      Systems and methods for electromagnetic thrusting are disclosed.
      An electromagnetic thrusting system includes an axially-asymmetric
      resonant cavity including a conductive inner surface, the resonant
      cavity adapted to support a standing electromagnetic (EM) wave
      therein, the standing EM wave having an oscillating electric field
      vector defining a z-axis of the resonant cavity. The resonating
      cavity lacks 2nd-axis axial symmetry. The standing EM wave induces
      a net unidirectional force on the resonant cavity.<br>

      A propulsion system for producing a linear and/or a rotational
      force used to propel a vehicle or other body or to serve in other
      applications requiring such a force. The system generates thrust
      by creating specific interactions between resonating
