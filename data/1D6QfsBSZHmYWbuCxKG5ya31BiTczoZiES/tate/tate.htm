      <p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>The Ambient Power Module (APM) is a simple electronic circuit
        which, when connected to antenna and earth ground, will deliver
        low voltage up to several milliwatts. The amount of voltage and
        power will be determined by local radio noise levels and antenna
        dimensions </p>
      <p>Generally a long wire antenna about 100' long and elevated in a
        horizontal position about 30' above ground works best. A longer
        antenna may be required in some locations. Any type copper wire,
        insulated or not, may be used for the antenna. More details
        about the antenna and ground will be discussed further on. </p>
      <p>The actual circuit consists of two oppositely polarized voltage
        doublers (Figure 1). The DC output of each doubler is connected
        in series with the other to maximize voltage without using
        transformers. Single voltage doublers were often found in older
        TV sets for converting 120 VAC to 240 VDC. In the TV circuit the
        operating frequency is 60 Hz. </p>

      <p>The APM operates at radio frequencies, receiving most of its
        power from below 1 MHz. The basic circuit may be combined with a
        variety of voltage regulation schemes, some of which are shown
        in Figure 2. Using the APM-2 to charge small NiCad batteries
        provides effective voltage regulation as well as convenient
        electrical storage. This is accomplished by connecting the APM-2
        as shown in Figure 2B. </p>

        <p><img src="00fig2.jpg" height="358" width="390"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Charging lead acid batteries is not practical because their
        internal leakage is too high for the APM to keep up with.
        Similarly, this system will not provide enough power for
        incandescent lights except in areas of very high radio noise. </p>
      <p>It can be used to power small electronic devices with CMOS
        circuitry, like clocks and calculators. Smoke alarms and low
        voltage LEDs also can be powered by the APM. </p>
      <p>Figure 3 is a characteristic APM power curve measured using
        various loads from 0-19 kOhm. This unit was operating from a
        100' horizontal wire about 25' high in Sausalito CA. As can be
        seen from the plot, power drops rapidly as the load resistance
        decrease from 2 kOhm. This means that low voltage, high
        impedance devices, like digital clocks, calculators and smoke
        alarms are the most likely applications for this power source.
        Some applications are shown in Figures 4 through 7. </p>

      <p>Figure 4 ~ A digital clock is shown powered by the APM-2. The
        1.5 volt clock draws 28 microamps. Its position on the power
        envelope curve would be off the scale to the right and almost on
        the bottom line, dissipating only 42 microwatts. </p>

      <p>Figure 6 shows a clock which has the APM-2 built into it so it
        is only necessary to connect the antenna and ground wires
        directly to the clock. The antenna for this clock, which is a
        low frequency marine type, is shown in Figure 7.These antenna
        are expensive, not generally available, and usually don't work
        any better than the long wire mentioned above. But it may be
        necessary to use them in urban areas where space is limited and
        radio noise is high. </p>

      <p><b>Building the Module</b> </p>
      <p>The builder has a choice of wiring techniques which may be used
        to construct the module. It may be hand wired onto a terminal
        strip, laid out on a bread board, experiment board, or printed
        circuit. Figure 8 shows some of the different ways of
        constructing the APM-2. </p>
      <p>Figure 8A is constructed on a screw strip terminal; Figure 8B
        is constructed on a perforated breadboard; Figure 8C is built on
        a standard experiment board; Figures 8D, 8E, and 8F are all
        printed circuits; Figure 8F is made up on a solder strip
        terminal. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="00fig8.jpg" height="300" width="375"></p>
      </center>
      <p>If you wish to make only one or two units, hand wiring will be
        most practical, either on a terminal strip or breadboard.
        Assembly on the terminal strip (Figure 8A) can be done easily
        and without soldering. It is important to get the polarity
        correct on the electrolytic capacitor. The arrow printed on the
        side of the capacitor points to negative. </p>
      <p>Figure 9 is a closer view of the terminal strip with an
        illustration of the components and how they are connected. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="00fig9.jpg" height="491" width="351"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The breadboard unit is shown in Figure 10 with all components
        on one side and all connections on the other. All you need is a
        2" x 2" piece of perforated breadboard (Radio Shack #276-1395)
        and the components on the parts list. Push component wires
        through the holes and twist them together on the other side.
        Just follow the pattern in the photo, making sure to observe the
        correct polarity on the electrolytic capacitors and the diodes.
        The ceramic capacitors may be inserted in either direction. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="00fig10.jpg" height="416" width="353"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The experiment board unit is assembled by simply pushing the
        component leads into the board as shown in Figure 11. This unit
        is powering a small red LED indicated by the arrow. </p>

        <p><img src="00fig11.jpg" height="234" width="450"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The solder strip unit is made up on a five terminal strip. The
        antenna connection is made to the twisted ends of the ceramic
        capacitors. When soldering the leads of the 1N34 diodes, care
        must be taken to avoid overheating. Clip a heat sink onto the
        lead between the diode and the terminal as shown in Figure 12. </p>

        printed circuits, but the layout of the board is provided in
        Figure 13. </p>

      <p>A small switch may be installed on the board to activate the
        zener regulator (Figure 15). This board was designed for use in
        clocks. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>Antenna Requirements</b> </p>
      <p>The antenna needs to be of sufficient size to supply the APM
        with enough RF current to cause conduction in the germanium
        diodes and charge the ground coupling capacitors. It has been
        found that a long horizontal wire works best. It will work
        better when raised higher. Usually 20-30 feet is required. Lower
        elevations will work, but a longer wire may be necessary. </p>
      <p>In most location, possible supporting structures already exist.
        The wire may be stretched between the top of a building and some
        nearby tree or telephone pole. If live wires are present on the
        building or pole, care should be taken to keep your antenna and
        body well clear of these hazards. </p>
      <p>To mount the wire, standard commercial insulators may be sued
        as well as homemade devices. Plastic pipe makes an excellent
        antenna insulator. Synthetic rope also works very well, and has
        the advantage of being secured simply by tying a knot. It is
        convenient to mount a pulley at some elevated point so the
        antenna wire may be pulled up to it using the rope which doubles
        as an insulator (Figure 16). </p>

        a building and tree for supports. </p>

        <p><img src="00fig17.jpg" height="252" width="389"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Grounding</b> </p>
      <p>Usually a good ground can be established by connecting a wire
        to the water or gas pipes of a building. Solder or screw the
        wire to the APM-2 ground terminal. In buildings with plastic
        pipes or joints, some other hookup must be used. A metal rod or
        pipe may be driven into the ground in a shady location where the
        earth usually is damper. Special copper coated steel rods are
        made for grounds which have the advantage of good bonding to
        copper wire. A ground of this type usually is found within the
        electrical system of most buildings. </p>
      <p>Conduit is a convenient ground provided that the conduit is
        properly grounded. This may be checked with an ohmmeter by
        testing continuity between the conduit and system ground (ground
        rod). Just as with the antenna, keep the ground wire away form
        the hot wires. The APM's ground wire may pass through conduit
        with other wires but should only be installed by qualified
        personnel. </p>
      <p>Grounding in extremely dry ground can be enhanced by burying
        some salts around the rod. The slats will increase the
        conductivity of the ground and also help retain water. More
        information on this subject may be found in an antenna handbook.
      </p>
      <p>Good luck getting your Ambient Power Module working. It is our
        hope that experimenters will find new applications and improve
        the power capabilities of the APM. </p>

        <p><a name="scinews"></a><b><font size="+1">Radio Waves Signal
              Earthquakes</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>From the bright flashes reported to appear in the sky during
        strong earthquakes to computer breakdowns during severe tremors,
        scientists have long suspected that seismic activity is
        associated with a variety of electrical effects. Recently
        researchers have been taking a careful look at this link, with
        an eye toward using it to predict earthquakes. </p>
      <p>One such study is being conducted by Joseph Tate of Ambient
        Research in Sausalito, CA, and William Daily at Lawrence
        Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, CA. With a system of
        radio wave monitors distributed along California's San Andreas
        fault, the researchers have recorded two kinds of changes in
        atmospheric radio waves prior to earthquakes that occurred
        between 1983 and 1986. </p>
      <p>The most common change is a drop in the radio signals that
        normally pervade the air as a result of lightning and human
        sources such as car ignition systems and electric power grids.
        This reduction typically occurs one to six days before an
        earthquake and can last for many hours. For example, a magnitude
        6.2 earthquake that shook Hollister CA in April 1984 was
        preceded six days earlier by a 24-hour drop in radio signals
        being monitored 30 miles from the quake's epicenter. Tate and
        Daily have found that the larger the earthquake, the longer the
        time between the radio wave depression and the quake. </p>
      <p>Laboratory studies have shown that the electrical conductivity
        of rocks increases as they are stressed. Based on this and their
        electrical modeling of the ground, Tate and Daily think the
        increased conductivity of stressed rocks near the fault causes
        more radio waves to be absorbed by the ground rather than their
        traveling through the air. They also plan to test a possible
        link between radio wave drops and the emission of radon gas,
        which itself is thought to be a quake precursor. The radon may
        ionize the air, making it temporarily more absorptive than the
        detector antenna. </p>
      <p>The researchers have also found, in addition to these drops,
        another prequake phenomenon in which short pulses of increased
        radio wave activity are emitted. For example, five days before
        the magnitude 6.5 earthquake hit palm Springs CA in July 1986, a
        station 15 miles from the epicenter detected a rise in radio
        signals. This sort of emission is consistent with laboratory
        work showing that cracking rocks release electromagnetic
        signals. </p>
      <p>Tate says that in their first attempts at predicting
        earthquakes in 1984 and 1985, they did not miss a single event,
        so he his optimistic about using this technique for short-term
        forecasting of San Andreas quakes. "In three to five years", he
        says, "we should be able to issue [earthquake] warnings." </p>

        <p>by </p>
        <p><b>Joe Tate</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Since the earliest days of radio research, many people have
        thought of these invisible waves as artificial, an effect
        created solely by wizards in a laboratory. Later, in the 1930s,
        Karl Jansky discovered radio emissions coming from the Milky
        Way. Stars are now known to be giant transmitters, broadcasting
        a spectrum of electromagnetism from low-frequency noise to gamma
        rays. So much for the artificiality of radio. </p>
      <p>Even in the 19th century, in the days of Tesla and Edison,
        radio noise caused by lightning was known to have recognizable
        propagation patterns. It was these patterns that Jansky was
        measuring when he discovered cosmic radio. </p>
      <p>Tesla actually calculated the resonant frequency of the Earth,
        and proposed that electromagnetic waves of this frequency (6-8
        Hz) should be generated by the planet from the action of
        lightning. These "Schumann resonances", as they came to be
        known, were finally detected in the 1960s. </p>
      <p>Other strange radio emissions were noticed at about the same
        time, a time when many new radio observatories were starting
        operation at various places around the world. The observatories
        could each detect and record a wide range and volume of
        electromagnetic radiation (EMR). Before and during the great
        Chilean earthquake of 1960, unusual strong signals were received
        at six widely scattered radiotelescopes. The connection between
        these radio signals and the earthquake was eventually shown by
        James Warwick of the University of Colorado, who analyzed the
        observatories' separately recorded data (Figure 1) [Not shown].
        Earthquakes generate radio waves! But how? </p>
      <p>Twenty-two years later, after performing a series of laboratory
        experiments in which rocks were crushed in powerful presses and
        the resulting electromagnetic emissions were measured, Warwick's
        paper describing the phenomenon appeared in the April 1982 issue
        of the <i>Journal of Geophysical Research</i>. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, other experimenters had recorded similar
        effects in Japan, France, the United States and the Soviet
        Union. Several studies of satellite data revealed marked
        increases in very-low-frequency (VLF) emissions from epicenter
        regions before and during major earthquakes. In Greece,
        researchers found that telluric currents (natural currents of
        electricity flowing in the Earth) fluctuated prior to
        earthquakes. </p>
      <p><b>Ambient Power</b> </p>
      <p>In 1979, I was experimenting with methods of turning radio
        energy in the air into usable electric power. I developed a
        clock which drew its power from an antenna that was just a long
        piece of wire stretched out horizontally about 20 feet above the
        ground. </p>
      <p>The power supply for the clock worked something like an
        old-style crystal radio, except that it did not have a tuning
        circuit. Because of this, the Crystal Clock (as I called it) was
        able to absorb a wide spectrum of radio noise from the antenna
        and yield electric power. The power supply was able to deliver
        much more current than was developed in a crystal radio,
        although its output was still just a few millivolts. </p>
      <p>In the early 80s I demonstrated the clock to the late Frank
        Oppenheimer, then director of San Francisco's Exploratorium,
        where I worked in the exhibit repair shop. Oppenheimer suggested
        recording the power supply's output over a long period of time
        to determine its dependability. After all, the device relied
        completely on whatever stray signals happened to be in the air.
      </p>
      <p>Using an Atari computer which had been donated to themuseum,
        the oputput of the clock's power supply was measured
        continuously and recorded on floppy disk. This was done by
        feeding the unregulated voltage output direcly into the
        coputer's joystick port. </p>
      <p>I began calling this power supply the "Ambient Power Module"
        (APM) because it extracted power from ambient background radio
        noise. This small circuit, when connected to antenna and ground,
        used the potential difference between air and ground to generate
        a small direct current continuously. </p>
      <p>As we studied the recorded data, mild fluctuations were noted
        in a daily cycle. The patterns were consistent over long periods
        of time, though they differed in different locations. Aside form
        that, the APM looked like a very dependable source of power.
        Until the spring of 1984. </p>
      <p>On April 24, 1984, a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck about 90
        miles from the APM recording station in Sausalito. Days later,
        while looking through the data, I noticed that the APM output
        dropped to less than half its normal value for several hours
        during the afternoon 6 days before the earthquake (Figure 2)
        [Not shown] this was very peculiar, because most of the APM's
        power came from broadcast signals, and broadcasting stations
        hadn't done anything different that afternoon. Apparently
        something had temporarily depressed the propagation of radio
        waves. At high frequencies, such effects can be caused by
        atmospheric conditions. But the lower frequencies involved here
        are hardly affected, particularly not the signals from the
        nearest stations, which account for most of the power received.
        It was tempting to think this strange radio depression might
        somehow have been a precursor to the earthquake. </p>
      <p>Several smaller quakes had occurred in the area during the year
        before. Perhaps these also were preceded by similar radio
        anomalies. Looking back through the accumulated data on the
        APM's power output, indeed, smaller, less obvious radio
        depressions were found to occur prior to the lesser earthquakes.
      </p>
      <p>I called the US Geologic Survey (USGS) office and told them
        about these radio events. I learned from them that ham operators
        in the area had also reported radio noises accompanying
        earthquakes, but no one had recorded them. Jack Everenden, with
        whom I was speaking, asked for copies of my data, which I sent.
      </p>
      <p>Two weeks later, William Daily of Lawrence Livermore Labs
        called, asking if I would like to work with him gathering
        earthquake radio noise data under a grant from the USGS. </p>
      <p><b>Radio Earth</b> </p>
      <p>For the next three years we deployed monitoring/recording
        devices along the San Andreas fault, from San Francisco to San
        Diego. The units were battery-powered paper-chart recorders
        which could hold one month's worth of data. They recorded radio
        noise levels in three adjacent bands: 0.2-1, 1-10 and 10-100
        kHz. In addition we continued using the APM recorders in two
        locations, Sausalito and San Mateo. </p>
      <p>During this period, some 46 earthquakes 4.0 and above occurred
        within 120 miles of our stations. Of these, 32 quakes were
        preceded by a radio anomaly. Only five quakes were not preceded
        by radio precursors. These were also ten false positives (radio
        events with no quakes following). These may have been caused by
        earthquake prepartion forces which failed to mature. Either way,
        our score was about 70%. </p>
      <p>The results of our study were published in October 1989, just
        as the Loma Prieta Earthquake struck northern California. </p>
      <p>By this time we had dismantled our network of recording
        stations. However, one of the original APM recorders was still
        running at my lab in Sausalito. This instrument recorded the
        largest radio depression I have ever seen, about 60 days prior
        to the October 17 shocks (Figure 3) [Not shown]. I had reported
        that event to Galilee Harbor's board of directors, but no action
        was taken. </p>
      <p>In studying several smaller earthquakes from 1985-1987, it
        appeared that the larger the earthquake, the larger and sooner
        the precursors appeared. The 6.0 earthquake of April 24, 1984
        was preceded by a radio depression 6 days before the shock. The
        Loma Prieta Earthquake of about 7.0 magnitude was preceded by a
        much greater radio depression 60 days before. A 7.0 magnitude
        quake is 10 times greater than a 6.0. The 60-day precursor time
        for the 7.0 earthquake was 10 times the precursor time for the
        6.0 earthquake. More data is needed to clarify this
        relationship. </p>
      <p>Warrick's lab showed that fracturing rocks generate radio
        waves: when Westerly granite was crushed in a shielded space, a
        receiving antenna detected broadband signals ranging from 500
        kHz to 30 MHz. Most of the energy was concentrated at the lower
        frequencies. </p>
      <p>Other experimenters measured changes in the electrical
        resistance of rocks under pressure. During the late 1970s,
        William Brace of MIT compressed various rocks in a powerful
        press while recording their resistance. He found that as rocks
        approach fracture pressure, they become much more electrically
        conductive. A related experiment by William Daily at Lawrence
        Livermore Lab subjected rocks to evenly distributed pressure
        while their electrical resistance was measured. Under uniform
        pressure, the rocks did not show the changes in resistance
        produced in Brace's press. That suggested it was stress caused
        by force being applied unevenly which caused the observed
        changes in resistivity. </p>
      <p>Although Warwick's experiment proved rocks can emit radio waves
        during crushing, calculations showed that any such waves
        generated far underground would be absorbed by the earth, never
        reaching the surface with enough energy to be detected in the
        atmosphere. In addition, this effect could not explain the
        decrease of ambient radio energy observed by us and others. </p>
      <p>Takeo Yoshino, of the University of Electro-Communications in
        Tokyo, has proposed that "resistance slots" form along a fault
        line due to effects similar to those demonstrated by Brace.
        Yoshino argues that if ground resistance becomes high enough in
        these slots, then radio waves coming from below will pass
        through them, rather than being absorbed, and enter the
        atmosphere. It would also mean atmospheric radio energy could
        pass into the earth through these slots. This could create
        interesting resonant effects. </p>
      <p>Does ground resistance actually reach the levels needed to
        sustain such an effect? It is known that ground water enhances
        ground conductivity. However, C.B. Raleigh of the USGS has
        calculated that enough heat can be produced by friction during
        the earthquake preparation process to boil the ground water out
        of a rupture zone. Perhaps dehydration could combine with
        stress-induced fluctuations in rock resistance to produce slots
        of heightened electrical resistance in the earth's crust. </p>
      <p>Based on this idea, it is my belief that the radio depressions
        and emissions recorded by us and others are the result of
        fluctuations in ground radio absorption. </p>
      <p>Radio waves moving through the atmosphere are always being
        partly absorbed into the ground. The absorption rate varies from
        place to place, based on the ground's conductance and the
        distribution of rocks and sediments. If anything alters this
        equilibrium, the radio fields in the atmosphere should also be
        affected. For instance, more ground absorption should result in
        a lower intensity in the atmosphere. A loss of absorption would
        produce increased intensity in the atmosphere. Seismic radio
        events may be due to this effect. </p>
      <p>As a model for explaining the observed radio anomalies, this
        has appeal, since it can account for both radio emissions and
        depressions. It could also explain the changes in telluric
        currents recorded in Greece prior to earthquakes. As ground
        conductance changes, currents flowing through the Earth may be
        diverted to channels and zones of greater conductance. </p>
      <p>As more data is gathered, we'll understand more about these
        phenomena. In the meantime, though, we're on a slow learning
        curve, limited by the frequency of large earthquakes. There is
        really no way to speed up this process, and perhaps we don't
        actually want to. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>The ambient broadband radio frequency field
        strength from broadcast stations is monitored (Figure 4) by
        periodic sampling (50, 52). A warning indication is provided if
        the field strength drops significantly. Drops in such field
        strength have been correlated empirically with the occurrence of
        seismic activity, usually several days later. Thus the
        indication serves as an early warning of an impending
        earthquake. In one preferred embodiment, a broadband,
        horizontal, very long monopole antenna (40) was connected to a
        rectifying and smoothing circuit (Figure 3) to provide a dc
        output proportional to the ambient rf field. This voltage is
        digitized (50), and using a suitably programmed computer (52),
        the digital version of the field strength signal is sampled once
        per minute (78). A cumulative or running average of the minute
        samples is calculated (80) and held. Once per hour the latest
        running average is stored (84) and a standard deviation (SD) of
        the last 24 hourly stored running averages is calculated (88).
        If the SD exceeds a predetermined value, 0.3 in one embodiment,
        an alarm is triggered (92). The use of the SD eliminates the
        effect of day-to-day changes in the amounts of the variations of
        the ambient field strength, due to changes in tides and other
        factors. Once per day the samples are written (96) to a
        permanent storage file and a continuous plot of the field
        strength is also made (14). Preferably the alarm is triggered
        only if another detector also provides an indication (FIG. 6),
        thereby to eliminate the effect of machine error. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>Background: Field of Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to the prediction of the fugure
        occurrence of seismic activity, particularly to the advance
        notification of earthquakes through the monitoring of ambient
        radio frequency (rf) energy. </p>
      <p><b>Background: Description of Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>Heretofore, insofar as we are aware, seismology, the science of
        earthquakes, has not been able to make any near-term predictions
        of earthquakes. </p>
      <p>While scientists have known that certain animals may have had
        some sort of advance knowledge of quakes, due to the fact that
        they exhibited peculiar behavior before quakes, and not at other
        times, this behavior has not been consistent and reliable enough
        to be of practical use. </p>
      <p>Also, while scientists have also been able to predict
        thunderstorms in advance by monitoring the ambient electrostatic
        field (see, e.g., US Pat. No. 3,611,365 to Husbyorg and Scuka,
        1968; 3,790,884 to Kohl, 1974; and 4,095,221 to Slocum, 1978),
        they have not been aware of any corresponding system for
        earthquake prediction. </p>
      <p>Scientists have been able actually to detect earthquakes during
        their occurrence by monitoring air pressure variations (e.g., as
        described in US. Pat. No. 4,126,203 to Miller, 1978) and by
        monitoring the earth's physical movement by seismographs but,
        again, science has not been aware of any system for short-term
        advance detection or prediction of quakes. </p>
      <p>Due to the devastating effects of quakes to property, life, and
        limb, public and governmental authorities would derive great
        benefit from any system which could provide short-time advance
        notification of great earthquakes. As it is now, except for
        aftershocks, which seismologists know will occur after any large
        quake, all great and small quakes occur without warning. Because
        people in the vicinity of such quakes are unprepared, they often
        are in places of great vulnerability, such as beside or inside
        collapsible buildings, so that severe and human injury usually
        occurs during a quake. Also, property itself is left vulnerable,
        e.g., by leaving automobiles in or near collapsible buildings,
        leaving gas and electricity connected such that disruption of
        these facilities causes fires, and leaving other valuable
        property in vulnerable areas. If advance notification of a large
        quake could be provided to the public and civil authorities,
        people and valuable property could be evacuated and protected,
        thereby preventing deaths, injuries, and greatly reducing
        property damage. Further, advance notification of quakes would
        eliminate the severe psychological trauma which often affects
        large segments of the populace due to the surprise occurrence of
        quakes. </p>
      <p><b>Objects &amp; Advantages</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly several objects and advantages of the invention are
        to provide a reliable and effective method of earthquake
        prediction, to provide a method of preventing death, injuries,
        and reducing property damage in earthquakes, and to provide a
        method of reducing the psychological trauma which often
        accompanies quakes due to their surprise occurrence. Additional
        objects are to provide such a system which is easy to use,
        economical, reliable, and portable. Further objects will become
        apparent from a consideration of the ensuing description, taken
        in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. </p>
      <p><b>Background: Theory of Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The following is a discussion of the background theory of the
        invention. While we believe it to be technically accurate, we do
        not wish to be limited by this theory since the operability of
        the invention has been empirically verified, as will be apparent
        from the later discussion. </p>
      <p>We have recently worked work with the reception and utilization
        of broadband radio-frequency reception, e.g., for low-power
        utilization applications, as discussed in the copending
        application Ser. No. 06/539,223 of Joseph B. Tate, filed Oct. 6,
        1983. While doing this work, we have noted that the antenna's
        output voltage fluctuated with time due to certain, known
        causes. </p>
      <p>First, we noted that the higher we placed an antenna above the
        ground, the the greater the output signal it provided. We have
        observed this by raising the physical height of an antenna and
        observing an increase in power output, and also by observing
        variations in the output of a fixed antenna near a body of ocean
        water as a function of the tides: the antenna's output was
        greatest at low tide and lowest at high tide. We believe that
        the change in water level, which serves as a ground plane,
        effectively lowers or raises the height of the antenna above the
        ground. </p>
      <p>We also noted that the antenna's output was affected by solar
        flares to a limited extent; these caused the antenna to produce
        a higher output voltage during their occurrence. We believe this
        phenomena is caused by an increase in the level of ambient
        ionization due to the flares. </p>
      <p>Further, we noted that the antenna's output dropped at certain
        irregular times; at first we would not attribute any cause to
        these drops. However investigation enabled us to correlate these
        drops with the subsequent occurrence of seismic activity. We
        found that the magnitude of the drop was proportional to the
        size of the subsequent earthquake. </p>
      <p>Certain phenomena have been discovered to precede earthquakes.
        These include an anomalous uplift of the ground, changes in the
        electrical conductivity of rock, changes in the isotopic
        composition of deep well water, changes in the nature of small
        earthquake activity (e.g., bunching of small foreshocks),
        anomalous ground tilt or strain changes, changes in physical
        properties, such as porosity, electrical conductivity, and
        elastic velocity in the hypocentral region. <i>Earthquake,
          McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science And Technology</i>, 1960;
        <i>Earth</i> by F. Press, W. H. Freeman &amp; Co., 1974. </p>
      <p>Phenomena associated with rocks have attracted much recent
        attention. Wm. Brace of the Mass. Inst. of Technology has found
        that when rocks were squeezed or compressed, just before they
        fractured, they tended to develop hairline cracks, swell or
        dilate (dilatancy), become more porous and electrically
        conductive, and transmitted high frequency seismic-like waves
        more slowly. Two of Brace's former students, Amos Nur of
        Stanford University and Christopher Scholz of Lamont-Doherty
        furthered Brace's work, connecting the dilatancy theory with
        seismic P-wave velocity shifts and rock resistivity changes as a
        precursor for earthquakes. See. e.g., Brace, Orange, and Madden,<i>
          J. Geophys. Res.</i>, 70(22), 5669, 1965; A. Nur, <i>Bull.
          Seis. Soc. of Amer.</i>, V 62, Nr. 5, pp. 1217-1222, 1972
        Oct.; <i>Earthquake</i> by B. Walker, Time-Life Books, 1982. </p>
      <p>Based upon the above background, we have developed a theory as
        to the cause of this drop in antenna output as a precursor or
        predictor of earthquakes. We believe that before a quake occurs,
        the pressure within underground rock bodies temporarily
        increases greatly, causing the rocks to dilate and become
        conductive, in accordance with the works of Brace, Nur, and
        Scholz. This increase in conductivity effectively raises the
        ground plane, thereby causing the antenna's output to decrease
        temporarily. </p>
      <p>Thus before the occurrence of a quake, the underground pressure
        increases greatly temporarily, causing underground rock bodies
        to swell and become more conductive, thereby raising the ground
        plane, which in turn causes the voltaic output of nearby
        antennas to drop. </p>
      <p>We accordingly constructed an apparatus to automatically
        monitor antenna output and provide a suitable indication if the
        output level dropped significantly. The indication was
        calibrated empirically after much experimentation so as to
        filter out the effects of solar- and tide-caused variations. We
        did this by arranging the apparatus so that an output indication
        was provided only if the antenna output dropped a predetermined
        degree beyond its average level; we utilized statistical
        filtering techniques to accomplish this. </p>

      <p>In accordance with the invention, a seismic early warning
        apparatus is provided as shown in FIG. 1. The apparatus consists
        of a housing containing a general purpose computer (not shown),
        a disc drive 10, an analog system comprising a microampere meter
        12 arranged to monitor direct current (which is proportional to
        the ambient rf energy), and a direct current strip chart
        recorder 14 arranged to provide a continuous indication of the
        current antenna output, which will be called the ambient power
        level. A hexidecimal keypad 16 is provided to enter data, such
        as time, for entering programs and changes and for operating the
        system according to preset codes. The time, date, and voltaic
        level of the antenna's output are continuously indicated by
        digital readouts 18, 20, and 22, respectively. A screen display
        24 is provided to display graphic and alphanumeric information
        of the current status of the apparatus and previous data
        records. </p>
      <p>Lastly the apparatus includes four status-indicating lamps,
        which preferably are LEDs (light-emitting diodes) as follows: A
        green LED 26 indicates that the system is on and functioning
        normally. A yellow LED 28 indicates that the system has detected
        an event, namely the occurrence of a drop in ambient power below
        the preset level, which would be the prediction of an impending
        earthquake. A red LED 30 is provided as backup confirmation of
        the occurrence of the event; LED 30 is illuminated when a
        duplicate receiving system also detects an event. A blue LED 32
        indicates initiation of operation of an automatic telephone
        dialer within the system, which has been preprogrammed to dial a
        predetermined number and provide a warning in the event of an
        occurrence of an alarm condition. Lastly the apparatus includes
        a hard copy output port 33 for providing printed graphic and
        numeric outputs of all system data. </p>

          Before Quake</b> </p>

      <p>Figure 2 illustrates a reproduction of an actual plot of a
        voltage as a function of time, which voltage was proportional to
        the ambient RF (radio frequency) level, from the period from
        before to after a relatively large earthquake. This plot, which
        is typical of many we have observed before a quake, was made by
        deriving the voltage with a 30-meter, long-wire monopole antenna
        (not shown) which was mounted horizontally and which extended
        over San Francisco (Richardson) Bay easterly from Sausalito,
        California, 9 meters above sea level. The antenna thus
        intercepted and converted to an RF voltage the ambient RF
        energy, mainly from local (San Francisco area) AM radio
        stations. We rectified and filtered the output of the antenna
        using one-half of the circuit of FIG. 3 (described below) to
        provide a DC voltage which was plotted on a conventional
        ink-on-paper plotter. Note that on the section of the chart for
        Apr. 19 (1984), which begins at time 0:00 (midnight) and ends at
        24:00, the voltage or ambient RF power level at the antenna
        increased and fell and then increased slightly in the 24-hour
        period. This wavelike variation typically occurs on a daily
        basis and is caused by tides: the peaks occurring at low tide
        when the effective ground plane provided by the water drops and
        the troughs occurring at high tide when the ground plane rises.
      </p>
      <p>On Apr. 20, from about 8:00 to about 12:00, a sharp and
        constant-level dip in the ambient rf power occurred, as
        indicated. The magnitude of this pronounced dip is far greater
        than the normal tide-caused variations, as is its beginning and
        ending slope. </p>
      <p>Thereafter, from Apr. 20 to Apr. 23, the plot (not shown)
        continued unremarkably, albeit with a slight variation from
        normal. </p>
      <p>The same occurred on Apr. 24, with the plot actually being
        generally similar to a normal day. However at 13:15 on Apr. 24,
        as indicated, a large, Richter magnitude 6.0 quake occurred near
        Hollister, Calif., about 340 km away from the antenna. No change
        in the plot occurred at this time. </p>
      <p>Correlation of this quake with the plot's marked dip of Apr. 20
        was made by the repeated observation of dozens of similar dips
        and subsequent quakes. Pronounced dips were always followed by a
        quake several days later. Thus we have empirically established
        causal and theoretical connections between pronounced dips of
        the type shown and the occurrence of subsequent seismic
        activity. </p>

      <p>The circuit of Figure 3 is used to convert the ambient RF
        energy to a direct voltage which can be used and handled by data
        processing equipment. Designated an ambient power module (APM),
        it is connected to an antenna 40, preferably a broadband
        monopole antenna of the type described in the preceeding
        section. The distal end of the antenna is free and its proximal
        end is connected to the circuit via two capacitors Cp1 and Cn1,
        each being in series with the signal line for coupling and each
        having a value of 0.047 microfarad. Taking the left or negative
        side of the circuit first, it comprises two rectifiers (diodes)
        Dn1 and Dn2 (1N34 type) and a filter capacitor Cn2 (40
        microfarads). Rectifier Dn1 is connected in parallel to the
        signal path and rectifier Dn2 is connected in series, in the
        well known voltage multiplier arrangement. Capacitor Cn2 is
        connected in parallel across the output of the APM to smooth the
        rectified output. The right or positive side of the circuit is
        similar, except for the polarity of the diodes. </p>
      <p>In operation, an RF voltage is developed across antenna 40;
        this voltage is voltage multiplied by the two rectifiers on each
        side of the circuit. The resultant direct voltages are smoothed
        or filtered by capacitors Cn1 and Cp2 and are supplied to output
        terminals 42 and 44. A positive version of this direct voltage
        is plotted in Figure 2, as described above. </p>

      <p>A computer for performing the monitoring and alarm functions of
        the invention and which is provided within the apparatus of
        Figure 1 is shown in Figure 4. The computer receives the
        positive voltage from the APM (Figure 3) and processes this,
        providing an alarm if the voltage dips a predetermined amount
        from its recent average value. <br>
        The computer comprises an analog to digital converter (ADC) 50
        which is arranged to convert the positive DC voltage from the
        AAPM to digital form, preferably in the form of a parallel
        signal at the output of ADC 50. The digitized voltage from ADC
        50 is supplied to a central processing unit 52, which is a type
        68000 microprocessor or computer on a chip. CPU 52 and ADC 50
        are clocked by a clock 54 in conventional fashion. </p>
      <p>CPU 52 operates on instructions from a program contained in an
        electrically programmed read only memory (EPROM), the program
        being listed later. CPU 52 temporarily stores data in a read and
        write memory (RAM) 58. CPU 52 also supplies output data to
        display screen 24, disc drive 10, and hard-copy printer 26',
        each of which was already described in conjunction with Figure
        1. </p>
      <p>CPU 52 can receive input data manually from hexidecimal keypad
        16 (see FIG. 1) via a keyboard encoder 60. <br>
        CPU 52 can supply an alarm output to a radio transmitter or
        automatic telephone dialer 62 via a modem
        (modulator-demodulator) 64 for connecting the CPU to a phone
        (not shown). </p>
      <p>As also indicated in Figure 4, the negative output of the AAPM
        of Figure 3 is connected to ammeter 12 and chart recorder 14. </p>

        <p><img src="0fig5.jpg" height="411" width="229"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In operation, the system of Figure 4 operates under control of
        the program in EPROM 56 in accordance with the flowchart of
        Figure 5 as follows: </p>
      <p>Startup: Blocks 70 and 72: An initialization and start-up
        sequence is first initiated when the machine is turned on, as
        indicated by block 70; this sets all registers and counters to
        zero. The time and data are then set manually (using EPROM 56),
        as indicated by block 72. </p>
      <p>Clock Reading: Blocks 74 and 76: Next, under automatic program
        control, the machine reads the elapsed time on its clock display
        register, as indicated by block 74. If the "seconds" register
        does not indicate the number one (#1), the machine continues to
        read the clock, as indicated by the "no" output of decision
        block 76. </p>
      <p>Minute Sample: Block 78: When second #1 appears, as it will
        once per minute, the decision in block 76 will be "yes", so that
        the machine will take one sample of the rectified, smoothed, and
        digitized version of the antenna's output, i.e., the output of
        ADC 50 of Figure 4, as indicated in block 78. This sample will
        be taken once per minute, i.e., whenever second #1 is displayed.
      </p>
      <p>Running Average: Block 80: Next, as indicated by block 80, a
        running average of the samples taken in block 78 is calculated.
        This is done by accumulating the samples to keep a running total
        of their values, counting the number of samples accumulated, and
        dividing the running total by the latest number of samples each
        time a new sample is taken. </p>
      <p>Store Hourly Average: Blocks 82 and 84: Next, as indicated in
        block 82, a test is made to see if the time display register
        indicates that minute number one (#1) has come up. If not, the
        decision is "no" and the clock is read again (block 74). If the
        decision is "yes", as it will be once per hour, the running
        average in the accumulator will be stored (block 84) and the
        accumulator will be cleared or reset to zero. </p>
      <p>One Day Test: Block 86 ("No" decision) and Block 94: Next the
        machine makes a test to see if 24 hours have passed. If not, the
        machine will not be able to make any valid statistical
        determinations. Thus it must run at least 24 hours before being
        operative. Assuming the decision in block 86 is negative (24
        hours have not yet elapsed) another test is made (block 94) to
        see if hour zero is indicated, which will occur once per day. If
        hour zero is not indicated, (decision in block 94 is negative),
        the clock will be read again (block 74) in the usual loop. </p>
      <p>Calculate SD: Block 86 ("Yes") and Block 88: If a full day has
        elapsed, so that valid statistics can be calculated ("yes" from
        block 86), the standard deviation (SD) of the last 24 hourly
        averages is calculated, as indicated in block 88. This is done
        once per hour. The calculation is made using the usual SD
        formula </p>
      <p>SDDEV=SQR([sum(x-X).sup.2 ]/n) </p>
      <p>where SDDEV=SD; SQR=the square root; sum=the sum of; x=the
        individual hourly averages; X=the mean of the hourly averages;
        and n=the number of individual hourly averages. Essentially the
        SD is calculated by taking the mean of all of the hourly
        averages, taking the difference or deviation of each hourly
        average from the mean, squaring each deviation, taking the mean
        of the squared deviations, and then taking the square root of
        the mean of the squared deviations. </p>
      <p>Evaluate SD: Block 90: The SD is then evaluated to see if it is
        greater than 0.3. This value has been empirically determined to
        be the level at which the present apparatus will provide a
        reasonably positive indication that an earthquake will occur,
        while neglecting the effects of non-seismic-caused variations.
        If the SD is less than 0.3, (a "no" output from block 90), this
        indicates that the last hourly average was not greatly different
        from the average of the last 24 hourly samples, so that no alarm
        need be indicated. I.e., the antenna's output did not drop
        significantly to indicate an impending earthquake. Thereupon the
        program moves to block 94, where a test is made for the
        existence of hour zero, as described. If, however the SD exceeds
        0.3 ("yes" output of block 90), this indicates that the
        antenna's output has dropped significantly so as to affect the
        last hourly average, thereby to indicate an impending
        earthquake. </p>
      <p>Alarm: Block 92: In response to the Yes output of block 92, an
        alarm is triggered (block 94). The alarm may be a bell, the
        dialing of a telephone to a location where personnel are present
        if the apparatus is placed at a remote or non-manned location,
        or the initiation of the further program of the Flowchart of
        Figure 6, the alarm trigger sequence. To eliminate the
        possibility of equipment failure and to provide confirmation
        from another apparatus at another location, we prefer to provide
        an alarm only upon confirmation from another apparatus, as
        discussed in the description of Figure 6 below. </p>
      <p>Make Record: Block 94 ("Yes") and Block 96: If hour zero is
        being displayed when the operation of block 94 is performed,
        which occurs once per day at midnight, the operation of block 96
        will be performed, i.e., the data in the registers will be
        stored to disc to create a permanent record and the registers
        will be cleared to create new data for the next day. However the
        previous 24 hourly averages are still stored at all times so
        that a valid SD can be calculated and tested every hour. After
        the operation of block 96, the clock is read again in accordance
        with the regular program (block 74). </p>

        <p><img src="0fig6.jpg" height="502" width="295"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The sequence of Figure 6 is performed when the alarm is
        triggered in block 92 of Figure 5 as an optional, but preferred
        backup confirmation of an impending earthquake. The operations
        in the backup confirmation system will be described briefly. </p>
      <p>Beginning with blocks 100 and 102, the system is continually
        tested (hourly) for the occurrence of a SD of the hourly
        averages of greater than 0.3. If the SD is greater than 0.3, the
        alert indicator (28 of Figure 1) is triggered (block 104) and
        the program initiates a test (block 106) to see if a backup
        apparatus (not shown) is present. If so (yes output of block
        106) the backup apparatus is also checked (blocks 108 and 110).
        If the backup does not indicate an excess SD, the indicators are
        reset to normal (block 112), but if backup confirmation is
        received, the alarm indicator (30 of Figure 1) is triggered per
        block 114 and a preprogrammed telephone number is dialed and
        indicator 32 is lit (block 116). </p>
      <p>After the alarm condition is manually checked and the system is
        reset, the output of block 120 will be a "yes" and the system
        will be reset to normal (block 112). If a valid alarm condition
        is indicated and confirmed, civil authorities will have time
        (usually several days) to notify the populace, evacuate the
        area, or take any other needed precautions, depending on the
        size of the impending quake as indicated by the size of the
        standard deviation. </p>
      <p><b>Programs</b> </p>
      <p>The attached computer programs will perform the calculations
        and operations above described. These programs are written in
        the BASIC programming language. Program "RECVOLT.AL" runs
        continuously and writes the information to disc every 24 hours.
        Program "GRASTAT.*" is manually run; it reads data from the disc
        and plots it on the screen or printer, as desired. </p>
      <p>While the above description contains many specifications, these
        should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the
        invention, but merely as an exemplification of one preferred
        embodiment thereof. Many other variations are possible. For
        example, the programming language can be changed, or the
        calculations and operations can be performed with hard-wired
        conventional circuitry in lieu of a programmed computer. More
        than two corroboration receivers can be used, and these can be
        placed at various locations. In lieu of testing the antenna's
        output reception of the area's AM stations, a special, dedicated
        transmitter with a special, dedicated frequency and a
        specially-tuned matching receiver can be used to avoid
        dependence on stations which are not under the control of the
        earthquake prediction system and its personnel. The transmitter
        and the receiver should be spaced apart geographically,
        preferably by at least several km, so that the ground plane
        conduction phenemonon can operate. Also the transmitted signal
        can be a specially-coded or modulated signal, or it can be an
        auxiliary signal of a regular transmitter, e.g., a SSB or SCA
        signal, together with a matching receiver. In lieu of a test for
        an excess SD, the apparatus can be arranged to test for a
        predetermined drop in the value of the antenna output from its
        immediately previous value or its average value over a
        predetermined period, such as an hour or day, or for a drop
        having greater than a predetermined slope. Accordingly the full
        scope of the invention should be determined by the appended
        claims and their legal equivalents, and not by the examples
        given. </p>
