      <p>Royal Raymond Rife (May 16, 1888 – August 5, 1971) claimed to
        have used a special optical microscope to observe very small
        viruses. Bacillus X and Bacillus Y (at some point renamed BX and
        BY viruses) were experimentally isolated, and Rife causally
        linked them to two forms of malignancy (cancer): carcinoma, and
        sarcoma. This renaming of these bacillus forms by Rife to that
        of viruses is now known to have been in error. The limitations
        of optical microscopes, and the size of viruses is such that
        most viruses cannot be seen under an optical microscope.
        Furthermore, the scientific understanding is that the estimated
        15% of human cancers that are caused by viruses are caused by a
        number of different types. Rife's virus claims must therefore be
        seen as mistaken.[1] </p>
      <p>Rife also claimed to have rendered, in the living patient, such
        viruses and many others inert by means of a "beam ray" device,
        which was claimed to devitalize pathogens by inducing resonances
        in their constituent chemicals[2][3]. Rife's treatment has been
        unanimously condemned as worthless by mainstream scientists,[4]
        and "Rife devices" have been blamed for the deaths of cancer
        sufferers who have used them in place of medical
        treatment.[5][6] </p>
      <p><b>Biography</b> </p>
      <p>Rife was of Scottish ancestry,[7] born on May 16, 1888, in
        Elkhorn, Nebraska. While still at university[citation needed],
        he began working part time for Carl Zeiss at their New York
        offices.[8] Rife said that after a while he moved to Germany and
        worked part time for Carl Zeiss at their Heidelberg offices,
        while attending the University of Heidelberg[citation needed].
        Rife also claimed to have worked for six years with Hans Luckel,
        who was Carl Zeiss's optical scientist and researcher.[9] It is
        claimed that Rife learned how to grind parabolic lenses.[10] </p>
      <p>Rife married Mamie Ah Quinn in 1912 and she passed away in
        1957. In 1960, Rife married Amelia Aragon. Rife died on August
        5, 1971 in Grossmont Hospital, El Cajon, California, from a
        combination of valium and alcohol, at the age of 83.[11] </p>
      <p><b>Rife's Microscopes</b> </p>
      <p>Rife built a number of microscopes. Rife 1 through to Rife 5
        are documented to have existed.[12] At least one was
        cannibalized for parts to build one or more of the others. The
        Rife #5 has never been reported to have worked since its
        original owner, Dr. Gonin in England, "was unable to obtain
        useful results with either No 4 or No 5."[13] Rife patented a
        high-intensity UV lamp for microscope use in 1929 (Patent
        #1727618).[14] </p>
      <p>On November 20, 1931, forty-four doctors attended a dinner
        advertised as "The End To All Diseases" at the Pasadena estate
        of Dr. Milbank Johnson. This dinner was honoring Dr. Arthur I.
        Kendall, professor at Northwestern Medical School, and developer
        of the "Kendall Medium" or "K-Medium," and Dr. Royal Rife, the
        developer of the "Rife microscope." Moving microorganisms from
        prepared, diseased human tissue were supposedly seen in
        Berkefeld-000 filtered form, still-photographed and motion
        pictured.[15] </p>
      <p>August, 1932, Science magazine published a report by Dr. Edward
        C. Rosenow, M.D. (1875-1966). It said that, in addition to other
        viruses viewable with the standard lab microscope, small bodies
        were seen in the filtrate.[16] </p>
      <p><b>Cancer and Disease Treatment Claims</b> </p>
      <p>Rife said that he could find a Mortal Oscillatory Rate[17]
        (M.O.R.) for various pathogenic organisms, and directed his
        research accordingly, culturing and testing various pathogens
        with his Universal #3 microscope and his directed radio
        frequency energy 'beam ray' tube machine. Rife claimed to have
        documented the precise frequencies[18] which destroyed specific
        organisms, and claimed that many, if not all, contagious
        diseases could be cured using this radiation treatment, using
        frequencies that were typically in the 10 kHz-100 MHz range (HF
        to mid-VHF).[19] Rife claims that a clinic was set up by a Dr.
        Milbank Johnson M.D. which conducted tests using Rife's machine
        on the growth of typhoid in medium, which he claimed
        demonstrated no motility of typhoid rods which were exposed to
        Rife's machine.[20][21] There is no independent verification of
        any of these claims. </p>
      <p><b>Modern Revival of Rife's Work</b> </p>
      <p>Rife's work was revived in the 1980s. An interest in Rife
        himself was revived by author Barry Lynes, who wrote a book
        about Rife entitled The Cancer Cure That Worked! This led to
        such groups as the Bioelectromagnetics Society. The American
        Cancer Society described Lynes' claims as implausible, noting
        that the book is written "in a style typical of conspiratorial
        theorists."[4] </p>
      <p>In the late 1980s, Life Energy Resources mass-produced the REM
        SuperPro Generator. Three of the company's top distributors, Pat
        Ballistrea, Michael Ricotta, and Brian Strandberg, claimed it
        was based on Rife's devices and cured many diseases, including
        cancer and AIDS. They served prison time for selling unapproved
        medical devices and drugs as a result of their trials in 1993,
        1994, and 1995. According to the Buffalo News, Judge Arcara told
        Ricotta: "Your sales strategy targeted the most vulnerable
        people, including those suffering from terminal disease ... It
        is especially cruel because, in many instances, it proved false
        hope to people who had no hope."[22] Similarly, the American
        Cancer Society reported in 1994 that Rife machines were being
        sold in a "pyramid-like, multilevel marketing scheme" with the
        claim that the device was being suppressed by an establishment
        conspiracy against cancer "cures".[4] </p>
      <p>In Australia, the use of Rife's machine has been blamed for
        causing the deaths of cancer patients who could have been cured
        with conventional therapy.[6] </p>
      <p>The Attorneys General of Wisconsin and Minnesota sued Shelvie
        Rettmann, a proponent of Rife's "frequency generator" for
        deceptive trade practices and consumer fraud. The Court found
        that Rettmann had violated the law and that, as a result of her
        actions, a cancer patient had ceased chemotherapy and died four
        months later.[23] </p>
      <p>Although Rife devices are not registered by the U.S Food and
        Drug Administration and have been linked to deaths among cancer
        sufferers, the Seattle Times reported that over 300 people
        attended the 2006 Rife International Health Conference in
        Seattle, where dozens of unregistered devices were sold.[5] </p>

      <p><font color="#000000">The machine has 3 external
          controls.&nbsp; The leftmost one is a 4 way rotary switch with
          positions labelled 1 through 4.&nbsp; These are the
          (modulation) frequency bands of the machine.&nbsp; The total
          range of the modulation settings is from approximately 20 Hz
          to 200 Khz in 4 decades as follows:</font> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">Band Setting // Frequency Range</font></b>
        <br>
        <font color="#000000">1 // 20 Hz - 200 Hz</font> <br>

        <font color="#000000">4 // 20 KHz - 200 KHz</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote><font color="#000000">The centre control is the main
        modulation frequency dial.&nbsp; This is calibrated in one step
        units from 0-100.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dial superficially appears to
        be a vernier dial but isn't, although it is finely marked, of
        good quality and is geared down, so a single turn does not move
        it completely from end to end.&nbsp; A resolution of 1/2 a
        division is easily possible.</font>
      <p><font color="#000000">The right hand control is the modulation
          depth control.&nbsp; It varies the modulation applied to the
          grid of the 812A from 0 to 50 V p-p.&nbsp; The highest setting
          of 50V p-p is not 100% modulation, but rather overmodulation
          of about 115%.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The actual frequency setting for any
          given dial setting is not linear.&nbsp; For example setting
          the frequency dial to 50 in band 3 does not guarantee you'll
          get 10 KHz.&nbsp;&nbsp; The variation of the actual frequency
          for any given dial setting follows an approximate 3rd degree
          polynomial curve.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Treatment Settings</font></font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The machine came with some old diary
          pages with a series of treatment settings scribbled on
          them.&nbsp; The year of the diary was not shown, just the
          months but February was shown.&nbsp; It was not a leap year
          and by matching the days of the week to the dates it had to be
          1939.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were the "usual" Rife pathogens plus a
          few more ailments that I had never seen quoted on any other
          early Rife machine list.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately they were
          not all complete so it wasn't possible to derive the true
          frequencies for all of them.&nbsp; The anomalies included:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">"V" with a setting of band 3, dial 39 -
          but I have no idea what this is.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">"Radiation" with a strange setting of

          machines.&nbsp; To test the thing further I tried tuning the

      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The most striking thing about the Beam
          Rays circuit at first glance is the oscillator section.&nbsp;
          The machine oscillator is clearly a first generation Hewlett
          Wein Bridge circuit.&nbsp; What makes this particularly
          notable is that Hewlett (Hewlett-Packard) only invented the
          circuit around the time the Beam Rays machine was built.&nbsp;
          Because it was so new and had not found its way into
          commercial designs it tends to imply that there might have
          been some connection between Hewlett and Beam Rays.&nbsp; I
          have written a detailed account of the history entitled "The
          Hewlett Connection".</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The earlier Rife machines had used the
          Hartley oscillator circuit which was nowhere near as stable as
          the Hewlett Wein Bridge.&nbsp; So the use of this circuit was
          a big step forward for Beam Rays.&nbsp;&nbsp; The earlier
          machines had been plagued with apparent frequency instability
          which made consistent use very difficult.&nbsp; The Wein
          bridge circuit was an apparent solution, but in practice there
          was another factor that they apparently did not take into
          account.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The Beam Rays oscillator is remarkably
          stable --- it drifts by only a few Hertz during normal
          operation and is superior to many modern analog
          generators.&nbsp; But it has one major drawback.&nbsp; Tuning
          is achieved by way of a variable capacitor.&nbsp; This
          capacitor is connected directly to the tuning dial.&nbsp; The
          tuning dial is a geared down dial that allows very precise
          turning of the capacitor shaft.&nbsp; However in practice it
          suffers from a slight degree of "backlash" - in other words,
          no matter how carefully you turn the dial, there is always
          some residual pressure on the rotary shaft - and left to
          itself for a while this residual pressure or tension causes
          the capacitor shaft to turn back by a small amount.&nbsp; This
          is enough to throw the tuning out by a couple of Hertz in the
          lowest range - and the problem multiplies by a factor of 10
          for each higher range.&nbsp; So in the top range the backlash
          can throw the frequency setting off by approximately
          2KHz.&nbsp; In addition, because the relationship between the
          dial setting and the actual frequency is non-linear, the
          problem is always worse toward the top of the scale (i.e. the
          dial is calibrated from 0 to 100 - the problem is much more
          pronounced near 100 than it is near 0).&nbsp; One of the ways
          in which this manifests most noticeably is that turning the
          dial down from a higher number results in a lower overall
          frequency than turning the dial up from a lower number to the
          same final setting.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The frequency setting is obviously
          critical and this may explain why some frequency stability
          related problems were encountered even with this extremely
          good oscillator.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The presence of the Hewlett oscillator
          explains also the general build of the machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          When I examined the machine there were various minor
          anomalies.&nbsp; One of which was the size of the two
          chassis.&nbsp; They are both much bigger than they need to
          be.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also there are two separate chassis and the
          earlier Beam Rays machines had only one.&nbsp; Another thing
          is that there is a circuit on the oscillator stage which is
          not connected and not used.&nbsp; This was probably meant to
          be able to create square waves by sine overdrive and
          clipping.&nbsp; Finally the mounting holes on the chassis do
          not correspond with the mounting holes on the case - someone
          has drilled new holes in both chassis to remount them in the
          case.&nbsp; This could mean that the case the machine is in is
          not the original case it was shipped in.&nbsp; Alternatively
          it could mean that the chassis were previously mounted in a
          different way (maybe in a different case) <b><i>prior</i></b>
          to shipping.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Taking all these things together leads me
          to the conclusion that the machine I examined is probably an
          original prototype.&nbsp; This makes sense considering that
          the Hewlett oscillator was so new.&nbsp; Obviously, Phillip
          Hoyland or whoever built the machine decided to try making the
          oscillator stage separately from the output stage.&nbsp; The
          output stage is presumably the same as in earlier Beam Rays
          machines (it looks the same as a 1937 Beam Rays machine), but
          clearly they decided to build the oscillator on a separate
          chassis.&nbsp; The chassis were overlarge to allow for circuit
          expansion and modification.&nbsp;&nbsp; The unused circuit was
          probably tested at some point and found to be
          unnecessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it is likely that during
          development the different mountings were used on some sort of
          open frame to allow testing and measurement.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">But this prototype machine was shipped
          and sold as a finished unit, why?&nbsp; The answer is probably
          quite obvious.&nbsp; The machine was produced during the great
          depression.&nbsp; Everything was expensive,&nbsp; Beam Rays
          was a small company and needed to keep down costs.&nbsp; The
          prototype was probably only needed during
          development.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once everything had been worked out
          satisfactorily, the prototype was no longer needed - and could
          be sold for a substantial profit, as it was effectively a
          working machine of a new design.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The 6SJ7 and 6K6(B) tubes on the combined
          schematic are the basic Hewlett Wein Bridge oscillator
          circuit.&nbsp; See "The Hewlett Connection" for a schematic of
          Hewlett's patented design.&nbsp; The third tube marked 6K6(A)
          is a simple cathode follower buffer stage, analogous to a
          modern transistor emitter follower circuit.&nbsp; This circuit
          has high input impedance, low output impedance and unity
          gain.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is designed to insulate the sensitive
          oscillator section from the following output stages.&nbsp; The
          6SN7 tube is the unused circuit and as mentioned above was
          probably meant to be part of a fast clipper amplifier to
          produce square wave modulation.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The oscillator stage creates a pure sine
          wave from approx 20 Hz to 200KHz depending on range and dial
          setting.&nbsp; It also produces a variable amplitude output
          which can be adjusted from 0v right up to approx 50V peak to
          peak.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The output stage consists mainly of a
          single 812A power triode.&nbsp; The stage is self-oscillating,
          it has a simple regenerative feedback arrangement from plate
          to grid via two capacitors and the tank coil.&nbsp; The degree
          of feedback can be adjusted by means of a large power resistor
          from the grid to ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: the machine was not
          actually grounded, the negative end of the supplies connected
          to the chassis and all "grounds" were actually referenced to
          the chassis.&nbsp; I found in practice that the chassis did
          tend to accumulate quite a nasty residual charge after the
          machine had been operating and so I grounded it which did not
          seem to affect the operation of the machine.&nbsp; The output
          stage is actually a Hartley oscillator, although not obviously
          so, because the output capacitor in series with the plasma
          tube capacitance represents the "tuning" capacitance of the
          circuit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The large power resistor in series with
          the tube affects the oscillator loading, the output field
          impedance and also the Q of the resonant circuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Because the plasma tube is an active circuit element,
          capacitive coupling from any body in the vicinity of the
          plasma tube actually causes changes in the oscillator
          frequency.&nbsp; The "resting" frequency of the output
          oscillator is around&nbsp; 3.3 MHz - I suspect the machine was
          actually designed to operate principally in the 80 m radio
          band (between 3.5 and 3.7 MHz).</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The output from the modulation oscillator
          stage is capacitively coupled to the output triode grid via an
          inductor.&nbsp; The latter is designed to prevent the carrier
          oscillations from feeding back into the modulation oscillator
          stage.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The DC HT power for the 812 triode is
          derived from a 1235 VAC plate transformer by two 866 mercury
          vapour rectifiers.&nbsp; The DC output is smoothed via a large
          choke and a filter capacitor to ground.&nbsp; There is also an
          RFC choke in the line to the plate.&nbsp;&nbsp; The smoothing
          circuit is not very efficient and has a lot of mains frequency
          ripple - this is not completely unexpected in a circuit
          running at such a high voltage (nominally 1750 V DC) due to
          the cost of larger HV capacitors.&nbsp; However much more
          interesting is the other end of the tube - the filaments
          (which double as cathodes) are connected to a direct AC
          filament heater transformer which means that there is an
          additional modulation at the 60Hz mains frequency (cathode
          modulation).</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In practice during operation, the machine
          creates the carrier waveform (which is not very clean and
          contains a lot of harmonics - it has a superficial similarity
          to a sawtooth wave). The carrier is then amplitude modulated
          by the sine wave produced by the modulation
          oscillator.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in addition, the AC cathode
          connection causes a further modulation at 60Hz.&nbsp; In
          effect the modulated wave is chopped into chunks or bursts
          that are one period of a 60 Hz cycle apart.&nbsp;&nbsp; And
          the envelope of the wave is effectively the first quarter
          cycle of a 60Hz cosine wave.&nbsp; In some respects this is
          like a very crude approximation to a damped wave.&nbsp; I
          believe that the latter is not a design flaw but rather a
          feature.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p>This unit was manufactured in San Diego California for a Dr. in
        1947.The large phanotron tube for it was made in Los Angeles. It
        was in constant use until the Dr.s death a few years ago. This
        device is very similar to a recently discovered 1939 unit. The
        1939 unit has a fixed carrier frequency of about 4.6 Mhz. There
        are two other primary harmonics within the carrier of 2.15 and
        9.09 Mhz. The carrier is Amplitude Modulated using a
        Hewlett-Wein Bridge Oscillator. Controls for the Hewlett
        oscillator can be seen on the front of the device. The knob on
        the Left changes the frequency band, while the knob in the
        center adjusts the audio frequency. Frequency range is from 16Hz
        to 200 KHz. The knob on the Right changes the amplitude, or
        audio power level. Optimum effects are found using 100 %
        modulation, and not overmodulation. Sine wave modulation, and
        not square wave modulation is used. </p>
      <p>The output wave of the device is gated at the AC line voltage
        frequency. For the USA, this would be 60 Hz. Each series of
        pulses within the gated envelope, is composed of a damped wave
        train. The three harmonics of 2.15, 4.6 ,and 9.09 are all
        modulated. Damped wave transmitters are now outlawed by all
        countries via international treaties. </p>
      <p>The plasma tube behaves as an active part of the circuit, and
        when placed close to the patient, couples the field to the
        patient. A curiosity is that frequencies utilized by this device
        are TEN TIMES the frequency that is presently used. For example,
        this device uses 21275 Hz instead of 2128 Hz. Please visit this
        web site for a more in depth description of the device. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The 1939 Beam Ray Machine</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In 1938, A group of British researchers&nbsp; headed by Dr
        Bertram Winter Gonin, sought to buy some experimental machines
        from Rife to confirm his work.&nbsp; At that time, Rife had no
        commercial operation capable of handling the orders, and at the
        instigation of his old friend Ben Cullen, Rife consented to the
        formation of a commercial company called Beam Rays Inc.&nbsp; At
        that time, the majority owner of the rights to the machine was
        an electronics engineer called Philip Hoyland.&nbsp; Hoyland had
        designed and developed all of the original Rife machines since
        late 1934.&nbsp; Hoyland and Rife became partners in Beam Rays
        Inc. The company produced a small number of machines but
        suffered internal conflicts because of the actions of some of
        the other partners and because of frictions between Hoyland and
        Gonin's group.&nbsp; Hoyland believed that Gonin and his
        partners were trying to steal the technology for
        themselves.&nbsp; Subsequently, the company was destroyed in
        1939/1940 when Hoyland brought a lawsuit against Beam Rays in an
        attempt to stop one of the partners from illegal stock trading
        and also to dissolve the contract with the British.&nbsp; Fuller
        details of this are being written up and will be posted here in
        the near future. </p>
      <p>The Beam Ray Corporation produced a number of machines.&nbsp;
        I'm not sure of the exact number as I have seen varying
        accounts, but I believe that about 17 machines were produced and
        shipped to MD's in California.&nbsp; Another four machines were
        shipped to England to Dr B. Winter Gonin of the London School of
        Tropical Medicine.&nbsp; There was some argument between Rife
        and Hoyland over these machines and their operating principle,
        however various MD's including James Couche used one of these
        machines for many allegedly successful treatments of patients
        for many years. </p>
      <p>The U.K. Rife Research Group managed to get access to one of
        the machines believed to be one of the originals that were
        shipped to California in the late 1930's.&nbsp; I reverse
        engineered that machine and present the results below.&nbsp; I
        have a lot of data on this machine of which this is only part, I
        will add things as I get time as much of the data needs to be
        organised properly.&nbsp; The exact date of the machine is
        unknown - we know that it was built sometime between the autumn
        of 1938 and the early part of 1939 - so it may actually be a
        1938 machine. </p>
      <p>I would like to express my thanks to Robert Harrison, an expert
        valve/tube engineer (I'm not a valve/tube expert) who gave me
        massive help and support during the reverse engineering process
        and who corrected numerous silly mistakes that I made!&nbsp; My
        thanks also to Stuart Andrews and Bob Haining for their help and
        support in this effort. </p>

      <p>The Frequency Instruments were steadily improved from the early
        version of 1920 to the clinical versions of 1934-38 and then, in
        the 1950s, improved again to the point where Rife could assert,
        "they are infallible and simple to operate." </p>
      <p>The May 6, 1928 <i>Evening Tribune</i> of San Diego described
        what the Frequency Instrument did: </p>
      <p>"Just what this Ray does to the organisms to devitalize them is
        not yet known. Because each organism requires a different wave
        length, it may be that whatever befalls these tiny slayers of
        man is something similar to the phenomenon occurring when the
        musical tuning fork is set in vibration by sound waves emanating
        from another fork struck nearby. ... <br>
        [ This at the time was a good explanation and still has some
        validity. But, (it) is very incomplete. The effect is
        multifaceted. — James Bare — ] </p>
      <p>"Rife thinks that the lethal frequencies for various disease
        organisms are, as in the sound waves, coordinates of frequencies
        existing in the organism themselves. If this is the explanation,
        it means that the Rife Ray probably causes the disease organisms
        to disintegrate or partially disintegrate, just as the vase and
        the glass. Several bits of evidence indicate that this is
        exactly what happens. ... </p>
      <p>"When the ray is directed upon them, they are seen to behave
        very curiously; some kinds do literally disintegrate, and others
        writhe as if in agony and finally gather together in deathly
        unmoving clusters. </p>
      <p>"Brief exposure to the tuned frequencies, Rife commented,
        brings the fatal reactions. In some organisms, it happens in
        seconds. </p>
      <p>"After the organisms have been bombarded, the laboratory
        reports show, they are dead. They have become devitalized — no
        longer exhibit life, do not propagate their kind and produce no
        disease when introduced into the bodies of experimental animals.
      </p>
      <p>"Now, he reported, the mortal oscillatory rates for many, many
        organisms have been found and recorded and the ray can be tuned
        to a germ's recorded frequency and turned upon that organism
        with the assurance that the organism will be killed." </p>
      <p>In 1950, after an absence of four years, including two years in
        an alcohol rehabilitation "prison" from which he finally
        escaped, Rife returned to his great work. In 1953, his cancer
        report was published — History of the Development of a
        Successful Treatment for Cancer and Other Virus, Bacteria and
        Fungi. </p>
      <p>Three years later, in 1956, he wrote a letter describing the
        safety of the Frequency Instrument and also its advanced
        development: </p>
      <p>"I have operated the 'Frequency Instrument' since 1921. I have
        watched it advance in style and performance with the advancement
        of electronics. </p>
      <p>"In the many years I used this equipment in my research, I have
        never suffered an injury or any ill effects whatsoever. I found
        it reliable in performance and efficient in results. The most
        recent model is infallible and simple to operate." </p>
      <p>[A] new Frequency Instrument was finished in September 1935 …
        Milbank Johnson explained the process: </p>
      <p>"The new Rife Ray Machine had arrived at its point of
        construction, when elaborate tests had to be made in order to
        synchronize the M.O.R. produced by it with the M.O.R. produced
        by the old machine. Now, we are in the throes of accurately
        charting the 14,000 possible settings on the new machine. Our
        next process, beginning next week, is to test its penetration,
        the time required in the different exposures, the different
        depths of lesions. So, take it altogether we are just about as
        busy as a bear in berrytime." </p>
      <p>Rife provided a brief description of his old Frequency
        Instrument: </p>
      <p>"The basic principle of this device is the control of a desired
        frequency. These frequencies varying upon the organism being
        treated. </p>
      <p>The frequency is set which controls the initial oscillator,
        which in turn is run through six stages of amplification, the
        last stage driving a 50 watt output tube. </p>
      <p>The frequency with its carrier wave is transmitted into an
        output tube similar to the standard X-ray tube, but filled with
        a different inert gas. This tube acts as a directional antenna.
      </p>
      <p>The importance in the variable control of these frequencies is
        that each pathogenic organism being treated is of a different
        chemical constituency, the consequence being they carry a
        different molecular vibratory rate. Each one in turn under these
        conditions requires a different frequency or vibratory rate to
        destroy." </p>
      <p>The new instrument was light-socket powered and had an output
        of 500 watts. Furthermore, it was equipped to deliver two
        distinct frequencies simultaneously and both variable. [ There
        were two output tubes places next to each other. ] This
        apparatus proved to be more efficient with decidedly fewer
        factors of error. </p>
      <p>On May 28, 1937, Dr. Milbank Johnson ... wrote to his friend
        Dr. Joseph D. Heitger in Louisville, Kentucky, the eye
        specialist to whom he had sent Rife: </p>
      <p>"I closed my clinic on May 28, having been running it for eight
        months. Our special effort this past winter has been working on
        cataracts, and while we have treated a number of other
        infectious conditions (if cataract is an infection), still our
        principle work has been on the eye. </p>
      <p>The application of the Rife Ray as we have used it, does, in
        the majority of cases, restore the full visual function of the
        eye; that is, the portion of the visual disturbance due to
        opacities in the lens. How it does it and why it does it, I do
        not know, but the above statement is an actual fact, supported
        now by many cases. </p>
      <p>How I wish we could get together and go over this work. I
        believe it will result in epochal changes in the profession's
        handling of cataract cases." </p>
      <p>[ I think Jane Kress' find regarding nano-bacteria is relevant
        here. ] </p>
      <p>Ben Cullen, the present of Beam Ray, later recalled what
        happened once Dr. Hamer had his own office: </p>
      <p>"Hamer ran an average of forty cases a day through his place.
        He had to hire two operators. He trained them and watched them
        very closely … Hamer was very well known on the Pacific Coast.
        His case histories were absolutely wonderful. </p>
      <p>We would go in there and see rectal cancers and stuff of that
        sort. He cleaned them up completely, absolutely clean. People
        would come in there with syphilis — not for that purpose — but
        those that had developed cancers, he'd find they had syphilis or
        gonorrhea. By golly he'd clean those up completely. Not a
        doggone taint of it in the blood stream at all. Clinically
        cured. </p>
      <p>I would go down to Dr. Hamer and he would painstakingly pull
        out those case histories showing improvement day by day of
        everyone of them." </p>

      </center>
      <p>Rife studied … </p>
      <p>[Cancer], Tetanus, typhoid, gonorrhea, syphilis, staphylococci,
        pneumonia, streptococci, tuberculosis, sarcoma, carcinoma,
        leprosy, polio, cholera, actinomycosis, glanders, bubonic
        plague, anthrax, influenza, herpes, cataracts, glaucoma,
        colitis, sinus, ulcers, lock-jaw bacillus, and many other virus
        bacteria and fungi. </p>
      <p>[ He was successful — using simple electronic equipment — in
        destroying them all without any significant side effects. The
        reason he was so successful was that his microscope allowed him
        to watch the living pathogens while he subjected them to
        resonate energy. ] </p>
      <p>One issue modern, orthodox medicine still fails to accept or
        take seriously, is "cause" and "maintenance". That is to deal
        not just with surgery of sick tissue; but, to deal with the
        cause of the problem, to try to prevent it in the first place;
        and, further, to try to prevent it from recurring! </p>
      <p>Rife was able to prove that virus forms could be altered with
        chemicals. Thus, he could create disease-producing viruses by
        manipulation of chemical structures. Again, he proved this
        over-and-over. </p>
      <p>Rife stated viruses to be a group of chemical constituents,
        which could be altered by applying specific chemicals — parts
        per million — creating different organisms. By applying the
        proper chemicals, Rife could alter a given microorganism into a
        specific pathogen, at will, and back again; as long as they were
        within a specific group, of which Rife had identified about ten
        groups at that point. </p>
      <p>Inoculation of experimental animals had demonstrated the
        disease causing properties of each virus isolated, according to
        Rife! </p>
      <p>Rife stated he worked seven years straight and studied 20,000
        cultures searching for a cancer virus, finally suspending the
        search since he had found nothing. </p>
      <p>Rife was later joined by Dr. Arthur Kendall, head of the
        department of bacteriology at Northwestern University Medical
        College. Dr. Kendall suggested a culture medium [ his K-medium —
        a protein mixture ], which proved to be the secret to success as
        Rife was able to press on and did eventually discover and
        isolate the cancer virus. </p>
      <p>Rife commented that his special illumination (under his scope)
        reveals the filter-passing organisms in individual,
        characteristic colors. He stated that no two kinds or forms of
        organisms have been found to have the same colors. However, one
        form was found to have dual colors. The center portion of the
        rod form responded to one frequency (of illumination) while the
        ends responded to another. This required dual frequencies for
        devitalization. (If the two frequencies are used simultaneously
        or one after the other over the same carrier wave, the patient
        gets well.) </p>
      <p>According to Rife, if a single frequency was applied and that
        portion of the organism was devitalized, it would release the
        other constituent. Depending on which constituent was
        devitalized, either nothing would happen or the patient would
        die! [ His lab animals ] </p>
      <p>The reason for the above, according to Rife's explanation is,
        if the bacilli of tuberculosis is killed, a virus — the 'poison
        of Vaughn' — is released which reacts with the dead bodies of
        the rod form and produces toxemia and death. </p>
      <p>"It was found that by using combinations of these frequencies
        for different microorganisms that many other diseases could be
        helped like sinus, ulcers, cataract, arthritis and
        poliomyelitis." </p>
      <p>Each pathogen or virus has a frequency of its own — natural
        resonate frequency. A healthy cell has a frequency; but, when
        that cell becomes contaminated or altered, the frequency is
        altered. </p>
      <p>That is one reason why frequency treatment can safely be
        applied. The correct frequency will affect only the unhealthy
        cell, or diseased tissue, while leaving healthy areas untouched.
        Rife proved this beyond any doubt. Still the closed minds of
        higher medical superiors would like us to believe frequency
        healing is unsafe. </p>
      <p>In some cases, frequency treatments result in virus destruction
        and rapid recovery. In other cases frequency healing appears to
        work by alerting the depressed immune system to become more
        aggressive, thus causing the immune system to attack the disease
        as nature intended. </p>
      <p>Rife made a statement that patients who had radiation
        treatments prior to frequency therapy, did not respond well to
        frequency therapy. Rife also stated that he could detect
        radiation in organ tissue up to six months after radiation
        therapy; and, up to two years after radium therapy. </p>
      <p>Another intriguing discovery made by Rife was polarization of
        microorganisms. Under the scope, if polarity was applied, the
        constituents would separate to the poles; a portion to the
        negative pole, a portion to the positive pole. Neither would
        culture individually; but, placed together, they would culture
        into a microorganism structure. As Rife put it, sort of, "male,
        female"! </p>
      <p>Another important discovery was the pH factor. (Acid-base
        balance.) Rife stated if the pH was neutral he could not produce
        a culture. But, if the Ph was altered to either base or acid, it
        would culture. Based on this information, Rife felt that if the
        human body remained in a neutral pH state, it was impossible to
        develop a disease. </p>
      <p>Correspondence from Milbank Johnson to Rife, 1935: "Now that we
        have a machine in which we can give two frequencies at one time,
        it would be easy to treat all forms of tuberculosis both for the
        tubercle bacilli and Much's granules." (Granules in sputum from
        TB patients, possibly degenerated tubercle bacilli. Re: Dr. Hans
        Christian Much.) </p>
      <p>Rife: "I studied leprosy and I isolated a virus which we
        jointly demonstrated was common to rat, soil, and human leprosy
        and I found a frequency which would eliminate leprosy." </p>
      <p>A doctor in Dayton Ohio; I have used it on several persons with
        fungus infections of the feet (athletes foot). The results in
        the fungus cases have been most spectacular. </p>
      <p>Here is an excerpt of a letter from one doctor to another
        doctor, dated June 1, 1937; </p>
      <p>"We treated the 'dewy' cornea condition empirically with the
        same MOR that we used on the cataracts and the dewy condition
        disappeared very promptly … </p>
      <p>Every case we have treated, with the exception of one which was
        a traumatic cataract where the lens was absolutely opaque and of
        recent origin, has benefited. The process of coagulation has
        been stopped and there has been a distinct retrogression of the
        opacities resulting in most cases, in a complete restitution of
        the function of the eye." </p>
      <p><b>The Case For Audio Frequencies:</b> </p>
      <p>Among researchers of Rife technology, debate continues
        regarding the issue of audio frequencies. Here are statements
        from Rife taken from an interview, which took place in Tijuana,
        Mexico. (There is no date on this document. But, it must have
        related to the John Crane trial of 1960–1961.) </p>
      <p>"Initially, I (Rife) worked with loose couplers to get an audio
        oscillation and then with the use of transmitters I tried to
        balance the audio and modulate the audio on a carrier wave to
        transmit the audio energy. But, I found that both the audio and
        the audio transmitted through a tube as an antenna worked
        equally well in a painless and harmless method to human tissue."
      </p>
      <p>Thumbing through the pages of historical data regarding Rife,
        Crane and frequency technology, one issue stands out, clearly —
        lack of stability. </p>
      <p>It seems this problem prevailed through the years. Researchers
        would achieve marvelous results for a period of time, then,
        suddenly the system would fail to produce much of anything. Even
        from one day to the next. </p>
      <p>This seems to still be "somewhat" true with our meager
        equipment and attempts at repeatability. It's not so much a
        failure of the technology; but, appears to be an atmospheric
        variation and other surrounding conditions. Changes in
        atmospheric pressure, temperature, magnetic earth fields and
        other surrounding natural forces affect electronics in strange
        ways. </p>
      <p>A suggested approach is to begin at 20 Hz and work up in 10
        cycle increments. … It is suggested (that) a beginner should
        avoid frequencies above 5,000 Hz. Interestingly, an amazing
        number of pathogens seem to respond in the low range from 20 Hz
        to 900 Hz. <br>
        [ The healing power of sound comes to mind here. ]&nbsp;&nbsp; [
        My work with resonance has proven to me that intervals of 5 Hz
        or even less might be more appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp; — Tommy C. —
        ] </p>
      <p>A duration of 3-minutes is standard protocol while searching or
        scanning for a usable frequency. </p>

      <p>[ This report is a pdf file and has pictures, schematics with
        part values, plus functional circuit descriptions, along with
        circuit wave form pictures.&nbsp; The "Plasma Ray Tube" itself
        is currently being manufactured. ] </p>
      <p>... The use of a Wien-bridge oscillator in this machine [an
        original 1939 unit discovered walled up in the closet of a
        former Doctors' surgery in Britain ] gives us our first and most
        surprising conclusion: that beam ray machines used sine waves,
        and NOT square waves! ... </p>
      <p>Another surprise followed when we set the Wien-bridge
        oscillator to the dial settings for BX [the cancer virus] (band
        4, dial 10) given on the hand-written pencil notes [found with
        the machine].&nbsp; We obtained a frequency of 21,275 Hz or
        21.275 KHz. We then set the machine to the other dial settings
        in the notes, and found that in all cases the active frequencies
        produced by this 1939 machine were 10x that of the standard
        Crane-Stafford frequencies of the 1950s. </p>
      <p>This reminded us of a very strange letter written by Dr.
        Millbank–Johnson on November 4th 1936. Johnson stated that while
        working in the laboratory, they had found "a new wave band" of
        frequencies. Johnson goes on to mention that this new band broke
        glass in the laboratory. </p>
      <p>Frequencies of 21,275 Hz etc. are supersonic [ultrasonic] in
        that they cannot be heard by the human ear. But, when generated
        at a sufficiently high amplitude, they have the capability to
        cause resonant destruction of glass and other fragile materials.
        Our conclusion then, is that this explains the effect that
        Johnson observed in 1936. </p>
      <p>The use of 10x Crane frequencies may be of great significance
        to the actual operational uses of modern Rife technology. We
        urge researchers to try this out. ... </p>
      <p><b>On the Issue of Stability</b> </p>
      <p>... the main RF tuning capacitor C1 is series fed to ground by
        the plasma tube (at Jack point J1). This means that the plasma
        tube itself forms part of a variable capacitor, and that it will
        be reactive when brought near any object or patient. This means
        that the main frequency tuning of the RF oscillator will change
        according to the individual capacitance of a patient [or weather
        conditions]. We believe this to be significant, particularly as
        contemporary accounts describe the tube being placed within 10
        inches of the patient. </p>
      <p>... The 812A triode produces an output in the region of 40
        watts RF, and Rife researchers will appreciate that this is a
        far lower power [level] than we have been led to believe was
        used in 1939. </p>

      <center><b><font size="+1">Tec Talk --- Engineering Rife's
            Technology</font></b></center>
      <p>We know, that Rife's "ray machine" was generating a special
        form of light. However, Dr. Rife lacked the language and
        paradigm to properly describe what he was seeing and
        doing.&nbsp; [ The fact that the rays would penetrate metal
        cabinets is an important clue. ] </p>
      <p>The scientific community was introduced to this paradigm, when
        the study of "Superconductivity" was undertaken. Here we learned
        about "Cooper Pairs" — pairs of electrons with complementary
        spins that are coupled together magnetically. We learned that
        current only flows through a superconductor as Cooper Pairs —
        single electrons find super conducting materials to be a perfect
        insulator! </p>
      <p>We then learned, that light was actually Cooper Pairs, which
        have been given oscillatory energy —(any part of the
        electromagnetic spectrum)— and accelerated away from their
        source. This is what gives light its wave properties — what are
        known as "Hertzian Waves".&nbsp;&nbsp; (I then realized what was
        going on within the broadcast equipment that I shepard.) </p>
      <p>Cooper Pairs can also be accelerated in a straight line, giving
        them the properties of "rays" and "beams". Our tube TV's are
        designed to safely do this, in order to scan a picture for us.
        Cooper Pairs are formed in a vacuum, and then are accelerated
        and focused on a phosphor coating to produce the picture. Change
        things around a little bit and you have an X–Ray tube. </p>
      <p>Using his special microscope Dr. Rife was able to observe
        LIVING organisms — something that an electron microscope can't
        do — while he performed his experiments. He learned that because
        of their small size, viruses strongly process the
        characteristics of crystals, allowing for resonate destruction.
        With his equipment, he was able to scientifically determine that
        viruses are 2,000 times more sensitive to pulsed electronic
        radiation, than our normal cells. </p>
      <p>Dr. Rife used gentle, perfectly timed, sine wave pulses of
        Cooper Pairs to literally shatter viruses and bacteria, just as
        the "Crystalline Entity" was destroyed on Star Trek.&nbsp; The
        problem of how to get gentle pulses to penetrate the body
        properly and completely was also addressed. </p>

      </center>
      <p>My work on Rife's frequencies involves the use of electronic
        interferometry and gating of 3D signals-- not known at this time
        in the Rife field. I designed the gated interferometer for my
        crystal-controlled amplifier oscillator. This is not "pseudo"
        electronics. I hold all rights to this process. Below are
        pictures of some of the special functions that can be done. My
        work in the beginning involved working with John Crane and Dr.
        Strecker in the reconstruction of the virus #3 "Universal"
        microscope in the early 80's to develop pumped wave frequency
        generators and 4-wave mixing. I had this microscope until Barry
        Lynes had it picked up by court order from Crane because John
        Crane had sold it many times before. All the parts were
        there--the parts that were missing Crane and I made, and John
        Crane took them with him when he left. What he did with them
        remains unknown to this day. The microscope was taken and never
        to be seen again. The only thing left is pictures and no working
        microscope. John Crane also had special gas filled Rife tubes
        whose whereabouts are also unknown. </p>
      <p>If you do not understand interferometry, it is basically the
        same system used in some laser systems to produce holograms and
        spectrum analysis. I'm only dealing with generating harmonics
        and sub- harmonics for research only. . </p>
      <p>Rife's microscope may have worked on the principles using
        interferometry and this could be why, to this day, the
        microscope is not understood. There were many lenses missing and
        prisms that Crane and I were building before the microscope was
        picked up by court order... </p>
      <p>Special thanks is given to James Bare for the special work he
        did to make all this happen in the Rife field. Without him you
        would not even be this far along. Also, special thanks is given
        to Tom Bearden for his insight into the the scalar vector field
        and 4-wave mixing using pump waves... </p>
      <p><b>John Crane's Simple Square Wave Generator</b> </p>
      <p>Dr. Strecker took care of John Crane while we were working
        together. Crane sold us just simple sine wave generators right
        off the shelf--they did not work for anything. But don't take my
        word for it as to what happened. Talk to Tom Bearden. Talk to
        the 18 people that got sued for 20 million dollars.&nbsp; That
        was just one of his phony lawsuits and just ended up costing
        everybody involved&nbsp; big money. </p>
      <p>John Crane was never given any of the circuits that I was
        developing at the time.&nbsp; They were potted in block modules
        and placed into the machines Crane sold out from underneath
        us.&nbsp; In the mean time, John Crane was selling phony square
        wave generators for $100.00 each, claiming that these would cure
        you.&nbsp; Well, they didn't cure anyone, and people died. When
        the FDA showed up, Crane ran as fast as he could.&nbsp; So after
        that, I locked the shop up and would never let Crane back in. </p>
      <p>Don't get me wrong, John Crane had many wonderful things to
        offer the world, but he lost integrity because of the lack of
        money. When we were developing the new generators to test on
        cultures that Dr. Strecker was in charge of,&nbsp; John Crane
        was treating people in the front office against all the rules
        and protocols laid out by Dr. Strecker.&nbsp; He would sell the
        polarity research manuals over and over to different people, and
        these belonged to all of us working on this project. John Crane
        was an expert draftsman and could draw anything you gave him. To
        draw a microscope was child's play for him to do.&nbsp; Rife
        trained him well in all the sciences. I had everything that John
        Crane had in his basement to amuse myself with--all the
        drawings, pictures, lenses, steam sterilizers, Argon loops, Rife
        tubes, test equipment, and many other undisclosed, secret
        prototype machines that Rife and Crane were working on...all of
        the things the "Rife gurus" have never seen. </p>
      <p>My story goes on with some more important things that I have
        taken from my lab notes and general discussions with Dr.
        Strecker,&nbsp;&nbsp; Crane and others. </p>
      <p>The pictures above...this is the way John Crane looked at the
        time.&nbsp; Dr. Strecker was in charge of the research and
        development.&nbsp; My brother and I closed the doors and moved
        the workers to a different building because this was a private
        project and had nothing to do with the business we were
        conducting at the time.&nbsp; Dr. Strecker was a true believer
        in getting this technology out, and so were the 18 people
        involved.&nbsp; The first problem with John Crane was to pay his
        back rent and and a few other pending bills.&nbsp; Again, John
        Crane and Rife&nbsp; had many wonderful proven inventions.&nbsp;
        We found John in absolutely filthy conditions, starving.&nbsp;
        He was making electrodes by cutting pieces of brass which he
        would solder on to the meter probes of an off-the-shelf
        frequency generator.&nbsp; Then, he would resell these units
        with these probes for $500 along with the polarity research
        manual for another $100.&nbsp; In a short time,&nbsp; he'd sell
        another 18 units, one to each member of the group. </p>
      <p>To walk through John Crane's house was to walk through some
        kind of a maze--boxes everywhere, things piled on tables, dust a
        half inch thick in some areas, rooms that you could not even get
        into, boxes, and more boxes.&nbsp; The front yard was full of
        all kinds of different inventions and contraptions.&nbsp;
        Whether they worked or not was unknown.&nbsp; Dr. Strecker took
        care of Crane, and Crane lived with him day and night at
        Strecker's apartment in Little Rock.&nbsp; Strecker would bring
        Crane to the shop in the morning and pick him back up in the
        evening after we discussed everything that was accomplished
        during the day. </p>
      <p>John Crane was a true mentor of Rife, and he understood
        everything Rife understood because Rife trained him. To quote
        Crane precisely, "Rife told me the secret to the machine, and I
        know how to build it." So we know Crane understood that a simple
        square wave generator would not cure anything .&nbsp; I got
        Crane to admit this to me when one day I asked him, "Why are you
        selling these simple square wave generators?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Crane
        responded by saying, "It works on some people...that's good
        enough."&nbsp; Strecker told Crane, "That's not a good thing to
        do with people that have cancer or another debilitating
        disease." And then Crane would say, "I have given the list of
        frequencies."&nbsp; So right there, Crane admitted that the
        machine he was selling may have worked for some, but not for
        others.&nbsp; Dr. Strecker, at this point, would just shake his
        head and walk away, but he was not about to give up his hope to
        make this technology work. </p>
      <p>I wanted to know what was missing from all the papers Crane
        sold everybody. I wanted to know what the real transmitter was
        and what was missing from it.&nbsp; (Note that Crane never
        mentioned it to John Marsh, Rockwell or anybody else.) Crane's
        answer to me about the transmitter was, "It's in the book you
        bought right here on this page." I would argue with him by
        telling him that the circuit diagrams he was selling were not
        even functional. And then I would ask him why the circuits did
        not look anything like the real machines did that were sitting
        right in front of us.&nbsp; Crane would then just say, "The
        square wave generator works better, and you will not cause any
        interference with radios...Go ahead hook up the transmitter and
        the tube.&nbsp; It's right here."&nbsp; So I hooked it up like
        he said, and it didn't kill anything Strecker had in the
        incubator at the time--no matter what frequency the dial was set
        at.&nbsp; Later, it was found that the generator was not
        producing any modulation in the AZ58 machine, so we fixed that,
        and it still would not kill anything in the incubator...even
        with Crane running the machine. </p>
      <p>I think the thing that excited Dr. Strecker the most were the
        reports about the microscope.&nbsp; I quote him from my notes,
        "I have talked to some people that bought John Crane's
        microscopes, and they report that they can see things never seen
        before.&nbsp; They say they can get 5000x out of the scope." Now
        Crane could have built this scope at the shop with the metal
        working machines we had, but he refused for some reason, so we
        were forced to buy a regular medical microscope to study the
        things we could see.&nbsp; Some of these things can be seen in
        Crane's lab notes that are now on Stan Truman's site at&nbsp;
        www.rife.org/johncrane.html.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are only a few of
        the notes Crane would carry around with him.&nbsp; The one set
        of papers that are missing contain all the research work done on
        the Risley Prisms and why Rife chose to use them.&nbsp; Could it
        be that Rife knew more then he was telling all the medical
        people?&nbsp; I think so because of John Crane's comment to me
        in my lab notes, "You must modulate this virus with light to see
        it.&nbsp; It must become resonate with the light interference."
        In other words, you must cause light interference before the
        subject would appear.&nbsp; Then, it could be seen in it's own
        color. </p>
      <p>We are talking about interferometry or
        heterodyning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using this process, one can change the
        phases of light, canceling certain frequencies out and adding
        others together, i.e. "a special mixer for light". I don't know
        of any microscopes that will do this today.&nbsp; There are some
        that use ultraviolet and with these you can see the cancer
        cells.&nbsp; But so what?&nbsp; You can see them under electron
        microscopes also.&nbsp; I want to see the colors Rife talked
        about. This is very important because radio waves also emit
        different colors as the transmitter is broadcasting. If you
        could see an AM or FM transmitter running, each antenna would be
        emitting a different color for that frequency in the radio
        spectrum.&nbsp; Your eyes just can't see this due to their
        limited bandwidth... </p>
      <p>The conversations with Crane would continue until the end of
        the day.&nbsp; Then I would continue to build the parts for the
        universal microscope in the machine shop.&nbsp; It was the prism
        holders that were missing, so I worked until they were
        done.&nbsp; Everything else was there.&nbsp; Crane then
        installed them, but still, nothing could be seen through the
        scope. Crane would then start over with drawings.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        During these times, he would go back to the office and just fall
        into a deep sleep at the drafting table.&nbsp; Upon waking, he'd
        say, "It's time for dinner.&nbsp; When are we going to
        eat?"&nbsp; It would take half of my day just to get this far
        with Crane, but when someone came in the shop that was looking
        for one of those square wave generators, Crane was on his
        toes.&nbsp; He would walk into the back of the shop and
        say,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't we have a square wave generator around
        here?" Then he'd take whatever was laying around and sell it
        when you weren't looking.&nbsp; I would just wait for the next
        day when John had gotten everything to eat and a good night's
        sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I'd start the questions again the next
        morning. I would cover everything two times with Crane to make
        sure that I did not miss anything.&nbsp; The group decided not
        to tell Crane about anything when it came to the circuits that
        were being developed.&nbsp;&nbsp; They, after all, were paying
        the bill for this project.&nbsp; Crane understood this, and, as
        long as he had money, everything was alright. </p>
      <p>My task was to build the electronic circuits for testing the
        Rife technologies. John Crane was never given any of these
        circuits, and I always potted them with a compound that would
        grind your tools away if you attempted to get into the block
        modules.&nbsp; My lab notes were not kept in the building
        anywhere for security reasons.&nbsp; I would come back at night
        and build the circuits and boards so as not to give away what I
        was working on.&nbsp; I worked nights to develop this electronic
        heterodyning interferometer unit and when I thought I had it,
        Dr. Strecker and I would test it in front of Crane.&nbsp; We did
        this many times before we got something to work. When I would
        ask Crane about the frequencies and if this is what he wanted to
        see on the scope, he would always say yes. Then Crane made the
        significant comment, "You need to understand that you must mimic
        the microscope in what it does to light up the virus so you can
        see them. The machine must work on the same principal as the
        microscope."&nbsp; Immediately, I stopped what I was doing and
        had to go sit down and think about what he had just
        said.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not written this way anywhere until
        now for the first time. (James Bare said that this is in the
        Rife, Thompson, Marsh patent application.)&nbsp; The next two
        days I kept going over this with Crane and he would add a little
        more each time, "Dr. Rife understood what made up the bacteria
        and virus that he wanted to kill with his frequency
        instrument."&nbsp; I quickly realized why nothing was working;
        the frequency instrument was not built right. There had to be a
        hidden side to this Rife machine with unseen, embedded
        frequencies.&nbsp; I asked Crane if Rife knew that the virus and
        bacteria frequencies had more to them then he was
        telling.&nbsp;&nbsp; Crane answered, "He found out that some of
        these virus and bacteria needed more then one frequency at a
        time to destroy it, even cancer." That answered my
        question.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was more to this machine then the
        people working on them knew, and that kept the secret safe. </p>
      <p>The unit was not complete yet and more work needed to be done
        to get this to work every time. Tom Bearden was told what it was
        and did write about it in a book called AIDS Biological Warfare
        in a chapter called DEVELOPING THE ELECTROMAGNETIC CURE FOR
        AIDS, Encouraging Preliminary Work on page 284.&nbsp; Tom
        Bearden did come and&nbsp; visit and see everything that we were
        doing with electromagnetic pump waves and mixing using
        interferometers and heterodyning units. </p>
      <p>When we did get something to work we would repeat the test over
        and over.&nbsp; Crane would ask what circuits we were using, but
        neither of us would answer him, and we'd change the subject. We
        could kill certain things but not others. </p>
      <p>Then came the day when we had 30 doctors in the room with
        us.&nbsp; We prepared the slide, put it under the microscope and
        put it up on a view screen so all could see.&nbsp; One push of
        the button on the machine, and BANG, the one cell animal was
        dead.&nbsp; All the doctors just went nuts.&nbsp; But the
        comments were very discouraging, "WE WILL NEVER TALK ABOUT THIS,
        WE WILL LOOSE OUR JOBS, THE FDA WILL RUN US OUT OF TOWN, WE WILL
        LOSE EVERYTHING." The main objection was that everything I did
        with the circuits was potted.&nbsp; Crane was the first to agree
        with all of them about this, saying there was something hidden
        in there, arguing,&nbsp; "We can't see it so we don't know if it
        works."&nbsp; I answered that we must protect what we have done
        so no one can change anything in the circuits.&nbsp; I kept very
        detailed notes as I went along on the circuits.&nbsp; At first
        they were very simple waves of different frequencies.&nbsp; As
        time went by, the waves got more complex. </p>
      <p>Rife comments in Crane's book, "Under the universal microscope,
        disease organisms, such as those of tuberculosis, cancer,
        sarcoma, streptococcus, typhoid, staphylococcus, leprosy, hoof
        and mouth disease, and others, may be observed to succumb when
        exposed to certain lethal frequencies, coordinated with the
        particular frequencies peculiar to each individual organism, and
        directed upon them by rays covering a wide range of
        waves."&nbsp;&nbsp; Rife's first machine used two transmitters.
        These two transmitters produce a mixing of frequencies (F1-F2)
        and the addition of some frequencies (F1+F2 ). In the mixing
        process many waves are produced with many fundamentals.&nbsp;
        The scope pictures above show what the mixing process
        produces.&nbsp;&nbsp; These wide band radio waves must contain
        all the fundamental frequencies for the known virus. The
        transmitters are then adjusted to produce the correct
        fundamental frequency.&nbsp; This is done by adjusting the
        amplitude output of one of the fundamental oscillators which
        changes the fundamental frequency and creates many harmonics of
        other fundamental frequencies, one behind the another, slightly
        out of phase.&nbsp; An example of this would be to take 62Hz, at
        3V peak to peak, and 1.059kHz, at 5V peak to peak, and mix the
        two to get a total output of 1.5V peak to peak, gating the
        oscillator at 150mV, and then modulating the 1.6000MHz
        transmitter.&nbsp; The frequency ends up being 1.556120 (the
        fundamental) with all the the harmonics added.&nbsp; Can you see
        that this is not as simple as just a single frequency square
        wave?&nbsp; The square waves were Crane's ideas, not
        Rife's.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Square waves only contain odd harmonics
        with amplitude.) </p>
      <p>To gain an understanding of what a "MOPA" transmitter is, See
        http://vintageham.com/stations.htm This link will give you a
        better understanding of the transmitter Rife used.&nbsp; Instead
        of an antenna, he used a gas tube. In the beginning he used two
        of these tunable oscillators into the same gas tube.&nbsp; I
        suspect that Rife figured out how to use the noble gas tube to
        mix frequencies. I will be running the experiments to see what
        happens. </p>
      <p>The AZ 58 transmitter must be tuned within 1% of the frequency
        fundamental to destroy the pathogen you're working with. See
        http://icehouse.net/john34/crystal.mpg, for example.&nbsp; The
        transmitter is a re-design of the original MOPA (Master
        Oscillator Power Amplifier) used by Rife.&nbsp; This is not what
        John Crane or John Marsh designed.&nbsp; The carrier frequency
        must be at 4.33MHz to work with Hoyland's frequency list.&nbsp;
        Hoyland's frequency list was accurate within 1% under all
        circumstances. The Microscope was altered, and so was the
        transmitter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have found the missing tube for
        the modulation and the missing circuit for the gating. I will be
        adding more on this later.&nbsp; The crystal is a piezo from a
        water purifier.&nbsp; It's oscillating frequency is
        970kHz.&nbsp; The transmitter had a carrier wave of 4.33Mhz and
        an audio frequency of 36.991kHz to achieve resonance.&nbsp;
        Again I'm saying that you can not be off more then 1%. Thank you
        Stan for suggesting this test. </p>
      <p>I have repeated this test using a square wave into the AZ-58
        transmitter. It is as I expected, the square wave does not have
        the correct fundamentals in this band to work with this
        transmitter. See it here
        http://icehouse.net/john34/square111.mpg. The Square wave has
        all odd harmonics as can be seen below. I have, however, found
        where the resonate frequency is of this piezo crystal is using a
        square wave.&nbsp; The square wave produces the same voltage
        level.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if the sine wave audio is at
        36.99 kHz for this crystal, the square wave will be at
        74.063kHz, and both waves will produce a 5 volt output level
        from the crystal.&nbsp; See
        http://icehouse.net/john34/square222.mpg.&nbsp;&nbsp; My
        conclusion is that either wave will work but you must be much
        higher in frequency with a square wave to get the same effect.
        The transmitter must accept a full audio spectrum from 10Hz to
        150Khz. I have only done this with "tubes" so far... </p>
      <p>John Crane and John Marsh had the real working
        machine.&nbsp;&nbsp; So why did they change it?&nbsp; If the
        machine Rife gave to John Marsh was tube driven, this answers
        the question. They did not understand tubes, nor did they want
        to work with them. They tried "Muntzing" it so it could be
        produced cheap. They took circuits out of it, but it did not
        work after that. The other question is, who altered the
        transmitter from the real Hoyland design?&nbsp; My best guess is
        Marsh and Crane, in an effort to keep the secret of the
        machine.&nbsp; The AZ-58 I'm working with has the correct
        circuits put back into the machine.&nbsp; It also has the
        correct gating circuits for the triode tube and can run in
        either mode. </p>
      <p>The AZ-58 MOPA transmitter broadcasting through the Phanatron
        tube is very directional.&nbsp; This is why the doctors had the
        tube so close to the patient. See here&nbsp;
        http://icehouse.net/john34/phanatron1.mpg.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        modulation is the key to the MOPA transmitter.&nbsp; I call this
        low band FM modulation.&nbsp; The frequency can not be listened
        to on AM, but can be heard on a low band FM all the way to 15Khz
        . See it here http://icehouse.net/john34/modgrid1.mpg... </p>
      <p>In the following experiment, Hoyland's given audio frequency
        was input (as a sine wave) into the machine and modulated on the
        RF carrier wave.&nbsp; We wanted to see if this would produce a
        powerful harmonic at Hoyland's measured frequency from Rife's
        1934 instrument.&nbsp; The analysis was done taken with an
        oscilloscope probe tip (shorted to its own ground so as not to
        damage the equipment with high rf power levels) directly in
        front of the Rife tube. With slight adjustment of the RF carrier
        wave, and, in some cases, slight adjustment of the audio
        frequency, we were indeed able to show that a powerful harmonic
        does indeed exist at each particular frequency Hoyland
        gave.&nbsp; We also found that proper adjustment of the audio
        signal level (dB) was important.&nbsp; If this is what Hoyland
        and Rife were doing, the spectrum analysis shows us that this
        process produces several powerful harmonics, each around the
        same power level.&nbsp; This could explain why there was so much
        confusion as to what the actual frequencies were.&nbsp; It also
        raises the issue that the documented frequencies may or may not
        be the ones that actually killed the germs, but perhaps a higher
        or lower harmonic. </p>

      <p>All tests so far indicate that the phanotron tube is a
        transducer of electrical waves to acoustical waves which are
        able to mechanically stimulate a piezocrystal to
        resonance.&nbsp; This is something that an ordinary antenna
        system (i.e. a "pad antenna" system) cannot do.&nbsp; We found
        the tube, like an ordinary audio speaker, to be
        directional.&nbsp; The stimulation of the crystal varies with
        the orientation of the tube. </p>
