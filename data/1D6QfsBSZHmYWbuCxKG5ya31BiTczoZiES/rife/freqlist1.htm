        <h2><font size="+1">Rife's Original Basic Frequencies</font></h2>
      </center>
      <p><br>
        For those who have been studying RIFE for many years now, how
        many remember the original claim relating to pleomorphics and
        the need for only 5 or 6 basic frequencies which RIFE said would
        kill any disease?&nbsp; It is quite similar to what Gaston
        Naessens claims but Rife preceded him though not using the same
        terminology. </p>
      <p>Over the years RIFE technology has become ever more complex as
        more people added stories and claims, and big bucks became
        involved.&nbsp; I have long been puzzled as to why no one refers
        back to the basic claims of RIFE, not all these
        'interpretations'... </p>
      <p>It's much like an inventor discovering a basic phenomenon but
        knowing he cannot make money with that as anyone can do it... so
        he makes a godawful complex machine (like Gray, two repulsive
        coils scaled up to the engine) which he can then patent and
        sell. </p>
      <p>Nothing wrong with trying to make money from a discovery or
        invention but stick with the basics of what works. </p>
      <p>We recently acquired copyright for the RIFE Way III book which
        will include a circuit diagram using ICs for the basic
        frequencies and a vacuum tube transmitter which is claimed to
        have been found as the ideal impedance matcher for the human
        body.&nbsp; I have a bit more to do with regard to getting the
        book together for inclusion in the products list but I wanted to
        post the frequency list and some description of the process. </p>
      <p>It seems everything mutates and grows into ever more complex
        structures as it ages.&nbsp; In virology and bacteriology this
        is called 'pleomorphism' which means </p>
      <p>'The theory that the various genera of bacteria are phases or
        variations of growth of a number of Protean species, each of
        which may exhibit, according to undetermined conditions, all or
        some of the forms characteristic of the different genera and
        species.' </p>
      <p>At one time back in the early 1980s Ed Skilling and Bob Beck
        were promoting this set of frequencies, then Riley Crabb (of
        Borderlands) was selling an audiotape with the frequencies on
        it...the idea being to listen to it for the 5 minutes of so or
        each frequency and it should explode the disease
        structure...however, I never heard of any successes from it nor
        should there be without a more intense coupling to the body to
        allow maximum amplitude. </p>
      <p>Same with the singing into a glass to cause it to break...you
        can sing all day at the exact resonant frequency, but if it is
        not of sufficient amplitude and not in phase (resonant) it won't
        blow it up though it will dance about the table a bit. </p>
      <p>The claim was that the basic viruses were responsive to the
        following frequencies; </p>
      <p>666 hz <br>
        690 hz <br>
        740 hz <br>
        1840 hz <br>
        1998 hz <br>
        (plus or minus 10 hz) </p>
      <p>Any of these can be easily projected using an off the shelf
        frequency generator using square waves and adjusting the
        amplitude to whatever you can handle, though I think it would
        need an amplifier to be effective, that is the beauty of the
        vacuum tube impedance matching circuit which will be in the
        book. </p>
      <p>No matter what pleomorphic stage these viruses had achieved
        within the body, they would still be subject to the basic
        frequencies and so would be exploded when exposed to them. </p>
      <p>The device used has an amplitude control as well as a fixed
        frequency 5 position switch for the 5 frequencies.&nbsp; A
        frequency generator could easily be used to allow other
        frequencies or these to be input to the vacuum tube amplifier
        section. </p>
      <p>Anyway, the stories I've been told about this device in
        particular include one that makes me particularly squeamish,
        'that worms will crawl out your rectum' when the device is
        applied.... also the appearance of zits, pimples, blackheads,
        diarrhea, tiredness, requiring more sleep, some possible
        allergic response or skin rash, excess urination....all
        temporary conditions and postivie indications that the body is
        indeed purging the toxins, poisons and diseases within it. </p>
      <p>That worms business has two connections, one is trichinosis
        from pork, one guy wrote in that they slit a pig, degutted it,
        poured wine into it and worms would crawl out....say ugh all you
        want, but I'd rather them crawl out and their eggs die than be
        living inside my body. .. </p>
      <p>The other connection is with Hulda Clarks claim of flukeworms
        as the cause of ALL DISEASE...where her ZAPPER is supposed to
        neutralize them.. </p>
      <p>I thought these basic ORIGINAL frequencies needed to be posted
        which were supposed to have been used for some 18 years with
        amazing successes when the vacuum tube amplifier was the
        coupling device. </p>
      <p>Additional frequencies as have seeped out of wherever over the
        years can be found at: </p>

      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The machine came with some old diary
          pages with a series of treatment settings scribbled on
          them.&nbsp; The year of the diary was not shown, just the
          months but February was shown.&nbsp; It was not a leap year
          and by matching the days of the week to the dates it had to be
          1939.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were the "usual" Rife pathogens plus a
          few more ailments that I had never seen quoted on any other
          early Rife machine list.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately they were
          not all complete so it wasn't possible to derive the true
          frequencies for all of them.&nbsp; The anomalies included:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">"V" with a setting of band 3, dial 39 -
          but I have no idea what this is.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">"Radiation" with a strange setting of
          "2-17-3"&nbsp; which could mean band 2 or 3 dial setting 17.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Pain - "20",&nbsp; Iodine Poisoning -
          "92",&nbsp; Mercury Poisoning - "55",&nbsp; Tissue repair -
          "58",&nbsp; Scar Tissue - "13",&nbsp; Mucous Colitis -
          "38",&nbsp; Haemorrhoid - "88",&nbsp;&nbsp; Catarrh -

        <font color="#000000">The treatment frequencies are all
          approximately 10 times the ones listed in the modern Crane
          derived frequency lists for various conditions.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">This begs the question of how effective
          these frequencies are in practice.&nbsp; During testing, a
          person with Candida was present during measurements.&nbsp;
          That person told me that they felt a strong reaction at a
          particular setting (the person did not know what frequencies I
          was using) - I noted that the setting in question was
          approximately 4640 Hz - which is exactly 10 times the common
          frequency of 464 Hz which is used for Candida in modern
          machines.&nbsp; To test the thing further I tried tuning the
          machine deliberately to 464 Hz (without the person in question
          knowing the setting) and the subject reported that there was
          no reaction.&nbsp; So the machine only seems to work on 10
          times settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; I discovered exactly the same
          phenomenon in myself during subsequent testing.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I have recently concluded that "MOR's"
          are not necessarily fixed and universal constants.&nbsp; I now
          believe that MOR's are specific to each machine and that the
          machine needs to be tuned to operate in a specific range&nbsp;
          - see my paper "Rife's Missing Link" for more details on this.</font>

        <h3>Updated Frequency List</h3>
      </center>
      This list is a compendium of frequencies that have been reported
      tby users of the device to have actual physiologic effects. Some
      of these are well know frequencies, used in a unique sequence,
      others are completely new heretofore unknown frequencies. This
      list will be updated as results are reported to me, all
      information should be considered as anecdotal, and not
      scientifically proven. These frequencies should not be considered
      as anything but experimental. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK; NO CLAIMS ARE
      MADE FOR EFFECTIVENESS.
      <p>Sedation or pain relief --- 304 --- Also nice to use as the
        last frequency of a set of frequencies. <br>
        Fibromyalgia and Joint Pains --- 650, 625, 600, 240, 95, 522,
        2900, 28 --- This set has many positive reports of symptomatic
        relief lasting from several days to almost a week: <br>
        Lyme Disease --- 432, 484, 610, 690, 790, and 864 --- Also
        reported: 2001 --- all the above plus : 652, 1103, 1500, 4200,
        450, 465. Please note the use of these frequencies has produced
        what is known as a Herxheimer Reaction. As the spirochetes die,
        they release a protein toxin that can produce joint pains,
        weakness, and general malaise for a few days following exposure.
        It has been suggested that one start slow with but a minute of
        exposure and then gradually increase the exposure time. One
        should not repeat an exposure until all effects and symptoms of
        the previous exposure have cleared. <br>
        Helicobacter Pylori --- 676 --- linked as a causative agent in
        stomach ulcers. <br>
        Blood Cancer : 728 --- A type of Cancer cell found in blood of
        people with Multiple Myeloma. Causes the cells to disintegrate
        according to one researcher. <br>
        Flu Virus : 728, 800, 88, 7760, 8000, 8250, 2050, 2180, 2452 ---
        Non responsive to Cancer at 2128 or 2008. It has been suggested
        that these Cancers are formed in response to some different
        stimulus than commonly occurs. <br>
        Cataracts : 1830, 1600, 9999, 1552, 2110, 1335, 1654, 2187,
        2195, 2211 <br>
        Emotion : 664, 764 --- Very beneficial for emotional ties to
        diseases. 664 has apparently caused people to giggle especially
        in a group exposure setting. <br>
        Epstein -Barr Virus : 660, 728, 787 --- also has been used for
        Mononucleosis. <br>
        Asthma --- 1234, 3672, 7344 --- Opens bronchioles makes
        breathing easier seems to be helpful for asthmatics. Also is
        quite sedating.7344 seems to work best of the three. <br>
        Sharpens Eyesight --- 350, 360 <br>
        Herpes Zoster --- 1489, 1500, 1550, 2489 --- relieves acute
        outbreak, but does not remove dormant form from body. Use of
        2489 for about 30 minutes seems to provide long term benefits. <br>
        Menie Cancerres Disease --- 9 Hz --- Removed all pain associated
        with. <br>
        Hand Tremors --- 470 --- Stopped involuntary tremors in left
        hand of a person with multiple sclerosis. <br>
        Tremors --- 463 and 466 stopped involuntary tremors in a person
        with brain tumors. <br>
        Warts --- 915 and 918 --- Plantar wart --- use long exposure
        time --- 15 to 30 minutes on each frequency. <br>
        Prostatitis --- 2050 and 2250 --- 10 to 15 minutes on each
        frequency. Use for a short interval will aggravate prostatitis!
        <br>
        Anger --- 3.6 and 6.3 Hz&nbsp; reported as being able to keep a
        person from becoming angry <br>
        Nausea and abdominal cramps --- 72, 95, 190, 304 <br>
        Chlamydia infections --- 866, 430, 2213, 620 <br>
        Central Nervous System --- 6000 --- A master Central Nervous
        System Frequency. Release of emotional problems, blocked
        seizures --- but does nothing once seizure starts, stopped
        tremors in hands in person with Parkinson's disease. <br>
        Hepatitis C --- 728, 166, 224, 317, 727, 787, 880, 2189 --- used
        by a Dr. in France to good effect. Exposures were of only 45
        seconds on each frequency. Longer exposures had no effect. <br>
        Multiple Sclerosis --- 5000 Hz for 30 minutes every other day,
        used the above Hep C protocol on alternate days. So one day
        5000, next day Hep C. One should start the 5000 at about 10
        minutes and work up in time slowly watching for detox reactions.
        <br>
        Psoriasis : --- 2180, 2128, 2008, 1552, 880, 784, 664, 304 ---
        From New Zealand comes this protocol. <br>
        Systemic Lupus Erythematosis (SLE) --- 633, 2125, 2008, 3612,
        802, 2489, 702 <br>
        Fruit Flies : 2167 Hz --- Reported by someone in the
        Netherlands. <br>
        Chronic Fatigue Syndrome --- 2127 , 465, 660, 666, 727, 787,
        880, 1550 --- Also used parasite frequencies. <br>
        Round Worms --- 104, 332, 422, 721, 942, 3212, 240, 688, 20, 120
        <br>
        Flukes --- 143, 275, 676, 763, 524, 854, 945, 651, 435, 524 <br>
        Incessant worrying --- 6130&nbsp; Hz <br>
        Gall Bladder --- 20, 727, 787, 880, 5000 <br>
        Pleural Efffusion --- 787, 474, 612, 361 <br>
        Basal Cell Skin Carcinoma --- 2116, 760, 2280 --- Direct
        exposure of the lesion to light from the tube helps as does
        pulsing the audio output. About 30 minutes exposures at 2116
        seemed optimal, 760 and 2280 at 5 minutes each. <br>
        Chem Spray Related Illness --- 664, 7344, 2842, 1147, 686.6,

      </center>
      <p>This is the concise list of frequencies.&nbsp; Many sets are
        exluded from this list, the sets (like the Keelynet and Crane
        ones) which merely specify for almost every <br>
        ailment the general frequencies of 728, 784/787, 880, 5000,
        10000, 800, 20. </p>
      <p>The following is a listing of these known MORs as compiled by
        Dr. Robert P. Stafford, M.D. a physician who worked with an
        original Rife machine from 1957 to 1963: </p>
      <p><b><i>Microorganism --- Frequency in Hertz:</i></b> </p>
      <p>Tetanus --- 120 <br>
        Treponema --- 660 <br>
        Gonorrhea --- 712 <br>
        Staphlococci --- 728 <br>
        Pneumococci --- 776 <br>
        Streptothrix (fungus) --- 784 <br>
        Streptococci --- 880 <br>
        Typhoid Bacteria --- 712 <br>
        Typhoid Virus --- 1862 <br>
        Bacillus Coli Rod Form --- 800 <br>
        Bacillus Coli Virus --- 1552 <br>
        Tuberculosis Rod Form --- 803 <br>
        Tuberculosis Virus --- 1552 (same as B-Coli) <br>
        Sarcoma (all forms) --- 2008 <br>
        Carcinoma (all forms) --- 2128 </p>
      <p>Format is frequency, what it supposedly effects, device,
        source. If the 'device' field says 'theory' it means that
        someone said this might work, but no-one has actually said
        anywhere that they've used it. If the 'device' field says
        'theory/440' then I took the frequency from Hulda Clark's book
        "The Cure For All Diseases" and divided by 440. </p>

      <p>Experiments conducted today show that there is indeed a major
        harmonic of the fundamental frequency from Rife's 1934 machine
        very near the fundamental audio frequency from Hoyland's
        machine.&nbsp; Were Hoyland's audio frequencies the true
        M.O.R.s? Did Rife's machine produce a harmonic that was the
        M.O.R.? </p>
