        <p><b>An Instrument which is Set in Motion by Vision or by
            Proximity of the Human body</b> </p>
        <p><b>By Charles Russ</b> <br>
          (M.B. Lond., M.R.C.S. Eng., &amp;c)</p>

      <p>Although the force or ray I am about to describe emerges from
        the human eye, and is therefore physiological, the means I
        employ for its demonstration involve the use of electrical and
        magnetic instruments. The need for the scrutiny of experts in
        the science of physics was therefore obvious. I have had the
        great advantage of giving successful demonstrations of the work
        to experts in physics, including 5 Fellows of the Royal Society,
        besides Doctors and Bachelors of Science. None of these
        physicists found any mechanical or electrical fallacy which
        could account for the effects which I demonstrate as due to
        human vision. They do not so far identify the ray or force as
        being of a known or unknown type. </p>
      <p>The fact that the direct gaze or vision of one person soon
        becomes intolerable to another person suggested to me that there
        might be a ray or radiation issuing from the human eye. If there
        is such a ray it may produce an uncomfortable effect on the
        other person’s retina or by collision with the other person’s
        ray; it is a fact that after a few seconds the vision of one or
        the other will have to be turned away at least for a short time.
        Numerous everyday observations and experiences seem to support
        the possibility of the existence of a ray or force emitted by
        the human eye, and in order to give my theory the support of
        some experimental evidence I decided to dry and find or create
        some instrument which should be set in motion by nothing more
        than the impact of human vision. </p>
      <p><b>Description of Apparatus</b> </p>
      <p>Within a metal box (Fig 1) I suspended a delicate solenoid made
        of fine copper wire. This solenoid was wound on a cylinder of
        celluloid and suspended by a silk fiber (unspun silk) 14 inches
        long; the silk fiber was contained within a long glass tube
        mounted in the roof of the metal box. Its upper end was attached
        to a cork stopper and its lower end was furnished with a small
        metal stirrup into which the solenoid could be hooked. Attached
        to the stirrup was a small magnet consisting of a short length
        of steel wire magnetized by a steel magnet. </p>
      <p>The box was 3 ft by 8-1/2 inches by 7 inches and lined with
        sheet aluminum. The far end of the box was closed by a sheet of
        window glass, and the near or observer’s end, was furnished with
        a thin glass r celluloid window which was also screened by a
        sheet of aluminum with a slot 3 in long and 1 in wide. A
        conducting wire connected the silk fiber with the aluminum of
        the box, which was earthed. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="russ1.jpg" height="313" width="501"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Method of Demonstration</b> </p>
      <p>The solenoid was held steady by the magnet which naturally came
        to rest in the magnetic meridian (Fig 1). If the human eye looks
        through the slot in the observing window and maintains a steady
        gaze at one end of the solenoid the latter will be seen to start
        into motion, which is usually away from the observing eye. If
        the gaze be now transferred to the true center of the solenoid
        the latte stops, and if the vision is now applied to the
        opposite end of the solenoid the latter moves in a reverse
        direction to the motion first induced. This maneuver may be
        repeated several times, each subsequent attempt being made only
        after the magnet has brought the solenoid to complete rest.
        Motion of the solenoid, though much reduced, was also obtained
        after interposing a column of water between the eye and the
        solenoid. </p>
      <p>In view of later work it is possible that the solenoid is
        acting as one element of a condenser system --- the air in the
        box being the dielectric. </p>
      <p>Early in 1918 I had been impressed by the rapid induction of
        motion of the solenoid immediately after its replacement in its
        box or case. This activity soon fades to a minimal value which
        can always be obtained. Thinking that such activity might be due
        to some electrically charged state, I constructed some light
        condensers and tested the effect of vision on them. The form of
        condenser used was a celluloid cylinder having strips of lead or
        aluminum foil adhesively fixed to its inner and outer surfaces
        in symmetrical arrangement. </p>
      <p>A large condenser of this type was made, 5 in diameter, 5 in
        long, and weighing 10 gr. It was suspended within a glass bowl
        10 in diameter by means of a silk fiber enclosed by a glass tube
        closed at the top end. The condenser was kept at rest by a small
        magnet fixed above it. The glass tube and its supporting
        platform formed an airtight cover to the bowl containing the
        condenser (Fig 2). The bowl was lined by aluminum foil except
        for small inspection areas at four diameter positions. For
        certain tests glass plates were also detachably mounted in a
        frame around the bowl with an air space between. </p>
      <p>Although such a large condenser is only slowly set in motion by
        the human gaze, I decided to test the effect upon it of the body
        generally, and placed my hands on the glass case. I found the
        effect was much enhanced, for within about 20 seconds the
        condenser was set in rotation, and such motion might amount to
        45 or even 90 degree. I noticed also that after producing this
        effect it only slowly returned to the zero position, in fact the
        return might require half an hour. </p>
      <p><b>Time and Degree of Reaction</b> </p>
      <p>The latent period and the degree of rotation obtained depend on
        the presence or absence of the extra glass plates which latter
        are also covered with foil. While producing this effect the
        operator’s vision is assisting the rotation and also appears to
        determine the direction of the movement obtained --- i.e.,
        whether clockwise or counterclockwise. To produce a rapidly
        acting model I suspended a sheet of celluloid 2-1/2 inch by 1
        inch inside a glass beaker. The celluloid was covered with gold
        leaf over an area of 2 sq in on each surface, and was suspended
        by a silk fiber and furnished with a control magnet. The glass
        beaker was covered inside and outside by aluminum foil except
        for inspection windows. If two fingers are placed on the vessel
        for two or three seconds then removed the card is seen to rotate
        towards the side of the hand used to touch the vessel wall. </p>
      <p><b>Possible Influence of Heat</b> </p>
      <p>At this point I will deal with the obvious possibility of heat
        being the cause of the motions described. Heat from the hands
        and body proximity is, of course, reaching the apparatus, and we
        know the delicacy of the heat-recording instruments at the
        command of the science of physics. I did not attempt to measure
        this heat, to measure this heat, but decided to apply heat to my
        apparatus. The results are shown in the following table, and I
        think the inference is that heat is inadequate to explain the
        effects observed. I found the effects much reduced, though not
        abolished, after surrounding the condenser by a jacket of water,
        paraffin, or methylated spirit. </p>
      <p>Heating experiments of the cases containing the condensers were
        undertaken in two ways: (1) radiant heat from one or two candles
        3 inches from the glass plates surrounding the large condenser
        (Fig 2) were almost entirely negative up to periods of six
        minutes; (2) Water heated to the temperatures shown in the table
        was placed in metal vessels against the glass plates, which were
        covered also with metal strips and areas of contact arranged
        were several times as large as the contact area of the human
        fingers. </p>
      <p>After placing the hands on the metal area of the guard plates
        the condenser moves after 30 seconds and usually travels through
        from 10 to 15 degrees within two minutes. In the hot-water
        experiments there was no vision applied. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>Effects of Vision Alone</b> </p>
      <p><i>Glass Rod Method </i>--- Remembering the activity referred
        to when replacing the coils and condensers in their cases, I
        decided to try the effects of charging them electrically by
        induction. If a glass rod rubbed with silk approaches the glass
        case (Fig 3) the condenser goes into rotary motion, and when
        this has ceased it comes to rest in the magnetic meridian. </p>
      <p>It is now sensitive to vision, and may, therefore, not be
        looked at until it has come to rest. This moment may be
        ascertained by a glance at its reflected image in a mirror 10
        feet away. When at rest its sensitiveness to vision only lasts
        about 30 seconds, depending on the force of the initial swing
        given by the rod’s approach. If the eye looks through the fluid
        and slot at the optimum period it will see the condenser go into
        active rotation which may amount to 30 or 45 degrees. The
        sensitiveness is brief and can only be renewed by recharging
        with glass rods. </p>
      <p>This method is one I used at first, but it is difficult and not
        quite satisfactory when demonstration to others; I have
        therefore improved upon it. </p>
      <p><i>Spot of Light Method --- </i>A small mirror is fixed to the
        stirrup on the end of the silk fiber. This mirror moves with the
        stirrup and its attached condenser. Light from a lamp near by
        falls on the mirror and is reflected on to a scale (as in the
        reflecting galvanometer). This is a very good method of proving
        that the condenser (set in motion by the induced electric
        charge) has come to rest. The spot of light is seen to move off
        rapidly as the electric charge is induced and its to-and-fro
        movement can be continuously observed on the scale without the
        eyes being directed at the condenser. When the spot of light has
        been seen to come to rest it will be found that human vision now
        directed at the condenser sets it, together with the spot of
        light, into rapid motion, which may be so large as to take the
        latter quickly off the scale. Special; caution is, however,
        needed in connection with this method, for I failed repeatedly
        in trying to use until I had noticed that no light from the lamp
        must be allowed to fall on the condenser. This is easily managed
        by interposing a screen of black paper or the equivalent between
        the lamp and the condenser. The little mirror in the stirrup is
        above the level of the condenser, and the small beam needed to
        give the spot of light is easily provided and focused by means
        of a lens if desired. </p>
      <p><i>Charge Plates Method ---</i> </p>
      <p>In Fig 3 the method is shown. Two metal plates are embedded in
        blocks of sulfur and mounted by the sides of the instrument. One
        is connected to the outer coating of a Leyden jar and is also
        connected to earth. The other plate embedded in the insulating
        sulfur is connected to the inner coating of the jar by a spring
        or chain and cap contact with the knob of the jar. The Leyden
        jar is charged by contact with an electrical friction machine
        giving several thousand volts. At the moment of applying this
        electrical pressure to the plates the condenser goes into active
        rotation. After a moderate charge from the Leyden jar this swing
        subsides and the condenser will be held for some minutes with
        its axis at right angles to the meridian. In this case the
        electric stress overpowers the magnetic pull. If the operator
        now looks into the open end of the condenser he will see its
        movement through 20-30 degrees; when the eyes are closed it
        returns to iis former position. Note must be made of the
        direction it takes. We know that left to itself the south end of
        the magnet will slowly turn towards the earth’s south pole as
        the electric stress fades. If vision of the operator causes the
        south end of the magnet to go towards the earth’s north pole. I
        call it an anti-magnetic effect. If, however, his vision causes
        the reverse motion it has the same value as an effect provided
        it is found on removing the force (closing his eyes) that the
        condenser (and of course its attached magnet) returns to the
        stressed position at right angles to the meridian. </p>
      <p>An important point must be made of the primary swing. It is
        vital to the production of the sensitiveness to vision of the
        condenser. If for any reason there is no swing there will be no
        movement after vision is applied. In case the swing was
        operating by making in its passage through the air in the vessel
        a frictional charge on the condenser. I tested the matter
        another way. Taking a bar magnet and moving it round the glass
        case one makes the control magnet in the stirrup swing, and of
        course its attached condenser also swings. In this way no
        electric batteries or rods are used to set up the primary swing.
        The effect of sensitiveness to vision is still observable,
        though I think less actively than when using the Leyden jar
        method; but the experiment serves to emphasize the need of the
        swing and perhaps to throw light on the true nature of the
        vision effects. If repeated observations are made involving
        frequent charging of the plates the motion of the condenser
        becomes lazy under the static charge, but recovers after a
        little rest. </p>
      <p>The electric charge will only hold for a few minutes on the jar
        and plates in damp weather. If dry conditions exist many vision
        effects may be obtained from only one charge. If, after
        charging, the condenser having come to rest, one discharges the
        jar by the insulated tongs, the condenser will show a rapid
        swing at the moment of electric discharge from the jar. By means
        of an accumulator and coil and spark gap I have tried to
        maintain the charge on the jar, so far with moderate success. As
        yet it is not easy to keep the condenser quite still, but when
        the apparatus is improved it will become independent of the
        humidity factor. </p>

        <p><img src="russ3.jpg" height="465" width="551"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Controls and Precautions</b> </p>
      <p>This system of the stressed plates is an extremely sensitive
        indicator of an electrostatic change. The operator must be still
        and seated behind a glass or celluloid screen so that no water
        vapor from nose or mouth can reach the glass case. His eyes are
        closed and no movements of limbs or other objects must disturb
        the vicinity of the electric field. When told by the assistant
        (or seeing by the spot of light) that condenser is at rest, he
        will look at it and perceive that his vision has set it in
        motion, which can be measured on the scale. If the eyes are not
        opened or only the hand has been kept in the operating position
        there will be no effect. There must, of course, be no vibration
        of the room by traffic, or any mechanical disturbance of the
        supporting bench. </p>
      <p><b>Darkness Tests</b> </p>
      <p>I did four tests which seemed to give a positive result, but
        many more such tests would be required before a decision could
        be made on this point. </p>
      <p><b>Probable Nature of the Effect</b> </p>
      <p>There is an electrical change in the retina accompanying
        vision. There are also the electric changes in muscles when in
        action, and these will have associated electric fields. The eye
        muscles include the ciliary and iris and the oculomotor group.
        Whether the fields from these sources are adequate to account
        for the effect cannot be answered at present. </p>
      <p><i>Heat --- </i>Besides the evidence in the table the
        arrangements in Fig 3 probably exclude htis agency as a cause of
        the movement obtained. </p>
      <p><i>Electrostatic Force --- </i>A force of this type cannot
        pass a fine metallic grid, and may therefore be considered
        unlikely to produce the activity obtained </p>
      <p><i>Electromagnetic Force --- </i>This group of vibrations
        includes a large number of rays ranging from the x-ray to the
        wireless waves. The influence of light from the lamp seems
        suggestive of an influence of this type, but no critical tests
        have done on these lines. </p>
      <p><b>Summary</b> </p>
      <p>Human vision can disturb the electrostatic state of an enclosed
        system. After the condenser has come to rest there must still
        exist a turbulence described. This turbulence appears to be
        reinforced or amplified by the applied vision, and is shown by
        (1) the activity shown by opening and closing the container; (2)
        the activity after rotating the condenser by the bar magnet; (3)
        the activity following the slight heating of the medium by the
        fingers on the guard plates; (4) the activity shown during the
        fading guard plates. Of course, at the time of operating these
        instruments by any use of the above methods the turbulence is
        not sufficient to cause motion --- i.e., the condenser has come
        to rest. Since the particles of any gas are always in motion it
        is probable that the effects of vision are only produceable when
        the turbulence of the medium is critical --- i.e., of a certain
        intensity. If the turbulence has fallen below this degree the
        activity to vision is lost. This latter point is shown by the
        fact that activity to vision is lost long before the sparking
        power has disappeared from the Leyden jar (Fig 4). </p>

      <p>I do not propose to say more at present as to the probable
        nature of the force accompanying the act of human vision of
        which these experiments are the evidence. Instead I restrict the
        claim of my work to our possession of the instrument which
        affords the evidence of the force, and which is the limit of the
        title of this article. The only reference in the literature I
        have met was mentioned to me by a friend in 1919. It is a
        destructive criticism by Lord Kelvin of the word, by a French
        physicist on the Supposed New Force. After reading Lord Kelvin’s
        paper one must, I think endorse his view that the author failed
        to establish his views, as he would not even enclose his
        instruments to meet the objection of air or heat currents. </p>
      <p>During the course of this work, which&nbsp; has occupied spare
        time since December 1917, I have had the advantage of criticism
        and suggestions by my brother Prof Sydney Russ, Prof A. Porter,
        FRS, Prof Rankine, and others as to the physical aspects of my
        experimental arrangements. </p>

        <p><b>( 24 March 1919 )</b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">An Instrument Set in Motion and whose
              Motion is Controlled by the Human Eye, i.e., by Vision</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This invention consists in an instrument which is set in motion
        and whose motion is controlled by the human eye, i.e., by
        vision. </p>
      <p>The instrument is the practical embodiment determined by the
        results of experiments which have made to ascertain whether
        there is a ray or radiation proceeding from the human eye. </p>
      <p>To this end a delicate solenoid of metallic wire is lightly
        suspended in the vicinity of two charged insulated electrical
        conductors and such solenoid can be set in motion and its motion
        controlled by the vision of one or both eyes directed at one or
        the other extremity of the solenoid. In an alternative
        construction, the solenoid may also be arranged as one of the
        electrodes (a movable terminal). The same effect is produced by
        arranging the solenoid in the vicinity of a magnet or
        electromagnet. </p>
      <p>In a further modification the solenoid is suspended within the
        field of another solenoid and the same effect is produced. </p>
      <p>I have also been able to produce the motion of the solenoid by
        directing the vision at the solenoid through glass or celluloid.
      </p>
      <p>The annexed drawing illustrates an example of construction of
        the instrument. </p>

      <p>Within a metal or glass case a (or other draught proof device)
        I suspend a solenoid b of fine copper or thin iron wire by means
        of a silk thread or slender metallic cord or chain c. This
        solenoid hangs over but does not touch, a metallic disc d raised
        and electrically insulated from the floor e of the case. </p>
      <p>An electrically insulated wire f is connected to the solenoid
        and another g to the disc, and by means of a battery h or other
        source of electric energy, each of them is electrically
        (statically charged. In this way, the air space between the
        solenoid b and disc d is in a state of electric stress, which is
        never great enough for a discharge (or spark) to take place. To
        this stressed zone the human eye will direct its vision and then
        the solenoid previously stationary will begin to move in a plane
        at right angles to its suspending fiber. This effect is best
        produced by directing the vision of one or both eyes at the one
        extreme end of the solenoid, and by steady gaze to follow in
        changing focus its steady motion. The reverse motion will be
        produced by transfer of the vision to the opposite end of the
        solenoid. </p>
      <p>The foregoing is, however, only one method of producing the
        effect. The following are various modifications. </p>
      <p>(A) The solenoid may be uncharged electrically if it is
        suspended by a non-conducting (i.e., an unsilvered) thread or
        fiber between two electrically charged discs, so as to hang
        within the zone of electric stress. It will move as described by
        vision directed upon it. </p>
      <p>(B) The solenoid may be suspended within the field of a
        permanent or electromagnet. </p>
      <p>(C) If the materials of the apparatus --- glass of the case ---
        solenoid and fiber are made sufficiently delicate, and draught,
        and forces such as heat from any lamps, extraneous to the
        apparatus are rigidly excluded, then there is no need for any
        electrical or magnetic force to be used. That is, the human eye
        is able to initiate and maintain --- up to fatigue point --- a
        small but definite motion upon a solenoid. </p>
      <p>With all of the foregoing I use an enclosing case of metal or
        glass. If metal, the case is furnished with glass or celluloid
        windows which the vision traverses to produce the effect. </p>
