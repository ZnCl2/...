      <p><b><font size="+1">1. Heavenly Consciousness (The Heart) ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>Master Lu-tsu said, That which exists through itself is called
        the Way (Tao). Tao has neither name nor shape. It is the one
        essence [<i>Hsing</i>], the one primal spirit. Essence and life
        cannot be seen. They are contained in the light of heaven. The
        light of heaven cannot be seen. It is contained in the two eyes.
        Today I will be your guide and will first reveal to you the
        secret of the Golden Flower of the great One, and starting from
        that, I will explain the rest in detail. </p>
      <p>The great One is the term given to that which has nothing above
        it. The secret of the magic of life consists in using action in
        order to attain non-action. One must not wish to leap over
        everything and penetrate directly. The maxim handed down to us
        is to take in hand the work on human nature (<i>hsing</i>). In
        doing this is importance not to take any wrong path. </p>
      <p>The Golden Flower is the light. What color is the light? One
        uses the Golden Flower as a symbol. It is the true energy of the
        translucent great one. The phrase "The lead of the water-region
        has but one taste" refers to it. </p>
      <p>[ *** Heaven created water through the One (<i>Hsing</i>). That
        is the true energy of the Great One. If man attains this One he
        becomes alive; if he loses it he dies. But even if man lives in
        the energy (vital breath, <i>prana</i>) he does not see the
        energy (<i>prana</i>), just as fishes live in water but do not
        see the water. Man dies when he has no vital breath, just as
        fishes perish when deprived of water. Therefore the adepts have
        taught people to holdfast to the primal, and to guard the One;
        it is the circulation of the light and the maintaining of the
        center. If one guards this true energy, one can prolong the span
        of life, and can then apply the method of creating an immortal
        body by "melting and mixing". ] </p>
      <p>The work on the circulation of the light depends entirely on
        the backward-flowing movement, so that the thoughts (the place
        of heavenly consciousness, the heavenly heart) are gathered
        together. The heavenly heart lies between sun and moon (the two
        eyes). </p>
      <p><i>The Book of the Yellow Castle</i> says: "In the square inch
        field of the square foot house, life can be regulated". The
        square foot house is the face. The square inch field in the
        face: what could that be other than the heavenly heart? In the
        middle of the square inch dwells the splendour. In the purple
        hall of the city of jade dwells the God of Utmost Emptiness and
        Life. The Confucians call it the center of emptiness; the
        Buddhist, the terrace of living; the Taoists, the ancestral
        land, or the yellow castle, or the dark pass, or the space of
        former heaven. The heavenly heart is like the dwelling place,
        the light is the master. </p>
      <p>Therefore when the light circulates, the energies of the whole
        body appear before its throne, as, when a holy king has
        established the capital and has laid down the fundamental rules
        of order, all the states approach with tribute; or as, when the
        master is quiet and calm, men-servants and maids obey his orders
        of their own accord, and each does his work. </p>
      <p>Therefore you have only to make the light circulate: that is
        the deepest and most wonderful secret. The light is easy to
        move, but difficult to fix. If it is made to circulate long
        enough, then it crystallizes itself; that is the natural
        spirit-body. This crystallized spirit is formed beyond the nine
        heavens. It is the condition of which it is said in the Book of
        the Seal of the Heart: "Silently thou fliest upward in the
        morning". </p>
      <p>In carrying out this fundamental principle you need to seek for
        no other methods, but must only concentrate your thoughts on it.
        The book <i>Leng Yen</i> says: "By collecting the thoughts one
        can fly and will be born in heaven". Heaven is not the wide blue
        sky but the place where corporeality is begotten in the house of
        the Creative. If one keeps this up for a long time there
        develops quite naturally, in addition to the body, yet another
        spirit-body. </p>
      <p>The Golden Flower is the Elixir of Life (<i>Chin-tan</i>,
        golden pill). All changes of spiritual consciousness depend upon
        the heart. There is a secret charm which, although it works very
        accurately, is yet so fluid that it needs extreme intelligence
        and clarity, and the most complete absorption and tranquility.
        People without this highest degree of intelligence and
        understanding do not find this highest degree of intelligence
        and understanding do not find the way to apply the charm; people
        without this utmost capacity for absorption and tranquility
        cannot keep fast hold of it. </p>
      <p>[ *** This section explains the origin of the great Way (the
        Tao) of the world. The heavenly heart is the germ of the great
        Way. If you can be absolutely quiet then the heavenly heart will
        spontaneously manifest itself. When the feeling stirs and
        expresses itself in the normal flow, man is created as primal
        creature. This creature abides between conception and birth in
        true space; when the one note of individuation enters into the
        birth, human nature and life are divided in two. From this time
        on, if the utmost quietness is not achieved, human nature and
        life never see each other again. </p>
      <p>Therefore it is said in <i>The Plan of the Supreme Ultimate</i>
        that the great One includes within itself true energy (prana),
        seed, spirit, animus and anima. If the thoughts are absolutely
        tranquil so that the heavenly heart can be seem, the spiritual
        intelligence reaches the origin unaided. This human nature lives
        indeed in true space, but the radiance of the light dwells in
        the two eyes. Therefore the Master teaches the circulation of
        the light so that the true human nature may be reached. The true
        human nature is the primal spirit. The primal spirit is
        precisely human nature and life, and if one accepts what is real
        in it, it is the primal energy. And the great Way is just this
        thing. </p>
      <p>The Master is further concerned that people should not miss the
        way that leads from conscious action to unconscious non-action.
        Therefore he says, the magic of the Elixir of Life makes use of
        conscious action in order that unconscious non-action may be
        attained. Conscious action consists in setting the light in
        circulation by reflection in order to make manifest the release
        of heaven, If then the true seed is born, and the right method
        applied in order to melt and mix it, and in that way to create
        the Elixir of Life, then one goes through the pass. The embryo,
        which must be developed by the work of warming, nourishing,
        bathing, and washing, is formed. That passes over into the realm
        of unconscious non-action. A whole year of this fire-period is
        needed before the embryo is born, sheds the shells, and passes
        out of the ordinary world into the holy world. </p>
      <p>This method is quite simple and easy. But there are so many
        transforming and changing conditions connected with it that it
        is said that not with one leap can a man suddenly get there.
        Whoever seeks eternal life must search for the place whence
        human nature and life originally sprang. ] </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">2. The Primal Spirit and the Conscious
            Spirit ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>Master Lu-tsu said, "In comparison with heaven and earth, man
        is like a mayfly. But compared to the great Way, heaven and
        earth, too, are like a bubble and a shadow. Only the primal
        spirit and the true nature overcome time and space". </p>
      <p>The energy of the seed, like heaven and earth, is transitory,
        but the primal spirit is beyond the polar differences. Here is
        the place whence heaven and earth derive their being. When
        students understand how to grasp the primal spirit they overcome
        the polar opposites of light and darkness and tarry no longer in
        the three worlds. But only he who has envisioned human nature’s
        original face is able to do this. </p>
      <p>When men are set free from the womb, the primal spirit dwells
        in the square inch (between the eyes), but the conscious spirit
        dwells below in the heart. This lower fleshly heart has the
        shape of a large peach: it is covered by the wings of the lungs,
        supported by the liver, and served by the bowels. This heart is
        dependent on the outside world. If a man does not eat for one
        day even, it feels extremely uncomfortable. If it hears
        something terrifying it throbs; if it hears something enraging
        it stops; if it is faced with death it becomes sad; if it sees
        something beautiful it is dazzled. But the heavenly heart in the
        head, when would it have moved in the least? Dost thou ask: Can
        the heavenly heart not move? Then I answer: How can the true
        thought in the square inch move! If it really moves, that is not
        good. For when ordinary men die, then it moves, but that is not
        good. It is best indeed if the light has already solidified into
        a spirit-body and its life-energy gradually penetrated the
        instincts and movements. But that is a secret which has not been
        revealed for thousands of years. </p>
      <p>The lower heart moves like a strong, powerful commander who
        despises the heavenly rule because of his weakness, and has
        usurped the leadership in affairs of state. But when the primal
        castle can be fortified and defended, then it is as is a strong
        and wise ruler sat upon the throne. The eyes start the light
        circulating like two ministers at the right and left who support
        the ruler with all their might. When rule in the center is thus
        in order, all those rebellious heroes will present themselves
        with lances reversed ready to take orders. </p>
      <p>The way to the Elixir of Life knows as supreme magic,
        seed-water, spirit-fire, and thought-earth: these three. What is
        seed-water? It is the true, one energy of former heaven (eros).
        Spirit fire is the light (logos). Thought-earth is the heavenly
        heart of the middle dwelling (intuition). Spirit-fire is used
        for the foundation. Ordinary men make their bodies through
        thoughts. The body is not only the seven foot-tall outer body.
        In the body is the anima. The anima adheres to consciousness, in
        order to affect it. Consciousness depends for its origin on the
        anima. The anima is yin (feminine), it is the substance of
        consciousness. As long as this consciousness is not interrupted,
        it continues to beget from generation to generation, and the
        changes of form of the anima and the transformations of
        substance are unceasing. </p>
      <p>But, besides this, there is the animus in which the spirit
        shelters. The animus lives in the daytime in the eyes; at night
        it houses in the liver. When living in the eyes, it sees; when
        housed in the liver, it dreams. Dreams are the wanderings of the
        spirit through all nine heavens and all nine earths. But whoever
        is in a dark and withdrawn mood on waking, and chained to his
        bodily form, is fettered by the anima. Therefore the
        concentration of the animus is brought about by the circulation
        of the light, and in this way the spirit is maintained, the
        anima subjugated, and consciousness cut off. The method used by
        the ancients for escaping from the world consisted in melting
        out completely the slag of darkness in order to return to the
        purely creative. This is nothing more than a reduction of the
        anima and a completion of the animus. And the circulation of the
        light is the magical means of reducing the dark, and gaining
        mastery over the anima. Even if the work is not directed towards
        bringing back the Creative, but confines itself to the magical
        means of the circulation of the light, it is just the light that
        is the Creative. By means of its circulation, one returns to the
        Creative. If this method is followed, plenty of seed-water will
        be present of itself; the spirit fire will be ignited, and the
        thought-earth will solidify and crystallize. And thus the holy
        fruit matures. The scarabaeus rolls his ball and in the ball
        there develops life as the result of the undivided effort of his
        spiritual concentration. If now an embryo can grow in manure,
        and shed its shells, why then should not the dwelling place of
        our heavenly heart also be able to create a body if we
        concentrate the spirit upon it? </p>
      <p>The one effective, true human nature (logos united with
        vitality), when it descends into the house of the Creative,
        divides into animus and anima. The animus is I the heavenly
        heart. It is of the nature of light; it is the power of
        lightness and purity. It is that which we have received from the
        great emptiness, that which is identical in form with the
        primordial beginning. The anima partakes of the nature of the
        dark. It is the energy of the heavy and the turbid; it is bound
        to the bodily fleshly heart. The animus loves life. The anima
        seeks death. All sensuous desires and impulses of anger are
        effects of the anima; itisthe conscious spirit which after death
        is nourished on blood, but which, during life, is in greatest
        distress. The dark returns to darkness and like things attract
        each other according to their kind. But the pupil understands
        how to distil the dark anima completely so that it transforms
        itself into pure light (yang). </p>
      <p>&nbsp;[ *** In this part there is described the role played by
        the primal spirit and the conscious spirit in the making of the
        human body. The Master says, The life of man is like that of a
        mayfly: only the true human nature of the primal spirit can
        transcend the cycle of heaven and earth and the fate of the
        aeons. The true human nature proceeds from that which has no
        polarity [the ultimate] whereby it takes the true essence of
        heaven and earth into itself and becomes the conscious spirit.
        As primal spirit it receives its human nature from father and
        mother. This primal spirit is without consciousness and
        knowledge, but is able to regulate the formative processes of
        the body. The conscious spirit is very evident and very
        effective, and can adapt itself unceasingly. It is the ruler of
        the human heart. As long as it stays in the body it is the
        animus. After its departure from the body it becomes spirit.
        While the body is entering into existence, the primal spirit has
        not yet formed an embryo in which it could incorporate itself.
        Thus it crystallizes itself in the non-polarized free One. </p>
      <p>At the time of birth the conscious spirit inhales the energy
        and thus becomes the dwelling of the new-born. It lives in the
        heart. From that on the heart is master, and the primal spirit
        loses its place while the conscious spirit has the power. </p>
      <p>The primal spirit loves stillness, and the conscious spirit
        loves movement. In its movement it remains bound to feelings and
        desires. Day and night it wastes the primal seed till the energy
        of the primal spirit is entirely used up. Then the conscious
        spirit leaves the shell and goes away. </p>
      <p>Whoever has done good in the main has spirit-energy that is
        pure and clear when death comes. It passes out by the upper
        openings of mouth and nose. The pure and light energy rises
        upward and floats up to heaven and becomes the fivefold present
        shadow-genius, or shadow-spirit. But if, during life, the primal
        spirit was used by the conscious spirit for avarice, folly,
        desire, and lust, and committed all sorts of sins, then in the
        moment of death the spirit-energy is turbid and confused, and
        the conscious spirit passes out together with the breath,
        through the lower openings of the door of the belly. For if the
        spirit-energy is turbid and unclean, it crystallizes downward,
        sinks sown to hell, and becomes a demon. Then not only does the
        primal spirit lose its nature, but the power and wisdom of true
        human nature is thereby lessened. Therefore the Master says, If
        it moves, that is not good. </p>
      <p>If one wants to maintain the primal spirit one must, without
        fail, first subjugate the perceiving spirit. The way to
        subjugate it is through the circulation of the light. If one
        practices the circulation of the light, one must forget both
        body and heart. The heart must die, the spirit live. When the
        spirit lives, the breath will begin to circulate in a wonderful
        way. This is what the Master called the very best. Then the
        spirit must be allowed to dive down into the abdomen (solar
        plexus). The energy then has intercourse with spirit, and spirit
        unites with the energy and crystallizes itself. This is the
        method of starting the work. </p>
      <p>In time, the primal spirit transforms itself in the dwelling of
        life into the true energy. At that time, the method of the
        turning of the millwheel must be applied, in order to distill it
        so that it becomes the Elixir of Life. That is the method of
        concentrated work. </p>
      <p>When the Life Elixir pearl is finished, the holy embryo can be
        formed; then the work must be directed to the warning and
        nourishing of the spiritual embryo. That is the method of
        finishing. </p>
      <p>When the energy-body of the child is fully formed, the work
        must be directed that the embryo is born and returns to
        emptiness. That is the method of ending the work. </p>
      <p>From the most ancient times till today, this is not empty talk,
        but the sequence of the Great Way in the true method of
        producing an eternally living and immortal spirit and holy man.
      </p>
      <p>But if the work is so far consummated, then everything
        belonging to the dark principle is wholly absorbed, and the body
        is born into pure light. When the conscious spirit has been
        transformed into the primal spirit, then only one can say that
        it has attained an infinite capacity for transformations and,
        departing from the cycle of births, has been brought to the
        sixfold present, golden genius. If this method of ennobling is
        not applied, how will the way of being born and dying be
        escaped? ] </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">3. Circulation of the Light and Protection
            of the Center ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>Master Lu-tsu said, since when has the expression "circulation
        of the ligh" been revealed? It was revealed by the "True Men of
        the Beginning of Form" (Kuan Yin-hsi). When the light is made to
        move in a circle, all the energies of heaven and earth, of the
        light and the dark, are crystallized. That is what is termed
        seed-like thinking, or purification of the energy, or
        purification of the idea. When one begins to apply this magic it
        is as if, in the middle of being, there were non-being. When in
        the course of time the work is completed, and beyond the body
        there is a body, it is as if, in the middle of non-being, there
        were being.&nbsp; Only after concentrated work of a hundred days
        will the light be genuine, then only will it become spirit-fire.
        After a hundred days there develops by itself in the midst of
        the light a point of the true light-pole (yang). Then suddenly
        there develops the seed pearl. It is as if man and woman
        embraced and a conception took place. Then one must be quite
        still and wait. The circulation of the light is the epoch of
        fire. </p>
      <p>In the midst of primal transformation, the radiance of the
        light (yang-kuang), is the determining thing. In the physical
        world it is the sun; in man, the eye. The radiation and
        dissipation of spiritual consciousness is chiefly brought about
        by this energy when it is directed outward (flows downward).
        Therefore the Way of the Golden Glower depends wholly on the
        backward-flowing method. </p>
      <p>[ *** Man’s heat stands under the fire trigram, <i>Li</i>. The
        flames of the fire press upward. When both eyes are looking at
        things of the world it is with vision directed outward. Now if
        one closes the eyes and, reversing the glance, directs it inward
        and looks at the room of the ancestors, that is the
        backward-flowing method. The energy of the kidneys is under the
        water sign. When the desires are stirred, it runs downward, is
        directed outward, and creates children. If, in the moment of
        release, it is not allowed to flow outward, but is led back by
        the energy of thought so that it penetrates the crucible of the
        Creative, and refreshes heart and body and nourishes them, that
        also is the backward-flowing method. Therefore it is said, The
        Way of the Elixir of Life depends entirely on the
        backward-flowing method. ] </p>
      <p>The circulation of the light is not only a circulation of the
        seed-blossom of the individual body, but it is even a
        circulation of the true, creative, formative energies. It is not
        a momentary fantasy, but the exhaustion of the cycle
        (soul-migration) of all the aeons. Therefore the duration of a
        breath means a year according to human reckoning and a hundred
        years measured by the long night of the nine paths (of
        reincarnation). </p>
      <p>After a man has the one sound of individuation (<i>ho</i>)
        behind him, he will be born outward according to the
        circumstances, and until his old age he will never look
        backward. The energy of the light exhausts itself and trickles
        away. That brings the ninefold darkness (of reincarnations) into
        the world. In the book <i>Leng Yen</i> it is said: "By
        concentrating the thoughts, one can fly; by concentrating the
        desires, one falls". When a pupil takes little care of his
        thoughts and much care of his desires, he gets into the path of
        submersion. Only through contemplation and quietness does true
        intuition arise: for that the backward-flowing method is
        necessary. </p>
      <p>In the <i>Book of the Secret Correspondences</i> it is said:
        "Release is in the eye". In the <i>Simple Questions of the
          Yellow Ruler</i> it is said: "The seed-blossoms of the human
        body must be concentrated upward in the empty space". This
        refers to it. Immortality is contained in this sentence and also
        the overcoming of the world is contained in it. This is the
        common goal of all religions. </p>
      <p>The light is not in the body alone, nor is it only outside the
        body. Mountains and rivers and the great earth are lit by sun
        and moon; all that is this light. Therefore it is not only
        within the body. Understanding and clarity, perception and
        enlightenment, and all movements (of the spirit) are likewise
        this light; therefore it is not just something outside the body.
        The light-flower of heaven and earth fills all the thousand
        spaces. But also the light-flower of the individual body passes
        through heaven and covers the earth. Therefore, as soon as the
        light is circulating, heaven and earth, mountains and rivers,
        are all circulating with it at the same time. To concentrate the
        seed-flower of the human body above the eyes, that is the great
        key of the human body. Children, take heed! If for a day you do
        not practice meditation, this light streams out, who knows
        whither? If you only meditate for a quarter of an hour, by it
        you can do away with a thousand births. All methods end in
        quietness. This marvelous magic cannot be fathomed. </p>
      <p>But when the practice is started, one must press on from the
        obvious to the profound, from the coarse to the fine. Everything
        depends on there being no interruption. The beginning and the
        end of the practice must be one. In between there are cooler and
        warmer moments, that goes without saying. But the goal must be
        to reach the vastness of heaven and the depths of the sea, so
        that all methods seem quite easy and taken for granted. Only
        then have we mastered it. </p>
      <p>All holy men have bequeathed this tone another: nothing is
        possible without contemplation (<i>fang-chao</i>, reflection).
        When Confucius says: "Perceiving brings one to the goal"; or
        when the Buddha calls it: "The vision of the heart"; or Lao-tse
        says: "Inner vision", it is all the same. </p>
      <p>Anyone can talk about reflection, but he cannot master it if he
        does not know what the word means. What has to be reversed by
        reflection is the self-conscious heart, which has to direct
        itself towards that point where the formative spirit is not yet
        manifest. Within our six-foot body we must strive for the form
        which existed before the laying down of heaven and earth. If
        today people sit and meditate only one or two hours, looking
        only at their own egos, and call this reflection, how can
        anything come of it? </p>
      <p>The two founders of Buddhism and Taoism have taught that one
        should look at the tip of one’s nose. But they did not mean that
        one should fasten one’s thoughts to the tip of the nose. Neither
        did they mean that, while the eyes were looking at the tip of
        the nose, the thoughts should be concentrated on the yellow
        middle. Wherever the eye looks, the heart is directed also. How
        can it be directed at the same time upward (yellow middle), and
        downward (tip of the nose), or alternatively, so that it is now
        up, now down? All that means confusing the finger which points
        to the moon with the moon itself. </p>
      <p>What then is really meant by this? The expression "tip of the
        nose" is very cleverly chosen. The nose must serve the eyes as a
        guideline. If one is not guided by the nose, either one opens
        wide the eyes and looks into the distance, so that the nose is
        not seen, or the lids shut too much, so that the eyes close, and
        again the nose is not seen. But when the eyes are opened too
        wide, one makes the mistake of directing them outward, whereby
        one is easily distracted. If they are closed too much, one makes
        the mistake of letting them turn inward, whereby one easily
        sinks into a dreamy reverie. Only when the eyelids are lowered
        properly halfway is the tip of the nose seen in just the right
        way. Therefore it is taken as a guideline. The main thing is to
        lower the eyelids in the right way, and then to allow the light
        to streaming of itself; without effort, wanting the light to
        stream in concentratedly. Looking at the tip of the nose serves
        only as the beginning of the inner concentration, so that the
        eyes are brought into the right direction for looking, and then
        are held to the guideline: after that, one can let it be. That
        is the way a mason hangs up a plumb-line. As soon as he has hung
        it up, he guides his work by it without continually bothering
        himself to look at the plumb-line. </p>
      <p>Fixating contemplation is a Buddhist method which has not by
        any means been handed down as a secret. </p>
      <p>One looks with both eyes at the tip of the nose, sits upright
        and in a comfortable position, and holds the heart to the center
        in the midst of conditions. In Taoism it is called the yellow
        middle, in Buddhism the center of the midst of conditions. The
        two are the same. It is not necessarily mean the middle of the
        head. It is only a matter of fixing one’s thinking on the point
        which lies exactly between two eyes. Then all is well. The light
        is something extremely mobile. When one fixes the thought on the
        mid-point between the two eyes, the light streams in of its own
        accord. It is not necessary to direct the attention especially
        to the middle castle. In these few words the most important
        thing is contained. </p>
      <p>"The center in the midst of conditions" is a very subtle
        expression. The center is omnipresent; everything is contained
        in it; it is connected with the release of the whole process of
        creation. The condition is the portal. The condition, that is,
        the fulfillment of this condition, makes the beginning, but it
        does not bring about the rest with inevitable necessity. The
        meaning of these two words is very fluid and subtle. </p>
      <p>Fixating contemplation is indispensable; it ensures the making
        fast of the enlightenment. Only one must not stay sitting
        rigidly if worldly thoughts come up, but one must examine where
        the thought is, where it began, and where it fades out. Nothing
        is gained by pushing reflection further. One must be content to
        see the thought arose, and not seek beyond the point of origin;
        for to find the heart (consciousness, to get behind
        consciousness with consciousness), that cannot be done. Together
        we want to bring the states of the heart to rest; that is true
        contemplation. What contradicts it is false contemplation. That
        leads to no goal. When the flight of the thoughts keeps
        extending further, one should stop and begin contemplating. Let
        one contemplate and then start fixating again. That is the
        double method of making fast the enlightenment. It means the
        circulation of the light. The circulation is fixation. The light
        is contemplation. Fixation without contemplation is circulation
        without light. Contemplation without fixation is light without
        circulation! Take note of that! </p>
      <p>[ *** The general meaning of this section is that protection of
        the center is important for the circulation of the light. The
        last section dealt with the theme that the human body is a very
        valuable possession when the primal spirit is master. But when
        it is used by the conscious spirit, the latter brings it about
        that, day and night, the primal spirit is scattered and wasted.
        When it is completely worn out, the body dies. Now the method is
        described whereby the conscious spirit can be subjected and the
        primal spirit protected; that is impossible if one does not
        begin by making the light circulate. It is like this: if a
        splendid is to be erected, a fine foundation must first be
        built. When the foundation is firm, then only can the work
        proceed and the base of the walls be deeply and solidly
        grounded, and the pillars and walls built up. If a foundation is
        not laid in this way, how can the house be completed? The method
        of cultivating life is exactly like that. The circulation of the
        light is to be compared with the foundation of the building.
        When the foundation stands firm, how quickly it can be built
        upon! To protect the yellow middle with the fire of the spirit,
        that is the work of building. Therefore the Master makes
        especially clear the method by which one enters into the
        cultivation of life, and bids people look with both eyes at the
        tip of the nose, to lower the lids, to look within, sit quietly
        with upright body, and fix the heart on the center in the midst
        of conditions. </p>
      <p>Keeping the thoughts on the space between the two eyes allows
        the light to penetrate. Thereupon, the spirit crystallizes and
        enters the center in the midst of conditions. The center in the
        midst of conditions is the lower Elixir-field, the place of
        energy (solar plexus). </p>
      <p>The Master hinted at this secretly when he said at the
        beginning of practice one must sit in a quiet room, the body
        like dry wood, the heart like cool ashes. Let the lids of both
        eyes be lowered; then look within and purify the heart, wash the
        thoughts, stop pleasures, and conserve the seed. Sit down daily
        to meditate with legs crossed. Let the light in the eyes be
        stopped; let the hearing power of the ear be crystallized and
        the tasting power of the tongue diminished; that is, the tongue
        shall be laid to the roof of the mouth; let the breathing
        through the nose be made rhythmical and the thoughts fixed on
        the dark door. If the breathing is not first made rhythmical it
        is to be feared that there will be difficulty in breathing,
        because of stoppage. When one closes the eyes, then one should
        take as a measure the point on the bridge of the nose which lies
        not quite half an inch below the intersection point of the line
        of vision, where there is a little bump on the nose. Then one
        begins to collect one’s thought; the ears make the breathing
        rhythmical; body and heart are comfortable and harmonious. The
        light of the eyes must shine quietly, and, for a long time,
        neither sleepiness nor distraction must set in. The eyes do not
        look forward; they lower their lids and light up what is within.
        It shines on this place. The mouth does not speak nor laugh. One
        closes the lips and breathes inwardly. Breathing is at this
        place. The nose smells no odors. Smelling is at this place. The
        ear does not hear things outside. Hearing is at this place. The
        whole heart watches over what is within. Its’ watching is at
        this place. The thoughts do not stray outward; true thoughts
        have duration in themselves. If the thoughts endure, the seed is
        enduring; if the seed endures, the energy endures; if the energy
        endures, then the spirit will endure. The spirit is thought;
        thought is the heart; the heart is the fire; the fire is the
        Elixir. When one looks at what is within in this way, the
        wonders of the opening and shutting of the gates of heaven will
        be inexhaustible. But the deeper secrets of the gates of heaven
        will be inexhaustible. But the deeper secrets cannot be effected
        without making the breathing rhythmical. </p>
      <p>If the pupil begins and cannot hold his thoughts to the place
        between the two eyes; if he closes the eyes, but the energy o
        the heart does not enable him to view the space of energy, the
        cause is most probably that the breathing is too loud and hasty,
        and other evils arise from this, because body and heart are kept
        busy trying to suppress forcibly the uprush of energy and quick
        breath. </p>
      <p>If the thoughts are held only to the two eyes, but the spirit
        is not crystallized in the solar plexus (the center in the midst
        of conditions), it is as if one had mounted to the hall but had
        not yet entered the inner chamber. Then the spirit-fire will not
        develop, the energy remains cold, and the true fruit will hardly
        manifest itself. </p>
      <p>Therefore the Master harbors the fear lest, in their efforts,
        men only fix their thoughts on the pace on the nose, but fail to
        think of fixing their ideas on the space of energy; that is why
        he used the comparison of the mason with the plumb-line. The
        mason uses the plumb-line only in order to see if his wall is
        perpendicular or slanting, and for this the string serves as a
        guide-line. When he has determined the direction, he can begin
        the work. But then he works on the wall, not on the plumb-line.
        That is clear. From this it is seen that fixing the thoughts
        between the eyes means only what the plumb-line does to the
        mason. The Master refers again and again to this because he
        fears his meaning might not be understood. And even if the
        pupils have grasped the way of doing the thing, he fears they
        might interrupt their work, and so he says several times: "Only
        after a hundred days of consistent work, only then is the light
        genuine; only then can one begin work with the spirit-fire". If
        one proceeds in a collected fashion, after a hundred days there
        develops spontaneously in the light a point of the genuine
        creative light (yang). The pupils must examine that with sincere
        hearts. ] </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">4. Circulation of the Light and Making the
            Breathing Rhythmical ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>Master Lu-tsu said, The decision must be carried out with a
        collected heart, and not seeking success; success will come of
        itself. In the first period of release there are chiefly two
        mistakes: indolence and distraction. But that can be remedied;
        the heart must not enter into the breathing too completely.
        Breathing comes from the heart. What comes out of the heart is
        breath. As soon as the heart stirs, there develops
        breath-energy. Breath-energy is originally transformed activity
        of the heart. When our ideas go very fast they imperceptibly
        pass into fantasies which are always accompanied by the drawing
        of a breath, because this inner and outer breathing hands
        together like tone and echo. Daily we draw innumerable breaths
        and have an equal number of fantasies. And thus the clarity of
        the spirit ebbs away as wood dries out and ashes die. </p>
      <p>So, then, should a man have no imagining in his mind? One
        cannot be without imaginings. Should one not breathe? One cannot
        do without breathing. The best way is to make a medicine of the
        illness. Since heart and breath are mutually dependent, the
        circulation of the light must be united with the rhythm of
        breathing. For this, light of the ear is above all necessary.
        There is a light of the eye and a light of the ear. The light of
        the eye is the united light of the sun and moon outside. The
        light of the ear is the united seed of sun and moon within. The
        seed is thus the light in crystallized form. Both have the same
        origin and are different only in name. Therefore, understanding
        (ear) and clarity (eye) are one and the same effective light. </p>
      <p>In sitting down, after lowering the lids, one uses the eyes to
        establish a plumb-line and then shifts the light downward. But
        if the transposition downward is not successful, then the heart
        is directed towards listening to the breathing. One should not
        be able to hear with the ear the outgoing and intaking of the
        breath. What one hears is that it has no tone. As soon as it has
        tone, the breathing is rough and superficial, and does not
        penetrate into the open. Then the heart must be made quite light
        and insignificant. The more it is released, the less it becomes;
        the less it is, the quieter. All at once it becomes so quiet
        that it stops. Then the true breathing is manifested and the
        form of the heart comes to consciousness. If the heart is light,
        the breathing is light, for every movement of the heart affects
        breath-energy. If breathing is light, the heart is light, for
        every movement of breath-energy affects the heart. In order to
        steady the heart, one begins by taking care of the
        breath-energy. The heart cannot be influenced directly.
        Therefore the breath-energy is sued as a handle, and this is
        what is called maintenance of the concentrated breath-energy. </p>
      <p>Children, do you not understand the nature of movement?
        Movement can be produced by outside means. It is only another
        name for mastery. One can make the heart move merely by running.
        Should one not also be able to bring it to rest by concentrated
        quietness? The great holy ones who knew how the heart and
        breath-energy mutually influence one another have thought out an
        easier procedure in order to help posterity. </p>
      <p>In the <i>Book of the Elixir</i> it is said: "The hen can
        hatch her eggs because her heart is always listening". That is
        an important magic spell. The hen can hatch the eggs because of
        the energy of heat. But the energy of the heat can only warm the
        shells; it cannot penetrate into the interior. Therefore she
        conducts this energy inward with her heart. This she does with
        her hearing. In this way she concentrates her whole heart. When
        the heart penetrates, the energy penetrates, and the chick
        receives the energy of the heat and begins to live. Therefore a
        hen, even when at times she leaves her eggs, always has the
        attitude of listening with bent ear. Thus the concentration of
        the spirit is not interrupted. Because the concentration of the
        spirit is not interrupted. But the concentration of the spirit
        suffers no interruption, neither does the energy of heat suffer
        interruption day or night, and the spirit awakens to life. The
        awakening of the spirit is accomplished because the heart has
        first died. When a man can let his heart die, then the primal
        spirit wakes to life. To kill the heart does not mean to let it
        dry and wither away, but it means that it has become undivided
        and gathered into one. </p>
      <p>The Buddha said: "When you fix your heart on one point, then
        nothing is impossible for you". The heart easily runs away, so
        it is necessary to concentrate it by means of breath-energy.
        Breath-energy easily becomes rough, therefore it has to be
        refined by the heart. When that is done, can it then happen that
        it is not fixed? </p>
      <p>The two mistakes of indolence and distraction must be combated
        by quiet work that is carried on daily without interruption;
        then success will certainly be achieved. If one is not seated in
        meditation, one will often be distracted without noticing it. To
        become conscious of the distraction is the mechanism by which to
        do away with distraction. Indolence of which a man is conscious,
        and indolence of which he is unconscious, are a thousand miles
        apart. Unconscious indolence is real indolence; conscious
        indolence is not complete indolence, because there is still some
        clarity in it. Distraction comes from letting the mind wander
        about; indolence comes from letting the mind wander about;
        indolence comes from the mind’s not yet being pure. Distraction
        is much easier to correct than indolence. It is as in sickness:
        if one feels pains and irritations, one can help them with
        remedies, but indolence is like a disease that is attended by
        lack of realization. Distraction can be counteracted, confusion
        can be straightened out, but indolence and lethargy are heavy
        and dark. Distraction and confusion at least have a place, but
        in indolence and lethargy the anima alone is active. In
        distraction the animus is still present, but in indolence pure
        darkness rules. If one becomes sleepy during meditation, that is
        an effect of indolence. Only breathing serves to overcome
        indolence. Although the breath that flows in and out through the
        nose is not the true breath, the flowing in and out of the true
        breath takes place in connection with it. </p>
      <p>While sitting, one must therefore always keep the heart quiet
        and the energy concentrated. How can the heart be made quiet? By
        the breath. Only the heart must be conscious of the flowing in
        and out of the breath; it must not be heard with the ears. If it
        is not heard, then the breathing is light; if light, it is pure.
        If it can be heard, then the breath-energy is rough; if rough,
        then it is troubled; if it is troubled, then indolence and
        lethargy develop and one wants to sleep. That is self-evident. </p>
      <p>How to use the heart correctly during breathing must be
        understood. It is a use without use. One should only let the
        light fall quite gently on the hearing. This sentence contains a
        secret meaning. What does it mean to let the light fall? It is
        the spontaneous radiation of the light of the eyes. The eye
        looks inward only and not outward. To sense brightness without
        looking outward means to look inward. To sense brightness
        without looking outward means to look inward; it has nothing to
        do with an actual looking within. What does hearing mean? It is
        the spontaneous hearing of the light of the ear. The ear listens
        inwardly only and does not listen to what is outside. To sense
        brightness without listening to what is outside is to listen
        inwardly; it has nothing to do with actually listening to what
        is within. In this sort of hearing, one hears only that there is
        no sound; in this kind of seeing, one sees only that no shape is
        there. If the eye is not looking outward and the ear is not
        hearkening outward, they close themselves and are inclined to
        sink inward. Only when one looks and hearkens inward does the
        organ not go outward nor sink inward. In this way indolence and
        lethargy are done away with. That is the union of the seed and
        the light of the sun and moon. </p>
      <p>If, as a result of indolence, one becomes sleepy, one should
        stand up and walk about. When the mind has become clear one
        should sit down again. If there is time in the morning, one may
        sit during the burning of an incense stick; that is the best. In
        the afternoon, human affairs interfere and one can therefore
        easily fall into indolence. It is not necessary, however, to
        have an incense stick. But one must lay aside all entanglements
        and sit quite still for a time. In the course of time there will
        be success without one’s becoming indolent and falling asleep. </p>
      <p>[ *** The chief thought of this section is that the most
        important for achieving the circulation of the light is
        rhythmical breathing. The further the work advances, the deeper
        becomes the teaching. During the circulation of the light, the
        pupil must coordinate heart and breathing in order to avoid the
        annoyance of indolence and distraction. The Master fears that
        when beginners have once sat and lowered their lids, confused
        fantasies may arise, because of which, the heart will begin to
        beat so that it is difficult to guide. Therefore he teaches the
        practice of counting the breath and fixing the thoughts of the
        heart in order to prevent the energy of the spirit from flowing
        outward. </p>
      <p>Because breath comes out of the heart, unrhythmical breathing
        comes from the heart’s unrest. Therefore one must breathe in and
        out quite softly so that it remains inaudible to the ear, and
        only the heart quietly counts the breaths. When the heart
        forgets the number of breaths, that is a sign that the heart has
        gone off into the outer world. Then one must hold the heart
        steadfast. If the ear does not listen attentively, or the eyes
        do not look at the bridge of the nose, it often happens that the
        heart runs off outside, or that sleep comes. That is a sign that
        the condition is going over into confusion and lethargy, and the
        seed-spirit must be brought into order again. If, in lowering
        the lids and taking direction from the nose, the mouth is not
        tightly closed and the teeth are not clenched firmly together,
        it can also easily happen that the heart hastens outwards; then
        one must close the mouth quickly and clench the teeth. The five
        senses order themselves according to the heart, and the spirit
        must have recourse to breath-energy so that heart and breath are
        harmonized. In this way there is need at most of daily work of a
        few quarter-hours for heart and breathing to come of themselves
        into the right sort of collaboration and harmony. Then one need
        no longer count and breathing becomes rhythmical of its own
        accord. When the breathing is rhythmical the mistakes of
        indolence and distraction disappear in time of their own accord.

      <p><b><font size="+1">5. Mistakes During the Circulation of the
            Light ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>Master Lu-tsu said, Your work will gradually become
        concentrated and mature, but before you reach the condition in
        which you sit like a withered tree before a cliff, there are
        still many possibilities of error which I would like to bring to
        your special attention. These conditions are recognized only
        when they have been personally experienced. I shall enumerate
        them here. Mt school differs from the Buddhist yoga school (<i>Chan-tsung</i>)
        in that it has confirmatory signs for each step of the way.
        First I would like to speak of the mistakes and then of the
        confirmatory signs. </p>
      <p>When one begins to carry out one’s decision, care must be taken
        so that everything can proceed in a comfortable, relaxed manner.
        Too much must not be demanded of the heart. One must be careful
        that, quite automatically, heart and energy are coordinated.
        Only then can a state of quietness be attained. During this
        quiet state the right conditions and the right space must be
        provided. One must not sit down [to meditate] in the midst of
        frivolous. That is to say, the mind must be free of vain
        preoccupations. All entanglements must be put aside; one must be
        detached and independent. Nor must the thoughts be concentrated
        upon the right procedure. This danger arises if too much trouble
        is taken. I do not mean that no trouble is to be taken, but the
        correct way lies in keeping equal distance between being and not
        being. If one can attain purposelessness through purpose, then
        the thing has been grasped.. Now one can let oneself go,
        detached and without confusion, in an independent way. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, one must not fall victim to the ensnaring world.
        The ensnaring world is where the five kinds of dark demons
        disport themselves. This is the case, for example, when, after
        fixation, one has chiefly thoughts of dry wood and dead ashes,
        and few thoughts of the bright spring on the great earth. In
        this way one sinks into the world of the dark. The energy is
        cold there, breathing is rough, and many images of coldness and
        decay present themselves. If one tarries there long one enters
        the world of plants and stones. </p>
      <p>Nor must a man be led astray by the ten thousand ensnarements.
        This happens if, after the quiet state has begun, one after
        another all sorts of ties suddenly appear. One wants to break
        through them and cannot; one follows them, and feels as if
        relieved by this. This means the master has become the servant.
        If a man tarries in this stage long he enters world of illusory
        desires. </p>
      <p>At best, one finds oneself in heaven, at the worst, among the
        fox-sprits. Such a fox-spirit, it is true, may be able to roam
        in the famous mountains enjoying the wind and the moon, the
        flowers and fruits, and taking his pleasure in coral trees and
        jeweled grass. But after having done this for three to five
        hundred years, or at the most for a couple of thousand years,
        his reward is over and he is born again into the world of
        turmoil </p>
      <p>All of these are wrong paths. When a man knows the wrong paths,
        he can then inquire into the confirmatory signs. </p>
      <p>[ *** The purpose of this section is to call attention to the
        wrong paths while meditating so that one enters the space of
        energy instead of that cave of fantasy. The latter is the world
        of demons. This, for example, is the case if one sits down to
        meditate and sees flames of light or bright colors appear, or if
        one sees Bodhisattvas and gods approach, or any other similar
        phantasms. Or, if one is not successful in uniting energy and
        breathing, if the water of the kidneys cannot rise, but presses
        downward, the primal energy becoming cold and breathing rough:
        then the gentle light-energies of the great earth are too few,
        and one lands in the gentle light-energies of the great earth
        are too few, and one lands in the empty fantasy-world. Or, when
        one has sat a long time, and ideas rise up in crowds and one
        tries to stop them, but cannot; one submits to being driven by
        them and feels easier: when this happens, one must get up and
        walk around a little until the heart and energy are again in
        unison; only then can one return to meditation. In meditating, a
        man must have a sort of conscious intuition, so that he feels
        energy and breathing unite in the field of the Elixir; he must
        feel that a warm release belonging to the true light is
        beginning to stir dimly. Then he has found the right space. When
        this right space has been found, one is freed from the danger of
        getting into the world of illusory desire or dark demons. ] </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">6. Confirmatory Experiences During the
            Circulation of the Light ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>Master Lu-tsu said, There are many kinds of confirmatory
        experiences. One must not content oneself with small demands but
        must rise to the thought that all living creatures have to be
        redeemed. One must not be trivial and irresponsible in heart,
        but must strive to make deeds prove one’s words. </p>
      <p>If, when there is quiet, the spirit has continuously and
        uninterruptedly a sense of great joy as if intoxicated or
        freshly bathed, it is a sign that the light-principle is
        harmonious in the whole body; then the Golden Flower begins to
        bud. When, furthermore, all openings are quiet, and the silver
        moon stands in the middle of heaven, and one has the feeling
        that this great earth is a world of light and brightness, that
        is a sign that the body of the heart opens itself to clarity. It
        is a sign that the Golden Flower is opening. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the whole body feels strong and firm so that it
        fears neither storm not frost. Things by which other men are
        displeased, when I meet them, cannot becloud the brightness of
        the seed of the spirit. Yellow gold fills the house; the steps
        are of white jade. Rotten and stinking things on earth that come
        in contact with one breath of the true energy will immediately
        live again. Red blood becomes milk. The fragile body of the
        flesh is sheer gold and diamonds. That is a sign that the Golden
        Flower is crystallized. </p>
      <p><i>The Book of Successful Contemplation</i> (<i>Ying-kuan-ching</i>)
        says: "The sun sinks in the great water and magic pictures of
        trees in rows arise". The setting of the sun means that in chaos
        (in the world before phenomena, that is before the intelligible
        world) the foundation is laid: that is the non-polarized
        condition [ultimateless](wu-chi). Highest good is like water,
        pure and spotless. It is the ruler of the great polarity, the
        god who appears in the trigram of shock, <i>Chen</i>. <i>Chen</i>
        is also symbolized by wood, and soothe image of trees in rows
        appears. A sevenfold row of trees means the light of the seven
        body-openings (or heart-openings). The northwest is the
        direction of the Creative. When it moves on one place further,
        the Abysmal is there. The sun which sinks on one place further,
        the Abysmal is there. The sun which sinks into the great water
        is the image for the Creative and the Abysmal. The Abysmal is
        the direction of midnight (mouse, <i>tzu</i>, north). At the
        winter solstice, thunder (<i>Chen</i>) is in the middle of the
        earth quite hidden and covered up. Only when the trigram <i>Chen</i>
        is reached does the light-pole appear over the earth again. That
        is the image represented by the rows of trees. The rest can be
        correspondingly inferred. </p>
      <p>The second part means the building of the foundation on this.
        The great world is like ice, a glassy jewel-world. The
        brilliancy of the light gradually crystallizes. Hence a great
        terrace arises and upon it, in the course o time, the Buddha
        appears. When the gold being appears who should it be but the
        Buddha? For the Buddha is the golden holy man of the great
        enlightenment. This is a great confirmatory experience. </p>
      <p>Now there are three confirmatory experiences which can be
        tested. The first is that, when one has entered the state of
        meditation, the gods are in the valley. Men are heard talking as
        though at a distance of several hundred paces, each one quite
        clear. But the sounds are all like an echo in a valley. One can
        always hear them, but never oneself. This is called the presence
        of the gods in the valley. </p>
      <p>At times the following can be experiences: as soon as one is
        quiet, the light of the eyes begins to blaze up, so that
        everything before one becomes quite bright as if one were in a
        cloud. If one opens one’s eyes and seeks the body, it is not to
        be found any more. This is called: "In the empty chamber it
        grows light". Inside and outside, everything is equally light.
        That is a very favorable sign. </p>
      <p>Or, when one sits in meditation, the fleshly body becomes quite
        shining like silk or jade. It seems difficult to remain sitting;
        one feels as if drawn upward. This is called: "The spirit
        returns and touches heaven". In time, one can experience it in
        such a way that one really floats upward. </p>
      <p>And now, it is already possible to have all three of these
        experiences. But not everything can be expressed. Different
        things appear to each person according to his dispositions. If
        one experiences these things, it is a sign of good aptitude.
        With these things it is just as it is when one drinks water. One
        can tell for oneself whether the water is warm or cold. In the
        same way a man must convince himself about these experiences,
        then only are they real. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">7. The Living Manner of the Circulation of
            the Light ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>Master Lu-tsu said, When there is a gradual success in
        producing the circulation of the light, a man must not give up
        his ordinary occupation in doing it. The ancients said, When
        occupations come to us, we must accept them; when things come to
        us, we must understand them from the ground up. If the
        occupations are properly handled by correct thoughts, the light
        is not scattered by outside things, but circulates according to
        its own law. Even the still invisible circulation of the light
        get started this way; how much more, then, is it the case with
        the true circulation of the light which has already manifested
        itself clearly. </p>
      <p>When in ordinary life one has the ability always to react to
        things by reflexes only, without any admixture of a thought of
        others or of oneself, that is a circulation of the light arising
        out of circumstances. This is the first secret. </p>
      <p>If, early in the morning, one can rid oneself of all
        entanglements and meditate from one to two double hours, and
        then can orientate oneself all activities and outside things in
        a purely objective, reflex way, and if this can be continued
        without any interruption, then after two or three months all the
        perfected ones come from heaven and approve such behavior. </p>
      <p>[ *** The receding section deals with the blissful fields that
        are entered when one goes forward in the work. The aim of this
        section is to show the pupils how they must shape their work
        more subtly day by day so that they may hope for an early
        attainment of the Elixir of Life. How does it happen that the
        master just at this point speaks to the fact that a man ought
        not to give up his ordinary way of life? It might be thought
        from this that the Master wanted to prevent the pupil from
        attaining the Elixir of Life quickly. He who knows replies to
        this, Not at all! The Master is concerned lest the pupil may not
        have fulfilled his karma, therefore he speaks in this way. Now
        if the work has already led into the blissful fields, the heart
        is like an expanse of water. When things come, it mirrors
        things; when things go, spirit and energy spontaneously unite
        again and do not allow themselves to be carried away by
        externals. That is what the Master means when he says that every
        entanglement in thought of other people and oneself must be
        completely given up. When the pupil succeeds in concentrating
        with true thoughts always on the space of energy, he does not
        have to start the light rotating, and the light rotates by
        itself. But when the light rotates, the Elixir is made
        spontaneously, and the performance of worldly tasks at the same
        time is not a hindrance. It is different at the beginning of the
        practice of meditation when spirit and energy are still
        scattered and confused. If worldly affairs cannot then be kept
        at a distance and a quiet place be found where one can
        concentrate with all one’s energy, and thus avoid all
        disturbances from ordinary occupations, then one is perhaps
        industrious in the morning and certainly indolent in the
        evening. How long would it take till a man attained to the real
        secrets in this way? Therefore it is said, When on begins to
        apply oneself to the work, one should put aside household
        affairs. And, if that is not wholly possible, someone ought to
        be engaged to look after them so that one can take pains with
        complete attention. But when the work is so far advanced that
        secret confirmations are experienced, it does not matter if, at
        the same time, one’s ordinary affairs are put in order, so that
        one can fulfill one’s karma. This means the living manner of the
        circulation of the light. Long ago, the True Man of the Purple
        Polar Light (Tzu-yang chen-jen, or Chang&nbsp; Po-tuan) said:
        "If one cultivates one’s action while mingling with the world
        and is still in harmony with the light, then the round is round
        and the angular has angles; then he lives among men, mysterious
        yet visible, different and yet the same, and none can compass
        it; then no one notices our secret actions". The living manner
        of the circulation of the light has jus this meaning: to live
        mingling with the world and yet in harmony with the light. ] </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">8. A Magic Spell for the Far Journey ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>Master Lu-tsu said, Yu Ch’ing has left behind him a magic spell
        for the far journey: </p>
      <p>Four words crystallize the spirit in the space of energy. <br>
        In the sixth month white snow is suddenly seen to fly. <br>
        At the third watch the sun’s disk sends out blinding rays. <br>
        In the water blows the wind of the Gentle. <br>
        Wandering in heaven, one eats the spirit-energy of the
        Receptive. <br>
        And the still deeper secret of the secret: <br>
        The land that is nowhere, that is the true home... </p>
      <p>These verses are full of mystery. The meaning is: The most
        important things in the great Tao are the words: action through
        non-action. Non-action prevents a man from becoming entangled in
        form and image (materiality). Action in non-action prevents a
        man from sinking into numbing emptiness and dead nothingness.
        The effect depends entirely on the central One; the releasing of
        the effect is in the two eyes. The two eyes are like the pole of
        the Great Wain which turns the whole of creation; they cause the
        poles of light and darkness to circulate. The Elixir depends
        from beginning to end on one thing: the metal in the midst of
        the water, that is, the lead in the water-region. Heretofore we
        have spoken of the circulation of the light, indicating thereby
        the initial release which works from without upon what lies
        within. This is to aid one in obtaining the Master. If is for
        pupils in the beginning stages. They go through the two lower
        transitions in order to gain the upper one. After the sequence
        of events is clear and the nature of the release is known,
        heaven no longer withholds the Way, but reveals the ultimate
        truth. Disciples, keep it secret and redouble your effort! </p>
      <p>The circulation of the light is the inclusive term. The further
        the work advances, the more does the Golden Flower bloom. But
        there is a still more marvelous kind of circulation. Till now we
        have worked from the outside on what is within; now we stay in
        the center and rule what is external. Hitherto it was a service
        in aid of the Master; now it is a dissemination of the commands
        of the Master. The whole relationship is now reversed. If one
        wants to penetrate the more subtle regions by this method, one
        must first see to it that body and heart are completely
        controlled, that one is quite free and at peace, letting go of
        all entanglements, untroubled by the slightest excitement, and
        with the heavenly heart exactly in the middle. Then let one
        lower the lids of the two eyes as if one received a holy edict,
        a summons to come before the minister. Who would dare disobey?
        Then with both eyes one illumines the house of the Abysmal
        (water, <i>K’an</i>). Wherever the Golden Flower goes, the true
        light of polarity comes forth to meet it. The Clinging
        (brightness, <i>Li</i>) is bright outside and dark within; this
        is the body of the Creative. The one dark [line] enters and
        becomes master. The result is that the heart (consciousness)
        develops in dependence on things, is directed outward, and is
        tossed about on the stream. When the rotating light shines
        towards what is within, it does not develop in dependence on
        things, the energy of the dark is fixed, and the Golden Flower
        shines concentratedly. This is then the collected light of
        polarity. Related things attract each other. Thus the polarized
        light-line of the Abysmal presses upward. It is not only the
        light in the abyss, but it is creative light which meets
        creative light. As soon as these two substances meet each other,
        they unite inseparably, and there develops an unceasing life; it
        comes and goes, rises and falls of itself, in the house of the
        primal energy. One is aware of effulgence and infinity. The
        whole body feels light and would like to fly. This is the state
        of which it is said: Clouds fill the thousand mountains.
        Gradually it goes to and fro quite softly; it rises and falls
        imperceptibly. The pulse stands still and breathing stops. This
        is the moment of true creative union, the state of which it is
        said: The moon gathers up the ten thousand waters. In the midst
        of this darkness, the heavenly heart suddenly begins a movement.
        This is the return of the one light, the time when the child
        comes to life. </p>
      <p>However, the details of this must be carefully explained. When
        a person looks at something, listens to something, eyes and ears
        move and follow the things until they have passed. These
        movements are all underlings, and when the heavenly ruler
        follows them in their task it means: to live together with
        demons. </p>
      <p>If now, during every movement of rest, a person lives together
        with people and not with demons, then the heavenly ruler is the
        true man. When he moves, and we move with him, then the movement
        is the root of heaven. When he is quiet, and we are quiet with
        him, then this quietness is the cave of the moon. When he
        unceasingly alternates movement and rest, go on with him
        unceasingly in movement and quietness. When he rises and falls
        with inhaling and exhaling, rise and fall with him. That is what
        is called going to and fro between the root of heaven and the
        cave of the moon. </p>
      <p>When the heavenly heart still preserves calm, movement before
        the right time is a fault of softness. When the heavenly heart
        has already moved, the movement that follows afterwards, in
        order to correspond with it, is a fault of rigidity. As soon as
        the heavenly heart is stirring, one must immediately mount
        upward whole-heartedly to the house of the Creative. Thus the
        spirit-light sees the summit; this is the leader. This movement
        is in accord with the time. The heavenly heart rises to the
        summit of the Creative, where it expands in complete freedom.
        Then suddenly it demands the deepest silence, and one must lead
        it speedily and whole-heartedly into the yellow castle; thus the
        eyes behold the central yellow dwelling place of the spirit. </p>
      <p>When the desire for silence comes, not a single thought arises;
        he who is looking inward suddenly forgets that he is looking. At
        this time, body and heart must be left completely released. All
        entanglements have disappeared without trace. Then I no longer
        know at what place the house of my spirit and my crucible are.
        If a man wants to make certain of his body, he cannot get at it.
        This condition is the penetration of heaven into earth, the time
        when all wonders return to their roots. So it is when the
        crystallized spirit goes into the space of energy. </p>
      <p>The One is the circulation of the light. When one begins, it is
        at first still scattered and one wants to collect it; the six
        senses are not active. This is the cultivation and nourishment
        of one’s own origin, the filling up of the oil when one goes to
        receive life. When one is far enough to have gathered it, one
        feels light and free and need not take the least trouble. This
        is the quieting of the spirit in the space of the ancestors, the
        taking possession of former heaven. </p>
      <p>When one is so far advanced that every shadow and every echo
        has disappeared, so that one is entirely quiet and firm, this is
        refuge within the cave of energy, where all that is miraculous
        returns to its roots. One does not alter the place, but the
        place divides itself. This is incorporeal space where a thousand
        and ten thousand places are one place. One does not alter the
        time, but the time divides itself. This is immeasurable time
        when all the aeons are like a moment. </p>
      <p>As long as the heart has not attained absolute tranquility, it
        cannot move itself. One moves the movement and forgets the
        movement; this is not movement in itself. Therefore it is said:
        If, when stimulated by external things, one moves, it is the
        impulse of the being. If, when not stimulated by external
        things, one moves, it is the movement of heaven. The being that
        is placed over against heaven can fall and come under the
        domination of the impulses. The impulses are based upon the fact
        that there are external things. They are thoughts that goon
        beyond one’s own position. Then movement leads to movement. But
        when no idea arises, the right ideas come. That is the true
        idea. When things are quiet and one is quite firm, and the
        release of heaven suddenly moves, is this not a movement without
        purpose? Action through non-action has just this meaning. </p>
      <p>As to the poem at the beginning, the two first lines refer
        entirely to the activity of the Golden Flower. The two next
        lines are concerned with the mutual interpenetration of sun and
        moon. The sixth month is the Clinging (<i>Li</i>, fire). The
        white snow that flies is the true polar darkness in the middle
        of the fire trigram, that is about to turn into the Receptive.
        The third watch is the Abysmal (<i>K’an</i>, water). The sun’s
        disk is the one polar line in te trigram for water, which is
        about to turn into the Creative. This contains the way to take
        the trigram for the Abysmal and the way to reverse the trigram
        for the Clinging (fire, <i>Li</i>). </p>
      <p>The following two lines have to do with the activity of the
        pole of the Great Wain, the rise and fall of the whole release
        of polarity. Water is the trigram of the Abysmal; the eye is the
        wind of the Gentle (Sun). The light of the eyes illumines the
        house of the Abysmal, and controls there the seed of the great
        light. "In heaven" means the house of the Creative (<i>Ch’ien</i>).


        "Wandering in heaven, one eats the spirit-energy of the
        Receptive". This shows how the spirit penetrates the energy, how
        heaven penetrates the earth; this happens so that the fire can
        be nourished. </p>
      <p>Finally, the two last lines point to the deepest secret, which
        cannot be dispensed with from the beginning to the end. This is
        the washing of the heart and the purification of the thoughts;
        this is the bath. The holy science takes as a beginning the
        knowledge of where to stop, and as an end, stopping at the
        highest good. Its beginning is beyond polarity. </p>
      <p>The Buddha speaks of the transient, the creator of
        consciousness, as being the fundamental truth of religion. And
        the whole work of completing life and human nature in our Taoism
        lies in the expression "to bring about emptiness". All three
        religions agree in the one proposition, the finding of the
        spiritual Elixir in order to pass from death to life. In what
        does this spiritual Elixir consist? It means forever dwelling in
        purposelessness. The deepest secret of the bath that is to be
        found in our teaching is thus confined to the work of making the
        heart empty. Therewith the matter is settled. What I have
        revealed here in a word is the fruit of a decade of effort. </p>
      <p>If you are not yet clear as to how far all three sections can
        be present in one section, I will make it clear to you through
        the threefold Buddhist contemplation of emptiness, delusion, and
        the center. </p>
      <p>Emptiness comes as the first of the three contemplations. All
        things are looked upon as empty. Then follows delusion. Although
        it is known that they are empty, things are not destroyed, but
        one attends to one’s affairs in the midst of the emptiness. But
        though one does not destroy things, neither does one pay
        attention to them; this is contemplation of the center. While
        practicing contemplation of the empty, one also knows that one
        cannot destroy the ten thousand things, and still one does not
        notice them. In this way the three contemplations fall together.
        But after all, strength is in envisioning the empty. Therefore,
        when one practices contemplation of emptiness, emptiness is
        certainly empty, but delusion is empty too. Being on the way of
        the center, one also creates images of the emptiness; they are
        not called empty, but are called central. One practices also
        contemplation of delusion, but one does not call it delusion,
        one calls it central. As to what has to do with the center, more
        need not be said. </p>
      <p>[ *** This section mentions first Yu Ch’ing’s magical spell for
        the far journey. This magical spell states that the secret
        wonder of the Way is how something develops out of nothing. In
        that spirit and energy unite in crystallized form, there
        appears, in the course of time, in the midst of the emptiness of
        nothing, a point of true fire. During this time the more quiet
        the spirit becomes, the brighter is the fire. The brightness of
        the fire is compared with the sun’s heat in the sixth month.
        Because the blazing fore causes the water of the Abysmal to
        vaporize, the steam is heated, and when it has passed the
        boiling point it mounts upward like flying snow. It is meant by
        this that one may see snow fly in the sixth month. But because
        the water is vaporized by the fire, the true energy is awakened;
        yet when the dark is at rest, the true energy is awakened; yet
        when the dark is at rest, the light begins to move; it is like
        the state of midnight. Therefore adepts call this time the time
        of the living midnight. At this time one works at the energy
        with the purpose of making it flow backward and rise, and flows
        down to fall like the upward spinning of the sun-wheel.
        Therefore it is said: "At the third watch the sun’s disk sends
        out blinding rays". The rotation method makes use of breathing
        to blow in the fire of the gates of life; in this way one
        succeeds in bringing to blow on the fire of the gates of life;
        in this way one succeeds in bringing the true energy to its
        original place. Therefore it is said that the wind blows in the
        water. Out of the single energy of former heaven, there develops
        the out- and in-going breath of later heaven and its inflaming
        energy. </p>
      <p>The way leads from the sacrum upward in a backward-flowing way
        to the summit of the Creative, and on through the house of the
        Creative; then it sinks through the two stories in a direct
        downward-flowing way into the solar plexus, and warms it.
        Therefore it is said: "Wandering in heaven, one eats the
        spirit-energy of the Receptive". Because the true energy goes
        back into the empty place, in time, energy and form become rich
        and full, body and heart become glad and cheerful. If, by the
        practice of the turning of the wheel of the doctrine, this
        cannot be achieved, how otherwise should one be able to enter
        upon this far journey? What it amounts to is this: the
        crystallized spirit radiates back to the spirit-fire and, by
        means of the greatest quiet, fans the "fire in the midst of the
        water", which is in the middle of the empty cave. Therefore it
        is said: "And the still deeper secret of the secret: the land
        that is nowhere, that is the true home". </p>
      <p>The pupil has already penetrated in his work into mysterious
        territory; but if he does not know the method of melting, it is
        to be feared that the Elixir of Life will hardly be produced.
        Therefore the Master has revealed the secret strictly guarded by
        the former holy men. When the pupil keeps the crystallized
        spirit fixed within the cave of energy and, at the same time,
        lets greatest quietness hold sway, then out of the obscure
        darkness a something develops from the nothingness, that is, the
        Golden Flower of the great One appears. At this time the
        conscious light is differentiated from the light of human nature
        [hsing]. Therefore it is said: "To move when stimulated by
        external things leads to its going directly outward and creating
        a man, that is the conscious light". If, at the time the true
        energy has been sufficiently collected, the pupil does not let
        it flow directly outward, but makes it flow backward, that is
        the light of life; the method of turning of the water-wheel must
        be applied. If one continues to turn, the true energy returns to
        the roots, drop by drop. Then the water-wheel stops, the body is
        clean, the energy is fresh. One single turning means one
        heavenly cycle, what Master Ch’iu has called a small heavenly
        cycle. If one does not wait to use the energy until it has been
        collected sufficiently, it is then too tender and weak, and the
        Elixir is not formed. If the energy is there and not used, then
        it becomes too old and rigid, and then, too, the Elixir of Life
        will hardly be produced. When it is neither too old nor too
        tender, then is the right time to use it purposefully. This is
        what the Buddha means when he says: "The phenomenon flows into
        emptiness". This is the sublimation of the seed into energy. If
        the pupil does not understand this principle, and lets the
        energy flow out directly, then the energy changes into seed;
        this is what is meant when it is said: "Emptiness finally flows
        into phenomena". But every man who unites bodily with a woman
        feels pleasure first and then bitterness; when the seed has
        flowed out, the body is tired and the spirit weary. It is quite
        different when the adept lets spirit and energy unite. That
        brings first purity and then freshness; when the seed is
        transformed, the body is healthy and free. There is a tradition
        that the old master P’eng grew to be 800 years old because he
        made use of serving maids to nourish his life, but that is a
        misunderstanding. In reality, he used the method of sublimation
        of spirit and energy. In the Elixir of Life symbols are used for
        the most part, and in them the fire of the Clinging (Li) is
        frequently compared to a bride, and the water of the Abyss to
        the boy (puer aeternus). From this arose the misunderstanding
        about Master P’eng having restored his virility through women.
        These are errors that have forced their way in later. </p>
      <p>But adepts can use the means of overthrowing the Abysmal (K’an)
        and the Clinging (Li) only when they have sincere intention in
        the work, otherwise a pure mixture cannot be produced. The true
        purpose is subject to the earth; the color of the earth is
        yellow, therefore in books on the Elixir of Life it is
        symbolized by the yellow germ. When the Abysmal and the Clinging
        (Li) unite, the Golden Flower appears; the golden color is
        white, and therefore white snow is used a s a symbol. But
        worldly people who do not understand the secret words of the
        Book of the Elixir of Life have misunderstood ad the yellow and
        white there in that they have taken it as a means of making gold
        out of stones. Is not that foolish? </p>
      <p>An ancient adept said: "Formerly, every school knew this jewel,
        only fools did not know it wholly". If we reflect on this we see
        that the ancients really attained long life by the help of the
        seed-energy present in their own bodies, and did not lengthen
        their years by swallowing this or that sort of elixir. But the
        worldly people lost the roots and clung to the tree-tops. <i>The


          Book of the Elixir</i> also says: "When the right man (white
        magician) makes use of the wrong means, the wrong means work in
        the right way". By this is meant the transformation of seed into
        energy. "But if the wrong man uses the right means, the right
        means work in the wrong way". By this is meant the bodily union
        of man and woman fro which spring sons and daughters. The fool
        wastes the most precious jewel of his body in energy. When it is
        finished, the boy perishes. The holy and wise men have no other
        way of cultivating their lives except by destroying lusts and
        safeguarding the seed. The accumulated seed is transformed into
        energy, and the energy, when there is enough of it, makes the
        creatively strong body. The difference shown by ordinary people
        depends only upon how they apply the downward-flowing way or the
        backward-flowing way. </p>
      <p>The whole meaning of this section is directed towards making
        clear to the pupil the method of filling up the oil when meeting
        life. Here the eyes are the chief thing. The two eyes are the
        handle of the pole star. Even as heaven turns about the polar
        star as a center point, so among men the right intention must be
        the master. Therefore the completion of the Elixir of Life
        depends entirely on the harmonizing of the right purpose. Then,
        if it is said that the foundation can be laid in a hundred days,
        first of all the degree of industry in work and the degree of
        strength in the physical constitution must be taken into
        account. Whoever is eager in the work, and has a strong
        constitution, succeeds more quickly in turning the water-wheel
        of the rear river. When a person has found the method of making
        thoughts and energy harmonize with one another, he can complete
        the Elixir within the hundred days. But whoever is weak and
        inert will not produce it even after the hundred days. When the
        Elixir is completed, spirit and energy are pure and clear; the
        heart is empty, human nature (hsing) manifest, and the light of
        consciousness transforms itself into the light of human nature,
        the Abysmal and the Clinging (fire, Li) have intercourse
        spontaneously. When the Abysmal and the Clinging commingle, the
        holy fruit is born. The ripening of the holy fruit is the effect
        of a great heavenly cycle. Further elucidation stops with the
        method of the heavenly cycle. </p>
      <p>This book is concerned with the means of cultivating life and
        shows at first how to start by looking at the bridge of one’s
        nose; here the method of reversing is shown; the methods of
        making firm and letting go are in another book, the <i>Hsu Ming
          Fang</i> (<i>Methods of Prolonging Life</i>). ] </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Summary of the Chinese Concepts on Which is
            Based the Idea of the Golden Flower, or Immortal Spirit-Body
            ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>The Tao, the undivided, great One, gives rise to two opposite
        reality principles, the dark and the light, yin and yang. These
        are at first thought of only as forces of nature apart from
        man,. Later, the sexual polarities and others as well are
        derived from them. From yin comes K’un, the receptive feminine
        principle; from yin come Ch’ien, the creative masculine
        principle; from yin comes ming, life; from yang, hsing or human
        nature. </p>
      <p>Each individual contains a central monad, which, at the moment
        of conception, splits into life and human nature, ming and
        hsing. These two are supra-individual principles, and so can be
        related to eros and logos. </p>
      <p>In the personal bodily existence of the individual they are
        represented by two other polarities, a p’o soul (or anima) and a
        hun soul (animus). All during the life of the individual these
        two are in conflict, each striving for mastery. At death they
        separate and go different ways. The anima sinks to earth as
        kuei, a ghost-being. The anima rises and becomes shen, a spirit
        or god, Shen may in time return to the Tao. </p>
      <p>If the life-energy flows downward, that is, without let or
        hindrance into the outer world, the anima is victorious over the
        animus; no spirit-body or Golden Flower is developed, and at
        death the ego is lost. If the life-energy is led through the
        backward-flowing process, that is, conserved, and made to rise
        instead of allowed to dissipate, the animus has been victorious,
        and the ego persists after death. It then becomes shen, a spirit
        or god. A man who holds to the way of conservation all through
        life may reach the stage of the Golden Flower, which then frees
        the ego from the conflict of the opposites, and it again becomes
        part of the Tao, the undivided, great One. </p>

      <p>[ The illustration found here in the Chinese text shows the
        body of a man. In the middle of the lower half of the body is
        drawn a germ cell by which the gateway of life is separated from
        the gateway of consciousness. In between, leading to the outside
        world, is the canal through which the vital fluids flow out. ] </p>
      <p>The subtlest secret of the Tao is human nature and life
        (hsing-ming). There is no better way of cultivating human nature
        and life than to bring both back to unity. The holy men o
        ancient times, and the great sages, set forth their thoughts
        about the unification of human nature and life by means of
        images from the external world.; they were reluctant to speak of
        it openly without allegories. Therefore the secret of how to
        cultivate both simultaneously was lost one earth. What I show
        through a series of images is not a frivolous giving away pf
        secrets. On the contrary, because I combined the notes of the
        Leng-yen-ching on the cessation of outflowing and the secret
        thoughts of Hua-yen-ching with occasional references to the
        other sutras, in order to summarize them in this true picture,
        it can be understood that consciousness and life are not
        anything external to the germinal vesicle. I have drawn this
        picture so that companions pursuing the divine workings of the
        dual cultivation may know that in this way the true seed
        matures, that in this way the cessation of outflowing is brought
        about, that in this way the sheli [Satira, the firm, the
        immortal body] is melted out, that in this way the great Tao is
        completed. </p>
      <p>But the germinal vesicle is an invisible cavern; it has neither
        form nor image. When the vital breath stirs, the seed of this
        vesicle comes into being; when it cease it disappears again. It
        is the pace which harbors truth, the altar upon which
        consciousness and life are made. It is called the dragon castle
        at the bottom of the sea, the boundary region of the snow
        mountains, the primordial pass, the kingdom of greatest joy, the
        boundless country. All these different names mean this germinal
        vesicle. If a dying man does not know this germinal vesicle, he
        will not find the unity of consciousness and life in a thousand
        births, nor in ten thousand aeons. </p>
      <p>This germinal point is soemthig great. Before this our body is
        born of our parents, at the time of conception, this seed is
        first created and human nature and life dwell therein. The two
        are intermingled and form a unity, inseparably mixed like the
        sparks in the refining furnace, a combination of primordial
        harmony and divine law. Therefore it is said: "In the state
        before the appearance there is an inexhaustible breath".
        Furthermore it is said: "Before the parents have begotten the
        child, the breath of life is complete and the embryo perfect".
        But when the embryo moves and the embryo vesicle is torn, it is
        as if a man lost his footing on a high mountain: with a cry the
        man plunges down to earth, and from then on human nature and
        life are divided. From this moment human nature can no longer
        see life nor life human nature. And now date takes its course:
        youth passes over into maturity, maturity into old age, and old
        age into woe. </p>
      <p>Therefore the Julia (Buddha Tathagata), in his great
        compassion, let the secret making and melting be known. He
        teaches one to re-enter the womb and create anew the human
        nature and life of the ego; he shows how spirit and soul (vital
        breath) enter the germinal vesicle, how they must combine to
        become a unity in order to complete the true fruit, just as the
        sperm and soul of father and mother entered into this germinal
        vesicle and united as one being in order to complete the embryo.
        The principle is the same. </p>
      <p>Within the germinal vesicle is the fire of the ruler; at the
        entrance of the germinal vesicle is the fire of the minister; in
        the whole body, the fire of the people. When the fire of the
        ruler expresses itself, it is received by the fire of the
        minister. When the fire of the minister moves, the fire of the
        people follows him. When the three fires express themselves in
        this order a man develops. But when the three fires return in
        reverse order the Tao develops. </p>
      <p>This is the reason that all the sages began their work at the
        germinal vesicle in which outflowing had ceased. If one does not
        establish this path, but sets up other things, it is of no
        avail. Therefore all the schools and sects which do not know
        that the ruling principle of consciousness and life is in this
        germinal vesicle, and which therefore seek it in the outer
        world, can accomplish nothing despite all their efforts to find
        it outside. </p>
      <p><font size="+1">2. The Six Periods of Circulation in Conformity
          with the Law ~</font> </p>
      <p>If one discerns the beginning of the Buddha’s path, <br>
        There will be the blessed city of the West. <br>
        After the circulation in conformity with the law, <br>
        There is a turn upward towards heaven when the breath is drawn
        in. <br>
        When the breath flows out energy is directed towards the earth.
        <br>
        One time-period&nbsp; consists of six intervals (hou). <br>
        In two intervals one gathers Moni (Sakyamuni). <br>
        The great Tao comes forth from the center. <br>
        Do not seek the primordial seed outside! </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="6.jpg" height="409" width="444"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The most marvelous effect of the Tao is the circulation in
        conformity with the law. What makes the movement&nbsp;
        inexhaustible is the path. What best regulates the speed are the
        rhythms (<i>kuei</i>). What best determines the number of the
        exercises is the method of the intervals (<i>hou</i>). </p>
      <p>This presentation contains the whole law, and the true features
        of the Buddha from the West are contained in it. The secrets
        contained in it show how one gets control o the process by
        exhaling and inhaling, how the alternation between decrease and
        increase expresses itself in closing and opening, how one needs
        true thoughts in order not to deviate from the way, how the firm
        delimitation of the regions makes it possible to begin and to
        stop at the right time. </p>
      <p>I sacrifice myself and serve man, because I have presented
        fully this picture which reveals the heavenly seed completely,
        so that every layman and man of the world&nbsp; can reach it and
        so bring it to completion. He who lacks the right virtue may
        well find something in it, but heaven will not grant him his
        Tao. Why not? The right virtue belongs to the Tao as does one
        wing of a bird to the other: if one is lacking, the other is of
        no use. Therefore there is needed loyalty and reverence,
        humaneness and justice and strict adherence to the five
        commandments [of Buddhism: Do not kill, steal, commit adultery,
        lie, nor drink alcohol nor eat meat]; then only does one have
        the prospect of attaining something. </p>
      <p>But all the subtleties and secrets are offered in this <i>Book
          of Consciousness and Life</i> to be pondered and weighted, so
        that one can attain everything in its truth. </p>
      <p>[ *** The drawing is intended to show the circulation of the
        streams of energy during the movement of breathing. Inhalation
        is accompanied by the sinking of the abdomen and exhalation by
        the lifting of it, but in these exercises the point is that we
        have a backward-flowing movement as follows: when inhaling, one
        opens the lower energy-gate and allows the energy to rise upward
        along the rear line of energy (in the spinal cord), and this
        upward flow corresponds to the time-intervals indicated in the
        drawing. In exhaling, the upper gate is closed and the stream of
        energy is allowed to flow downward along the front line,
        likewise in the order of the time-intervals indicated.
        Furthermore, it is to be noted that the stations for "washing"
        and "bathing" do not lie exactly in the middle of the lines, but
        that "washing" is somewhat above and "bathing" somewhat below
        the middle, as the drawing shows. ] </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">3. The Two Energy-Paths of Function and
            Control ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>There appears the way of the in-breathing and out-breathing of
        the primordial pass. <br>
        Do not forget the white path below the circulation in conformity
        wit the law! <br>
        Always let the cave of eternal life be nourished through the
        fire! <br>
        Ah! Test the immortal place of the gleaming pearl! </p>
      <p>[ *** In the text there is another picture here which is very
        similar to the first. It shows again the paths of energy: the
        one in front leads down and is called the function-path (<i>jen</i>),


        and the one at the back leading upwards is the control-path (<i>tu</i>).


        ] </p>
      <p>This picture is really the same as the one that precedes it.
        The reason that I show it again is so that the person striving
        for cultivation of the Tao may know that there is in his own
        body a circulation with the law. I have furnished this picture
        in order to enlighten companions in search of the goal. When
        these two paths (the functioning and the controlling) can be
        brought into unbroken connection, then all energy-paths are
        joined. The deer sleeps with his nose on his tail in order to
        close his controlling energy-path. The crane and the tortoise
        close their functioning-paths. Hence these three animals become
        at least a thousand years old. How much further can a man go! A
        man who carries on the cultivation of the Tao, who sets in
        motion the circulation in conformity with the law, in order to
        let consciousness and life circulate, need not fear that he is
        not lengthening his life and is not completing his path. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">4. The Embryo of the Tao ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>According to the law, but without exertion, one must diligently
        fill oneself with light. <br>
        Forgetting appearance, look within and help the true spiritual
        power! <br>
        Ten months them embryo is under fire. <br>
        After a year the washing and baths become warm. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="2.jpg" height="685" width="618"></p>
      </center>
      <p>This picture will be found in the original edition of the <i>Leng-yen-ching</i>.
        But the ignorant monks who did not recognize the hidden meaning
        and knew nothing about the embryo of the Tao have for this
        reason made the mistake of leaving this picture out. I only
        found out through the explanations of adepts that the Julai
        (Tathagata) knows real work on the embryo of the Tao. This
        embryo is nothing corporeally visible which might be completed
        by other beings, but is in reality the spiritual breath-energy
        of the ego. First the spirit must penetrate the breath-energy
        (the soul), then the breath-energy envelops the spirit. When
        spirit and breath-energy are firmly united and the thoughts
        quiet and immobile, this is described as the embryo. The
        breath-energy must crystallize; only then will the spirit become
        effective. Therefore it is said in the Leng-yen-ching: "Take
        maternal care of the awakening and the answering". The two
        energies nourish and strengthen one another. Therefore it is
        said: "Daily growth takes place". When the energy is strong
        enough and the embryo is round and complete it comes out on the
        top of the head. This is what is called: the completed
        appearance which comes forth as embryo and begets itself as the
        son of the Buddha. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">5. The Birth of the Fruit ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>Outside the body there is a body called the Buddha image. <br>
        The thought which is powerful, the absence of thoughts, is
        Bodhi. <br>
        The thousand-petal lotus flower opens, transformed through
        breath-energy. <br>
        Because of the crystallization of the spirit, a hundred-fold
        splendor shines forth. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="3.jpg" height="750" width="618"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In the <i>Leng-yen-chou</i> [Suramgama mantra] it is said: "At
        that time the ruler of the world caused a hundredfold precious
        light to beam from his hair knots. In the midst of the light
        shone the thousand-petal, precious lotus flower. And there
        within the flower sat a transformed Julai. And from the top of
        his head went ten rays of white, precious light, which were
        visible everywhere. The crowd looked up to the outstreaming
        light and the Julai announced: 'The divine, magic mantra is the
        appearance of the light-spirit, therefore his name is Son of
        Buddha'". </p>
      <p>If a man does not receive the teaching about consciousness and
        life, how could there develop out of his own body the Julai, who
        sits and shines forth in the lotus flower and appears in his own
        spirit-body! Many say that the light-spirit is a minor teaching;
        but how can that which a man receives from the ruler of the
        world be a minor teaching? Herewith I have betrayed the deepest
        secret of the Leng-yen in order to teach disciples. He who
        receives this way rises at once to the dark secret and no longer
        becomes submerged in the dust of everyday life. </p>

        The total spiritual power unfolds its traces and transforms

        Going out into being and going into non-being, one completes the

        All separate shapes appear as bodies, united with a true source.
