      </p>
      <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A fast pulsed nonthermal plasma
      reactor includes a discharge cell and a charging assembly
      electrically connected thereto. The charging assembly provides
      plural high voltage pulses to the discharge cell. Each pulse has a
      rise time between one and ten nanoseconds and a duration of three
      to twenty nanoseconds. The pulses create nonthermal plasma
      discharge within the discharge cell. Accordingly, the nonthermal
      plasma discharge can be used to remove pollutants from gases or
      break the gases into smaller molecules so that they can be more
      efficiently combusted. </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This invention pertains generally to
      for processing pollutant containing gases, and more particularly
      to nonthermal plasma reactors. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>2. Description of Related Art</b> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The emission and discharge of volatile
      organic compounds (VOCs) are strictly regulated by the U.S.
      Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the National Pollutant
      Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), and the National Emissions
      Standards for Hazardous Air Pollution regulations (NESHAPS).
      Technical and regulatory difficulties associated with current VOC
      treatment methods such as air-stripping (dilution),
      activated-carbon absorption, incineration, and thermal-catalytic
      treatment have prompted the search for alternatives. The drawbacks
      of present methods result in ineffective treatment, the generation
      of large secondary waste streams, and increased costs. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The present invention has recognized
      the prior art drawbacks, and has provided the below-disclosed
      solutions to one or more of the prior art deficiencies. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The present invention can be used to
      effectively treat VOCs while meeting regulations in a timely and
      economical fashion. In addition to VOCs, the present invention can
      be used to treat other air pollutants and hazardous/toxic
      chemicals in gases (e.g., acid rain precursors NOx and SOx, odor
      causing chemicals, chemical/biological warfare agents, and
      industrial emissions). Furthermore, to operate fossil-fueled motor
      vehicles and other combustion-related engines or machinery under
      higher efficiency and reduced pollution output conditions in the
      future, it is desirable to have clean-burning, energy-efficient,
      hydrocarbon liquid fuels. Such higher-order hydrocarbons can be
      synthesized using a nonthermal plasma (NTP) device according to
      the present invention. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">By way of example, and not of
      limitation, the present invention is a device that employs
      electrical discharges/nonthermal plasmas in a gaseous medium to
      destroy air pollutants or undesirable chemicals/chemical or
      biological agents, to process chemicals, or to synthesize chemical
      compounds. In nonthermal plasmas, the electrons are "hot", while
      the ions and neutral species are "cold" which results in little
      waste enthalpy being deposited in a process gas stream. This is in
      contrast to thermal plasmas, where the electron, ion, and
      neutral-species energies are in thermal equilibrium (or "hot") and
      considerable waste heat is deposited in the process gas. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the present invention, the NTP
      reactor is applied to gas streams containing hazardous/toxic, or
      other undesirable pollutants or contaminants and to gas streams
      that are to be processed (i.e., changed in chemical form or
      transformed into other useful products). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In one aspect of the present
      invention, a nonthermal plasma reactor includes a discharge cell

      invention, a nonthermal plasma reactor includes a discharge cell
      and a first charging assembly and a second charging assembly that
      are electrically connected to the discharge cell. The charging
      assemblies alternatingly provide opposite polarity high voltage
      pulses to the reactor. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In yet another aspect of the present

      Further, a spark gap switch is electrically connected to the first
      capacitor plate and a first electrode is electrically connected to
      the second capacitor plate. A second electrode is slightly spaced
      from the first electrode and a dielectric layer is disposed
      adjacent to the first electrode. Moreover, a gas discharge gap is
      established between the dielectric layer and the second electrode.
      In this aspect of the present invention, the first capacitor plate
      and the second capacitor plate provide plural high voltage pulses
      to the discharge cell. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In yet still another aspect of the
      present invention, a nonthermal plasma reactor includes a first
      capacitor plate, a second capacitor plate, and a first dielectric
      layer that is disposed therebetween. A first spark gap switch is
      electrically connected to the first capacitor plate. The reactor
      further includes a third capacitor plate, a fourth capacitor
      plate, and a second dielectric layer that is disposed
      therebetween. Further, a second spark gap switch is electrically
      connected to the third capacitor plate. In this aspect of the
      present invention, a first electrode is electrically connected to
      the second capacitor plate and the fourth capacitor plate and a
      second electrode is slightly spaced from the first electrode. A
      dielectric layer is disposed adjacent to the first electrode and a
      gas discharge gap is established between the dielectric layer and
      the second electrode. The first capacitor plate, the second
      capacitor plate, the third capacitor plate, and the fourth
      capacitor plate alternatingly provide opposite polarity high
      voltage pulses to the reactor. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In still yet another aspect of the
      present invention, a nonthermal plasma reactor includes a
      discharge cell and means for providing plural high voltage pulses
      to the discharge cell. Each high voltage pulse has a rise time of
      not more than ten nanoseconds. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In another aspect of the present
      invention, a method for treating pollutant containing gases
      includes providing a discharge cell. Plural high voltage pulses
      are provided to the discharge cell. Each high voltage pulse has a
      rise time of not more than ten nanoseconds. </p>

      be brought out in the following portions of the specification,
      wherein the detailed description is for the purpose of fully
      disclosing preferred embodiments of the invention without placing
      limitations thereon. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL
        VIEWS OF THE DRAWING(S)</b> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The invention will be more fully

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIG. 9 is a schematic diagram of a
      circuit utilizing capacitive transfer circuits. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION</b> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Referring more specifically to the
      drawings, for illustrative purposes the present invention is
      embodied in the apparatus generally shown in FIG. 1 through FIG.
      9. It will be appreciated that the apparatus may vary as to
      configuration and as to details of the parts, and that the method
      may vary as to the specific steps and sequence, without departing
      from the basic concepts as disclosed herein. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Referring initially to FIG. 1, a
      positive electrode and a negative electrode are shown and
      designated 10 and 12, respectively. A gas discharge gap 14 is
      established between the electrodes 10, 12. As shown, the gas
      discharge gap 14 has a width 16. Moreover, three non-limiting,
      exemplary discharge streamers 18 are shown between the electrodes
      10, 12 within the gas discharge gap 14. Each discharge streamer 18
      shown has a head 20 and a tail 22. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It can be appreciated that a voltage
      pulse can be applied across the electrodes 10, 12. If the applied
      voltage pulse rise time and pulse duration are comparable to the
      streamer transit time across the gap 14, the drive circuit,
      described below, can influence the development of the discharge
      across the gap 14. If the applied electric field rises fast
      enough, each discharge streamer head 20 can coalesce to create
      quasi-homogenous discharges. It is to be understood that
      quasi-homogenous discharges can have very favorable consequences.
      For example, the discharge operates for a larger fraction of its
      duration at a higher, and more favorable, reduced electric field,
      i.e., electric field divided by gas density (E/N). Further, the
      discharge operates at a higher average electron energy. FIG. 2,
      for example, shows that the average electron energy increases with
      increasing reduced electric field for oxygen gas. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Further results of the
      quasi-homogenous discharges are greater yields, i.e., number per
      unit energy, of free radicals and other active species because
      these yields generally increase with increasing electron
      temperature. Moreover, with more homogenous discharges, the
      radicals are spread over a larger volume and have lower peak
      concentrations. As such, there is less competition from
      radical-radical interactions which tend to reduce the
      concentrations of active species and therefore, more active
      species survive to react with entrained pollutants or feed gas
      species. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIG. 3 shows a non-limiting, exemplary
      embodiment of a nonthermal plasma (NTP) reactor, generally
      designated 50. As shown in FIG. 3, the reactor 50 includes a
      generally rectangular, box-shaped housing 52 in which a charging
      assembly 54 and a discharge cell 56 are disposed. FIG. 3 shows
      that the charging assembly 54 includes a first capacitor plate 58
      and a second capacitor plate 60. The first capacitor plate 58
      rests on a first dielectric layer 62 (e.g., Mylar) which insulates
      it from the housing 52. Also, a second dielectric layer 64 is
      installed between the capacitor plates 58, 60. A spark gap switch
      66 is connected to the first capacitor plate 58. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As shown in FIG. 3, the discharge cell
      56 includes a first electrode 68 and a second electrode 70 that
      are separated by a dielectric layer 72. Preferably, the dielectric
      layer 72 is made from a material such as glass. A gas discharge
      gap 74 is established between the electrodes 68, 70. It is to be
      understood that after the capacitor plates 58, 60 are charged, the
      spark gap switch 66 can be used to control the electric pulse
      delivered across the electrodes 68, 70. It is to be understood
      that pollutant containing gas can be supplied to the gas discharge
      gap 74 where it can be treated as described in detail below. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Referring now to FIG. 4, an electric
      circuit representing the device shown in FIG. 3 is shown and is
      generally designated 100. FIG. 4 shows that the circuit 100
      includes a first electrode 102 and a second electrode 104 that are
      separated by a discharge gap 106. FIG. 4 also shows that a first
      dielectric layer 108 and second dielectric layer 110 can be
      disposed between the electrodes 102, 104 and that the discharge
      gap 106 can be established between the dielectric layers 108, 110.
      As shown in FIG. 4, a first inductor 112 is connected parallel to
      the electrodes 102, 104. Moreover, a first capacitor 114 and a
      second capacitor 116 are also installed in the circuit 100 such
      that they are connected in series to each other and the
      combination thereof is connected parallel to the first inductor
      112 and the electrodes 102, 104. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIG. 4 also shows a second inductor
      118 that is connected to the circuit 100 adjacent to the second
      capacitor 116 the second inductor 118 represents the inherent
      inductance of the spark gap switch 126. Further, the circuit 100
      is connected to a power source 120 such as a direct current (DC)
      power source. A resistor 122 is connected between the power source
      120 and the circuit 100. As shown, the circuit 100 is also
      connected to ground 124, e.g., at the second electrode 104. The
      circuit 100 also includes a switch 126, e.g. a spark gap switch as
      described above. It is to be understood that the above described
      circuit 100 can be used to create a fast-pulse nonthermal
      discharge between the electrodes 102, 104. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Referring now to FIG. 5, a
      resonant-charging circuit is shown and is generally designated
      150. FIG. 5. shows that the circuit 150 includes a discharge cell
      152 having a first electrode 154 and a second electrode 156
      separated by a discharge gap 158. As shown in FIG. 5, a first
      inductor 160 is installed in the circuit so that it is parallel to
      the electrodes 154, 156. Moreover, a first capacitor 162 and a
      second capacitor 164 are connected in series to each other and the
      combination thereof is connected parallel to the first inductor
      160 and the electrodes 154, 156. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIG. 5 further shows a transformer 166
      installed in the circuit 150. The transformer 166 includes a low
      voltage (input) side 168 and a high voltage (output) side 170. As
      shown the high voltage side 170 of the transformer 166 is
      installed in the circuit 150 so that it provides a high voltage
      signal to the capacitors 162, 164. FIG. 5 also shows a spark gap
      switch 172 is installed in the circuit parallel to the second
      capacitor 164. The spark gap switch 172 is connected to ground 174
      and can be used to control the electric pulses that are delivered
      to the discharge cell 152 between the electrodes 154, 156.
      Preferably, in this embodiment, a first diode 176 is installed in
      the circuit 150 between the spark gap switch 172 and the
      transformer 166. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As shown in FIG. 5, the low voltage
      side 168 of the transformer 166 is connected to a power source 178
      such as an AC power source. A second diode 180 and a resistor 182
      are connected parallel to each other and the combination thereof
      is installed in series within the circuit 150 between the low
      voltage side 168 of the transformer 166 and the power source 178.
      A second inductor 184 is connected in series with the second diode
      180 and resistor 182 combination between the power source 178 and
      the second diode 180 and resistor 182 combination. It is to be
      understood that the above described circuit 150 can be used to
      create a fast-pulse nonthermal discharge between the electrodes
      154, 156 within the discharge cell 152. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIG. 6 shows a reduced electric field
      waveform generated, e.g., by the reactor 50 shown in FIG. 3 with
      oxygen in the discharge cell 56, i.e. within the gas discharge gap
      74. As shown in FIG. 6, the waveform peaks at approximately one
      and eight-tenths of a nanosecond (1.8 ns). This is a direct result
      of a high voltage pulse having an extremely fast rise time and
      short duration. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIG. 7 shows an exemplary,
      non-limiting graph of the short-pulse electrical discharge power
      versus time, e.g., for the reactor 50 shown in FIG. 3. As shown,
      the power peaks initially at approximately two and eight-tenths
      nanoseconds (2.8 ns) and as time elapses the amplitude of the
      power spikes decrease. Accordingly, very little power is wasted at
      times when electron temperature is low. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Referring now to FIG. 8 an alternative
      embodiment of a nonthermal reactor, generally designated 200. As
      shown in FIG. 8, the reactor 200 includes a generally rectangular,
      box-shaped housing 202 in which a first charging assembly 204 and
      a second charging assembly 206 are disposed. Each charging
      assembly 204, 206 is connected to a discharge cell 208 that is
      disposed in the housing 202 between the charging assemblies 204,
      206. FIG. 8 shows that the first charging assembly 204 includes a
      first capacitor plate 210 and a second capacitor plate 212. The
      first capacitor plate 210 rests on a first dielectric layer 214
      which insulates it from the housing 202. Also, a second dielectric
      layer 216 is installed between the capacitor plates 210, 212. A
      spark gap switch 218 is connected to the first capacitor plate
      210. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Similar to the first charging assembly
      204, the second charging assembly 206 includes a first capacitor
      plate 220 and a second capacitor plate 222. The first capacitor
      plate 220 rests on a first dielectric layer 224 which insulates it
      from the housing 202. Also, a second dielectric layer 226 is
      installed between the capacitor plates 220, 222. A spark gap
      switch 228 is connected to the first capacitor plate 220. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As shown in FIG. 8, the discharge cell
      208 includes a first electrode 230 and a second electrode 232 that
      are separated by a dielectric layer 234. Preferably, in this
      embodiment, the dielectric layer 234 is made, e.g., from glass. A
      gas discharge gap 236 is established between the electrodes 230,
      232. It is to be understood that the capacitor plates 210, 212 of
      the first charging assembly 204 and the capacitor plates 220, 222
      of the second charging assembly 206 can be oppositely charged.
      Moreover, the spark gap switches 218, 228 can be alternatingly
      fired in order to alternatingly deliver opposite polarity pulses
      to the discharge cell 208. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Referring to FIG. 9, a circuit diagram
      utilizing capacitive transfer circuits is shown and is generally
      designated 250. FIG. 9 shows that the circuit 250 includes a first
      electrode 252 and a second electrode 254 that are separated by a
      discharge gap 256. FIG. 9 also shows that a first dielectric layer
      258 and second dielectric layer 260 can be disposed between the
      electrodes 252, 254 and that the discharge gap 256 can be
      established between the dielectric layers 258, 260. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As shown in FIG. 9, the circuit 250
      includes a first capacitive-transfer circuit 262 and a second
      capacitive-transfer circuit 264 that provide pulses across the
      electrodes 252, 254 within the discharge gap 256. FIG. 9 shows
      that the first capacitive-transfer circuit 262 includes a storage
      capacitor 266 and a peaking capacitor 268 that are connected to
      the circuit 250 in series to each other and in parallel to the
      electrodes 252, 254. FIG. 9 also shows that the first
      capacitive-transfer circuit 262 is connected to a negative power
      source 270. A first inductor 272 is installed between the power
      source 270 and the first capacitive-transfer circuit 262.
      Moreover, a second inductor 274 and a switch 276 are shown between
      the first inductor 272 and the peaking capacitor 268. It is to be
      understood that the second inductor 274 shown in the first
      capacitive-transfer circuit 262 represents the inherent inductance
      of the switch 276 and the connections associated therewith. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Similar to the first
      capacitive-transfer circuit 262, the second capacitive-transfer
      circuit 264 includes a storage capacitor 278 and a peaking
      capacitor 280 that are connected to the circuit 250 in series to
      each other and parallel to the electrodes 252, 254. FIG. 9 also
      shows that the second capacitive-transfer circuit 264 is connected
      to a positive power source 282. A first inductor 284 is installed
      between the power source 282 and the second capacitive-transfer
      circuit 264. Moreover, a second inductor 286 and a switch 288 are
      shown between the first inductor 284 and the peaking capacitor
      280. It is to be understood that the second inductor 286 shown in
      the second capacitive-transfer circuit 264 represents the inherent
      inductance of the switch 288 and the connections associated
      therewith. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is to be understood that the
      storage capacitors 266, 278 are rapidly switched into the closely
      coupled peaking capacitors 268, 280. The capacitance of each
      peaking capacitor 268, 280 is less than its neighboring storage
      capacitor 266, 278. Accordingly, the peaking capacitors 268, 280
      "ring-up" to a higher voltage than the charge voltage on the
      storage capacitors 266, 278 and electrical discharges are created
      across the electrodes 252, 254. It is to be understood that in
      order to deliver very fast time rise pulses to the electrodes 252,
      254, the inductances represented by the second inductors 274, 286
      in each capacitive-transfer circuit 262, 264 must be kept very
      low. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It can be appreciated that in each
      circuit 100, 150, 250 described above additional circuit elements,
      e.g., resistors, inductors, etc., can be included in order to
      facilitate pulse shaping. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is to be understood that each
      reactor 50, 200 is a fast-pulsed nonthermal plasma (NTP) reactor
      that can be used to generate highly reactive chemical species,
      such as free radicals. These reactive species, e.g., O-atoms,
      OH-radicals, N-radicals, excited N.sub.2 and O.sub.2 molecules,
      HO.sub.2 -radicals, NH-radicals, CH-radicals, etc., readily
      decompose organic chemicals (e.g., VOCs), oxides of sulfur and
      nitrogen (SO.sub.2 and NOx), and odor agents (e.g., aldehydes,
      H.sub.2 S and many others) by breaking their chemical bonds. The
      result is the production of nonhazardous or easily-managed
      products. The free radicals, described above, can also play a key
      role in chemical synthesis, producing desirable products, e.g.,
      creating higher-order hydrocarbon fuels from methane/natural gas.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Further, nonthermal plasmas can be
      created by the reactors 50, 200. As described in detail above,
      each reactor 50, 200 makes use of an extremely fast-pulsed
      dielectric-barrier discharge arrangement. A high voltage pulse
      having an extremely fast rise time, approximately one to ten
      nanoseconds (1-10 ns), and duration, approximately three to twenty
      nanoseconds (3-20 ns), is applied to the electrodes thereby
      creating electrical-discharge streamers in the gas. With a short
      enough rise time, the development of the discharges can be
      influenced such that the discharge gap undergoes electrical
      breakdown at a reduced electric field, electric field divided by
      gas density (E/N), much higher than the static field (or the field
      with a slower rise time)--a condition sometimes called
      "overvolting". This can create a quasi-homogeneous discharge
      condition in which most of the reactor active volume, i.e., the
      area between the electrodes, is filled with an electrical
      discharge having a high average electron energy. The discharges
      are the source of the active nonthermal plasma (NTP). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Each of the above-described NTP
      reactors 50, 200 are able to reduce hazardous compound
      concentrations in off-gases to very low levels by free-radical
      "cold combustion" or synthesize desirable chemical products using
      gaseous feedstocks. It is to be understood that although each NTP
      reactor 50, 200, described above, has a generally rectangular box
      shape, each can be modified to have a generally cylindrical shape.
