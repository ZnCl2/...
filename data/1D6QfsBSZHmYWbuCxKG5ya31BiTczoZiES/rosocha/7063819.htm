    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A device for processing gases includes
      a cylindrical housing in which an electrically grounded, metal
      injection/extraction gas supply tube is disposed. A dielectric
      tube surrounds the injection/extraction gas supply tube to
      establish a gas modification passage therearound. Additionally, a
      metal high voltage electrode circumscribes the dielectric tube.
      The high voltage electrode is energizable to create nonthermal
      electrical microdischarges between the high voltage electrode and
      the injection/extraction gas supply tube across the dielectric
      tube within the gas modification passage. An injection/extraction
      gas and a process gas flow through the nonthermal electrical
      microdischarges within the gas modification passage and a modified
      process gas results. Using the device contaminants that are
      entrained in the process gas can be destroyed to yield a cleaner,
      modified process gas. <br>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">1. Field of the Invention </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This invention pertains generally to
      devices for processing contaminated/polluted gases or gases to be
      used as feedstocks for chemical synthesis/modification, and more
      particularly to non-thermal plasma reactors. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">2. Description of Related Art </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The emission and discharge of volatile
      organic compounds (VOCs) are strictly regulated by the U.S.
      Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the National Pollutant
      Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), and the National Emissions
      Standards for Hazardous Air Pollution regulations (NESHAPS).
      Technical and regulatory difficulties associated with current VOC
      and HAP treatment methods such as air-stripping (dilution),
      activated-carbon absorption, incineration, and thermal-catalytic
      treatment have prompted the search for alternatives. The drawbacks
      of present methods result in ineffective treatment, the generation
      of large secondary waste streams, and increased costs. It is also
      recognized that, for example, to operate fossil-fueled motor
      vehicles and other combustion-related engines or machinery under
      higher efficiency and reduced pollution output conditions in the
      future, it is desirable to have clean-burning, energy-efficient,
      hydrocarbon liquid fuels. This invention can also be used to
      synthesize such fuels from gaseous feedstocks. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The present invention has recognized
      these prior art drawbacks, and has provided the below-disclosed
      solutions to one or more of the prior art deficiencies. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This invention overcomes many of these
      drawbacks and enables the end user to effectively treat VOCs and
      HAPs while meeting regulations in a timely and economical fashion.
      In addition to VOCs/HAPs, this invention shows promise for
      treating other air pollutants and hazardous/toxic chemicals in
      gases (e.g., acid rain precursors NOx and SOx, odor causing
      chemicals, chemical/biological warfare agents, and industrial
      emissions). Additionally, higher-order hydrocarbons (e.g., for
      motor vehicle fuels) can be synthesized using a nonthermal plasma
      (NTP) device according to the present invention. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">By way of example, and not of
      limitation, the present invention is a device that employs
      electrical discharges/nonthermal plasmas in a gaseous medium to
      destroy air pollutants or undesirable chemicals/chemical or
      biological agents; process chemicals, or synthesize chemical
      compounds. In nonthermal plasmas, the electrons are "hot", while
      the ions and neutral species are "cold" which results in little
      waste enthalpy being deposited in a process gas stream. This is in
      contrast to thermal plasmas, where the electron, ion, and
      neutral-species energies are in thermal equilibrium (or "hot") and
      considerable waste heat is deposited in the process gas. The
      present invention utilizes a method for injecting additive
      gases/chemical compounds into the process gas stream to increase
      the efficiency and/or selectivity of the plasma processing. In
      prior-art dielectric-barrier (DB) reactors, an additive, e.g., an
      injection/extraction gas, has not been applied. Doing so allows
      for a greater variety of active species to be produced with
      associated increases in effective active species yields. Also,
      some chemical injectants (e.g., those with low photoionization
      cross sections) can be used to "seed" the discharge so a more
      homogeneous bulk-volume plasma results. This can provide
      advantages in terms of spreading the active species over the
      plasma reactor volume and, thereby, decreasing deleterious active
      species consumption mechanisms (e.g., radical-radical
      recombination). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the present invention, the NTP
      reactor is applied to gas streams containing hazardous/toxic, or
      other undesirable pollutants or contaminants and to gas streams
      that are to be processed (i.e., changed in chemical form or
      transformed into other useful products). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In one aspect of the present
      invention, a device for processing contaminated gases includes a
      high voltage electrode and a ground electrode that is slightly
      spaced from the high voltage electrode. A dielectric layer is
      disposed in close contact with the high voltage electrode between
      the high voltage electrode and the ground electrode. Moreover, a
      gas modification passage is established within the housing between
      the dielectric layer and the ground electrode. A process gas
      supply provides a process gas to the gas modification passage and
      an injection/extraction gas supply provides an
      injection/extraction gas to the gas modification passage. The high
      voltage electrode is energizable to create nonthermal electrical
      microdischarges between the high voltage electrode and the ground
      electrode, distributed over the dielectric layer area within the
      gas modification passage. As the process gas and the
      injection/extraction gas flow through the gas modification
      passage, the process gas is modified to yield a modified process
      gas in which entrained pollutants have been destroyed. Or, the
      process gas can be modified to yield a fuel that can be more
      easily and efficiently combusted with less resultant pollution. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In another aspect of the present
      invention, a device for processing gases includes a gas
      modification passage that defines a length. The device further
      includes a means for supplying a process gas to the gas
      modification passage and a means for supplying an
      injection/extraction gas to the gas modification passage. Further,
      the device includes means for creating non-thermal electrical
      microdischarges along the length of the gas modification passage.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In yet another aspect of the present
      invention, a device for processing gases includes a cylindrical
      housing. A metal injection/extraction gas supply tube is disposed
      within the housing and is electrically grounded. A first
      dielectric tube surrounds the injection/extraction gas supply
      tube. Moreover, a gas modification passage is established between
      the injection/extraction gas supply tube and the first dielectric
      tube. In this aspect, a metal high voltage electrode circumscribes
      the first dielectric tube. The high voltage electrode is
      energizable to create nonthermal electrical microdischarges
      between the high voltage electrode and the injection/extraction
      gas supply tube along the length of the gas modification passage.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In still another aspect of the present
      invention, a device for processing gases includes a rectangular
      box-shaped housing. A metal, rectangular, plate-shaped
      injection/extraction gas manifold is disposed within the housing.
      The injection/extraction gas manifold is formed with
      injection/extraction gas passages and is electrically grounded.
      Further, a rectangular, dielectric plate is installed in the
      housing such that it is slightly spaced from the
      injection/extraction gas manifold. A gas modification passage is
      established between the ground electrode and the dielectric layer.
      This aspect of the present invention further includes a metal,
      rectangular, plate-shaped high voltage electrode that is adjacent
      to the dielectric layer. The high voltage electrode is energizable
      to create nonthermal electrical microdischarges between the high
      voltage electrode and the injection/extraction gas manifold along
      the length of the gas modification passage. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In yet still another aspect of the
      present invention, a device for processing gases includes a
      rectangular box-shaped housing. A metal, rectangular, plate-shaped
      high voltage electrode is installed within the housing. Moreover,
      a rectangular, first dielectric plate is installed within the
      housing adjacent to the high voltage electrode. Further, the
      device includes a rectangular, second dielectric plate that is
      slightly spaced from the first dielectric plate. A metal,
      rectangular, plate-shaped ground electrode is adjacent to the
      second dielectric plate. In this aspect, a gas modification
      passage is established between the first dielectric plate and the
      second dielectric plate. Additionally, an injection/extraction gas
      manifold flanks the first dielectric plate and the second
      dielectric plate. The injection/extraction gas manifold is formed
      with an injection/extraction gas passage that is in fluid
      communication with the gas modification passage. Also, the high
      voltage electrode is energizable to create nonthermal electrical
      microdischarges between the high voltage electrode and the ground
      electrode along the length of the gas modification passage. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In still another aspect of the present
      invention, a method for processing gases includes establishing a
      gas modification passage. Nonthermal electrical microdischarges
      are created along the length of the gas modification passage. A
      process gas is provided to the gas modification passage such that
      the process gas flows through the nonthermal electrical
      microdischarge. Also, an injection/extraction gas is provided to
      the gas modification passage such that the injection/extraction
      gas flows through the nonthermal electrical microdischarges with
      the process gas. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">An object of the invention is to
      provide a relatively high degree of contaminant removal. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Another object of the invention is to
      decrease contaminant-removal costs. </p>

      provide simultaneous destruction and removal of multiple
      pollutants. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Another object of the invention is to
      eliminate the need for fuels or catalysts. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Another object of the invention is the
      potential for self catalysis in the gas phase due to
      chain-reaction propagators resulting from the additive gas. </p>

      be brought out in the following portions of the specification,
      wherein the detailed description is for the purpose of fully

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Referring more specifically to the
      drawings, for illustrative purposes the present invention is
      embodied in the apparatus generally shown in FIG. 1 through FIG.
      10. It will be appreciated that each apparatus may vary as to
      configuration and as to details of the parts, and that the method
      may vary as to the specific steps and sequence, without departing
      from the basic concepts as disclosed herein. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIGS. 1 and 2 show a first embodiment
      of a silent discharge plasma/dielectric-barrier discharge
      (SDP/DBD) reactor according to the present invention, generally
      designated 10. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the reactor 10 includes
      a generally cylindrical housing 12 disposed between a generally
      disk-shaped inlet end cap 14 and a generally disk-shaped outlet
      end cap 16. FIGS. 1 and 2 show that the end caps 14, 16 can be
      removably engaged with the housing 10 using plural nuts 18 and
      plural bolts 20, but it can be appreciated that any other
      fastening means well known in the art can be used. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIG. 2 shows that the reactor 10
      includes a metal, generally cylindrical high-voltage (HV)
      electrode 22 that is disposed within the housing 12 between the
      end caps 14, 16. In a preferred embodiment, the HV electrode 22 is
      connected to an alternating current (AC) source or a pulsed direct
      current (DC) source. Moreover, a generally cylindrical, dielectric
      tube 24 is disposed within the HV electrode 22 such that the HV
      electrode 22 closely surrounds the dielectric tube 24. Preferably,
      the dielectric tube 24 is made from a dielectric material, e.g.,
      glass, ceramic, etc. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As shown in FIG. 2, a metal, generally
      cylindrical injection/extraction gas supply tube 26 is disposed
      within the dielectric tube 24. The injection/extraction gas supply
      tube 26 is electrically grounded and can be considered a ground
      electrode. It is to be understood that the HV electrode 22 and the
      tubes 24, 26 are concentric to each other and are centered on a
      central axis 28 established by the reactor 10. Moreover, it is to
      be understood that the dielectric tube 24 establishes a dielectric
      barrier or layer between the HV electrode 22 and the grounded
      injection/extraction gas supply tube 26. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIG. 2 shows that a gas modification
      passage 30 is established between the injection/extraction gas
      supply tube 26 and the dielectric tube 24. Also, an
      injection/extraction gas passage 32 is established within the
      injection/extraction gas supply tube 26. Plural
      injection/extraction gas holes 34 are established laterally within
      the injection/extraction gas supply tube 26 and connect the
      injection/extraction gas passage 32 to the gas modification
      passage 30. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As shown in FIG. 2, one end of the
      injection/extraction gas supply tube 26 establishes an
      injection/extraction gas inlet 36. A plug 38 is disposed within
      the other end of the injection/extraction gas supply tube 26. FIG.
      2 further shows that the reactor 10 also includes a process gas
      inlet 40 established by the inlet end cap 14. The process gas
      inlet 40 leads to the gas modification passage 30. Also, a
      modified process gas outlet 42 is established by the outlet end
      cap 16 and leads from the gas modification passage 30. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is to be understood that when the
      HV electrode 22 is energized, nonthermal electrical
      microdischarges occur between the HV electrode 22 and the grounded
      injection/extraction gas supply tube 26 across the dielectric
      barrier established by the dielectric tube 24. The nonthermal
      electrical microdischarges occur within the gas modification
      passage 30 and the width of the gas modification passage 30
      defines a discharge gap 44. Preferably, the discharge gap 44 is
      between one and several millimeters (e.g., 1 10 mm). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is to be understood that an
      injection/extraction gas is supplied to the injection/extraction
      gas inlet 36 and flows through the injection/extraction gas
      passage 32, through the injection/extraction gas holes 34, and
      into the gas modification passage 30. A process gas is supplied to
      the process gas inlet 40 and flows through the gas modification
      passage 30. It is to be understood that the process gas can be
      ambient air, a noble gas, natural gas, a gas mixture, etc. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When the HV electrode 22 is energized,
      nonthermal electrical microdischarges occur between the dielectric
      tube 24 and the grounded injection/extraction gas supply tube 26.
      As the process gas flows through the gas modification passage 30
      and the injection/extraction gas flows through the
      injection/extraction gas passage 32, the SDP/DBD reactor 10 can be
      used to generate highly reactive chemical species, such as free
      radicals. These reactive species, e.g., O-atoms, OH-radicals,
      N-radicals, excited N.sub.2 and O.sub.2 molecules,
      HO.sub.2-radicals, NH-radicals, CH-radicals, etc., readily
      decompose organic chemicals (e.g., VOCs), oxides of sulfur and
      nitrogen (SO.sub.2 and NOx), and odor agents (e.g., aldehydes,
      H.sub.2S and many others) by breaking their chemical bonds. The
      result is the production of nonhazardous or easily-managed
      products. The free radicals and other active species, described
      above, can also play a key role in chemical synthesis, producing
      desirable products, e.g., creating higher-order hydrocarbon fuels
      from methane/natural gas. Moreover, nonthermal plasmas can be
      created by several types of electric discharge configurations. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In this exemplary, non-limiting
      embodiment of the invention, the reactor 10 utilizes a
      dielectric-barrier discharge arrangement, i.e., the HV electrode
      22, the dielectric tube 24, and the grounded injection/extraction
      gas supply tube 26. The two conducting electrodes, i.e., the HV
      electrode 22 and the grounded injection/extraction gas supply tube
      26, are separated by a relatively thin gas-containing space, i.e.,
      the gas modification passage 30. The HV electrode 22 is covered by
      a dielectric material, i.e., the dielectric tube 24. As described
      in detail below, it can be appreciated that the grounded
      injection/extraction gas supply tube 26 can also be covered by a
      dielectric layer. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A high-voltage signal, e.g.,
      alternating current with a frequency in a range of ten Hertz to
      twenty kiloHertz (10 Hz 20 kHz) is applied to the HV electrode 22
      and the grounded injection/extraction gas supply tube 26 (which
      also serves as an electrode) thereby creating electrical-discharge
      streamers (microdischarges) in the gas modification passage 30. It
      is to be understood that the discharges are the source of the
      active nonthermal plasma. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It can be appreciated that the reactor
      10 of the present invention can reduce hazardous compound
      concentrations in off-gases to very low levels by free-radical
      "cold combustion." Or, the reactor 10 can synthesize desirable
      chemical products using gaseous feedstocks. Because this invention
      provides for the injection of additive chemical compounds, e.g.,
      ammonia, hydrocarbons, etc., into the gas modification passage 30,
      additional reactive species can be created. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIG. 3 shows a second embodiment of a
      SDP/DBD reactor according to the present invention, generally
      designated 50. As shown in FIG. 3, the reactor 50 is similar in
      every aspect to the reactor shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 except for the
      addition of a second dielectric tube 52 that circumscribes an
      injection/extraction gas supply tube 26. Accordingly, as intended
      by this embodiment of the present invention, a gas modification
      passage 54 is established between the first dielectric tube 24 and
      the second dielectric tube 52. Moreover, nonthermal electrical
      microdischarges can occur between the HV electrode 22 and the
      injection/extraction gas supply tube 26 across both dielectric
      tubes 24, 52. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIGS. 4 and 5 show a third embodiment
      of a SDP/DBD reactor according to the present invention, generally
      designated 100. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the reactor 100
      includes a generally rectangular housing 102 disposed between a
      generally flat, rectangular, plate-shaped inlet end cap 104 and a
      generally flat, rectangular, plate-shaped outlet end cap 106.
      FIGS. 4 and 5 show that the end caps 104, 106 can be removably
      engaged with the housing 100 using plural nuts 108 and plural
      bolts 110, but it can be appreciated that any other fastening
      means well known in the art can be used. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIG. 5 shows that the reactor 100
      includes a metal, generally flat, rectangular, plate-shaped
      high-voltage (HV) electrode 112 that is disposed within the
      housing 102 between the end caps 104, 106. Preferably, the HV
      electrode 112 is connected to an alternating current (AC) source
      or a pulsed direct current (DC) source. Moreover, a generally
      flat, rectangular dielectric plate 114 is disposed within the
      reactor 100 adjacent to the HV electrode 112. Preferably, the
      dielectric plate 114 is made from a material such as glass,
      ceramic, etc. As shown in FIG. 5, a metal, generally flat,
      rectangular injection/extraction gas manifold 116 is disposed
      within the reactor 100 such that it is slightly spaced from the
      dielectric plate 114. It is to be understood that the
      injection/extraction gas manifold 116 is electrically grounded and
      can be formed with one or more injection/extraction gas passages
      118--each passage 118 can further have plural injection/extraction
      gas holes 120 leading therefrom (see, e.g., FIG. 6). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As shown in FIG. 5, a gas modification
      passage 122 is established between the injection/extraction gas
      manifold 116 and the dielectric plate 114. The
      injection/extraction gas holes 120 provide fluid communication
      between the injection/extraction gas passages 118 and the gas
      modification passage 122. FIG. 5 further shows that the inlet end
      cap 104 is formed with a process gas inlet 124 that leads to the
      gas modification passage 122 and an injection/extraction gas inlet
      126 that leads to the injection/extraction gas passages 118. Also,
      a modified process gas outlet 128 is established by the outlet end
      cap 106 and leads from the gas modification passage 122. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is to be understood that when the
      HV electrode 112 is energized, nonthermal electrical
      microdischarges occur between the dielectric plate 114 and the
      grounded injection/extraction gas manifold 116. The nonthermal
      electrical microdischarges occur within the gas modification
      passage 122 and the width of the gas modification passage 122
      defines a discharge gap 130. Preferably, the discharge gap 130 is
      between one and several millimeters (e.g., 1 10 mm). It can be
      appreciated that as a process gas and an injection/extraction gas
      flow through the gas modification passage 122, the process gas is
      modified by the nonthermal electrical microdischarges within the
      gas modification passage 122, as described in detail above. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Referring now to FIGS. 7, 8, and 9, a
      fourth embodiment of a SDP/DBD reactor according to the present
      invention is shown and is generally designated 200. As shown in
      FIGS. 7, 8, and 9, the reactor 200 includes a generally
      rectangular housing 202 disposed between a generally flat,
      rectangular, plate-shaped inlet end cap 204 and a generally flat,
      rectangular, plate-shaped outlet end cap 206. FIGS. 7, 8, and 9
      show that the end caps 204, 206 can be removably engaged with the
      housing 200 using plural nuts 208 and plural bolts 210, but it can
      be appreciated that any other fastening means well known in the
      art can be used. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIG. 8 shows that the reactor 200
      includes a metal, generally flat, rectangular, plate-shaped
      high-voltage (HV) electrode 212 disposed within the housing 202
      between the end caps 204, 206. Also, a metal, generally flat,
      rectangular, plate-shaped ground electrode 214 is disposed within
      the housing 202 and is slightly spaced from the HV electrode 212.
      Preferably, the HV electrode 212 is connected to an alternating
      current (AC) source or a pulsed direct current (DC) source and the
      ground electrode 214 is electrically grounded. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As shown, a generally flat,
      rectangular first dielectric plate 216 is disposed within the
      reactor 200 immediately adjacent to the HV electrode 212 between
      the HV electrode 212 and the ground electrode 214. Moreover, a
      generally flat, rectangular second dielectric plate 218 is
      disposed within the reactor 200 immediately adjacent to the ground
      electrode 214 between the HV electrode 212 and the ground
      electrode 214. Preferably, the dielectric plates 216, 218 are made
      from a material such as glass, ceramic, etc. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As shown in FIG. 9, a generally "C"
      shaped first injection/extraction gas manifold 220 is disposed
      within the reactor 200 such that it partially surrounds the
      dielectric plates 216, 218. A generally "C" shaped second
      injection/extraction gas manifold 222 is disposed within the
      reactor 200 opposite the first injection/extraction gas manifold
      220 such that the second injection/extraction gas manifold 222
      partially surrounds the dielectric plates 216, 218 opposite the
      first injection/extraction gas manifold 220. FIGS. 8 and 9 show
      that each injection/extraction gas manifold 222 is formed with an
      injection/extraction passage 224 having plural
      injection/extraction gas holes 226 leading therefrom. The plural
      injection/extraction gas holes 226 lead to a gas modification
      passage 228 that is established between the dielectric plates 216,
      218. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">FIG. 8 further shows that the inlet
      end cap 204 is formed with a process gas inlet 230 that leads to
      the gas modification passage 228. Also, a modified process gas
      outlet 232 is established by the outlet end cap 206 and leads from
      the gas modification passage 228. It is to be understood that when
      the HV electrode 212 is energized, nonthermal electrical
      microdischarges occur between the HV electrode 212 and the ground
      electrode 214 across the dielectric plates 216, 218. These
      nonthermal electrical microdischarges occur within the gas
      modification passage 228 and the width of the gas modification
      passage 228 defines a discharge gap 234. Preferably, the discharge
      gap 234 is between one and several millimeters (e.g., 1 10 mm). It
      can be appreciated that as a process gas and an
      injection/extraction gas flow through the gas modification passage
      228, the process gas is modified by the nonthermal electrical
      microdischarges within the gas modification passage 228, as
      described in detail above. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Referring now to FIG. 10, a
      non-limiting, exemplary gas-processing system is shown and is
      generally designated 300. FIG. 10 shows that the system 300
      includes an SDP/DBD reactor, e.g., the reactor 10 shown in FIGS. 1
      and 2 and described in detail above. A process gas supply 302 is
      connected to the SDP/DBD reactor 10 via a process gas fluid line
      304. A process gas flow meter 306 is installed along the process
      gas fluid line 304 to monitor the flow of process gas to the
      SDP/DBD reactor 10. Also, an injection/extraction gas supply 308
      is connected to the SDP/DBD reactor 10 via an injection/extraction
      gas fluid line 310. An injection/extraction gas flow meter 312 is
      installed along the injection/extraction gas fluid line 310 to
      monitor the flow of injection/extraction gas to the reactor 10. It
      can be appreciated that the process gas supply 302 is connected to
      the process gas inlet 40 (FIG. 2) and the injection/extraction gas
      supply 308 is connected to the injection/extraction gas inlet 36
      (FIG. 2). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As further shown in FIG. 10, a power
      supply 314, e.g., an AC power supply, is connected to the SDP/DBD
      reactor 10 via a high voltage (HV) transformer 316. Moreover, an
      oscilloscope 318 is also connected to the SDP/DBD reactor 10 and
      can be used to monitor the current and voltage of the signal that
      is applied to the SDP/DBD reactor 10 in order to create the
      nonthermal electrical microdischarges that are necessary to modify
      the process gas flowing through the reactor 10. FIG. 10 also shows
      that the SDP/DBD reactor 10 can be connected to an outlet manifold
      320 by a modified gas fluid line 322 that provides modified gas to
      the manifold 320. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Accordingly, it can be seen that this
      invention provides a means for effectively destroying air
      pollutants or undesirable chemicals or biological agents in a
      process gas, e.g., a polluted or contaminated gas. This invention
      can also effectively synthesize chemical compounds by adding
      useful chemical ions to a process gas. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A greater variety of active species,
      including various free radicals, can be achieved and accompanied
      by greater effective active species yields (number per unit
      energy). Moreover, certain chemical additives can create more
      homogeneous dielectric barrier discharges. With a more homogeneous
      discharge, the active species/radicals are spread over a larger
      volume and have lower peak concentrations, so there is less
      competition from radical-radical interactions which tend to reduce
      the concentrations of active species. Therefore, more active
      species survive to react with entrained pollutants or feed gas
      species. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It can be understood that various
      "active" and "inactive" regions can be established within the
      reactor using segmented electrodes (some of which can be injectors
      with variable injection/extraction gas hole sizes). The results
      include variable pump power, i.e., specific energy deposition,
      over different reactor spatial regions which further results in
      better control over the plasma chemistry because some chemical
      reactions are favored in "inactive" regions or vice-versa. It is
      also to be understood that the device can be used over a wide
      range of process gas pressures, e.g., a millitorr to a few
      atmospheres. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Although the description above
      contains many details, these should not be construed as limiting
      the scope of the invention but as merely providing illustrations
