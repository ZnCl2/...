      <br>
      ANN ARBOR — Arginine, a common amino acid found naturally in
      foods, breaks down dental plaque, which could help millions of
      people avoid cavities and gum disease, researchers at the
      University of Michigan and Newcastle University have discovered.<br>
      <br>
      Alexander Rickard, assistant professor of epidemiology at the U-M
      School of Public Health, and colleagues, discovered that in the
      lab L-arginine—found in red meat, poultry, fish and dairy
      products, and is already used in dental products for tooth
      sensitivity—stopped the formation of dental plaque.<br>
      <br>
      "This is important as bacteria like to aggregate on surfaces to
      form biofilms. Dental plaque is a biofilm," Rickard said.
      "Biofilms account for more than 50 percent of all hospital
      infections. Dental plaque biofilms contribute to the billions of
      dollars of dental treatments and office visits every year in the
      United States."<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Dental biofilms are the culprits in the formation of dental caries
      (cavities), gingivitis and periodontal disease. Surveys indicate
      that nearly 24 percent of adults in the United States have
      untreated dental caries, and about 39 percent have
      moderate-to-severe periodontitis, a number that rises to 64
      percent for those over age 65.<br>
      <br>
      Most methods for dental plaque control involve use of
      antimicrobial agents, such as chlorhexidine, which are chemicals
      aimed at killing plaque bacteria, but they can affect sense of
      taste and stain teeth. Antimicrobial treatments have been the
      subject of debate about overuse in recent years.<br>
      <br>
      Pending further clinical trials to verify their lab findings, the
      researchers said L-arginine could take the place of the current
      plaque-controlling biocide substances including chlorhexidine and
      other antimicrobials.<br>
      <br>
      "At present, around 10-to-15 percent of adults in the Western
      world have advanced periodontitis, which can lead to loose teeth
      and even the loss of teeth. Therefore, there is a clear need for
      better methods to control dental plaque," said Nick Jakubovics, a
      lecturer at Newcastle University's School of Dental Sciences.<br>
      <br>
      Their findings are reported in the current issue of PLOS ONE.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanism for how L-arginine causes the disintegration of the
      biofilms needs further study, the researchers said. It appears
      arginine can change how cells stick together, and can trigger
      bacteria within biofilms to alter how they behave so that they no
      longer stick to surfaces, they said.<br>
      <br>
      In conducting their research, team members used a model system
      they introduced in 2013 that mimics the oral cavity. The
      researchers were able to grow together the numerous bacterial
      species found in dental plaque in the laboratory, using natural
      human saliva.<br>
      <br>
      "Other laboratory model systems use one or a small panel of
      species," Rickard said. "Dental plaque biofilms can contain tens
      to hundreds of species, hence our model better mimics what occurs
      in the mouth, giving us great research insight."<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The amino acid L-arginine inhibits bacterial coaggregation, is
      involved in cell-cell signaling, and alters bacterial metabolism
      in a broad range of species present in the human oral cavity.
      Given the range of effects of L-arginine on bacteria, we
      hypothesized that L-arginine might alter multi-species oral
      biofilm development and cause developed multi-species biofilms to
      disassemble. Because of these potential biofilm-destabilizing
      effects, we also hypothesized that L-arginine might enhance the
      efficacy of antimicrobials that normally cannot rapidly penetrate
      biofilms. A static microplate biofilm system and a controlled-flow
      microfluidic system were used to develop multi-species oral
      biofilms derived from pooled unfiltered cell-containing saliva
      (CCS) in pooled filter-sterilized cell-free saliva (CFS) at 37oC.
      The addition of pH neutral L-arginine monohydrochloride (LAHCl) to
      CFS was found to exert negligible antimicrobial effects but
      significantly altered biofilm architecture in a
      concentration-dependent manner. Under controlled flow, the
      biovolume of biofilms (µm3/µm2) developed in saliva containing
      100-500 mM LAHCl were up to two orders of magnitude less than when
      developed without LAHCI. Culture-independent community analysis
      demonstrated that 500 mM LAHCl substantially altered biofilm
      species composition: the proportion of Streptococcus and
      Veillonella species increased and the proportion of Gram-negative
      bacteria such as Neisseria and Aggregatibacter species was
      reduced. Adding LAHCl to pre-formed biofilms also reduced
      biovolume, presumably by altering cell-cell interactions and
      causing cell detachment. Furthermore, supplementing 0.01%
      cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), an antimicrobial commonly used for
      the treatment of dental plaque, with 500 mM LAHCl resulted in
      greater penetration of CPC into the biofilms and significantly
      greater killing compared to a non-supplemented 0.01% CPC solution.
      Collectively, this work demonstrates that LAHCl moderates
      multi-species oral biofilm development and community composition
      and enhances the activity of CPC. The incorporation of LAHCl into
      oral healthcare products may be useful for enhanced biofilm
      control.<br>

      Inventor: RICKARD ALEXANDER, et al.<br>
      <br>
      The present disclosure relates to compositions and methods for
      destabilizing biofilms, altering biofilm 3D structure, and
      dispersing biofilms, in order to enhance biofilm cell removal
      and/or sensitivity to other agents (e.g., environmental or
      co-applied treatments). In particular, the present disclosure
      relates to the use of L-arginine in the removal and/or
      sensitization (e.g., to antimicrobials) of microorganisms in
      medical, industrial, domestic, or environmental applications, as
      well as treatment of bacterial infections (e.g., in biofilms).<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A biofilm is a well-organized community of microorganisms that
      adheres to surfaces and is embedded in slimy extracellular
      polymeric substances (EPSs). EPS is a complex mixture of
      high-molecular-mass polymers (&gt; 10,000 Da) generated by the
      bacterial cells, cell lysis and hydrolysis products, and organic
      matter adsorbed from the substrate. EPSs are involved in the
      establishment of stable arrangements of microorganisms in biofilms<br>
      <br>
      (Wolfaardt et al. (1998) Microb. Ecol. 35:213-223; herein
      incorporated by reference in its entirety), and extracellular DN A
      (eDNA) is one of the major components of EPSs (Flemming et al.
      (2001) Water Sci. Technol. 43:9-16; Spoering et al. (2006) Curr.
      Opin. Microbiol. 9: 133-137; each herein incorporated by reference
      in its entirety). Bacteria living in a biofilm usually have
      significantly different properties from free-floating (planktonic)
      bacteria of the same species, as the dense and protected
      environment of the film allows them to cooperate and interact in
      various ways. One benefit of this environment is increased
      resistance to detergents and antibiotics, as the dense
      extracellular matrix and the outer layer of cells protect the
      interior of the community. In some cases antibiotic resistance can
      be increased a thousand-fold (Stewart et al. (2001) Lancet 358:
      135-138; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).
      Biofilms can be formed in various bacterial species (e.g.,
      Acinetobacter sp. (e.g., A. baylyi, A. baumannii), Staphylococcus
      aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Escherichia coli (e.g., E.
      coli K-12). The formation of biofilms by such species is a major
      determinant of medical outcome during the course of colonization
      or infection. For example, Acinetobacter spp. frequently colonize
      patients in clinical settings through formation of biofilms on
      ventilator tubing, on skin and wound sites, medical tubing, and
      the like, and are a common cause of nosocomial pneumonia.<br>
      <br>
      As biofilms are complex structures formed of various elements,
      their removal or disruption traditionally requires the use of
      dispersants, surfactants, detergents, enzyme formulations,
      antibiotics, biocides, boil-out procedures, corrosive chemicals,
      mechanical cleaning, use of antimicrobial agents, inhibiting
      microbial attachment, inhibiting biofilm growth by removing
      essential nutrients and promoting biomass detachment and
      degradation of biofilm matrix (Chen XS, P.S.: Biofilm removal
      caused by chemical treatments. Water Res 2000;34:4229-4233; herein
      incorporated by reference in its entirety). However, such
      classical removal or disruption methods are not efficacious or
      feasible in all situations where biofilm formation is undesirable.<br>
      <br>
      Additional methods for undesirable bacteria in biofilms are
      needed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present disclosure relates to compositions and methods for
      destabilizing biofilms, altering biofilm 3D structure, and
      dispersing biofilms, in order to enhance biofilm cell removal
      and/or sensitivity to other agents (e.g., environmental or
      co-applied treatments). In particular, the present disclosure
      relates to the use of L-arginine in the removal and/or
      sensitization (e.g., to antimicrobials) of microorganisms in
      medical, industrial, domestic, or environmental applications, as
      well as treatment of bacterial infections (e.g., in biofilms).<br>
      <br>
      Embodiments of the present invention provide compositions (e.g.,
      pharmaceutical, commercial, health care, etc.), systems, uses, and
      methods that result in one or more of: inducing cell-damage,
      killing cells, disrupting intra-cellular processes leading to<br>
      <br>
      deregulation/loss of homeostasis, disrupting cell-cell adhesion,
      inducing three dimensional rearrangement of architecture,
      disrupting cell-cell signaling, disrupting cell-cell metabolic
      interactions, disrupting adhesion to surfaces, reducing the
      pathogenic potential of biofilms, reducing biofilm mass,
      decreasing the proportion of pathogenic bacteria in a biofilm,
      increasing the proportion of beneficial bacteria in a biofilm, or
      preventing growth of a microorganism in a biofilm, comprising:
      contacting bacteria in a biofilm with cell-free L- arginine at a
      concentration of at least 1 mM, wherein the contacting kills or
      inhibits the growth of microorganisms and/or alters the 3D
      arrangement of the cells in the biofilm, which can damage bacteria
      by preventing them from interacting with others and/or exposing
      them to deleterious environmental effects. In some embodiments,
      the microorganism is a bacterium. In some embodiments, the
      bacteria are in a coaggregate. In some embodiments, the biofilm is
      a dental biofilm. In some embodiments, the bacteria are in a
      coaggregate or biofilm with a plurality of different bacterial
      species (e.g., of Streptococcus and Actinomyces, such as, for
      example, S. gordonii and A. oris). In some embodiments, the
      L-arginine prevents coaggregation or promotes
      de-adhesion/dispersion of said bacteria. In some embodiments, the
      L-arginine is present at a concentration of at least 1 mM (e.g.,
      at least 10 mM, at least 50 mM, at least 100 mM, 200 mM, at least
      250 mM, at least 300 mM, at least 350 mM, at least 400 mM, at
      least 450 mM, at least 500 mM, at least 600 mM, at least 700 mM,
      at least 800 mM, at least 900 mM, or at least 1 M). In some
      embodiments, the bacteria are in multi- species oral biofilms
      (e.g., dental plaque in saliva). In some embodiments, L-arginine
      disrupts biofilms grown in saliva without antimicrobial activity.
      In some embodiments, the method further comprises contacting the
      bacteria with cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC).<br>
      <br>
      Additional embodiments comprise the use of a composition
      comprising L-arginine at a concentration of at least 1 mM to
      induce one or more of: inducing microbial cell-damage, killing
      cells, disrupting intra-cellular processes leading to
      deregulation/loss of homeostasis, disrupting cell-cell adhesion,
      inducing three dimensional rearrangement of architecture,
      disrupting cell-cell signaling, disrupting cell-cell metabolic
      interactions, disrupting adhesion to surfaces, reducing the
      pathogenic potential of biofilms, reducing biofilm mass,
      decreasing the proportion of pathogenic bacteria in a biofilm,
      increasing the proportion of beneficial bacteria in a biofilm, or
      preventing growth of a microorganism in a biofilm. In some
      embodiments, the composition further comprises at cetylpyridinium
      chloride (CPC).<br>
      <br>
      Further embodiments provide a plasmid that reports expression or
      concentration of a component of a biofilm or planktonic cell
      population, where the plasmid comprises either a first marker
      under the control of a constitutive promoter or a second marker
      under the control of a promoter induced by the component. In some
      embodiments, the marker is a fluorescent marker (e.g., GFP or
      Mcherry). In some embodiments, the first promoter is a
      streptococcal ribosomal promoter (e.g., a S. gordonii DL1 50S
      ribosomal protein (SGO l 192) promoter). In some embodiments, the
      second promoter is S. gordonii catabolite control protein A (SGO
      0773), or S. gordonii argC or arcA promoter.<br>
      <br>
      Additional embodiments provide a streptococcal cell (e.g., S.
      gordonii) comprising the plasmid. In some embodiments, the cell is
      in a biofilm.<br>
      <br>
      Some embodiments provide methods and uses of monitoring
      concentration of a component (e.g., arginine or AI-2) of a biofilm
      or planktonic cell culture, comprising: a) contacting a
      streptococcal cell with the plasmid described herein; and b)
      measuring the level of the marker. In some embodiments, the level
      of expression of the marker is correlated to the level of the
      component. In some embodiments, the method further comprises the
      step of contacting the cell with a test compound (e.g. a drug that
      kills or inhibits or is suspected of killing or inhibiting the
      growth of the cell).<br>
      <br>
      Additional embodiments are described herein.<br>

      </b><b>DEFINITIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a number
      of terms and phrases are defined below:<br>
      <br>
      As used herein the term "biofilm" refers to any three-dimensional,
      (e.g., matrix- encased) microbial community displaying
      multicellular characteristics. Accordingly, as used herein, the
      term biofilm includes surface-associated biofilms as well as
      biofilms in suspension, such as floes and granules. Biofilms may
      comprise a single microbial species or may be mixed species
      complexes, and may include bacteria as well as fungi, algae,
      protozoa, or other microorganisms. In some embodiments, biofilms
      comprise coaggregating organisms. In some embodiments, biofilms
      comprise a single organism or multiple organisms that do not
      coaggregate.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "host cell" refers to any eukaryotic or
      prokaryotic cell (e.g., bacterial cells such as E. coli, yeast
      cells, mammalian cells, avian cells, amphibian cells, plant cells,
      fish cells, and insect cells), whether located in vitro or in
      vivo. For example, host cells may be located in a transgenic
      animal.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "prokaryotes" refers to a group of
      organisms that usually lack a cell nucleus or any other
      membrane-bound organelles. In some embodiments, prokaryotes are
      bacteria. The term "prokaryote" includes both archaea and
      eubacteria.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "subject" refers to individuals {e.g.,
      human, animal, or other organism) to be treated by the methods or
      compositions of the present invention. Subjects include, but are
      not limited to, mammals {e.g., murines, simians, equines, bovines,
      porcines, canines, felines, and the like), and most preferably
      includes humans. In the context of the invention, the term
      "subject" generally refers to an individual who will receive or
      who has received treatment for a condition characterized by the
      presence of bio film-forming bacteria, or in anticipation of
      possible exposure to biofilm-forming bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein the term, "in vitro" refers to an artificial
      environment and to processes or reactions that occur within an
      artificial environment. In vitro environments include, but are not
      limited to, test tubes and cell cultures. The term "in vivo"
      refers to the natural environment {e.g. , an animal or a cell) and
      to processes or reaction that occur within a natural environment.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "virulence" refers to the degree of
      pathogenicity of a microorganism (e.g., bacteria or fungus), e.g.,
      as indicated by the severity of the disease produced or its
      ability to invade the tissues of a subject. It is generally
      measured experimentally by the median lethal dose (LD50) or median
      infective dose (ID50). The term may also be used to refer to the
      competence of any infectious agent to produce pathologic effects.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to the amount
      of a composition (e.g., a composition comprising L-arginine)
      sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results. An effective
      amount can be administered in one or more administrations,
      applications or dosages and is not intended to be limited to a
      particular formulation or administration route. In some
      embodiments, the effective amount is at least 1 mM (e.g., 10 mM,
      50 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM, 400 mM, 500 mM, 750 mM, 1000 mM or
      more).<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "administration" refers to the act of
      giving a drug, prodrug, or other agent, or therapeutic treatment
      (e.g., compositions comprising L-arginine) to a physiological
      system (e.g., a subject or in vivo, in vitro, or ex vivo cells,
      tissues, and organs). Exemplary routes of administration to the
      human body can be through the eyes (ophthalmic), mouth (oral),
      skin (transdermal), nose (nasal), lungs (inhalant), oral mucosa
      (buccal), ear, by injection (e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously,
      intratumorally, intraperitoneally, etc.), topical administration
      and the like.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "treating a surface" refers to the act of
      exposing a surface to one or more compositions comprising
      L-arginine. Methods of treating a surface include, but are not
      limited to, spraying, misting, submerging, and coating.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "co -administration" refers to the
      administration of at least two agent(s) (e.g. , L-arginine in
      combination with an antimicrobial agent) or therapies to a
      subject. In some embodiments, the co-administration of two or more
      agents or therapies is concurrent. In other embodiments, a first
      agent/therapy is administered prior to a second agent/therapy.
      Those of skill in the art understand that the formulations and/or
      routes of administration of the various agents or therapies used
      may vary. The appropriate dosage for co-administration can be
      readily determined by one skilled in the art. In some embodiments,
      when agents or therapies are co -administered, the respective
      agents or therapies are administered at lower dosages than
      appropriate for their administration alone. Thus, coadministration
      is especially desirable in embodiments where the co-administration
      of the agents or therapies lowers the requisite dosage of a
      potentially harmful (e.g., toxic) agent(s).<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "wound" refers broadly to injuries to
      tissue including the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, bone, and
      other structures initiated in different ways, for example,
      surgery, (e.g., open post cancer resection wounds, including but
      not limited to, removal of melanoma and breast cancer etc.),
      contained post-operative surgical wounds, pressure sores (e.g.,
      from extended bed rest) and wounds induced by trauma. As used
      herein, the term "wound" is used without limitation to the cause
      of the wound, be it a physical cause such as bodily positioning as
      in bed sores or impact as with trauma or a biological cause such
      as disease process, aging process, obstetric process, or any other
      manner of biological process. Wounds caused by pressure may also
      be classified into one of four grades depending on the depth of
      the wound: i) Grade I: wounds limited to the epidermis; ii) Grade
      II: wounds extending into the dermis; iii) Grade III: wounds
      extending into the subcutaneous tissue; and iv) Grade IV: wounds
      wherein bones are exposed (e.g., a bony pressure point such as the
      greater trochanter or the sacrum). The term "partial thickness
      wound" refers to wounds that are limited to the epidermis and
      dermis; a wound of any etiology may be partial thickness. The term
      "full thickness wound" is meant to include wounds that extend
      through the dermis.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, "wound site" refers broadly to the anatomical
      location of a wound, without limitation.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "dressing" refers broadly to any material
      applied to a wound for protection, absorbance, drainage,
      treatment, etc. Numerous types of dressings are commercially
      available, including films (e.g., polyurethane films),
      hydrocoUoids (hydrophilic colloidal particles bound to
      polyurethane foam), hydrogels (cross-linked polymers containing
      about at least 60% water), foams (hydrophilic or hydrophobic),
      calcium alginates (nonwoven composites of fibers from calcium
      alginate), and cellophane (cellulose with a plasticizer) (Kannon
      and Garrett (1995) Dermatol. Surg. 21 : 583-590; Davies (1983)
      Burns 10: 94; each herein incorporated by reference). The present
      invention also contemplates the use of dressings impregnated with
      pharmacological compounds (e.g., antibiotics, antiseptics,
      thrombin, analgesic compounds, etc). Cellular wound dressings
      include commercially available materials such as Apligraf®,

      As used herein, the term "toxic" refers to any detrimental or
      harmful effects on a subject, a cell, or a tissue as compared to
      the same cell or tissue prior to the administration of the
      toxicant.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "pharmaceutical composition" refers to
      the combination of an active agent {e.g., L-arginine) with a
      carrier, inert or active, making the composition especially
      suitable for diagnostic or therapeutic use in vitro, in vivo or ex
      vivo. The terms "pharmaceutically acceptable" or
      "pharmacologically acceptable," as used herein, refer to
      compositions that do not substantially produce adverse reactions,
      e.g., toxic, allergic, or immunological reactions, when
      administered to a subject.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "topically" refers to application of the
      compositions of the present invention to the surface of the skin
      and mucosal cells and tissues {e.g., alveolar, buccal, lingual,
      masticatory, or nasal mucosa, and other tissues and cells which
      line hollow organs or body cavities).<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier"
      refers to any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers including,
      but not limited to, phosphate buffered saline solution, water,
      emulsions {e.g., such as an oil/water or water/oil emulsions), and

      <br>
      As used herein, the term "therapeutic agent," refers to
      compositions that decrease the infectivity, morbidity, or onset of
      mortality in a subject (e.g., a subject contacted by a biofilm-
      forming microorganism) or that prevent infectivity, morbidity, or
      onset of mortality in a host contacted by a biofilm- forming
      microorganism. As used herein, therapeutic agents encompass agents
      used prophylactically, e.g. , in the absence of a bio film-
      forming organism, in view of possible future exposure to a bio
      film-forming organism. Such agents may additionally comprise
      pharmaceutically acceptable compounds {e.g. , adjuvants,
      excipients, stabilizers, diluents, and the like). In some
      embodiments, the therapeutic agents of the present invention are
      administered in the form of topical compositions, injectable
      compositions, ingestible compositions, and the like. When the
      route is topical, the form may be, for example, a solution, cream,
      ointment, salve or spray.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "pathogen" refers to a biological agent
      that causes a disease state {e.g., infection, cancer, etc.) in a
      host. "Pathogens" include, but are not limited to, viruses,
      bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoans, mycoplasma, prions, and
      parasitic organisms.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "microbe" refers to a microorganism and
      is intended to encompass both an individual organism, or a
      preparation comprising any number of the organisms.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "microorganism" refers to any species or
      type of microorganism, including but not limited to, bacteria,
      archaea, fungi, protozoans, mycoplasma, and parasitic organisms.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "fungi" is used in reference to
      eukaryotic organisms such as the molds and yeasts, including
      dimorphic fungi.<br>
      <br>
      The terms "bacteria" and "bacterium" refer to all prokaryotic
      organisms, including those within all of the phyla in the Kingdom
      Procaryotae. It is intended that the term encompass all
      microorganisms considered to be bacteria including Mycoplasma,
      Chlamydia, Actinomyces, Streptomyces, and Rickettsia. All forms of
      bacteria are included within this definition including cocci,
      bacilli, spirochetes, spheroplasts, protoplasts, etc. Also
      included within this term are prokaryotic organisms that are
      Gram-negative or Gram-positive. "Gram- negative" and
      "Gram-positive" refer to staining patterns with the Gram-staining
      process, which is well known in the art. (See e.g., Finegold and
      Martin, Diagnostic Microbiology, 6th Ed., CV Mosby St. Louis, pp.
      13-15 (1982)). "Gram-positive bacteria" are bacteria that retain
      the primary dye used in the Gram-stain, causing the stained cells
      to generally appear dark blue to purple under the microscope.
      "Gram-negative bacteria" do not retain the primary dye used in the
      Gram-stain, but are stained by the counterstain. Thus,
      Gram-negative bacteria generally appear red.<br>
      <br>
      The term "non-pathogenic bacteria" or "non-pathogenic bacterium"
      includes all known and unknown non-pathogenic bacterium
      (Gram-positive or Gram-negative) and any pathogenic bacterium that
      has been mutated or converted to a non-pathogenic bacterium.
      Furthermore, a skilled artisan recognizes that some bacteria may
      be pathogenic to specific species and non-pathogenic to other
      species; thus, these bacteria can be utilized in the species in
      which it is non-pathogenic or mutated so that it is
      non-pathogenic.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "non-human animals" refers to all

      transformed cell lines, finite cell lines (e.g., non-transformed
      cells), bacterial cultures in or on solid or liquid media, and any
      other cell population maintained in vitro.<br>
      <br>
      The term "coating" as used herein refers to a layer of material
      covering, e.g., a medical device or a portion thereof. A coating
      can be applied to the surface or impregnated within the material
      of the implant.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "antimicrobial agent" refers to
      composition that decreases, prevents or inhibits the growth of
      bacterial and/or fungal organisms. Examples of antimicrobial
      agents include, e.g., antibiotics and antiseptics.<br>
      <br>
      The term "antiseptic" as used herein is defined as an
      antimicrobial substance that inhibits the action of
      microorganisms, including but not limited to a-terpineol,
      methylisothiazolone, cetylpyridinium chloride, chloroxyleneol,
      hexachlorophene,<br>

      iodine and iodophores, triclosan, taurinamides, nitrofurantoin,
      methenamine, aldehydes, azylic acid, silver, benzyl peroxide,
      alcohols, and carboxylic acids and salts. One skilled in the art
      is cognizant that these antiseptics can be used in combinations of
      two or more to obtain a synergistic or additive effect. Some
      examples of combinations of antiseptics include a mixture of
      chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol, chlorhexidine and
      methylisothiazolone, chlorhexidine and (a-terpineol,
      methylisothiazolone and a-terpineol; thymol and chloroxylenol;

      spectrum of activity against a wide variety of organisms.<br>
      <br>
      The term "antibiotics" as used herein is defined as a substance
      that inhibits the growth of microorganisms, preferably without
      damage to the host. For example, the antibiotic may inhibit cell
      wall synthesis, protein synthesis, nucleic acid synthesis, or
      alter cell membrane function.<br>

      <br>
      As used herein, the term "sample" is used in its broadest sense.
      In one sense, it is meant to include a specimen or culture
      obtained from any source, as well as biological and environmental
      samples. Biological samples may be obtained from animals
      (including humans) and encompass fluids, solids, tissues, and
      gases. Biological samples include blood products, such as plasma,
      serum and the like. Such examples are not however to be construed

      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present disclosure relates to compositions and methods for
      destabilizing biofilms, altering biofilm 3D structure, and
      dispersing biofilms, in order to enhance biofilm cell removal
      and/or sensitivity to other agents (e.g., environmental or
      co-applied treatments). In particular, the present disclosure
      relates to the use of L-arginine in the removal and/or
      sensitization (e.g., to antimicrobials) of microorganisms in
      medical, industrial, domestic, or environmental applications, as
      well as treatment of bacterial infections (e.g., in biofilms).<br>
      <br>
      A biofilm is an aggregate of microorganisms in which cells adhere
      to each other and/or to a surface. These adherent cells are
      frequently embedded within a self-produced matrix of extracellular
      polymeric substance (EPS). Biofilm EPS, also referred to as slime,
      is a polymeric conglomeration generally composed of extracellular
      DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides in various configurations and
      of various compositions. Biofilms may form on living or non-living
      surfaces, and represent a prevalent mode of microbial life in
      natural, industrial and clinical settings. The microbial cells
      growing in a biofilm are physiologically distinct from planktonic
      cells of the same organism, which, by contrast, are single cells
      that may float or swim in a liquid medium.<br>
      <br>
      Microbial biofilms form in response to many factors including but
      not limited to cellular recognition of specific or non-specific
      attachment sites on a surface, nutritional cues, or in some cases,
      by exposure of planktonic cells to sub-inhibitory concentrations
      of antibiotics. When a cell switches to the biofilm mode of
      growth, it undergoes a phenotypic shift in behavior in which large
      suites of genes are differentially regulated (Petrova et al., J.
      Bacteriol. 2012 May;194(10):2413-25; Stoodley et al, Annu Rev
      Microbiol. 2002;56: 187- 209).<br>
      <br>
      Although the present invention is not limited by any type of
      biofilm, biofilm formation typically begins with the attachment of
      free-floating microorganisms to a surface. These first colonists
      adhere to the surface initially through weak, reversible Van der
      Waals forces. If the colonists are not immediately separated from
      the surface, they can anchor themselves more permanently using
      cell adhesion structures such as pili.<br>
      <br>
      Initial colonists commonly facilitate the arrival of other cells
      by providing more diverse adhesion sites and beginning to build
      the matrix that holds the biofilm together. Some species are not
      able to attach to a surface on their own but are often able to
      anchor themselves to the matrix or directly to earlier colonists.
      It is during this colonization that the cells are able to
      communicate via quorum sensing, for example, using such compounds
      as N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL). Once colonization initiates,
      the biofilm grows through a combination of cell division and
      recruitment. The final stage of biofilm formation is known as
      development although herein the terms "formation" and
      "development" are used interchangeably. In this final stage, the
      biofilm is established and may only change in shape and size. The
      development of a biofilm may allow for an aggregate cell colony
      (or colonies) to be increasingly antibiotic resistant.<br>
      <br>
      Dispersal of cells from the biofilm colony is an essential stage
      of the biofilm lifecycle.<br>
      <br>
      Dispersal enables bio films to spread and colonize new surfaces.
      Enzymes that degrade the biofilm extracellular matrix, such as
      dispersin B and deoxyribonuclease, may play a role in biofilm
      dispersal (Whitchurch et al. (2002) Science 295: 1487; herein
      incorporated by reference in its entirety). Biofilm matrix
      degrading enzymes may be useful as anti-biofilm agents (Kaplan et
      al. (2004) Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 48 (7): 2633-6;
      Xavier et al. (2005) Microbiology 151 (Pt 12): 3817-32; each
      herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). A fatty acid
      messenger, cis-2-decenoic acid, can induce dispersion and inhibit
      growth of biofilm colonies. Secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      this compound induces dispersion in several species of bacteria
      and the yeast Candida albicans (Davies et al. (2009) Journal of
      Bacteriology 191 (5): 1393-403; herein incorporated by reference
      in its entirety).<br>
      <br>
      Biofilms are ubiquitous and are usually found on solid substrates
      submerged in or exposed to some aqueous solution, although they
      can form as floating mats on liquid surfaces and also on the
      surface of leaves, particularly in high humidity climates. Given
      sufficient resources for growth, a biofilm will quickly grow to be
      macroscopic. Many types of microbes can form biofilms, e.g.,
      bacteria, archaea, protozoa, fungi and algae. Biofilms may
      comprise a single type of microbe (monospecies biofilms), or,
      commonly, multiple types. In some mixed species biofilms, each
      group performs specialized metabolic functions.<br>
      <br>
      Biofilms form in environments including but not limited to:
      substrates (e.g., rocks, pebbles) in natural bodies of water
      (e.g., rivers, pools, streams, oceans, springs); extreme
      environments (e.g., hot springs including waters with extremely
      acidic or extremely alkaline pH; frozen glaciers); residential and
      industrial settings in which solid surfaces are exposed to liquid
      (e.g., showers, water and sewage pipes, floors and counters in
      food preparation or processing areas, water-cooling systems,
      marine engineering systems); hulls and interiors of marine
      vessels; sewage and water treatment facilities (e.g., water
      filters, pipes, holding tanks); contaminated waters; within or
      upon living organisms (e.g., dental plaque, surface colonization
      or infection of e.g., skin, surfaces of tissues or organs or body
      cavities or at wound sites; plant epidermis, interior of plants);
      on the inert surfaces of implanted devices such as catheters,
      prosthetic cardiac valves, artificial joints, and intrauterine
      devices; and the like.<br>
      <br>
      Biofilms are involved in a wide variety of microbial infections in
      the body. Infectious processes in which biofilms have been
      implicated include but are not limited to urinary tract
      infections, catheter infections, middle-ear infections, formation
      of dental plaque and gingivitis, contact lens contamination
      (Imamura et al. (2008) Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 52
      (1): 171-82; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety),
      and less common but more lethal processes such as endocarditis,
      infections in cystic fibrosis, and infections of permanent
      indwelling devices such as joint prostheses and heart valves
      (Lewis et al. (2001) Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 45 (4):
      999-1007; Parsek et al. (2003) Annual Review of Microbiology 57:
      677-701; each herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).
      Bacterial biofilms may impair cutaneous wound healing and reduce
      topical antibacterial efficiency in healing or treating infected
      skin wounds (Davis et al. (2008) Wound Repair and Regeneration 16
      (1): 23-9; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).<br>
      <br>
      Coaggregation is the highly specific recognition and adhesion of
      genetically distinct bacteria mediated by complementary protein
      adhesins and polysaccharide receptors on the cell surface of
      coaggregating cells (Kolenbrander, Annu Rev Microbiol 54, 413-437,
      2000; Rickard et al., Trends Microbiol 11, 94-100, 2003a). This
      phenomenon is distinct from autoaggregation, which is the
      recognition and adhesion of genetically identical bacteria to one
      another (Khemaleelakul et al. , J Endod 32, 312-318, 2006; Rickard
      et al. , FEMS<br>
      <br>
      Microbiol Lett 220, 133-140, 2003b; Van Houdt &amp; Michiels, Res
      Microbiol 156, 626-633, 2005). Coaggregation was first described
      between human dental plaque bacteria in 1970 (Gibbons &amp;
      Nygaard, Arch Oral Biol 15, 1397-1400, 1970), and work over the
      last two decades has shown that it also occurs between bacteria
      isolated from the human gut, the human urogenital tract, in
      wastewater floes, and freshwater biofilms (Ledder et al. , FEMS
      Microbiol Ecol 66, 630-636, 2008; Phuong et al, J Biotechnol,
      2011; Reid et al, Can J Microbiol 34, 344-351, 1988; Rickard et
      al, Appl Environ Microbiol 66, 431-434, 2000; Simoes et al, Appl
      Environ Microbiol 74, 1259-1263, 2008). Coaggregation has also
      been shown to occur among numerous taxonomically distinct
      freshwater species (Rickard et al , Appl Environ Microbiol 68,
      3644-3650, 2002; Rickard et al, 2003b, supra; Rickard et al, Appl
      Environ Microbiol 70, 7426-7435, 2004b; Simoes et al, Appl Environ
      Microbiol 74, 1259-1263, 2008) and in planktonic and biofilm
      populations (Rickard et al , J Appl Microbiol 96, 1367-1373,
      2004a). Studies of coaggregation between Sphingomonas
      (Blastomonas) natatoria and Micrococcus luteus demonstrated that
      the ability of a species to coaggregate alters dual-species
      biofilm development in both flowing and static environments (Min
      &amp; Rickard, Appl Environ Microbiol 75, 3987-3997, 2009; Min et
      al, Biofouling 26, 931-940, 2010). Coaggregation may mediate
      biofilm development, architectural changes, and alterations in the
      species composition (Hojo et al, J Dent Res 88, 982-990, 2009;<br>
      <br>
      Kolenbrander et al, Periodontal 2000 42, 47-79, 2006; Rickard et
      al, 2003a, supra). In addition, coaggregation may play a role in
      promoting or hindering the integration of pathogenic species into
      freshwater biofilms (Buswell et al, Appl Environ Microbiol 64,
      733- 741, 1998). Evidence to support such a possibility can be
      found in studies of dental plaque biofilms where coaggregation has
      been indicated to promote the integration of oral pathogens such
      as Porphyromonas gingivalis (Kolenbrander et al, Periodontal 2000
      42, 47-79, 2006; Whitmore &amp; Lamont, Mol Microbiol 81, 305-314,
      2011).<br>
      <br>
      Dental plaque is composed of hundreds of species of bacteria that
      can collectively cause oral and systemic diseases (Jakubovics et
      al, Oral diseases. 2010;16(8):729-39; Kuo et al, Public Health.
      2008;122(4):417-33.). During dental plaque development, bacteria
      sense and respond to numerous exogenous bacterial- or
      environmental-derived chemicals which alter their ability to
      establish themselves within these biofilms.<br>
      <br>
      Oral biofilms cause major problems throughout both industrialized
      and developing countries. Data from recent surveys indicate that
      23.7% of US adults have untreated dental caries while 38.5% of
      adults have moderate to severe periodontitis (National Center for<br>
      <br>
      Health Statistics. Health, United States, 2011 : With Special
      Feature on Socioeconomic Status and Health. Hyattsville, MD: 2012;
      Eke et al, Journal of dental research. 2012;91(10):914- 20).
      Untreated dental caries also affects between 15-20% of children up
      to 19 years, while periodontitis is a major problem in the elderly
      population, where 64% of adults over 65 years have moderate to
      severe forms of the condition (National Center for Health
      Statistics. Health, United States, 2011 : With Special Feature on
      Socioeconomic Status and Health. Hyattsville, MD: 2012; Eke et al,
      Journal of dental research. 2012;91(10):914-20). Clearly, new
      methods for controlling dental plaque-related diseases are
      urgently needed. Dental plaque is a finely balanced homeostatic
      bacterial community (Marsh et al., Periodontology 2000. 2011
      ;55(1): 16-35). Embodiments of the present invention provide a
      broad-acting intervention that alters the balance of such oral
      bacterial communities and is more effective at controlling dental
      plaque -related diseases than strategies that target individual
      species. Dental plaque contains an interactive "aware" community
      of microbes. On cleaned tooth-surfaces, dental plaque develops
      through a microbial succession (Jakubovics et al, supra;
      Kolenbrander et al, Nature reviews Microbiology. 2010;8(7):471-80;
      Kolenbrander et al., Periodontology 2000. 2006;42:47-79 23, 24).
      Initial colonizers, predominantly<br>
      <br>
      Streptococcus species, adhere to salivary pellicle and produce
      thin layers of bio film that support the integration of other
      species through coaggregation, cell-cell signalling, and
      metabolite recognition (Jakubovics et al, supra; Kolenbrander et
      al, Nature reviews<br>
      <br>
      Microbiology. 2010;8(7):471-80; Hojo et al, Journal of dental
      research. 2009;88(11):982-90; Rickard et al., Trends Microbiol.
      2003;11(2):94-100; Bowden et al., Advances in dental research.
      1997;1 l(l):81-99). Coaggregation involves specific recognition
      and adhesion between bacteria and brings different species in
      close proximity. This increases the potential to exchange
      cell-cell signalling molecules or metabolites (Kolenbrander et
      al., Nature reviews Microbiology. 2010;8(7):471-80; Hojo et al,
      supra). For example, the signalling molecule autoinducer-2
      (AI-2)mediates mutualistic growth of the coaggregating partners
      Streptococcus oralis and Actinomyces oris, and facilitates the
      development of bio films containing the coaggregating partners S.
      gordonii and S. oralis (Cuadra-Saenz et al, Microbiology.<br>
      <br>
      2012;158(Pt 7): 1783-95; Rickard et al, Molecular microbiology.
      2006;60(6): 1446-56.). Examples of important metabolites include
      hydrogen peroxide, which is produced by some streptococci, and
      inhibits other species including mutans streptococci (Zhu et al,
      Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2012;2012:717843), and lactate which is
      produced by streptococci and used by coaggregating Veillonella
      species for energy (Egland et al, Proceedings of the National<br>
      <br>
      Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 2004;
      101(48): 16917-22). Arginine is important in metabolite exchange
      (Jakubovics et al., supra) but, unlike other mechanisms of
      communication, it also disrupts coaggregation between oral
      bacteria and appears to have a major impact upon biofilm structure
      (Edwards et al., Oral microbiology and immunology.
      2007;22(4):217-24; Sato et al, J Microbiol Immunol Infect. 2012;
      Ellen et al, Oral microbiology and immunology. 1992;7(4):
      198-203.).<br>
      <br>
      Thus, arginine, although receiving limited attention to date, is a
      key global moderator of biofilm development and a pivotal
      component in the onset of caries or periodontal disease
      (Nascimento et al., Oral microbiology and immunology.
      2009;24(2):89-95). The concept of 'nutritional virulence', whereby
      bacterial systems for acquiring nutrients from the host are
      considered key factors for pathogenesis, is emerging as an
      important paradigm for infectious diseases (Abu Kwaik et al,
      Cellular microbiology. 2013;15(6):882-90). Amino acids in
      particular are often a growth-limiting resource for bacteria. Even
      when species possess all the genes required for amino acid
      biosynthesis, they may be functionally auxotrophic in certain
      conditions. For example, Staphylococcus aureus possesses the full
      genetic pathway encoding the biosynthesis of L-arginine from
      L-glutamate, yet cannot grow in vitro without L-arginine (Nuxoll
      et al, PLoS pathogens. 2012;8(1 l):el003033). Similarly, S.
      gordonii can<br>
      <br>
      biosynthesize L-arginine anaerobically but is a functional
      arginine auxotroph in aerobic conditions (Jakubovics et al.,
      supra). Oral streptococci have varied requirements for amino acids
      in vitro (Cowman et al, Applied microbiology. 1975;30(3):374-80;
      Cowman et al, Journal of dental research. 1978;57(1):48; Terleckyj
      et al, Infect Immun. 1975;11(4):656- 64), and it is not well
      understood how these nutritional deficiencies restrict growth in
      dental plaque. Early colonizing bacteria obtain most of their
      nutrients from saliva (Bowden et al., Advances in dental research.
      1997; 1 l(l):81-99). Human saliva can contain up to 40 µ? free
      arginine (Van Wuyckhuyse et al, Journal of dental research.
      1995;74(2):686-90). S. gordonii is unable to grow aerobically in
      &lt;25 µ? L-arginine (Jakubovics et al., supra). Arginine
      restriction of S. gordonii growth can be overcome by coaggregation
      with A. oris (Jakubovics et al, supra). Expression of S. gordonii
      arginine biosynthesis genes is strongly down- regulated in
      coaggregates compared with monocultures, indicating that
      coaggregation relieves low-arginine stress. Further, coaggregation
      with A. oris supported growth of S. gordonii under
      arginine-limited conditions. Therefore, inter-bacterial
      interactions are important for growth in saliva.<br>
      <br>
      <b>I. Therapeutic Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Experiments conducted during the course of development of
      embodiments of the present disclosure demonstrated that high
      concentrations of arginine abrogate biofilm formation by S.
      gordonii. Biofilm formation was highly sensitive to millimolar
      levels of arginine in a dose-dependent manner.<br>
      <br>
      Arginine concentrations in saliva are thought to stay low due to
      continuous uptake into cells and turnover by bacterial arginine
      deiaminase systems (ADS's), which catabolise arginine to ATP,
      ammonia and L-glutamine (Van Wuyckhuyse et al., Journal of dental
      research. 1995;74(2):686-90). The production of ammonia increases
      the local pH of plaque, which protects against caries (Liu et al.,
      International journal of oral science. 2012;4(3): 135- 40.). The
      ADS's of the opportunistic pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S.
      aureus are up-regulated in biofilms and these systems are
      essential to protect cells from oxygen and glycolysis-derived
      acids (39, 40). The ADS's of oral streptococci have been shown to
      influence biofilm formation in mixed-species systems, where
      removal of L-arginine by S. intermedius ADS inhibits biofilm
      formation by the periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis (Cugini et al,
      Microbiology. 2013;159(Pt 2):275-85). Production of ADS's is
      controlled at the level of transcription by ArgR/AhrC family
      regulators such as ArcR (Liu et al., Applied and environmental
      microbiology. 2008;74(16):5023-30; Zeng et al., Journal of
      bacteriology. 2006;188(3):941-9). ArcR is important for S.
      gordonii biofilm formation in nutrient-rich growth media.<br>
      <br>
      Further experiments described herein demonstrated that L-arginine
      reduces the pathogenic potential of biofilms by reducing the
      biofilm biomass and reducing the total amount and proportion of
      pathogens (e.g., without direct antimicrobial activity); and L-
      arginine augments/enhances the activity of antimicrobials such as
      CPC. This is through enhancing access of antimicrobial by
      loosening biofilm and also by altering the growth-rate of the
      bacteria; L-arginine causes cell-cell signaling dysregulation;
      L-arginine is a combinational treatment that up-regulates
      metabolism, alters cell-cell signaling, and inhibits cell-cell
      adhesion; and L-arginine increases the proportion of beneficial
      bacteria that can combat the negative effects of potential
      pathogens such as S. mutans.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention provide
      compositions (e.g., pharmaceutical or research compositions or
      kits) comprising L-arginine (e.g., alone or in combination with
      CPC) and pharmaceutical, industrial, or research methods of using
      L- arginine in the treatment and prevention of bacterial
      infections (e.g., dental plaque) and in decontamination of
      surfaces (e.g., surfaces of medical devices).<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides compositions
      and methods for using L-arginine to disrupt cell-cell interactions
      (adhesion) within a biofilm, disrupt bacterial homeostasis, induce
      cell-damage and killing, disrupt intra-cellular processes leading
      to deregulation/loss of homeostasis, disrupt cell-cell adhesion in
      biofilms, biofilm 3D rearrangement of architecture, disrupt
      cell-cell signaling, disrupt cell-cell metabolic interactions,
      and/or disrupt adhesion to surfaces. In some embodiments,
      L-arginine induces one or more of the above and these work
      individually and collectively to kill and/or reduce cell-activity
      and reduce biofilm biomass. In some embodiments, this also allows
      for improved killing with antimicrobials (e.g. L-arginine -
      antimicrobial agents or cocktails).<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the present invention provides compositions
      comprising L- arginine, alone or in combination with a
      pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or other desired delivery
      material (e.g., cleaner or disinfectant, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides compositions
      (e.g., dental care compositions such as toothpaste, mouthwash,
      etc.) comprising L-arginine in combination with e.g., CPC.<br>

      Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical
      administration may include transdermal patches, ointments,
      lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids,
      mouthwash, and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers,
      aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be
      necessary or desirable.<br>
      <br>
      Compositions and formulations for oral administration include
      powders or granules, suspensions or solutions in water or
      non-aqueous media, capsules, sachets or tablets.<br>
      <br>
      Thickeners, flavoring agents, diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing
      aids or binders may be desirable.<br>
      <br>
      Compositions and formulations for parenteral, intrathecal or
      intraventricular administration may include sterile aqueous
      solutions that may also contain buffers, diluents and other
      suitable additives such as, but not limited to, penetration
      enhancers, carrier compounds and other pharmaceutically acceptable
      carriers or excipients.<br>
      <br>
      Pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure include, but
      are not limited to, solutions, emulsions, and liposome-containing
      formulations. These compositions may be generated from a variety
      of components that include, but are not limited to, preformed
      liquids, self-emulsifying solids and self-emulsifying semisolids.<br>
      <br>
      The pharmaceutical formulations, which may conveniently be
      presented in unit dosage form, may be prepared according to
      conventional techniques well known in the pharmaceutical industry.<br>
      <br>
      The compositions may additionally contain other adjunct components
      conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions. Thus, for
      example, the compositions may contain additional, compatible,
      pharmaceutically-active materials such as, for example,
      antipruritics, astringents, local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory
      agents, or may contain additional materials useful in physically
      formulating various dosage forms of the compositions, such as
      dyes, flavoring agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opacifiers,
      thickening agents and stabilizers. However, such materials, when
      added, should not unduly interfere with the biological activities
      of the components of the compositions. The formulations can be
      sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g.,
      lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents,
      emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers,
      colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like
      which do not deleteriously interact with the active agents of the
      formulation.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition contains a)
      L-arginine, and b) one or more other agents useful in killing or
      preventing the growth of microorganisms (e.g., antibiotics) or
      impacting the growth, formation or health impact or microorganisms

      <br>
      <b>II. Screening compositions and methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Embodiments of the present disclosure provide compositions and
      methods for determining levels of biofilm components (e.g.
      arginine or AI-2) in biofilms or planktonic cells. Arginine is
      internalized by streptococci and sensed through the action of
      three different, but related, regulatory proteins: ArcR, AhrC and
      ArgR. These alter their conformation when they bind to arginine so
      that they either bind to promoter sequences or are released from
      promoters.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a
      plasmid that reports expression or concentration of a component in
      a biofilm or planktonic cell culture. In some embodiments, the
      plasmid comprises a first detectable (e.g., fluorescent) marker
      under the control of a bacterial promoter that is constitutively
      expressed or a second marker (e.g., a different color fluorescent
      label), that is induced by the component in the biofilm (e.g.,
      arginine or AI-2 present in the biofilm or cell culture). The
      present disclosure is not limited to particular promoters or
      reporter genes. Examples of fluorescent markers include, but are
      not limited to, luciferase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase,
      green fluorescent protein (GFP), or Mcherry. In some embodiments,
      the promoter is a streptococcal promoter (e.g., a promoter active
      in S. gordonii such as, e.g., S. gordonii DL1 50S ribosomal
      protein (SGO l 192), S. gordonii argC or arcA promoters, or
      catabolite control protein A (SGO 0773)). In some embodiments, the
      50S ribosomal protein promoter or other streptococcal ribosomal
      promoters or lactococcal promoters such as usp45 serve as control
      promoters for constitutive expression of the first marker. In some
      embodiments, catabolite control protein A promoter is a reporter
      of AI-2. In some embodiments, argC or arcA promoters are
      responsive to arginine.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods of
      using the plasmids described herein to monitor concentration of
      components (e.g., arginine or AI-2) of a biofilm or planktonic
      cell population (e.g., in a streptococcal spp. such as S.
      gordonii), comprising: a) contacting a streptococcal cell with the
      promoters described herein; and b) measuring the level of marker.
      In some embodiments, the level of signal from the marker under the
      control of the promoter induced by the external biofilm component
      or the constitutive promoter is compared to level of signal from
      known quantities/concentrations of the component (e.g., a standard
      curve). In some embodiments, the level of fluorescence is then be
      correlated in a fluorimeter or imaging system.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the reporter plasmids and methods find use in
      research, screening (e.g., drug screening), and diagnostic
      applications. For example, in some embodiments, test compounds
      (e.g., antimicrobial drugs) are added to a biofilm or planktonic
      cell population and the effect of the test compound on levels of
      biofilm components (e.g., arginine) is assayed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXPERIMENTAL</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following examples are provided in order to demonstrate and
      further illustrate certain preferred embodiments and aspects of
      the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting the
      scope thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Example 1 This example relates to bio films formed by single
      species of bacteria. In these systems, L-arginine has diverse
      effects on bacterial gene regulation, phenotype, metabolism and
      biofilm formation.<br>
      <br>
      Arginine sensing triggers gene regulation.<br>
      <br>
      S. gordonii contains the full genetic pathway for biosynthesis of
      L-arginine. However, like S. aureus, it is a functional arginine
      auxotroph under laboratory conditions (Jakubovics et al, supra,
      Nuxoll et al, PLoS pathogens. 2012;8(1 l):el003033). A shift from
      arginine - replete medium to arginine-deficient medium resulted in
      a marked change in phenotype of S. gordonii. In addition to genes
      previously shown to be regulated by coaggregation, there was a
      significant decrease in the expression of several
      well-characterized cell surface adhesins (Table 1). In general,
      metabolism was decreased with the exception of the arginine
      biosynthesis pathway, which was strongly up-regulated (Figure 2).
      These data are consistent with the development of a specialized
      biofilm dispersal cell state, similar to that produced by the
      dimorphic aquatic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, upon nutrient
      limitation (England et al., Journal of bacteriology.
      2010;192(3):819-33.). This example relates to biofilms formed by
      single species of bacteria. In these systems, L-arginine has
      diverse effects on bacterial gene regulation, phenotype,
      metabolism and biofilm formation.<br>
      <br>
      Biofilm formation in an environmentally germane microfluidic
      biofilm system.<br>
      <br>
      The effects of arginine-dependent dosing of S. gordonii biofilms
      is assessed in a modified Bioflux microfluidics system. Human
      saliva is collected and pooled from &gt;6 different volunteers
      (Cuadra-Saenz et al, Microbiology. 2012;158(Pt 7): 1783-95),
      diluted to 25%, and additional supplements (e.g. sucrose, haemin,
      BHI) added as required to simulate different conditions. Note, we
      grow robust biofilms in even non-supplemented saliva and pooling
      the saliva minimizes variation in salivary components. To obtain
      an indication of free arginine levels in pooled saliva, arginine
      is measured in &gt;3 different pooled saliva samples using
      standard techniques (Jakubovics et al, supra; Van Wuyckhuyse et
      al., Journal of dental research. 1995;74(2):686-90). The 24
      channels of the Bioflux system are coated with saliva, inoculated
      with monocultures of S. gordonii (or multi-species biofilms
      harvested form saliva) and biofilms are developed at 37°C with
      cell free saliva. After 20 h, cells are stained with live/dead
      stain and visualized using a Leica SPE CLSM. Biomass and
      structural biofilm parameters are quantified using COMSTAT
      (Heydorn et al., Microbiology. 2000; 146 ( Pt 10):2395-407),
      ImageJ (Collins, Biotechniques. 2007;43(1 Suppl):25-30), and
      IMARIS software (Bitplane, Switzerland). Figure 3 shows that high
      concentrations of arginine (500 mM) significantly reduce the
      extent of bio film present. Arginine and bacterial biofilm
      formation.<br>
      <br>
      Arginine has been shown to play a key role in biofilm formation
      and host colonization by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
      For example, at physiological concentrations found in cystic
      fibrosis sputum, arginine promotes P. aeruginosa biofilm formation
      (Bernier et al., Research in microbiology. 2011;162(7):680-8).
      Arginine was the only amino acid that prevented swarming by P.
      aeruginosa, and thus plays a pivotal role in promoting a sessile
      lifestyle in this species (Bernier et al, supra). In S. aureus,
      the final gene in the arginine biosynthesis pathway, argH, is
      essential for virulence in a mouse kidney abscess model,
      indicating that arginine is restricted in vivo (Nuxoll et al.,
      supra). Many oral streptococci are auxotrophic or conditionally
      auxotrophic for arginine (Jakubovics et al., supra, Cowman et al.
      Applied microbiology. 1975;30(3):374-80; Terleckyj et al, Infect
      Immun. 1975;11(4):656- 64; Cowman et al, Applied microbiology.
      1974;27(l):86-92; Rogers et al, Journal of general microbiology.
      1990;136(12):2545-50). The importance of the S. gordonii arginine<br>
      <br>
      biosynthesis pathway for growth in salivary biofilms is
      investigated using an argH mutant and a complemented strain. The
      present invention is not limited to a particular mechanism.
      Indeed, an understanding of the mechanism is not necessary to
      practice the present invention. Nonetheless, it is contemplated
      that arginine is a limiting nutrient for L-arginine biosynthesis-
      deficient streptococci growing as single-species colonies in
      salivary biofilms. Further, it is contemplated that coaggregation
      with other species in the biofilm overcomes the effects of L-
      arginine restriction but is subject to disruption by adding
      elevated amounts of L-arginine.<br>
      <br>
      Arginine catabolism in biofilms.<br>
      <br>
      In biofilm cells of P. aeruginosa, arginine metabolism is
      up-regulated<br>
      <br>
      compared with planktonic cells, due to an increase in expression
      of genes encoding the arginine deiminase system (ADS) (Xu et al,
      PloS one. 2013;8(2):e57050; Sauer et al, Journal of bacteriology.
      2002; 184(4): 1140-54). The ADS is a key component of anaerobic
      metabolism in this organism. The switch to ADS-mediated anaerobic
      fermentation is linked to increased susceptibility of P.
      aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin and tobramycin (Borriello et al.,
      Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy. 2004;48(7):2659-64). The
      ADS is also important in the pathogenicity of S. aureus. Indeed,
      the US A300 pathogenic lineage of S. aureus has acquired a genetic
      element termed the Arginine Catabolic Mobile Element (ACME), which
      contains genes encoding an ADS pathway and is thought to be a key
      factor in promoting growth and survival on the skin (Otto et al.,
      International journal of medical microbiology: IJMM. 2013). As
      such, the ACME may be important for the high transmissibility of
      USA300 strains.<br>
      <br>
      High concentrations of arginine negatively affect the ability of
      certain oral bacteria to colonize oral bio films. Arginine has
      been shown to inhibit several different coaggregation interactions
      between oral bacteria (Edwards et al., Oral microbiology and
      immunology. 2007;22(4):217-24; George et al, Oral microbiology and
      immunology. 1992;7(5):285-90. PubMed PMID: 1494452; Kaplan et al,
      Molecular microbiology. 2009;71(l):35-47;<br>
      <br>
      Takemoto et al., Journal of periodontal research.
      1993;28(l):21-6.; Nagata et al., Journal of dental research.
      1990;69(8): 1476-9.). Data described herein shows that the
      disruption of coaggregation within oral bio films leads to the
      release of bacteria from the biofilm. Nutrients induce dispersion
      of P. aeruginosa biofilms and this phenomenon involves genes
      required for arginine metabolism (Sauer et al., Journal of
      bacteriology. 2004 186(21): 7312-7326). Figure 4 shows that in S.
      gordonii the gene encoding ArcR, the regulator of arginine
      deiminase system genes, is required for biofilm formation by S.
      gordonii since a strain lacking the arcR gene does not form strong
      biofilms. Therefore L-arginine is a central regulator of biofilm
      formation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This example describes the impact of L-arginine on oral bio films
      that contain species grown under conditions representative of the
      human oral cavity. Using a microfluidic-based approach, using
      human saliva as the inoculum and 25% filter- sterilized human
      saliva as the nutrient source, it was demonstrated that
      HCL-balanced L-arginine (LAHCL) destabilizes oral biofilms in a
      concentration dependent manner. Destabilization was expressed as
      loss of biofilm structure and change in bacterial community
      membership, as determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy
      and 454 pyrosequencing. Very limited antimicrobial effects were
      evident and only detected as a consequence of biofilm
      perturbation, and the optimal concentration for destabilization
      was between 50 and 500mM. No substantial changes in pH were
      recorded, due to the use of HC1 balanced L-arginine (L-arginine
      monohydro chloride) and the buffering capacity of human saliva.<br>
      <br>
      As traditional approaches to control oral biofilms rely heavily on
      antimicrobials and L-arginine was demonstrated a destabilizing
      effect, synergy with other antimicrobials to more effectively
      inactivate biofilm cells was investigated. Mixing L-arginine with
      cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) resulted in at least five times
      greater biofilm inactivation (by live/dead staining). Taken
      collectively, it was demonstrated that L-arginine has broad oral
      biofilm destabilizing effects under conditions representative of
      the human mouth. Such effects are used to remove biofilms or
      enhance traditional CPC-based antimicrobial treatment strategies.
      Results are shown in Figures 5-11. Figure 5 shows changes in
      community composition of L-arginine (500 mM) treated bio films.
      Figure 6 shows the effect of L-arginine (CLSM) on multi-species
      bio films of bacteria in saliva derived community developed in
      pooled filter sterilized saliva in a static (non-flowing)
      microplate system. 500mM L-arginine destabilized multi-species
      oral biofilm communities to reduce biofilm biomass (and therefore
      total numbers of bacteria, including pathogens) and also makes the
      biofilm more diffuse with respect to architechture. No substantial
      killing was observed although there is a slight statistically
      significant increase in red "signal" indicating that the
      non-responsive<br>
      dead/damaged cells are left behind in the biofilm.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 7 shows Representative 3D renderings and biofilm
      characteristics derived from computational image analysis of oral
      biofilms developed for 20 h in different concentrations of
      L-arginine monohydro chloride (LAHC1) in the Bioflux™ flowing
      saliva biofilm system. Green signal indicates viable live cells
      and red signal indicates damaged/dead cells.<br>
      <br>
      Associated table shows changes in cell viability, biofilm biomass,
      thickness, and roughness. Data derived from at-least 18 renderings
      across three experiments and standard deviations are shown in
      brackets. *P&lt;0.05; **P&lt;0.01; **P&lt;0.001 : significant
      differences from the CFS control.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 8 shows that 500mM L-arginine destabilizes pre-formed
      multi-species oral biofilms of differing developmental age.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 9 shows that L-arginine destabilizes multi-species oral
      biofilm communities to enhance the penetration of CPC. As a
      consequence, lower CPC concentrations are used to achieve the same
      level of killing/inactivation/cell damage.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 10 shows fold induction of luciferase production in the
      Vibrio harveyi reporter strain BB170 normalized to a positive
      control (BB152). A control run of plain CFS (cell-free saliva)
      with the given concentrations of arginine was compared to
      microfluidics efflux, which contains any secreted molecules from
      bacteria grown with the given concentration of L- arginine. Values
      were produced by first taking averages of 4 trials at each
      concentration and dividing them by the average for the negative
      control, creating an induction number. The amount of AI-2 produced
      from multi-species biofilms increases as the concentrations of
      arginine used to treat them increases. This indicates that
      L-arginine energizes bacterial communities, because AI-2 is a
      proxy for metabolism. High AI-2 may also have a destabilizing
      effect on the community, which could explain or contribute to the
      structural changes seen in the biofilms. Figure 11 shows that
      application of L-arginine disrupts bacterial biofilm communities
      but D-arginine does not have the same effect. Therefore the
      destabilizing effects of arginine are specific to the L-form.<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, these examples demonstrate that L-arginine reduces
      the pathogenic potential of bio films by reducing the biofilm
      biomass and reducing the total amount and proportion of pathogens;
      L-arginine augments/enhances the activity of antimicrobials such
      as CPC. This is through enhancing access of antimicrobial by
      loosening biofilm and also by altering the growth-rate of the
      bacteria; L-arginine causes cell-cell signaling dysregulation; L-
      arginine is a combinational treatment that up-regulates
      metabolism, alters cell-cell signaling, and inhibits cell-cell
      adhesion; and L-arginine increases the proportion of beneficial
      bacteria that can combat the negative effects of pathogens such as
      S. mutans. The proportion of Veillonella species are increased in
      biofilms as are the proportions of non-cariogenic streptococci.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><br>
      <br>
      A plasmid (See e.g., Figure 12) was utilized to monitor expression
      of reporter genes in the presence of arginine or AI-2. The ???????
      backbone described in England et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.
      2004 Nov 30;101(48): 16917-22. Epub 2004 Nov 16) was modified to
      express fluorescent genes such as GFP or Mcherry in S. gordonii
      DL1 or other species of streptococci. Specifically, promoters from
      differentially regulated genes are inserted upstream of a GFP or
      Mcherry gene harbored on ??????? (or similar streptococcal plasmid
      shuttle vector system) to be differentially expressed (Figure 12A
      and 12B). An example was performed (Figure 12B) showing minimal
      differential expression by a 50S ribosomal protein (SGO l 192;
      gene rplJ responsible for the highly abundant 50S ribosomal
      protein L10) when exposed to exogenously added autoinducer-2
      (AI-2) as compared to drastically different gene expression by the
      catabolite control protein A (SGO 0773; ccpA). The plasmid
      provides constitutive -producing fluorescent probes for monitoring
      bacteria in biofilms and reporter systems that report arginine (or
      AI-2) concentrations in biofilms such as those found in dental
      plaque biofilms.<br>

      Also published as: JP3803695 <br>
      <br>
      PURPOSE: To obtain an antimicrobial preparation exhibiting
      excellent antimicrobial activity against the aggregate and lump of
      microorganisms, such as a biofilm or plaque, which can
      substantially not be controlled with an antimicrobial agent a
      lone. CONSTITUTION: The antimicrobial preparation contains
      0.001-10wt.% of arginine or its derivative and 0.001-10wt.% of a
      compound exhibiting antimicrobial activity. The further addition
      of 0.005-5wt.% of at least a surfactant selected from a nonionic
      surfactant and an amphoteric surfactant to the antimicrobial
      preparation gives the more excellent antimicrobial effect. The
      compound exhibiting the antimicrobial activity includes cationic
      antimicrobial agents (e.g. cetylpyridinium chloride), fluorides,
      natural antimicrobial agents (e.g. thymol, oil-soluble glycyrrhiza
      extract, a polyphenol), trichlosan, and isopropylmethylphenol.;
      The nonionic surfactant is preferably a polyethylene
      oxide-polypropylene oxide block copolymer, and the amphoteric
      surfactant is preferably a palm oil fatty acid amide
      propylbetaine.<br>

        </b><b>COMPOSITION FOR ORAL CAVITY</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To obtain a composition for oral cavity,
      capable of promoting absorption of a cationic disinfectant to the
      surface of tooth and excellent in prevention of formation of
      dental plaque and prevention of decayed tooth. SOLUTION: This
      composition for oral cavity is obtained by blending a cationic
      disinfectant such as gluconic acid chlorohexidine with an N long
      chain acyl basic amino acid lower alkyl ester or its salt such as
      N-cocoil-L-arginine ethylester-pyrrolidone carboxylic acid salt
      and a pH adjuster such as citric acid so as to keep pH to 5.5 to
      6.5. Thereby, largest absorption amount of the disinfectant is
      obtained, especially in a region of pH5.5 to 6.5 and absorption to
      dental surface is promoted in the region.<br>

        </b><b>COMPOSITION FOR ORAL CAVITY</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      PURPOSE:To obtain a composition for oral cavity having an
      excellent suppression effect of pH reduction of a bacterial
      plaque, constituted by containing arginine, canavanine or their
      salts, and a carbon dioxide producing agent or carbon dioxide.
      CONSTITUTION:Arginine, canavanine which is an arginine analog, and
      their salts of 0.05-20wt.%, and a carbon dioxide producing agent
      or carbon dioxide of 0.5-20wt.% are contained in this composition.
      Further, a calcium ion capturing agent of 0.05-50wt.% is contained
      in it as indispensable component, and the other optional
      components which are added in an usual composition for oral
      cavity, are added to adjust pH of 5-10, when it is dissolved in
      water of 10 fold amount.; By combining arginine, canavanie or
      their salts having a high safety and the carbon dioxide producing
      agent or carbon dioxide, with a manifestation of suppressing
      effect of lactic acid production, together with promoting effect
      of its decomposition, a reduction of pH of a bacterial plaque is
      suppressed. Since, even taking a food containing sucrose at the
      same time, the pH lowering is suppressed, a cariogenicity is
      reduced, and it is useful in fields of quasi-drug, a cosmetic and
      a food, and capable of changing a bacterial flora in the oral
      cavity to a flora rich with a goody bacteria.<br>

      The present invention relates to oral preparations having
      anti-caries activity. The compositions comprise pyruvic acid or an
      orally-acceptable salt thereof, and urea and/or arginine or a
      derivative thereof. This combination induces a pH-rise in the
      plaque.<br>
