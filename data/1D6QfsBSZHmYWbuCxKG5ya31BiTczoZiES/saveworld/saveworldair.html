      A device that reduces emissions and increases fuel efficiency has
      passed Europe's toughest air quality standards and could be headed
      to the U.S. Save The World Air, Inc., has developed technology
      that reduces NOX and CO2 emission by creating magnetic fields that
      reorganizes molecules prior to combustion. The company received a
      U.S. patent last year and is currently distributing products in
      China. According to SWTA, tests showed that emissions from a
      motorcycle engine were cut by more than 75 percent. Perhaps this
      technology would be a cost-efficient way for auto manufacturers to
      meet California's tough emissions laws. STWA patented/patent
      pending devices are specifically engineered to minimize
      environmental pollution, to enhance fuel system performance and to
      increase engine efficiency. Variations of these devices can be
      attached to the internal combustion engines or exhaust systems in
      most automobiles, motorcycles, off-road vehicles, generators and
      other stationary implements. ZEFS devices work to enhance the
      atomization of the fuel by affecting the Viscosity of that fuel.
      The effect is achieved by the use of specific and complex magnetic
      flux orientations that have the ability to influence fuel at the
      molecular level, reducing the structure of the molecular
      structures with in the fuel. These devices affect the fuel
      atomization process by breaking down the size of the molecular
      structure of the fuel. Reductions have been recorded in the scale
      from 760 microns down to 140 microns in carburetion fuel systems
      and as low as 3 microns in fuel injection systems. The devices
      create a more efficient burn rate, thus lowering the production of
      CO, THC and NOX. ZEFS devices are easily fitted to the base plates
      of carburetors and fuel injection systems; the devices are compact
      and there are no moving parts. Our testing to date on both two and
      four stroke motorcycles, two and four stroke generators and a 1995
      Mexican fuel injection VW automobiles are most encouraging.
      Independent tests performed in August 2004 at the Hong Kong
      Exhaust Emissions Laboratory (HKEEL) on a HONDA NSR 150 two-stroke
      motorcycle produced a 75% reduction in NOX, a 78% reduction CO and
      the reduction in THC emissions was even greater at 95%. Another
      independent test performed at HKEEL in August 2004 on a two-stroke
      63cc generator engine produced a 58% reduction of THC emissions,
      86% reduction of NOX and a 57% reduction of CO emissions.<br>

          <b> </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          This disclosure describes the physical mechanisms by which
          viscosity can be reduced in hydrocarbons (e.g., crude oil)
          containing paraffin and/or asphaltenes. In this disclosure,
          two specific types of molecular aggregation are described:
          paraffin-based and asphaltene- based.<br>
          <br>
          Paraffin molecules are typically considered to be long alkane
          molecules. One example of such molecules is shown in Figure 1.<br>
          <br>
          For sufficiently low temperatures, below the so-called waxing
          temperature, the long- chain alkane molecules will solidify.
          Above the waxing temperature, the polymeric mixture is a
          liquid phase with high viscosity that varies strongly with
          temperature. STWA's technology is based upon using
          dielectrophoresis (DEP) to stimulate aggregation that causes
          alkane molecules to clump together into sub-micron particulate
          matter. As will be discussed later, this conformational change
          can dramatically decrease bulk viscosity of the solution.
          Asphaltenes are a general class of molecules that are not
          soluble in alkane-based solvents such as n-heptane, but
          soluble in aromatic solvents such as toluene. The actual
          molecular structure can vary significantly depending upon the
          crude oil source. An example of an asphaltene molecule from
          Venezuelan crude is shown in Figure 2. These types of
          molecules consist of many aromatic ring-type moieties, thereby
          giving them a somewhat two- dimensional structure, which
          allows them to be soluble in toluene-type solvents.<br>
          <br>
          As can be seen from Figures 1 and 2, the structural form of
          paraffin and asphaltene- type molecules are significantly
          different. For our basic discussion, we can consider paraffin
          to be quasi one-dimensional, whereas asphaltene can be
          considered quasi two-dimensional. As these molecules migrate
          through an apparatus for reducing viscosity, such as seen in
          Figures 3, 4, 5, 6 (which will be discussed later in this
          disclosure) with an appropriate electric field, the molecules
          will clump into sub-micron sized particulate clusters.<br>
          <br>
          Upon the application of an appropriate electric field,
          molecules/particulate matter can be made to aggregate.
          Consider molecules/particulate matter suspended in a solvent
          that exhibit a different permittivity compared to the
          surrounding medium. Under the influence of an applied electric
          field, a dipole moment will be induced at the interface of the
          molecules/particulate matter and the surrounding medium. This
          is shown in Figure 7 where region A indicates the induced
          dipole region surrounding paraffin-like molecules. These
          induced dipole moments are generated as a result of exposure
          to the electric field, and provide a net dielectrophoretic
          force that pulls the molecules/particulate matter together,
          thereby inducing aggregation during treatment within the
          apparatus. Hence, Figure 7 is an example of paraffin molecules
          under the influence of an applied electric field. Region A in
          Figure 7 indicates the region where induced dipoles are
          formed.<br>
          <br>
          The attractive Coulombic force must be sufficiently high to
          overcome the entropic forces due to thermal energy, 3/4 T.
          Therefore, the critical electric field is estimated by kBT
          8p+2e,<br>
          <br>
          nefa&lt;3&gt;(ep- ef)' (1) where a is the effective radius of
          the molecule/particulate, n is the number density of the
          molecule/particulate matter, and the permittivity is given £
          and E for the particle and fluid, respectively. Once the
          molecules have been pulled sufficiently close together, van
          der Waals forces can act to maintain the aggregated state.
          However, entropic forces will eventually cause the aggregated
          particles to de-aggregate, and eventually return to the
          initial un- aggregated state. The time scale required for
          reversing the aggregated state is not clear from first
          principals, however, based upon empirical evidence in
          independent laboratory testing indicates that the time scale
          required is in excess of 24 hours, and depends upon several
          factors.<br>
          <br>
          Most polymeric fluids (such as crude oil) exhibit complex
          non-linear behavior.<br>
          <br>
          It has been found that the DEP-based aggregation of molecules
          creates a conformational change in the structure of the
          particulate matter. It is this change in conformation that
          reduces viscosity, as per the teachings of this disclosure.<br>
          <br>
          An illustration of the aggregation process for paraffin-like
          molecules is shown in Figures 8A - 8C. As one can observe,
          initially the molecules are dispersed in the medium (Figure
          8A). This dispersion allows the molecules to dissipate energy
          from the flowing medium. However, when an appropriate electric
          field is applied, induced electric dipoles cause the molecules
          to aggregate. First they coalesce (Figure 8B), and then
          aggregate into particulate matter (Figure 8C). Once the
          molecules are aggregated into sub-micron or micron-sized
          particulate matter, the amount of energy that they dissipate
          from the flowing medium is dramatically reduced, and therefore
          the effective viscosity of the bulk solution is reduced.<br>
          <br>
          A model for nanoaggregates of asphaltenes has been suggested.
          The asphaltene model has the aromatic molecules on one side of
          the alkane moieties which extend from the aromatic center.
          Essentially, asphaltenes are aromatic rings with alkane
          moieties that can be affected via dielectrophoresis-induced
          dipole moments. These alkanes interact with neighboring
          molecules and form nano-scale clusters due to the temporary
          induction of a dipole moment to the alkane moiety. As per the
          teachings of this disclosure, under an intense electric field
          as generated by the apparatus, this aggregation process can be
          increased; creating larger clusters and thereby decreasing the
          dissipation effect on the surrounding medium, which in turn
          reduces the effective bulk viscosity. Referring again to
          Figure 3, a front view of a disclosed embodiment is
          illustrated. In one embodiment, plates 10 are arranged in
          parallel at a predetermined, uniform 5 cm spacing.
          Alternatively, plates 10 are arranged in parallel at a
          predetermined, uniform spacing between 1/8 inches and 2
          inches. Plates 10 are oppositely charged, tied together by
          common electrical feed. Plates 10 are contained within tubular
          member 12, wherein tubular member 12 may be an electrical
          insulator polyurethane blended insulator.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 4 is a top, partial cross-sectional view of the
          embodiment of Figure 3. As noted earlier, plates 10 are
          arranged at a predetermined, uniform 5 cm spacing, oppositely
          charged, tied together by a common electrical feed.
          Alternatively, plates 10 are arranged at a predetermined,
          uniform spacing between 1/8 inches and 2 inches. Tubular
          member 12 may be an electrical polyurethane blended insulator.<br>
          <br>
          An aspect of the parallel-plate apparatus and/or concentric
          cylinder-type apparatus is the streamlining of costs
          associated with manufacture and operation when compared to a
          similar apparatus with plates held perpendicular to the flow
          direction. Another aspect is the current parallel plate
          apparatus and/or concentric cylinder-type apparatus is that by
          aligning the plates parallel to the bulk fluid flow, the
          pressure drop is minimized through the apparatus.<br>
          <br>
          Yet another aspect is the parallel plate device allows for the
          efficient and effective reduction of viscosity in hydrocarbon
          fluids and gas. A method of reducing viscosity of a
          hydrocarbon liquid containing paraffin molecules or asphaltene
          molecules in suspension may include providing a viscosity
          reducing apparatus. The viscosity reducing apparatus may
          include a conduit having an inner cavity dimensioned to
          accommodate a flow of the hydrocarbon liquid along a flow
          direction extending from an inlet end of the inner cavity to
          an outlet end of the inner cavity, and a series of
          electrically charged plates housed within the inner cavity,
          with each electrically charged plate extending along the flow
          direction. The method may further include flowing the
          hydrocarbon liquid through the inner cavity of the conduit,
          and using the series of electrically charged plates to apply
          electric fields to the hydrocarbon liquid flowing through the
          inner cavity such that a plurality of paraffin molecules or a
          plurality of asphaltene molecules undergo a conformational
          change in microstructure to form a cluster of paraffin
          molecules or a cluster of asphaltene molecules, thereby
          reducing the viscosity of the hydrocarbon liquid.<br>
          <br>
          Where the hydrocarbon liquid contains paraffin molecules and
          asphaltene molecules in suspension, the method may include
          using the series of electrically charged plates to apply
          electric fields to the hydrocarbon liquid flowing through the
          inner cavity such that a plurality of paraffin molecules and a
          plurality of asphaltene molecules undergo a conformational
          change in microstructure to form a cluster of paraffin
          molecules and a cluster of asphaltene molecules, thereby
          reducing the viscosity of the hydrocarbon liquid.<br>
          <br>
          The strength of the applied electric field may be varied to
          achieve a desired viscosity reduction of the hydrocarbon
          liquid. Alternatively, the exposure time period of the
          hydrocarbon liquid to the applied electric field may be varied
          to achieve a desired viscosity reduction of the hydrocarbon
          liquid. In another alternative, the strength of the applied
          electric field and the exposure time period of the hydrocarbon
          liquid to the applied electric field may both be varied to
          achieve a desired viscosity reduction of the hydrocarbon
          liquid. The series of electrically charged plates may be
          concentrically arranged, and the method may include flowing
          the hydrocarbon liquid between each of the series of
          electrically charged plates in the inner cavity of the
          conduit. In a further embodiment, the inner cavity of the
          conduit and each electrically charged plate may be
          cylindrically-shaped, with the electrically charged plates
          concentrically arranged within the inner cavity, and the
          method may include flowing the hydrocarbon liquid between each
          of the series of electrically charged plates in the inner
          cavity of the conduit. Alternatively, the series of
          electrically charged plates may be configured in a parallel
          arrangement, and the method may include flowing the
          hydrocarbon liquid between each of the series of electrically
          charged plates in the inner cavity of the conduit. Although
          the present invention has been described in considerable
          detail with reference to certain preferred versions thereof,
          other versions are possible. Therefore, the spirit and scope
          of the appended claims should not be limited to the
          description of the preferred versions contained herein.<br>

          A fuel saving device comprising a support body (10) having at
          least one flow opening (15) therein and a periphery which
          adapts the support body (10) for positioning within a sealed
          environment of a fuel system of a combustion engine in a
          manner in which the longitudinal axis of the at least one flow
          opening (15) is coaxial with a fluid flow path, and a
          plurality of permanent magnets (11-14), the polar axes of all
          magnets oriented parallel to the flow path through the opening
          (15), the magnets (11-14) are provided in at least two stacks
          (16, 16'), each stack (16, 16') containing at least two
          magnets (11-14), the magnets (11-14) of each stack (16, 16')
          each have a polar axis extending in the same direction with
          the magnets (11- 14) of at least one stack (16) having polar
          axes extending in opposite direction to the other of the at
          least two stacks (16').<br>
          <br>
          <b>Technical Field</b><br>
          <br>
          This invention relates to a device for saving fuel in
          combustion engines and reducing emissions, e.g. gaseous
          emissions to the atmosphere. Background Art<br>
          <br>
          This invention relates particularly but not exclusively to a
          device for saving fuel and reducing emissions for use on
          internal combustion engines, e.g., normally aspirated engines
          and engines with fuel injectors. It will therefore be
          convenient to describe the invention with reference to these
          example applications. However, it is to be clearly understood
          that the invention is capable of broader application.<br>
          <br>
          For example, the invention can be applied to any combustion
          engine and not just motor vehicle engines.<br>
          <br>
          Incomplete combustion of liquid fuels increases the cost of
          running engines. Further unburned fuel e.g. hydrocarbons are
          vented to the atmosphere through the exhaust and are generally
          harmful to the atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          Some of the gases emitted into the atmosphere include carbon
          monoxide, various nitrogen oxides, and unburned hydrocarbons.<br>
          <br>
          Naturally therefore any device which acted to decrease fuel
          consumption and thereby lower the running costs of a vehicle
          as well as lowering the pollution released to the atmosphere
          would be a major advance in the art and would be most
          advantageous to society generally.<br>
          <br>
          International patent application No. PCT<b>/AUOl/00585</b>
          describes a fuel saving device including a support which
          mounts a plurality of magnets in opposed polarities provided
          in a number of embodiments which enable the device to be
          incorporated in the fuel system of combustion engines with
          resulting fuel savings and a reduction in emissions.<br>
          <br>
          It is generally agreed that there is strong evidence of a
          positive effect when carbon based liquid and gaseous fuels are
          magnetically influenced. It is also generally agreed that
          there is a possibility that the "air" (and probably
          specifically the O2 atoms within air) is influenced positively
          in terms of its ability combined with the gasoline particles.<br>
          <br>
          Our tests to date have shown to our satisfaction that although
          gasoline can be influenced by magnetic fields arranged in
          particular alignments and cross alignments, the greatest
          influence is achieved when the air is treated either
          individually or in conjunction with the gasoline at the point
          where the air and gasoline mix. As a result of researching
          available data, and our own on-going practical testing
          observations and recordings, we believe that the fuel that
          combusts in an engine is not just the gasoline, but is the
          combination of gasoline and air. This distinction becomes
          important in understanding where the influence of a magnetic
          field may be most dominant. Any reference to fuel in this
          document means "the combination of gasoline and air".<br>
          <br>
          The magnetic influences and/or effects that are most likely to
          be influencing the gasoline/air mix going into the combustion
          chamber of the engine include the viscosity of the fluid
          particles of the fuel.<br>
          <br>
          Practical testing carried out in our research facility in 2002
          proved that the introduction of magnetic fields with
          particular alignments and cross alignments, positively affects
          the ability of gasoline fluid particles to atomise to a
          greater extent, into air. The fluid particles of the
          gasoline/air mix became smaller and lighter.<br>
          <br>
          There is no assertion as to any particular effect of magnetic
          influence on the gasoline prior to the point of atomisation in
          air. It should however be noted that Hans Dehmelt of the
          University of Washington, Seattle, in his 40 years of research
          into the basic properties of electrons showed that the
          electron has only four known characteristics: mass, charge,
          spin and magnetism. The magnetic effects seen on a daily
          basis, and employed in this device relate to ferromagnetic
          interaction. When we talk about "non-magnetic", we are
          actually saying non-ferromagnetic as there is no reaction with
          ferrite based substances. The recognition of
          "non-ferromagnetic forces" that are nonetheless magnetic, is a
          direct result of Dehmelt's work and their influences, although
          proven to exist, are yet to be quantified.<br>
          <br>
          General laws of physics imply that the smaller the particle,
          the less surface tension, and the decreased weight of that
          particle allows for an increased "suspension" time in the air
          as it travels the distance through the intake manifold from
          the area of magnetic influence to the combustion chamber.<br>
          <br>
          The fuel velocity through the intake manifold is influential
          in keeping fluid particles suspended in the air and this
          ability is enhanced if the fluid particles are smaller and
          lighter. The greater the amount of fluid in fine suspension on
          reaching the combustion chamber, the greater the fluid surface
          area exposed to air at the point of combustion. This has a
          positive effect on the rate of burn and the completeness of
          that burn. The result is that more power is generated from the
          same amount of fuel and with a more efficient burn less
          harmful gases are exhausted from the engine.<br>
          <br>
          As the main requirement for combustion to occur in this
          situation is the presence of oxygen (O2), it seems logical to
          deduce that the most influential part of the air portion of
          fuel is the O2 molecule. Practical testing has been carried
          out in our research facility to identify the influence of
          magnetic fields on air before it mixes with gasoline to become
          "the fuel".<br>
          <br>
          There is strong evidence to suggest that "air" (or more
          likely, specifically the O2 molecule in air) is susceptible to
          magnetic influence and may be the more dominant of the
          affected fuel components of gasoline and air.<br>
          <br>
          There are devices similar to the present invention available.
          The devices which seem most similar are those disclosed in <b>WO




            97/25528, US 4414951 and US3762135</b>. These devices are
          not the same as the present invention however and the
          differences between them and the present invention realise
          improved performance on the part of the present invention.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Summary Of The Invention</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          It is thus an object of the present invention to provide
          improvements to fuel saving devices which may at least
          partially overcome at least one of the abovementioned
          disadvantages or provide the consumer with a useful or
          commercial choice. hi one form, the invention resides in a
          fuel saving device comprising a support body having at least
          one flow opening therein and a periphery which adapts the
          support body for positioning within a sealed environment of a
          fuel system of a combustion engine in a manner in which the
          longitudinal axis of the at least one flow opening is co-axial
          with a fluid flow path, and a plurality of permanent magnets,
          the polar axes of all magnets oriented parallel to the flow
          path through the opening, characterised in that the magnets
          are provided in at least two stacks, each stack containing at
          least two magnets, the magnets of each stack each have a polar
          axis extending in the same direction with the magnets of at
          least one stack having polar axes extending in opposite
          direction to the other of the at least two stacks.<br>
          <br>
          The support body of the invention is preferably a spacer,
          defining a passage for the fuel air mixture, which is coupled
          in series with the rest of the fuel line.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, there will be a pair of stacks of magnets, the
          stacks of magnets being on substantially opposed sides of the
          opening.<br>
          <br>
          Suitably, the plurality of magnets of each stack will be
          mounted in the same plane; that is, the support body will
          generally be a substantially planar body. The support body is
          typically formed of aluminium or a similar metal.<br>
          <br>
          The magnets of each stack may abut each other or may be spaced
          apart in the stack. Typically, at least one spacing member may
          be provided between magnets in a stack, the spacing member
          having a shape similar to that of the magnet.<br>
          <br>
          The magnets can be secured to the support body by key slots of
          a complimentary shape. Each of the plurality of magnets is
          suitably keyed into the support body and each has a magnetic
          face which extends to and is communicable with the at least
          one flow opening. A portion of the magnets (and any spacing
          member) may form or assist with defining a sidewall of the
          flow opening.<br>
          <br>
          The support body is suitably provided with a plurality of
          apertures therein to facilitate the mounting of the support
          body in a fuel/air line leading to a combustion chamber of an
          internal combustion engine.<br>
          <br>
          The support body may be provided with top and bottom cover
          plates which secure the magnets against displacement via top
          and bottom surfaces of the support body. Alternatively, the
          magnets may be secured to the support body using an adhesive
          material, preferably one which is heat resistant.<br>
          <br>
          There is preferably an even number of magnets keyed into the
          body in each stack, the poles of opposite stacks of the
          magnets reversed relative to each other, but the magnets in a
          stack having aligned polar axes.<br>
          <br>
          The device, as adapted for use in association with a
          single-throat carburetor, will typically include a pair of
          stacks but there may be more than one pair of stacks provided.
          For example, there may be four stacks spaced substantially
          equidistantly about the circumference of the at least one
          opening in the support body, arranged at approximately
          90[deg.] apart from each other. A further preferred embodiment
          of the device has six stacks spaced substantially
          equidistantly about the circumference of a substantially oval
          shaped central opening in the support body.<br>
          <br>
          The magnets provided according to the invention may be a rare
          earth or neodymium iron boron magnet. Preferably, a plurality
          of magnets of this type are provided although alternative
          configurations of magnet numbers and types of magnets may be
          used according to the present invention. The rare earth
          magnets produce high strength magnetic fields. This enhances
          the magnetic force which is applied to the fuel droplets as
          they pass through the device. This enhances the breaking up or
          size reduction of the droplets as they pass through the
          device.<br>
          <br>
          Naturally, the size of the magnets will influence the strength
          of the magnetic field generated in the fuel air passageway. In
          one particular form, each magnet has a cross sectional surface
          area in the range of 20-50mm x 20-50mm. This will suffice to
          produce a suitable magnetic field in a fuel air passageway
          having a diameter of 22 mm to 40mm, preferably about 25mm or
          38mm. The depth or thickness of the magnet will typically be
          10-30mm, the actual depth being influenced by the thickness of
          the spacer in which the magnet is received. It will be
          appreciated however that the size of the magnets can vary.<br>
          <br>

          <b> </b><b>Description Of The Preferred Embodiment</b><br>
          <br>
          With respect to Figure 1 of the drawings, the fuel saving
          device illustrated comprises a support body 10 which is
          generally hexagonal in shape and having a central aperture 15.
          The support body 10 supports a plurality of permanent magnets
          11 (preferably 11 to 14), the support body 10 illustrated
          being constructed from a substantially unitary metal material
          and without top or bottom cover plates.<br>
          <br>
          The magnets 11-14 are secured to the support body by key slots
          17 of a complimentary shape. Each of the plurality of magnets
          11-14 is keyed into the support body 10 and each has a face
          which extends to and is communicable with the central opening
          15. A portion of the magnets (and any spacing member) may form
          or assist with defining a sidewall of the central aperture 15.<br>
          <br>
          The magnets 11-14 face the central aperture 15. The polar axes
          of all magnets provided are oriented parallel to the flow path
          of fuel and air through the aperture 15 in the support body
          10. The magnets 11-14 are provided in two magnet stacks 16,
          16'. Each magnet stack 16, 16' contains two magnets, the
          magnets of each stack 16, 16' each having a polar axis
          extending in the same direction with the magnets of a first
          stack 16 having polar axes extending in opposite direction to
          the other stack 16'. hi this case however, the magnets extend
          only partially throughout the depth of the support body 10 and
          stop short of the bottom face of the support body 10 by a
          distance "S".<br>
          <br>
          Such an arrangement provides the option of moving the magnetic
          field further away from the base of a carburetor and
          increasing the area of magnetic influence between the point of
          gasoline atomization and the point of cessation of magnetic
          influence.<br>
          <br>
          The support body 10 is also provided with a plurality of
          attachment openings 18 therein to facilitate the mounting of
          the support body 15 in a fuel/air line leading to a combustion
          chamber of an internal combustion engine.<br>
          <br>
          With respect to figure 2 of the drawings, the magnets of the
          stacks 16, 16' are illustrated removed from the support body
          10. The polar axes are illustrated by designating the poles of
          the magnets.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 3 of the drawings show a view from above the device
          according to the preferred embodiment with typical dimensions.<br>
          <br>
          The device described has been shown to provide significant
          reductions in fuel consumption and significant reduction in
          emissions. Use of a device according to the invention
          generally results in a marked decrease in the level of unburnt
          hydrocarbons in the exhaust stream from the engine. It also
          leads to a decrease in the level of carbon monoxide and oxides
          of nitrogen in the exhaust stream from the engine. Use of the
          device according to the invention also results in an increase
          in the level of oxygen in the exhaust stream. An implication
          of this can be seen to be that the combustion of the
          hydrocarbons in the engine is more efficient resulting in a
          lower level of unburnt hydrocarbons in the exhaust stream and
          more efficient use of oxygen resulting in less oxygen being
          used in the combustion process.<br>
          <br>
          Various experiments have been performed using the device of
          the invention. The following is a typical example of emission
          levels and fuel efficiency from such experiments, including
          comparison to the Euro II standard. Experiment 1<br>
          <br>
          The tests were conducted in December 2005 at the Automotive<br>
          <br>
          Emission Laboratory, Pollution Control Department, Ministry of
          Natural Resources and Environment of Thailand, and were
          performed jointly with S.P. Suzuki of Thailand, the authorized
          distributor of Suzuki products in Thailand. The tests were
          conducted on a used, 4-stroke motorcycle.<br>
          <br>

          In addition, during the testing, horsepower increased at all
          ranges, peaking at 18.8% at 50 km/h. Even more significant was

          33% over the baseline tests. Experiment 2<br>

          This set of tests were conducted on a new Chinese-manufactured
          carbureted 4-stroke Suyijia SZKl 25 motorcycle, and were
          better than EURO3 standards for motorcycles of 150cc or less.
          The tests were conducted in early March<br>

          Hong Kong, a certified laboratory of the United Kingdom 's
          Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA). The certified test results
          surpassed EURO3 standards in all three of the harmful exhaust
          emissions by the amounts, as shown below:<br>

          A fuel saving device comprising a disc-like non-magnetic solid
          support body having at least one flow opening therein and a

          within the fuel system in a manner in which the longitudinal

          field across the at least one flow opening in the support

          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          This invention relates to a device for saving fuel in
          combustion engines and reducing emissions, e. g. gaseous
          emissions to the atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          This invention relates particularly but not exclusively to a
          device for saving fuel and reducing emissions for use on
          internal combustion engines, e. g., normally aspirated engines
          and engines with fuel injectors. It will therefore be
          convenient to describe the invention with reference to these
          example applications.<br>
          <br>
          However, it is to be clearly understood that the invention is
          capable of broader application.<br>
          <br>
          For example, the invention can be applied to any combustion
          engine and not just motor vehicle engines.<br>
          <br>
          Incomplete combustion of liquid fuels increases the cost of
          running engines. Further unburned fuel e. g. hydrocarbons are
          vented to the atmosphere through the exhaust and are generally
          harmful to the atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          Some of the gases emitted into the atmosphere include carbon
          monoxide, various nitrogen oxides, and unburned hydrocarbons.<br>
          <br>
          Naturally therefore any device which acted to decrease fuel
          consumption and thereby lower the running costs of a vehicle
          as well as lowering the pollution released to the atmosphere
          would be a major advance in the art and would be most
          advantageous to society generally.<br>
          <br>
          International patent application No. PCT/AU01/00585 describes
          a fuel saving device including a support which mounts a
          plurality of magnets in opposed polarities provided in a
          number of embodiments which enable the device to be
          incorporated in the fuel system of combustion engines with
          resulting fuel savings and a reduction in emissions.<br>
          <br>
          It is generally agreed that there is strong evidence of a
          positive effect when carbon based liquid and gaseous fuels are
          magnetically influenced.<br>
          <br>
          It is also generally agreed that there is a possibility that
          the"air" (and probably specifically the 02 atoms within air)
          is influenced positively in terms of its ability combine with
          the gasoline particles.<br>
          <br>
          Our tests to date have shown to our satisfaction that although
          gasoline can be influenced by magnetic fields arranged in
          particular alignments and cross alignments, the greatest
          influence is achieved when the air is treated either
          individually or in conjunction with the gasoline at the point
          where the air and gasoline mix.<br>
          <br>
          As a result of researching available data, and our own
          on-going practical testing observations and recordings, we
          believe that the fuel that combusts in an engine is not just
          the gasoline, but is the combination of gasoline and air. This
          distinction becomes important in understanding where the
          influence of a magnetic field may be most dominant. Any
          reference to fuel in this document means"the combination of
          gasoline and air".<br>
          <br>
          The magnetic influences and/or effects that are most likely to
          be influencing the gasoline/air mix going into the combustion
          chamber of the engine include the viscosity of the fluid
          particles of the fuel.<br>
          <br>
          Practical testing carried out in our research facility in 2002
          proved that the introduction of magnetic fields with
          particular alignments and cross alignments, positively affects
          the ability of gasoline fluid particles to atomise to a
          greater extent, into air. The fluid particles of the
          gasoline/air mix, became smaller and lighter.<br>
          <br>
          There is no assertion as to any particular effect of magnetic
          influence on the gasoline prior to the point of atomisation in
          air. It should however be noted that Hans Dehmelt of the
          University of Washington, Seattle, in his 40 years of research
          into the basic properties of electrons showed that the
          electron has only four known characteristics: mass, charge,
          spin and magnetism. The magnetic effects seen on a daily
          basis, and employed in this device relate to ferromagnetic
          interaction. When we talk about"non-magnetic", we are actually
          saying non-ferromagnetic as there is no reaction with ferrite
          based substances. The recognition of"non-ferromagnetic forces"
          that are none the less magnetic, is a direct result of
          Dehmelt's work and their influences, although proven to exist,
          are yet to be quantified.<br>
          <br>
          General laws of physics imply that the smaller the particle,
          the less surface tension, and, the decreased weight of that
          particle allows for an increased "suspension"time in the air
          as it travels the distance through the intake manifold from
          the area of magnetic influence, to the combustion chamber.<br>
          <br>
          The fuel velocity through the intake manifold is influential
          in keeping fluid particles suspended in the air and this
          ability is enhanced if the fluid particles are smaller and
          lighter. The greater the amount of fluid in fine suspension on
          reaching the combustion chamber, the greater the fluid surface
          area exposed to air at the point of combustion. This has a
          positive effect on the rate of burn and the completeness of
          that burn.<br>
          <br>
          The result is that more power is generated from the same
          amount of fuel, and with a more efficient burn less harmful
          gases are exhausted from the engine.<br>
          <br>
          As the main requirement for combustion to occur in this
          situation is the presence of oxygen (02), it seems logical to
          deduce that the most influential part of the air portion of
          fuel, is the 02 molecule.<br>
          <br>
          Practical testing has been carried out in our research
          facility to identify the influence of magnetic fields on air
          before it mixes with gasoline to become"the fuel".<br>
          <br>
          There is strong evidence to suggest that"air" (or more likely,
          specifically the 02 molecule in air) is susceptible to
          magnetic influence and may be the more dominant of the
          effected fuel components of gasoline and air.<br>
          <br>
          The magnetic field patterns which are created by fuel saving
          devices such as that discussed by international patent
          application no. PCT/AU01/00585, are important and we conclude
          that multidirectional fields are more successful than orderly
          single line fields and that the devices may need to be
          arranged in different ways to best suit particular engines.<br>
          <br>
          It is thus an object of the present invention to provide
          improvements to fuel saving devices which may at least
          partially overcome at least one of the abovementioned
          disadvantages or provide the consumer with a useful or
          commercial choice.<br>
          <br>
          Further objects and advantages of the present invention will
          become apparatus from the ensuing description which is given
          by way of example.<br>
          <br>
          In one form, the invention resides in a fuel saving device
          comprising a disc-like non-magnetic solid support body having
          at least one flow opening therein and a continuous periphery
          which adapts the support body for positioning within a sealed
          air/fuel environment of a fuel system of a combustion engine
          at an air/fuel mixing point within the fuel system in a manner
          in which the longitudinal axis of the at least one flow
          opening is co-axial with fluid flow paths within the air/fuel
          environment, a plurality of permanent magnets having opposed
          polar axes supported by the periphery and positioned to
          provide at least one magnetic field across the at least one
          flow opening in the support body, and at least one booster
          magnet associated with the at least one flow opening.<br>
          <br>
          Suitably, the plurality of peripherally mounted magnets will
          be mounted in the same plane, that is, the disc-like
          non-magnetic solid support body will generally be a
          substantially planar body.<br>
          <br>
          The booster magnet will generally be positioned in
          substantially the same plane as the plurality of permanent
          magnets.<br>
          <br>
          The plurality of magnets is suitably keyed into the periphery
          of the body and each has a magnetic face which extends to and
          is communicable with the at least one flow opening.<br>
          <br>
          The support body is suitably provide with a plurality of
          apertures therein to facilitate the mounting of the support
          body in a fuel/air line leading to a combustion chamber of an
          internal combustion engine.<br>
          <br>
          The support body may be provided with top and bottom cover
          plates which secure the magnets against displacement via top
          and bottom surfaces of the support body.<br>
          <br>
          There is preferably an even number of magnets keyed into the
          periphery of the body with the poles of opposite pairs of the
          magnets reversed relative to each other.<br>
          <br>
          According to a most preferred embodiment, the device, as
          adapted for use in association with a single-throat
          carburetor, has four magnets spaced substantially
          equidistantly about the circumference of the central opening
          in the support body, arranged at approximately 90 apart from
          each other.<br>
          <br>
          A further preferred embodiment of the device has six magnets
          spaced substantially equidistantly about the circumference of
          a substantially oval shaped central opening in the support
          body.<br>
          <br>
          The booster magnet may be oriented with the polar axis of the
          magnet being oriented such that the negative pole of the
          magnet is on the outlet side of the device.<br>
          <br>
          The inventors have found that in addition to defining an
          annular magnetic field around the central magnet, the fact
          that the central magnet is present places an obstruction in
          the flow path of the air/fuel mixture as it passes through the
          opening. This may result in at least radial mixing of the
          air/fuel mixture and will generally result in longitudinal
          mixing as well. The mixing characteristics of the air/fuel
          mixture as it passes through the opening may overcome the plug
          flow characteristics present in prior art devices.<br>
          <br>
          Plug flow is characterised by the fact that the flow of
          mixture through the device is orderly with no element of fluid
          overtaking or mixing with any other element ahead or behind
          it. In a plug flow situation, the degree of treatment of the
          mixture varies from point to point along a flow path, with a
          given mixture element being treated only once as it passes
          through the magnetic fields caused by the device.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention may promote at least radial and some
          longitudinal mixing of the air/fuel mixture which results in
          the possibility that a given mixture element pass through the
          magnetic fields caused by the device more than once, thus
          enhancing treatment.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to this, prior art devices promote a convex
          air/fuel mixture flow profile due to the boundary layer caused
          by in the pipe and opening. This results in a larger amount of
          the mixture passing through the middle of the opening as
          compared to the periphery of the pipe. As the magnets of the
          prior art devices are located around the periphery of the
          opening, this resulting magnetic field is strongest or most
          effective closest to the magnets, that is closest to the
          periphery of the opening, and weakest in the centre of the
          opening as the field is active over the width or diameter of
          the opening. Therefore, in prior art devices, the majority of
          the air/fuel mixture is treated or affected by a weaker part
          of the magnetic field.<br>
          <br>
          By providing the obstruction in the flow path of the air/fuel
          mixture as it passes through the opening of the present
          invention, the central magnet may disrupt the flow profile and
          force the fluid mixture to pass through or across the more
          effective portion of the magnetic field, thus enhancing
          treatment of the mixture. It may also have the effect of
          decreasing the width or diameter of the opening over which the
          magnetic field must span. The width of the opening may be
          effectively halved allowing the magnetic fields to
          be"shorter"and thus increase effectiveness.<br>
          <br>
          Still further, the magnetic field may be increased in
          dimension in the longitudinal direction of the device due to
          the provision of the central magnet.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          With respect to figure 1 of the drawings, the fuel saving
          device illustrated comprises a hexagonal shaped non-magnetic
          body 1 supporting a plurality of permanent magnets 2
          (preferably 2 to 6), the body illustrated being constructed in
          two halves or having a central core and top and bottom cover
          plates.<br>
          <br>
          The magnets 2 face a central aperture 3 and have opposed
          polarities as described in the abovementioned international
          patent application.<br>
          <br>
          In this case however, the magnets extend only partially
          throughout the depth of the body and stop short of the top
          wall of the body by a distance"S".<br>
          <br>
          Such an arrangement provides the option of moving the magnetic
          field further away from the base of a carburetor and
          increasing the area of magnetic influence between the point of
          gasoline atomization and the point of cessation of magnetic
          influence.<br>
          <br>
          With respect to figure 2 of the drawings, the device of figure
          1 is modified to include a centrally positioned magnet 5
          supported by a grate (not shown) with a magnetic field running
          transverse to the main magnets. The magnetic field created by
          the additional central magnet causes an increased 3D effect.<br>
          <br>
          The polarity of the central magnet 5 is negative down.<br>
          <br>
          Figures 3 and 3a of the drawings show respectively the
          magnetic fields generated by the device of figure 1 and the
          device of figure 2.<br>

          With respect to figures 3 and 3a, in figure 3, there occurs a
          predominant plane of magnetic forces, parallel to the plane of
          the plurality of magnets, indicated by arrow 6 associated with
          magnetic lines of force which are perpendicular to the plane
          of the plurality of magnets, indicated by arrow 7. The
          direction of fuel is indicated by arrow 8. In figure 3, the
          central magnet, indicated by arrow 9 influences the magnetic
          forces to the extent that the perpendicular lines of force are
          increased in length.<br>
          <br>
          The devices described have been shown to provide significant

          Where it is used above, the symbol"NO"is used in a generic
          sense to mean oxides of nitrogen generally as opposed to its
          strict sense which is nitric oxide.<br>
          <br>
          As can be seen from the above examples, use of a device
          according to the invention generally results in a marked
          decrease in the level of unburnt hydrocarbons in the exhaust
          stream from the engine. It also leads to a decrease in the
          level of carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen in the exhaust
          stream from the engine. Use of the device according to the
          invention also results in an increase in the level of oxygen
          in the exhaust stream. An implication of this can be seen to
          be that the combustion of the hydrocarbons in the engine is
          more efficient resulting in a lower level of unburnt
          hydrocarbons in the exhaust stream and more efficient use of
          oxygen resulting in less oxygen being used in the combustion
          process.<br>
          <br>
          It will of course be realised that the above has been given by
          way of illustrative examples of the invention and that all
          such modifications and variations thereto as would be apparent
          to persons skilled in the art are deemed to fall within the
          broad scope and ambit of the invention.<br>

          <b> </b><br>
          The present invention relates to emission control devices and
          in particular to emission control devices used in conjunction
          with electronically controlled fuel injection systems.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Background Art</b><br>
          <br>
          It is now accepted that the treatment of a body of fluid with
          magnetic fields is capable of providing varying beneficial
          effects.<br>
          <br>
          Magnetic devices for treating fuels have been proposed in the
          past and descriptions of such devices can be found in: <br>

          <br>
          Authorities throughout the world are moving to encourage
          efficiencies of petrol and diesel engines including non-road
          engines and in particular regulating to encourage
          manufacturers to reduce harmful emissions from engines.<br>
          <br>
          Most modern motor vehicles are fitted with petrol injection
          systems, either mechanical or electronic.<br>
          <br>
          In such a system, injectors open to spray fuel into an
          airstream in an inlet duct in a fuel rail. The injectors are
          mounted in the intake manifold so that they spray fuel
          directly at the intake valves. A pipe called the fuel rail
          supplies pressurized fuel to all of the injectors.<br>
          <br>
          Fuel rails for modern injection systems are accessible and
          accordingly, provide a site to mount a treatment device.<br>
          <br>
          It is an object of the present invention to provide a device
          and methodology for treating fuels via the fuel rail of a fuel
          injection system with a view to reducing harmful emissions.<br>
          <br>
          Further objects and advantages will become apparent from the
          ensuing description which is given by way of example only.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Disclosure of Invention</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          According to the present invention, there is provided an
          emissions control device comprising (a) an elongate body
          portion having a plurality of channels which are angularly
          orientated to each other, and (b) each channel having at least
          one magnet positioned in the channel, the at least one magnet
          having a polar axis orientated to create magnetic fields
          directed at a common site adjacent to the body portion.<br>
          <br>
          Each channel is most suitably oriented at approximately 120
          degree intervals to each other channel. Each channel typically
          has an open face to allow insertion of the magnets into the
          channel or replacement of the magnets.<br>
          <br>
          The open faces are radially spaced at approximately 120 degree
          intervals.<br>
          <br>
          The device may include a tubular cover which houses the body
          portion and provides an opening common with the common site.
          The cover may be attachable relative to the body portion to
          secure the magnets provided in the various channels.<br>
          <br>
          The at least one magnet mounted in a first of the channels may
          be a neodymium iron boron magnet. Preferably, a plurality of
          magnets of this type are provided although alternative
          configurations of magnet numbers and types of magnets may be
          used according to the present invention.<br>
          <br>
          Magnets mounted in a second and third channels may be ferrite
          or neodymium iron or boron magnets. Again, a plurality of
          magnets of this type may be provided although alternative
          configurations of magnet numbers and types of magnets may be
          used according to the present invention. According to the most
          preferred embodiment of the present invention, a single bar
          magnet may be provided in the second and third channels.<br>
          <br>
          The cover may be fabricated or moulded from aluminium
          tubestock.<br>
          <br>
          According to the present invention, there is provided a method
          of treating air fuel/fuel mixtures of an engine having a fuel
          injection system comprising mounting a device as aforesaid
          coaxially with a fuel intake rail of a fuel injection system.<br>
          <br>
          The device may be mounted externally of the fuel rail.<br>
          <br>
          The device may be mounted within or partially within the fuel
          rail.<br>
          <br>
          Without wishing to be limited by theory, the inventors of the
          present invention have found that the imposition of a magnetic
          field with particular alignments and/or cross alignments may
          affect the ability of hydrocarbon fluid particles to atomize.
          In particular, an increase in the effectiveness of the
          atomisation of the hydrocarbon fluid was realised.<br>
          <br>
          The general laws of physics imply that the smaller a particle
          is, the lower the surface tension of that particle and the
          lower the weight of the particle.<br>
          <br>
          Smaller particles therefore result in an increase suspension
          time of a particle of hydrocarbon fluid as it travels the
          distance through the intake manifold form the area of magnetic
          influence of the device according to the present invention and
          into the combustion chamber.<br>
          <br>
          The hydrocarbon fluid velocity when injected (as well as the
          air velocity) through the intake manifold may be influential
          in keeping hydrocarbon fluid particles suspended in the air
          and the ability to suspend more particles for a longer period
          may be enhanced if the hydrocarbon fluid articles are smaller
          and lighter. The greater the amount of fluid in suspension on
          reaching the combustion chamber, the greater the hydrocarbon
          fluid particle surface area exposed to air at the point of
          combustion, thereby increasing the rate of burn, the
          efficiency of burn and completeness of burn. One result may be
          an increase in power generated per unit of hydrocarbon fluid
          and a decrease in noxious exhaust gases produced due to
          increase burn efficiency.<br>
          <br>
          One way in which the magnetic field may affect the size of the
          hydrocarbon fluid particles upon atomisation is by affecting
          the viscosity of the hydrocarbon fluid. This may occur by the
          action of the magnetic field aligning the hydrocarbon chains
          in the hydrocarbon fluid.<br>

          The alignment action may be effected because the hydrocarbon
          chains may exhibit a degree of paramagnetism. A paramagnetic
          material is one whose atoms may have permanent dipole moments,
          but perminant no perminant magnetism exsists outside the
          influence of an external magnetic field. If a magnetic field
          is applied to such a material, the dipole moments try to line
          up with the magnetic field, but are<br>
          <br>
          prevented from becoming perfectly aligned by their random
          thermal motion. Because the dipoles try to line up with the
          applied field, the susceptibilities of such materials are
          positive, but in the absence of the strong ferromagnetic
          effect, the susceptibilities are rather small. If on the
          average only a relatively small fraction of the atoms are
          aligned with the field (say 30% or less), then the
          magnetization obeys Curie's law:<br>
          <br>
          where C is a constant (different for each different material),
          where T is the temperature in kelvins, and where Bext is the
          applied magnetic field. Curie's law says that if Bext is
          increased, the magnetization increases (the stronger magnetic
          field aligns more of the dipoles). It also says that if the
          temperature is increased, the magnetization decreases (the
          increased thermal agitation helps prevent alignment). Curie's
          law only works for samples in which only a relatively small
          fraction of the atoms are aligned, on the average, with the
          magnetic field. When the aligned fraction becomes larger,
          Curie's law no longer holds because it predicts that the
          magnetization just goes up forever with increasing applied
          magnetic field Beat. But this can't be true because once the
          dipoles are 100% aligned, further increases in the
          magnetization are impossible.<br>
          <br>
          When this happens we say that the material is saturated, and
          further increases in BeXt or decreases in T will not change
          the magnetization very much because the atoms are about as
          aligned as they can get.<br>
          <br>
          When a paramagnetic material is placed in a strong magnetic
          field, it becomes a magnet, and as long as the strong magnetic
          field is present, it will attract and repel other magnets in
          the usual way. But when the strong magnetic field is removed,
          the net magnetic alignment is lost as the dipoles relax back
          to their normal random motion.<br>
          <br>
          The effects of the alignment of the hydrocarbon chains may
          allow the reduction in size of the hydrocarbon fluid particles
          when formed. (The length of time that the chains remain
          aligned is dependent upon several influences including but not
          limited to conduit surface inter-reaction, fluid density, and
          the degree of tortuosity of th pathway through which the
          particles flow, which is particularly relevent in combustion <br>
          engines.)<br>
          The effects of this may be seen from the following example
          using a unit scale:<br>
          <br>
          If one particle of atomised hydrocarbon (calculated as a
          uniform sphere and identified as"A") is 12 arbitrary units in
          diameter, then the surface area of that particle would be
          47rr2, or as the radius of this particle in 6 units,
          approximately 452.38 square units of surface area.<br>
          <br>
          The volume of that same sphere A would be 4/37ir3 or
          approximately 904.8 cubic units.<br>
          <br>
          If the magnetic influence has an effect of changing the
          packing factor of the hydrocarbon chains by 20% with an effect
          if a size reduction in the atomized hydrocarbon particle by
          20%, then the above calculation for surface area and volume of
          a particle 20% smaller than 12 units in diameter or 9.6 units
          in diameter (Particle "B") would be as follows:<br>
          <br>
          Surface area would be 289.5 square units and a volume of 463.2
          cubic units.<br>
          <br>
          If the total volume of all hydrocarbon atomised as it enters
          the system is constant, the difference in volume between
          particle A and Particle B requires that approximately 2
          particle B's are created instead of 1 particle A (904.8/463. 2
          equal 1.953 or approximately 2). If two B particles are
          created, then the corresponding surface area of these two B
          particles is 289.5 square units x 2 or 579 square units. The
          surface area of particle A is 452. 38 square units. Therefore,
          the total increase in surface area realised by providing two
          smaller volume particles having the same volume as a single
          larger particle is 126.62 square units, that is, the surface
          area of the smaller particles exhibit a surface area increase
          of approximately 28%.<br>
          <br>
          The increase in surface area available for contact with the
          air and an increase surface area available for the combustion
          process, an increase in burn efficiency is realised. The
          increase burn efficiency may result in a lower level of
          emissions and more power per unit of hydrocarbon fuel.<br>

          <b> </b><b>Description of Preferred Embodiment</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          With respect to the drawings, a device according to the
          present invention can comprise an elongate body generally
          indicated by arrow 1, the body providing a plurality of
          channels 2 therein, each having angularly orientated open
          faces 3.<br>
          <br>
          A plurality of magnets generally indicated by arrow 4 are
          positioned in the channels having polar axes as indicated
          which create magnetic fields directed at a common site
          adjacent to the body.<br>
          <br>
          The open faces are radially spaced by approximately 120
          degrees.<br>
          <br>
          The device may include a tubular cover 5 which houses the body
          1 and provides an opening 6 common with the common site.<br>
          <br>
          The device is mounted on a common fuel rail 7 (see Figures 2
          and 3) which defines the common site for the magnetic field.<br>
          <br>
          The magnets may be separate magnets or may be in bar form.<br>
          <br>
          The magnet types may vary, for example, the magnets in a first
          of the channels 8 may be neodymium iron boron magnets whilst
          magnets in channels 9 and 10 may be ferrite magnets of lesser
          strength.<br>
          <br>
          Voids within the interiors of the cover may be filled or
          partially filled with a non-magnetic filler e. g. an epoxy.<br>
          <br>
          Whilst the device of the present invention is primarily
          concerned with reducing the level of undesirable emissions
          from engines, it is likely that it will also reduce fuel
          consumption.<br>
          <br>
          The magnetic field applied to a fuel line is directly applied
          to fuels by the magnets immediately adjacent the fuel line. It
          is supposed that the magnetic lines of flux from the magnets
          immediately adjacent the fuel line deflect and spread
          throughout the cross-section of the fuel line and the effect
          of the stronger magnet is to assist the process.<br>
          <br>
          It is also supposed that an alignment of the carbon chains in
          the fuel in a specific way takes place. Testing has indicated
          that with specific magnetic field alignment, the viscosity of
          the liquid fuel is affected.<br>
          <br>
          Examples of this testing is given in the table below, in which
          the test was carried out on a vehicle with an electronically
          controlled fuel injection system.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          The test was carried out at a constant 60 kph. The operating
          temperature of the engine was verified prior to testing as
          temperature can also effect the viscosity of the fluid.<br>
          <br>
          The test was carried out at ambient conditions (humidity and
          temperature) which were recorded and remained within a 5%
          range throughout the test. The emissions in the gaseous
          exhaust were then analysed.<br>

          Inventor: BAKER PATRICK / KOSTIC JOHN &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          Applicant: SAVE THE WORLD AIR INC &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          This invention is directed to a device that can sit within, or
          be associated with an exhaust stream of an internal combustion
          vehicle and which can improve the efficiency of the catalytic
          converter in the exhaust stream, typically by keeping parts of
          the catalyst hotter than otherwise would be possible.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Background Art.</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Internal combustion engines such as gasoline or petrol engines
          provide toxic emissions which contain carbon monoxide,
          nitrogen oxides and the like.<br>
          <br>
          One way by which these toxic emissions can be reduced is to
          provide a catalytic converter in the exhaust stream. A common
          catalytic converter is a three-way converter that reduces the
          three regulated emissions - carbon monoxide, VOC's, and
          nitrogen oxides. The catalytic converter typically uses two
          different types of catalysts, being a reduction catalyst and
          an oxidation catalyst. The converter usually comprises a
          honeycomb of ceramic or metal structure which is coated with a
          metal catalyst which is typically platinum, palladium or
          rhodium.<br>
          <br>
          One of the biggest shortcomings of the catalytic converters is
          that they only work efficiently at fairly high temperature.
          One simple way to keep the catalytic converter hot is to make
          sure that the converter is positioned upstream in the exhaust
          system and close to the engine. However, this is not always
          convenient and can result in the catalytic converter becoming
          too hot which will cause damage to the catalytic converter.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, it is also known to preheat the catalytic converter.
          This is commonly done using an electric preheating element
          which is powered by the vehicle battery and which heats the
          catalytic converter to the operating temperature. During
          normal operation of the engine, the heat of the exhaust gases
          is usually sufficient to keep the&nbsp; catalytic converter at
          its operating temperature, and the preheating element can then
          be switched off. However, an electric preheater still requires
          several minutes of operation to heat the catalyst to the
          operating temperature. Also, the preheater can create a
          considerable power drain to the battery, and will not be
          suitable for engines that do not have a battery (such as
          lawnmower engines).<br>
          <br>
          Another major operational problem with inline catalytic
          converters is that the converter temperature can drop below an
          operating level when the engine is idling.<br>
          <br>
          For instance, if the vehicle is in heavy traffic, or is
          stopped by a red traffic light, the engine revolutions
          decrease to idling speed. This causes the temperature of the
          exhaust gases to quickly drop to a level where the temperature
          does not properly maintain the catalytic converter in its
          operational temperature zone.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, there would be an advantage if it were possible to
          provide some means which can maintain the catalytic converter
          in its operational temperature zone for a longer period of
          time than would otherwise be possible especially if the engine
          speed reduces (for instance is idling).<br>
          <br>
          It will be clearly understood that, if a prior art publication
          is referred to herein, this reference does not constitute an
          admission that the publication forms part of the common
          general knowledge in the art in Australia or in any other
          country.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Object of the Invention.</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          It is an object of the invention to provide an inline exhaust
          device that can improve the working of a catalytic converter
          and which may overcome at least some of the above mentioned
          disadvantages or provide a useful or commercial choice.<br>
          <br>
          In a broad form, the invention comprises a device to improve
          the working of an inline catalytic converter, the device
          affecting the flow of hot exhaust gasses to improve the
          transfer of heat from the exhaust gasses to the catalytic
          converter.<br>
          <br>
          In this manner, there is less, or no need for a separate
          electric heater for the catalyst.<br>
          <br>
          This now enables smaller engines [ lawnmower engines etc] to
          have a catalytic converter which works more efficiently, as
          these engines do not usually have a battery to enable an
          electric heater to heat the catalyst.<br>
          <br>
          In a more particular form the device comprises a particular
          internal profile which contacts the exhaust gasses and absorbs
          heat from the exhaust gasses. The profile may comprise or
          include a plurality of recesses or cavities to facilitate
          increased turbulence of the gasses which may improve the heat
          absorption.<br>
          <br>
          In another fonm, the invention resides in a device to improve
          the working of an inline catalytic converter, the device
          comprising a plurality of cavities or spaced apart members
          that extend at least partially into the exhaust stream, and
          adjacent the catalytic converter, the cavities or spaced apart
          members functioning to absorb heat from the exhaust stream and
          to keep at least part of the catalytic converter at an
          elevated temperature.<br>
          <br>
          In this manner, the device can absorb heat from the hot
          exhaust gases when the engine is running normally and should
          the engine idle, and the exhaust gas temperature drop, the
          device can radiate or otherwise transmit heat to part of the
          catalytic converter, or warm part of the catalytic converter
          to maintain the converter at least partially in its more
          efficient operating temperature during the idling time. Of
          course, the device cannot indefinitely maintain the
          temperature of the catalytic converter, but it should be
          effective during stop/start traffic or ordinary periods of
          idling.<br>
          <br>
          The device will typically be placed downstream from the
          catalyst. It may also be possible to place the device in front
          of the catalyst, but in some exhaust systems, the front
          portion can get quite hot and it may not be efficient to place
          the device in front of the catalyst. However, if the exhaust
          system is such that the catalyst is far enough away from the
          engine, it may be possible to place the device in front
          (upstream) of the catalyst as well as, or instead of, behind
          the catalyst.<br>
          <br>
          The device is preferably configured to absorb heat from the
          exhaust stream but without unnecessarily creating a
          backpressure in the exhaust. A backpressure is not always
          advantageous as too much back pressure can reduce the engine
          power by between 20%-30% and can increase fuel consumption.<br>
          <br>
          For this reason, it is preferred that the device comprises a
          plurality of spaced apart members that extend at least
          partially into the exhaust stream, at least some of the
          members being provided with an opening extending therethrough
          through which at least some of the exhaust gases can pass. It
          is preferred that the members extend substantially about the
          inner wall of the exhaust. Therefore, if the exhaust is
          substantially circular, it is preferred that the members
          comprise circular disks containing a central opening through
          which exhaust gases can pass. Of course, if the exhaust has a
          square, oval or rectangular cross-section, the shape of the
          members can vary to accommodate these configurations.<br>
          <br>
          The number of spaced apart members may vary depending on the
          size of the exhaust, the volume of exhaust gases, etc.
          Typically, the device will contain between 2-20 spaced apart
          members and preferably between 4-10 spaced apart members.<br>
          <br>
          2 0 The device may comprise a sleeve to which the spaced apart
          members are attached.<br>
          <br>
          The sleeve may be designed to slide within the exhaust system
          to a position adjacent the catalyst. Alternatively, the sleeve
          may be designed to be part of the exhaust system and clamped
          to the exhaust or otherwise attached to the exhaust pipe. The
          sleeve may alternatively have another internal profile to
          improve heat transfer from the gasses to the device.<br>
          <br>
          The spaced apart members (or other profile) may be spaced
          apart by a distance of between 3-50 millimetres and typically
          between 5-20 millimetres. A function of the spaced apart
          members is to create turbulence in the exhaust gas to cause
          part of the exhaust gas to swirl or be turbulent about and
          between the spaced apart members. It is considered that this
          improves the absorption of heat from the exhaust gases and
          into the spaced apart members. This can be due to increased
          resident time between the hot exhaust gas and the member
          caused by the turbulence or "eddy" effect which may function
          to cause the cooler gasses on the "outside" of the gas stream
          and which are in a heat exchange relationship with the device
          to be replaced by the hotter gasses in the "central" part of
          the gas flow, thereby causing the catalytic converter to heat
          up more quickly. This effect need not substantially increase
          the resident time of the gasses in the exhaust.<br>
          <br>
          The spaced apart members will preferably be formed from
          materials which will be strong enough to survive in the hot
          exhaust gases while still being relatively efficient in
          absorbing heat from the gases. Metals such as steel are
          considered suitable.<br>
          <br>
          However, no limitation should be placed on the invention
          merely by providing steel as a suitable material from which
          the spaced apart members can be made. The members can be made
          from other suitable metals, metal alloys, sintered metals,
          nonmetallic heat absorbing members, composite materials and
          the like.<br>
          <br>
          The spaced apart members will typically extend from the edge
          of the exhaust tube into the gas flow sufficiently to
          efficiently absorb heat from the gas flow without
          unnecessarily impeding the gas flow to create an undesirable
          backpressure. It is considered that the spaced apart members
          may extend into the exhaust tube by a distance of between
          10%-80% of the area. In one embodiment, this can be achieved
          by having the spaced apart members comprising substantially
          circular disks having an opening extending therethrough with
          the area of the disk comprising between 10% 80% of the
          cross-section area of the exhaust tube.<br>
          <br>
          One function of the spaced apart members is to create eddies
          or turbulence in at least part of the gas flow inter alia to
          improve the ability of the members to absorb heat from the gas
          flow. For this reason, the profile of the members may be such
          to improve this effect. In one form, the spaced apart members
          may be substantially disk-like having parallel sidewalls.
          However, in another form the, or each, side wall may be
          profiled to improve turbulence. The profile may comprise a
          recess or "concavity" in the or each side wall. In another
          form, the members may comprise a ramped surface which may
          extend towards or away from the catalytic converter. Other
          profiles and configurations are envisaged to improve the
          turbulence of the gas flow.<br>
          <br>
          It is considered beneficial to have a spacing gap between the
          catalytic converter and the first member of the device. While
          not wishing to be bound by theory, we believe that this gap
          improves the ability of the heat absorbed by the device to
          radiate the heat (or otherwise transmit the heat) back to the
          catalytic converter. The gap can comprise a "heat curtain" and
          can be anywhere between 5 millimetres-100 millimetres and
          preferably about 25 millimetres.<br>
          <br>
          In another more particular form of the invention, the device
          may comprise a valve or iris which is operable between an open
          position and a closed or partially closed position, the valve
          being downstream from the catalytic converter and functioning
          to increase the resident time of the exhaust gas about the
          catalytic converter especially when the engine is idling.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, when the engine is idling, the valve may be in a closed
          or partially closed position to keep the hot exhaust gases in
          the exhaust stream and about the catalytic converter to keep
          the temperature of the catalytic converter higher than would
          otherwise be the case if the exhaust gases were simply allowed
          to pass through the exhaust system unencumbered.<br>
          <br>
          The method may comprise a single valve as described above or a
          plurality of valves. If a plurality of valves is provided,
          these may be in "series" in "parallel" or in any combination
          thereof. The valve(s) may include an iris(s) The valve may be
          provided downstream of the catalytic converter to throttle or
          choke the exhaust gases when necessary to ensure that the
          catalytic converter is kept at a higher temperature than would
          otherwise be possible. It is envisaged that the valve can be
          positioned at any position downstream of the catalytic
          converter including immediately behind the catalytic
          converter, or some distance away from the catalytic converter,
          or even external of the exhaust pipe.<br>
          <br>
          It is envisaged that no particular limitation should be placed
          on the type of valve that may be used. Therefore, the valve
          may comprise a simple hinged flap valve, a slide valve, a
          rotating valve, a gate valve, an iris and the like.<br>
          <br>
          It is preferred that the valve is operated such that it will
          move to a more open position or a fully open position upon an
          increase of the volume of exhaust gases passing through the
          exhaust system. For instance, it is preferred that the valve
          moves to a more open position when the engine revs at higher
          resolutions as sufficient hot gases now pass over the
          catalytic converter. It is preferred that the valve is
          operable in an automated or semi-automated manner. In a very
          simple form, the valve may comprise a hinged weighted valve,
          which moves under the influence of gravity to a closed
          position when the engine gas volume is low but which is pushed
          by the engine gas volume to an open position when the gas
          volume is higher. Alternatively, the valve may be spring
          biased to a naturally closed position and can be pushed to the
          open position by the volume of the engine gas. Alternatively,
          the valve may be operated by temperature and may move from a
          closed position to an open position upon an increase in the
          temperature. This type of valve may be called a "thermostat
          valve".<br>
          <br>
          Alternatively, the valve may be operated by pressure
          differential in the exhaust stream. Other types of operating
          means to operate the valve may be used.<br>

          <b> </b><b>Best Mode.</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Referring initially to figure 4, there is illustrated a
          typical exhaust system that extends from the engine 10 to the
          tailpipe 11 and which contains an inline muffler 12, a&nbsp;
          catalytic converter 13, and a device 14 according to a first
          embodiment of the invention and which is mounted behind
          (downstream) the catalytic converter 13.<br>
          <br>
          Referring to figure 1, there is illustrated a device according
          to an embodiment of the invention. The device 14 is positioned
          downstream from catalytic converter 13. Hot exhaust gases from
          the engine pass into the front of catalytic converter 13 at a
          temperature of between 2000-270' centigrade (this can of
          course vary). At the rear end of the catalyst is a small air
          gap 15 having a length of about 25 millimetres. The device 14
          comprises five spaced apart members 16, each member comprising
          a circular disk having a central aperture 17 through which the
          exhaust gases can pass.<br>
          <br>
          The central aperture 17 of each disk is aligned with the
          central aperture of each other disk to provide a central flow
          pathway 18 which is substantially unimpeded.<br>
          <br>
          The disks are spaced apart by about 20 millimetres. As exhaust
          gas flows from catalyst 13 and through the aligned central
          apertures 17 of each disk, eddies and turbulence is provided
          about each disk causing exhaust gas to flow into the spacing
          between adjacent disks. This hot exhaust gas can then exchange
          heat with the respective disks causing the disks to heat up.
          This continues along the length of the device until the
          exhaust passes through the device and towards muffler 12.<br>
          <br>
          Figures 2-3 illustrate different designs of the spaced apart
          members 16. The designs are to improve the edge effects
          between the gas and the member to cause turbulence and eddies
          to be formed between the spaced apart members.<br>
          <br>
          The design does not increase the backpressure of the exhaust
          to an undesirable degree which can cause a reduction in engine
          power and increase in fuel consumption. It is considered that
          the aligned apertures in the disks enable exhaust gas to still
          flow through the device, and it is considered that having the
          spaced apart members provides a better heat exchange.<br>
          <br>
          Tests have shown that under engine idling conditions, the
          temperature at the front of the catalyst is about 150' and,
          without the device fitted, the temperature at the rear of the
          catalyst is about 1000. When the device is fitted, this
          increases the temperature at the rear of the catalyst to about
          2000.<br>
          <br>
          Referring to figure 5, there is illustrated an exhaust system
          similar to that of figure 4, except that figure 5 illustrates
          various positions 20-22 where secondary air can enter into the
          exhaust system. For instance, at position 20, secondary air
          can enter the exhaust system after engine 12 but before the
          catalytic converter 13. At position 21, secondary air can
          enter into the exhaust system after the catalytic converter 13
          but before muffler 12. At position 22, secondary air can enter
          into the exhaust system in muffler 12. At position 20, the
          secondary air can provide additional oxygen for assistance in
          proper catalytic conversion of the exhaust gases. At position
          21 and position 22, the secondary air dilutes the exhaust
          gases to reduce the percentage of the emissions from the
          tailpipe.<br>
          <br>
          Referring to figures 6-10, there is illustrated another
          embodiment of the invention where the device is a valve that
          can be of various configurations and types, and can be placed
          in various positions in the exhaust stream. The valve
          functions to throttle the engine gases to "bathe" the
          catalytic converter 13 in the hot engine gases for longer than
          would be possible without the valve.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 6-7 show a simple hinged valve 23 which can be
          positioned on the end of tailpipe 11. The valve is naturally
          weighted to the closed position (figure 6) and is pushed to
          the partially open position (figure 7) by the force of exhaust
          gases passing through the tailpipe. Thus, on the idling
          conditions, the valve will be mainly closed and this will
          result in the exhaust gases slowing down especially about the
          catalytic converter 13 such that the catalytic converter can
          stay hotter.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 8 illustrates a simple hinged valve 24 which is
          positioned inside part of the exhaust system and again can
          move between a naturally closed position and a partially
          opened position (shown in phantom line), again by the force of
          exhaust gases.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 9 illustrates a valve 25 that can be pushed downwardly
          by the force of the exhaust gases and move between a naturally
          closed position by virtue of spring 26 and a pushed down open
          position illustrated in figure 9.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 10 illustrates a turn valve 27 which can be rotated
          about a pivot axis 28, between an open position illustrated in
          figure 10 and a closed position where the valve has been
          rotated by 900 to block off the flow of gases. The turn valve
          27 can be operated by heat which means that as the valve heats
          up, it moves to the open position. The valve can be heated by
          the exhaust gases. Alternatively, another type of thermal reed
          valve, or flap or disk can be used.<br>
          <br>
          The valve will typically be positioned downstream from the
          catalytic converter to provide a degree of throttling or
          backpressure under low engine idling conditions to keep the
          hot exhaust gases about the catalytic converter for longer
          than would be otherwise possible if the valve was not in
          place.<br>
          <br>
          It is envisaged that the invention will extend to a
          combination of a device 14 typically as illustrated in figures
          1-4 and a valve typically as illustrated in figures 6-10.<br>
          <br>
          The secondary air injection (see for instance figure 5) can be
          carried out with the valves in place or with the device 14 in
          place or both.<br>
          <br>
          Tests carried out on the temperature on the rear of the
          catalytic converter using the device as illustrated in figures
          1-4 show a marked increase of the temperature on the rear of
          the catalytic converter.<br>
          <br>
          In an experiment, and using an engine containing the device
          illustrated in figures 1-4, the front of the catalytic
          converter was between 340-700 over a five-minute period, and
          the rear of the catalytic converter was between 70'-1400. With
          the same engine under a 500 watt load condition, the front of
          the catalytic converter was between 46 1800 over a five minute
          period while the rear of the catalytic converter was between
          131-3240. The results show that the rear of the catalytic
          converter is kept quite warm due to the device re-radiating
          heat back to the catalytic converter.<br>
          <br>
          The warming of the catalytic converter had an advantageous
          reduction on the emissions. In an experiment, a HONDA NSR
          150cc two-stroke engine was used to test the reduction in
          emissions using the device is illustrated in figures 1-4.<br>
          <br>
          Without the device fitted, the emissions were as follows:<br>
          <br>
          Lda 0.872ULP RPM 4384 02 3.32% NO 14 ppm CO2 9.14% HC
          [hydrocarbons] 4902 ppm CO 2.848% <br>
          <br>
          With the device fitted, the emissions over several hours were
          as follows:<br>
          <br>
          TIME Lda RPM 02% NO ppm CO2% HC ppm CO% [Hr] 1 0.902 4559 0.00
          2 13.37 1093 2.103 4 0.907 4657 0.32 2 13.51 1505 1.92 0.889
          4455 0.00 2 13.28 1533 2.0 7 0.895 4311 0.23 3 13.46 1744 2.0
          9 0.896 4421 0.49 3 13.27 1787 2.29 12 0.879 4717 0.00 3 13.17
          1695 2.23 <br>
          <br>
          Thus the device functions to reduce emissions, primarily NO
          and hydrocarbons from an exhaust stream.<br>
