      <br>
      Dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) is an oxidized form of ascorbic acid
      (vitamin C). It is actively imported into the endoplasmic
      reticulum of cells via glucose transporters.[citation needed] It
      is trapped therein by reduction back to ascorbate by glutathione
      and other thiols.[1] The (free) chemical radical
      semidehydroascorbic acid (SDA) also belongs to the group of
      oxidized ascorbic acids.<br>
      <br>
      Although a sodium-dependent transporter for vitamin C exists, it
      is present mainly in specialized cells, whereas the glucose
      transporters, the most notable being GLUT1, transport Vitamin C
      (in its oxidized form, DHA)[2] in most cells, where recycling back
      to ascorbate generates the necessary enzyme cofactor and
      intracellular antioxidant, (see Transport to mitochondria).<br>
      <br>
      The structure shown here for DHA is the commonly shown textbook
      structure. This 1,2,3-tricarbonyl is too electrophilic to survive
      more than a few milliseconds in aqueous solution, however. The
      actual structure shown by spectroscopic studies is the result of
      rapid hemiacetal formation between the 6-OH and the 3-carbonyl
      groups. Hydration of the 2-carbonyl is also observed.[3] The
      lifetime of the stabilized species is commonly said to be about 6
      minutes under biological conditions.[4] Destruction results from
      irreversible hydrolysis of the ester bond, with additional
      degradation reactions following.[5] <br>
      <br>
      Crystallization of solutions of DHA gives a pentacyclic dimer
      structure of indefinite stability. Recycling of ascorbate via
      active transport of DHA into cells, followed by reduction and
      reuse, mitigates the inability of humans to synthesize it from
      glucose.[6]<br>
      <br>
      Hydration equilibria of DHA - the hemiacetal structure (center) is
      the predominant one. (Water molecules are not actually involved in
      the first equilibrium, since it is an "internal"
      hemiacetalisation. Real hydration strictly occurs only in the
      middle carbonyl group)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Transport to mitochondria</b><br>
      <br>
      Vitamin C accumulates in mitochondria, where most of the free
      radicals are produced, by entering as DHA through the glucose
      transporters, GLUT10. Ascorbic acid protects the mitochondrial
      genome and membrane.[2]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Transport to the brain</b><br>
      <br>
      Vitamin C does not pass from the bloodstream into the brain,
      although the brain is one of the organs that have the greatest
      concentration of vitamin C. Instead, DHA is transported through
      the blood–brain barrier via GLUT1 transporters, and then converted
      back to ascorbate.[7]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Use</b><br>
      <br>
      Dehydroascorbic acid has been used as a vitamin C dietary
      supplement.[8]<br>
      <br>
      As a cosmetic ingredient, dehydroascorbic acid is used to enhance
      the appearance of the skin.[9] It may be used in a process for
      permanent waving of hair[10] and in a process for sunless tanning
      of skin.[11]<br>
      <br>
      In a cell culture growth medium, dehydroascorbic acid has been
      used to assure the uptake of vitamin C into cell types that do not
      contain ascorbic acid transporters.[12]<br>
      <br>
      As a pharmaceutical agent, some research has suggested that
      administration of dehydroascorbic acid may confer protection from
      neuronal injury following an ischemic stroke.[7] The literature
      contains many reports on the antiviral effects of vitamin C,[13]
      and one study suggests dehydroascorbic acid has stronger antiviral
      effects and a different mechanism of action than ascorbic
      acid.[14] Solutions in water containing ascorbic acid and copper
      ions and/or peroxide, resulting in rapid oxidation of ascorbic
      acid to dehydroascorbic acid, have been shown to possess powerful
      but short-lived antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral
      properties, and have been used to treat gingivitis, periodontal
      disease, and dental plaque.[15][16] A pharmaceutical product named
      Ascoxal is an example of such a solution used as a mouth rinse as
      an oral mucolytic and prophylactic agent against
      gingivitis.[16][17] Ascoxal solution has also been tested with
      positive results as a treatment for recurrent mucocutaneous
      herpes,[17] and as a mucolytic agent in acute and chronic
      pulmonary disease such as emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma by
      aerosol inhalation.[18]<br>

        </font></div>
      <br>
      Our name is pronounced "ree SEE ver in," we are manufacturers and
      sellers of advanced, science-based solutions of Vitamin C for
      topical and dietary use. ReCverin LLC is founded in the science of
      Vitamin C, with particular focus on the oxidized form called DHAA.
      We believe that the more you know about this science, the more you
      will appreciate the value of our products.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ReCverin LLC</b><b><br>
      </b><b>944 E. 3300 S.</b><b><br>

      <br>
      ReCverin C contains 10% L-ascorbic acid as a stabilized solution
      in pure, vegetable glycerin. It provides the moisturizing,
      collagen-stimulating and antioxidant power of L-ascorbic acid in
      an ultra-pure, fragrance-free, moisturizing base with no harsh
      chemical preservatives. For firmer, smoother, more radiant-looking
      skin, apply daily before any other skincare product to the face,
      neck, hands, arms, and other exposed skin.<br>
      <br>
      Stratum corneum (the dead outer layer of skin) poses a significant
      barrier to absorption of the common form of Vitamin C called
      L-ascorbic acid. Therefore L-ascorbic acid serums are most
      effective for persons who also practice some type of exfoliation
      (which refers to physical or chemical techniques for removing
      stratum corneum). Nevertheless, daily topical use of a
      high-strength serum like ReCverin C has been shown to increase the
      Vitamin C concentration in skin to higher levels than can be
      achieved by oral ingestion of Vitamin C, even in persons who don't
      exfoliate. The pH of an L-ascorbic acid serum has been shown to be
      a critical factor; absorption is much improved in serums with pH
      values of 3.0 or lower. ReCverin C™ is formulated at pH 2.7 for
      best absorption.<br>
      <br>
      ReCverin C compares to many competing high-strength Vitamin C
      serums, with these important differences:<br>
      <br>
      ReCverin C is extremely stable. It will easily retain greater than
      95% of its stated L-ascorbic acid concentration for a year when
      stored at typical room temperatures, and it will remain crystal
      clear and colorless. With ReCverin C, you are free to ignore any
      concerns about stability and/or yellowing of your Vitamin C skin
      serum!<br>
      <br>
      ReCverin C does not contain emulsifiers, detergents,
      preservatives, colorants or fragrances. Formulated in pure
      vegetable glycerin, it does not require any unnatural chemical
      agents that can contribute to skin sensitivity or other problems.
      Glycerin is the natural humectant found in sebum, the fluid that
      skin normally secretes onto its own surface. This water-soluble,
      skin-identical moisturizer has been used for centuries for its
      cosmetic effects in smoothing and moisturizing the skin, and also
      for its soothing, beneficial effects on rough, dry and irritated
      skin.<br>
      <br>
      ReCverin C is economical. The two-ounce bottle contains 2 or 4
      times more serum than a bottle of most competing products.<br>
      <br>
      Please be aware that some people experience tingling or irritation
      after applying high-strength L-ascorbic acid solutions. For most
      people, if they experience them at all, these effects are mild,
      temporary, and completely tolerable. But those with very sensitive
      skin can have difficulty using high-strength L-ascorbic acid.<br>
      <br>
      We highly recommend our premiere product ReCverin 50/50 for those
      with sensitive skin, for those who don't regularly exfoliate, and,
      in fact, for anyone who is seeking maximum absorption of Vitamin
      C.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ReCverin C™ Use and Storage Guidelines</b><br>
      <br>
      Apply daily to the face, neck, arms, hands and other exposed skin.
      Avoid direct contact with eyes.<br>
      <br>
      We suggest using 3-5 drops for the face, and a similar application
      rate for other, similar-sized skin areas.<br>
      <br>
      Apply to clean skin before any other products, and massage in
      thoroughly.<br>
      <br>
      ReCverin C can be used directly as supplied, or it may be mixed
      with water immediately before applying. We suggest applying to
      moist skin or mixing with a little water by placing a few drops of
      water and product in the palm and rubbing the hands together.
      Water combines with the humectant glycerin base to create a
      deep-penetrating moisturizer that absorbs quickly and gives a skin
      texture that many people prefer. Vary the proportions to the
      consistency you desire.<br>
      <br>
      ReCverin C blends nicely with most lotions. You can mix a few
      drops with another lotion immediately before applying, or you can
      apply another lotion immediately after applying our serum.<br>
      <br>
      Please keep in mind that ReCverin C is carefully formulated to
      stabilize Vitamin C. One of the secrets to its stability is that
      it contains no water. We recommend that you do not premix with
      water or lotions for later use.<br>
      <br>
      Store at room temperature or below. For best results, use within 1
      year.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A Special Note for Do-It-Yourselfers</b><br>
      <br>
      Making do-it-yourself skin care products is a popular hobby. We
      respect and admire those who blend their own in that quest for the
      perfect, individualized composition of ingredients! Both ReCverin
      C and ReCverin 50/50 can be utilized as a starting base or
      component of the water-soluble fraction of your own formulas.<br>
      <br>
      A particularly popular composition among DIYers contains Vitamin
      C, Vitamin E, and Ferulic Acid, commonly known as a "CEF Serum,"
      and there are many different and varied recipes. To demonstrate
      how our products can be used by DIY folks, we have prepared a
      video that shows how an excellent and easy CEF Serum can be
      prepared featuring ReCverin C. This recipe focuses on maintaining
      a water-free composition to preserve the remarkable stability of
      the Vitamin C component as provided in ReCverin C.<br>

      C ports, but it doesn't take energy to absorb through the glucose
      ports). (Absorption into blood stream from digestive tract and

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A concentration-function approach to vitamin C (ascorbate) has
      yielded new physiology and pharmacology discoveries. To determine
      the range of vitamin C concentrations possible in humans,
      pharmacokinetics studies were conducted. They showed that when
      vitamin C is ingested by mouth, plasma and tissue concentrations
      are tightly controlled by at least 3 mechanisms in healthy humans:
      absorption, tissue accumulation, and renal reabsorption. A 4th
      mechanism, rate of utilization, may be important in disease. With
      ingested amounts found in foods, vitamin C plasma concentrations
      do not exceed 100 μmol/L. Even with supplementation approaching
      maximally tolerated doses, ascorbate plasma concentrations are
      always &lt;250 μmol/L and frequently &lt;150 μmol/L. By contrast,
      when ascorbate is i.v. injected, tight control is bypassed until
      excess ascorbate is eliminated by glomerular filtration and renal
      excretion. With i.v. infusion, pharmacologic ascorbate
      concentrations of 25–30 mmol/L are safely achieved. Pharmacologic
      ascorbate can act as a pro-drug for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
      formation, which can lead to extracellular fluid at concentrations
      as high as 200 μmol/L. Pharmacologic ascorbate can elicit
      cytotoxicity toward cancer cells <br>
      and slow the growth of tumors in experimental murine models. The
      effects of pharmacologic ascorbate should be further studied in
      diseases, such as cancer and infections, which may respond to
      generation of reactive oxygen species via H2O2...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><br>
      <br>
      A concentration-function approach to vitamin C yields new insights
      into its physiology and pharmacology. Vitamin C concentrations are
      tightly controlled with oral ingestion by at least 4 mechanisms.
      Disruption of one mechanism, renal reabsorption, reveals a new
      potential role of ascorbate in perinatal health and unanticipated
      feedback regulation of ascorbate biosynthesis. For proper clinical
      translation, dose concentration relationships must be accounted
      for in clinical studies. Tight control of ascorbate concentrations
      is bypassed with i.v. administration until renal excretion
      restores homeostasis. With i.v. administration, ascorbate is
      turned from vitamin to drug, as pharmacologic concentrations are
      produced that are as much as 100-fold higher than those possible
      with maximal oral dosing. Pharmacologic ascorbate, by acting as a
      pro-drug for H2O2 in the extracellular fluid, has potential in
      treatment of cancer, infectious diseases, and perhaps other
      conditions in which H2O2 may have efficacy. Ascorbate administered
      intravenously has already been tested in a phase I clinical trial,
      is in wide use by complementary and alternative medicine
      (integrative medicine) practitioners, and appears to have minimal
      side effects in patients who are properly screened.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Topical application of vitamin C has an established history of use
      in skincare. A large body of literature from clinical and
      laboratory studies supports a scientific basis for its use in
      improving both the appearance and health of the skin. Ascorbic
      acid (AA) is the naturally-occurring chemical form of vitamin C
      that is most familiar, and it is commonly used in topical
      products. But AA has limited permeation through the stratum
      corneum, and this has led to the use of very high concentrations
      that are associated with side effects such as tingling, irritation
      and redness in some people. Dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) is the
      other naturally-occurring form of vitamin C, and has chemical
      properties that suggest its skin permeation rate would be higher
      than AA. In this study, the rates of AA and DHAA permeation were
      compared by a clinically relevant, in vivo method on human
      subjects. Specifically, a solution containing equal parts of AA
      and DHAA was applied in amounts and for time periods likely to be
      achieved in common use of a topical product by consumers. The
      amount absorbed was determined by subtracting the amount
      recoverable in skin washings. The results show that DHAA permeates
      stratum corneum at a rate up to 12 times faster than AA. This
      supports the concept that lower concentrations of DHAA in topical
      preparations can enhance skin vitamin C levels with less potential
      for side effects…<br>
      <br>
      DHAA is a more lipophilic compound than AA, and it is not ionized
      in aqueous solution [11]. Both of these properties suggest that
      DHAA would permeate the stratum corneum more easily [12]. The aim
      of the present study was to compare the rate of AA versus DHAA
      absorption in order to assess whether or not DHAA actually does
      permeate more easily. A solution containing both AA and DHAA in
      approximately equal concentrations was used to compare their
      absorption rates in vivo, using a simple, non-invasive technique
      on human subjects. To assess permeation into the stratum corneum,
      the solution was applied to delineated skin surfaces and allowed
      0, 2 or 4 hours for absorption. Each skin surface was then washed
      with deionized water, and the skin washings were collected and
      measured for AA and DHAA content. The amount absorbed at 2 and 4
      hours was determined by subtraction from the amount present in the
      0 hour washings. The aim of the study was achieved, since
      measurable differences in AA versus DHAA absorption were observed,
      and the DHAA absorption rate was found to be significantly greater
      than that of AA…<br>

      mortality in numerous studies. In this study, bioavailability of
      the oxidized form of vitamin C (l-dehydroascorbic acid or
      DHA)—commonly found in vitamin C containing food products prone to
      oxidation—was studied. Our aim was to compare tissue accumulation
      of vitamin C in guinea pigs receiving different oral doses of
      either ascorbate or DHA. In all tissues tested (plasma, liver,
      spleen, lung, adrenal glands, kidney, muscle, heart, and brain),
      only sporadic differences in vitamin C accumulation from ascorbate
      or DHA were observed except for the lowest dose of DHA (0.25 mg/ml
      in the drinking water), where approximately half of the tissues
      had slightly yet significantly less vitamin C accumulation than
      from the ascorbate source. As these results contradicted data from
      rats, we continued to explore the ability to recycle DHA in blood,
      liver and intestine in guinea pigs, rats and mice. These
      investigations revealed that guinea pigs have similar recycling
      capacity in red blood cells as observed in humans, while rats and
      mice do not have near the same ability to reduce DHA in
      erythrocytes. In liver and intestinal homogenates, guinea pigs
      also showed a significantly higher ability to recycle DHA compared
      to rats and mice. These data demonstrate that DHA in guinea
      pigs—as in humans—is almost as effective as ascorbate as vitamin C
      source when it comes to taking up and storing vitamin C and
      further suggest that the guinea pig is superior to other rodents
      in modeling human vitamin C homeostasis.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Ischemic stroke results in the diverse phathophysiologies
      including blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption, brain edema,
      neuronal cell death, and synaptic loss in brain. Vitamin C has
      known as the potent anti-oxidant having multiple functions in
      various organs, as well as in brain. Dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) as
      the oxidized form of ascorbic acid (AA) acts as a cellular
      protector against oxidative stress and easily enters into the
      brain compared to AA. To determine the role of DHA on edema
      formation, neuronal cell death, and synaptic dysfunction following
      cerebral ischemia, we investigated the infarct size of ischemic
      brain tissue and measured the expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP-1) as
      the water channel protein. We also examined the expression of
      claudin 5 for confirming the BBB breakdown, and the expression of
      bcl 2 associated X protein (Bax), caspase-3, inducible nitric
      oxide synthase (iNOS) for checking the effect of DHA on the
      neurotoxicity. Finally, we examined postsynaptic density
      protein-95 (PSD-95) expression to confirm the effect of DHA on
      synaptic dysfunction following ischemic stroke. Based on our
      findings, we propose that DHA might alleviate the pathogenesis of
      ischemic brain injury by attenuating edema, neuronal loss, and by
      improving synaptic connection.<br>

      <b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Ischemic stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide
      accompanied by severe disability [1]. Cerebral ischemia and
      reperfusion injury leads to damage of brain tissues, inflammation
      as a result of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, oxidative
      damage [2], and apoptosis [3]. Brain tissue is highly vulnerable
      to oxidative damage because of its high use of oxygen [4] under
      cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia leads to loss of tight
      junction proteins in brain endothelium, BBB disruption, and
      finally brain edema [5]. Brain edema leads to an imbalance in
      energy demand and influences on the postsynaptic effects of
      glutamate [6] and interruption of synaptic transmission in the
      penumbra after stroke [7, 8]. Overall, excitotoxicity,
      inflammation and oxidative stress caused by ischemic stroke plays
      a crucial role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke [9, 10].
      To reduce the brain damage caused by cerebral ischemia, the
      solution for oxidative damage is the issue of the greatest
      importance. Vitamin C is the most important antioxidant for
      metabolic function of the brain [11, 12, 13] owing to its low
      redox potential which is capable of neutralizing diverse pro
      oxidants [14, 15, 16, 17]. Mainly, vitamin C could be found in its
      form such as ascorbic acid (AA) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA)
      (AA's oxidized form) [18, 19]. According to earlier studies, lower
      levels of vitamin C are a risk factor of cerebral stroke [20, 21]
      and actually, decreased vitamin C levels has been demonstrated in
      patients with ischemic stroke [22]. Recent study demonstrated that
      the treatment of AA prevented the disruption of BBB and sustained
      the BBB integrity in the cortex [23]. Neuroprotection by DHA has
      been demonstrated in several recent studies in both in vitro and
      in vivo. In in vitro study, DHA has been reported that it inhibits
      mitochondrial damage and cell death against oxidative injury [24].
      Specifically, DHA among vitamin C could crosses the BBB through
      glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) [25] and prevents cell death against
      oxidative damage by increasing glutathione (GSH) levels through
      glucose transporters [26, 27]. In in vivo study, DHA have been
      reported to have protective effects as antioxidants in
      experimental neurological disease models such as stroke [19, 28,
      29, 30]. DHA administration attenuates oxidative stress markers
      and inflammation in hyperglycemic stroke models [31]. However, the
      study on the role of DHA administration through intra-peritoneal
      route in ischemic stroke animal model focused on edema formation,
      neurotoxicity, and synaptic dysfunction has not yet been
      determined. In present study, we investigated DHA's beneficial
      effect after ischemic brain injury in in vivo study. Our results
      show that DHA is involved in the prevention of brain edema
      formation, neurotoxicity, and synaptic dysfunction following
      ischemia injury. Thus, we suggest that DHA might mitigate
      stroke-induced pathological alterations following cerebral
      ischemic stroke...<br>

      </b><b>DISCUSSION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ischemic stroke causes the blockage of cerebral blood vessels in
      the regions of brain, which can lead to human disability and death
      [36]. Subsequently, the blockage of blood vessels following stroke
      leads to diverse pathophysiologies including brain edema, neuronal
      loss, and cognitive dysfunction [37, 38, 39, 40]. Cerebral cortex,
      hippocampus, and corpus striatum in the brain are the most
      vulnerable regions against oxidative stress and hypoxic injury
      induced by cerebral ischemia [41]. Many studies has reported that
      vitamin C among antioxidants is generally neuroprotective in
      response to brain ischemic injury [42, 43, 44, 45]. Oral
      administration of AA to animal had demonstrated that it suppresses
      neuronal damage under cerebral ischemia-reperfusion [46].
      Dehydroascorbic acid as AA's oxidized form [15, 18, 19] has been
      reported that it has a neuroprotective role [47] and is easily
      transported to the brain by mediating glucose transporter 1
      (GLUT1) located in the endothelial cells of the BBB [48]. However,
      DHA did not fully be investigated in ischemic stroke animal model
      in spite of its advantages. We anticipated that DHA as an
      anti-oxidant may considerably affect on cerebral ischemia animal
      because it can rapidly pass through the brain than AA [25]. In
      present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of
      brain by DHA i.p administration in cerebral ischemia rat. First,
      we obtained the consequence that DHA treatment inhibits the brain
      edema formation in MCAO rat brain. Edema defined as an abnormal
      increase in brain water content is frequently observed in cerebral
      ischemia and also has a critical influence on morbidity and
      mortality [49]. Several studies reported that cerebral ischemia
      contributes to damage the integrity and permeability of the BBB
      [50, 51]. Aquaporin (AQP) is the water channel protein that
      facilitates water transport through cell membranes [52, 53].
      Specifically AQP-1 is permeable only to water and is considered to
      participate in brain water homeostasis [54]. In addition, AQP 1
      has been reported that it is involved in edema formation and cell
      death in the hippocampus following brain injury [55]. Following
      our results, we suggest that DHA may reduce osmotic water
      permeability following cerebral ischemia by inhibiting the
      expression of AQP-1. All BBB components have been reported to the
      association with the regulation of the BBB permeability including
      tight junctions of endothelial cells, glia cells [56, 57, 58]. The
      BBB is composed of the brain endothelial cells interconnected with
      transmembrane tight junction proteins such as claudin-5 [59] and
      regulates paracellular permeability [60, 61]. In present study,
      our results indicated that claudin 5 as a tight junction protein
      in DHA treated MCAO rat brain was evidently preserved against
      ischemic injury. According to our results, DHA may protect the BBB
      integrity by preserving tight junction protein in response to
      ischemic injury. Cerebral ischemia induces the neurotoxic
      environment in brain and it could result in the severe neuronal
      cell damage, so we investigated the cell death marker such as Bax
      [62, 63], caspase-3[64, 65], and iNOS [66, 67] in order to examine
      the protective effect of DHA against the neurotoxicity following
      ischemic stroke. In present study, DHA treatment reduced the
      expression of Bax and caspase-3 which is the marker of the
      mitochondrial cell death and iNOS in ischemic injured brain.
      Nitric oxide (NO) that causes neuronal cell death and exacerbates
      glutamate toxicity after cerebral ischemia [68] is synthesized by
      NO synthase such as iNOS [69]. Several studies demonstrated that
      inhibition of iNOS in cerebral ischemia improves neurological
      deficits and reduces infarct volume [70, 71]. In consideration of
      Figure 1 result, our finding suggested that DHA attenuates the
      expression of iNOS and it may be linked to reduced infarct volume
      and improved cell death against hypoxic injury. Additionally, NO
      formed by iNOS has been reported the implicated in
      neurodegeneration [69]. Judging from our result regarding the
      reduced iNOS expression, we suggest the possibility of DHA
      regarding the improvement of cognitive function against ischemic
      stroke although we did not check the production of NO and behavior
      test considering that AA improves the cognitive decline in
      Alzheimer's disease [72]. As mentioned earlier, several studies
      demonstrated that DHA prevents cell death against ischemic injury
      [19, 28, 29, 30]. However, previous studies have not yet been
      determined the effect of DHA on recovery of neuronal function in
      ischemia animal model. Therefore, we tried to examine the effect
      of DHA on neuronal function by measuring indirectly synaptic
      dysfunction in present study. In order to observe the effect of
      DHA on ischemia-induced synaptic connection alteration, we
      investigated the expression of PSD-95 protein in ischemic brain
      tissue. PSD-95 protein as a postsynaptic marker [73, 74] is a
      member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family of
      synaptic molecules and is localized at excitatory synapses [75].
      Postsynaptic densities (PSD) proteins are involved in regulation
      of synaptic function and in the transduction of synaptic signals
      to the postsynaptic cell [76, 77, 78]. Especially, PSD-95 has been
      implicated in the regulation of ion-channel function, synaptic
      activity, and intracellular signaling and finally cognitive
      impairment [79, 80, 81]. In addition, PSD-95 protein is implicated
      in promoting synapse stability and makes synaptic contacts more
      stable in neurons [75]. Recent studies suggested that the PSD-95
      protein improves the neurophysiologic phenomenon after ischemic
      stroke involving MCAO [82, 83]. Moreover, some researchers
      demonstrated that the decrease of PSD-95 protein immunoreactivity
      in the ischemic brain leads to a deficit of postsynaptic
      plasticity in the brain [84]. Several studies suggest that
      PSD-95's reduction is associated with cognitive impairment [85,
      86, 87, 88]. Based on our results, our findings indicate that DHA
      induced the increase of PSD-95 protein immunoreactivity in
      ischemic stroke brain and DHA may improve the ischemic-induced
      synaptic plasticity dysfunction. In addition, although we did not
      check the memory function related behavior test such as water
      maze, we carefully expect that DHA may improve the learning and
      memory dysfunction following cerebral ischemia by promoting the
      neuron's synapse stability. Taken together, our findings suggest
      three points that 1) DHA is involved in the inhibition of AQP-1
      expression and the preservation of claudin 5, ultimately resulting
      in the reduction of edema formation induced by cerebral ischemia,
      2) DHA is associated with the decrease of Bax, cleaved caspase-3
      and iNOS expression, ultimately resulting in the protection of
      cell death against neurotoxicity following cerebral ischemia, 3)
      DHA is linked to the preservation of PSD-95 protein expression,
      ultimately resulting in the improvement of neuron's synaptic
      connection in cerebral ischemia. The present study has some
      limitations fully to prove the beneficial effect of DHA against
      ischemic injury. However, we suggest that this study is worthy in
      that it provide the need of the further study of DHA on ischemic
      stroke. Taken together, we propose that the DHA might be
      beneficial to alleviate clinical pathologies that occur after
      ischemic stroke.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Vitamin C is an essential factor for neuronal function and
      survival, existing in two redox states, ascorbic acid (AA), and
      its oxidized form, dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). Here, we show
      uptake of both AA and DHA by primary cultures of rat brain
      cortical neurons. Moreover, we show that most intracellular AA was
      rapidly oxidized to DHA. Intracellular DHA induced a rapid and
      dramatic decrease in reduced glutathione that was immediately
      followed by a spontaneous recovery. This transient decrease in
      glutathione oxidation was preceded by an increase in the rate of
      glucose oxidation through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and
      a concomitant decrease in glucose oxidation through glycolysis.
      DHA stimulated the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,
      the rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP. Furthermore, we found that
      DHA stimulated the rate of lactate uptake by neurons in a time-
      and dose-dependent manner. Thus, DHA is a novel modulator of
      neuronal energy metabolism by facilitating the utilization of
      glucose through the PPP for antioxidant purposes.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Intestinal vitamin C (Asc) absorption was believed to be mediated
      by the Na+-dependent ascorbic acid transporter SVCT1. However, Asc
      transport across the intestines of SVCT1 knock-out mice is normal
      indicating that alternative ascorbic acid transport mechanisms
      exist. To investigate these mechanisms, rodents were gavaged with
      Asc or its oxidized form dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), and plasma
      Asc concentrations were measured. Asc concentrations doubled
      following DHA but not Asc gavage. We hypothesized that the
      transporters responsible were facilitated glucose transporters
      (GLUTs). Using Xenopus oocyte expression, we investigated whether
      facilitative glucose transporters GLUT2 and GLUT5–12 transported
      DHA. Only GLUT2 and GLUT8, known to be expressed in intestines,
      transported DHA with apparent transport affinities (Km) of 2.33
      and 3.23 mm and maximal transport rates (Vmax) of 25.9 and 10.1
      pmol/min/oocyte, respectively. Maximal rates for DHA transport
      mediated by GLUT2 and GLUT8 in oocytes were lower than maximal
      rates for 2-deoxy-d-glucose (Vmax of 224 and 32 pmol/min/oocyte
      for GLUT2 and GLUT8, respectively) and fructose (Vmax of 406 and
      116 pmol/min/oocyte for GLUT2 and GLUT8, respectively). These
      findings may be explained by differences in the exofacial binding
      of substrates, as shown by inhibition studies with ethylidine
      glucose. DHA transport activity in GLUT2- and GLUT8-expressing
      oocytes was inhibited by glucose, fructose, and by the flavonoids
      phloretin and quercetin. These studies indicate intestinal DHA
      transport may be mediated by the facilitative sugar transporters
      GLUT2 and GLUT8. Furthermore, dietary sugars and flavonoids in
      fruits and vegetables may modulate Asc bioavailability via
      inhibition of small intestinal GLUT2 and GLUT8.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract:</b><br>
      <br>
      In the present study, ascorbic acid weakly inhibited the
      multiplication of viruses of three different families: herpes
      simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), influenza virus type A and
      poliovirus type 1. Dehydroascorbic acid, an oxidized form of
      ascorbic acid and hence without reducing ability, showed much
      stronger antiviral activity than ascorbic acid, indicating that
      the antiviral activity of ascorbic acid is due to factors other
      than an antioxidant mechanism. Moreover, addition of 1 mM Fe3+,
      which oxidizes ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid and also
      enhances the formation of hydroxyl radicals by ascorbic acid in
      the culture media, strongly enhanced the antiviral activity of
      ascorbic acid to a level significantly stronger than that of
      dehydroascorbic acid. Although both ascorbic acid and
      dehydroascorbic acid showed some cytotoxicity, the degree of
      cytotoxicity of the former was 10-fold higher than the latter,
      suggesting that the observed antiviral activity of ascorbic acid
      with and without ferric ion is, at least in part, a secondary
      result of the cytotoxic effect of the reagent, most likely due to
      the free radicals. However, the possibility that oxidation of
      ascorbic acid also contributed to the antiviral effects of
      ascorbic acid exists, in particular in the presence of ferric ion,
      since dehydroascorbic acid exhibited a very strong antiviral
      activity. Characterization of the mode of antiviral action of
      dehydroascorbic acid revealed that the addition of the reagent
      even at 11 h post infection almost completely inhibited the
      formation of progeny infectious virus in the infected cells,
      indicating that the reagent inhibits HSV-1 multiplication probably
      at the assembly process of progeny virus particles after the
      completion of viral DNA replication. <br>

      <br>
      To evaluate the dehydroascorbate (DHA) transport mechanisms in
      human chondrocytes.<br>
      <b><br>
        Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The transport of L-14C-DHA in human chondrocytes was analyzed
      under various conditions, including the use of RNA interference
      (RNAi), to determine the role of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1)
      and GLUT-3 in L-14C-DHA transport and to evaluate the effects of
      physiologically relevant oxygen tensions on L-14C-DHA transport.
      In order to estimate the contributions of reduced ascorbic acid
      (AA) and DHA to intracellular ascorbic acid (Asc), the quantities
      of AA and DHA were measured in synovial fluid samples from
      osteoarthritis (OA) patients and compared with the reported levels
      in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><br>
      <br>
      DHA transport in human chondrocytes was glucose-sensitive,
      temperature-dependent, cytochalasin B–inhibitable, modestly
      stereoselective for L-DHA, and up-regulated by low oxygen tension.
      Based on the RNAi results, GLUT-1 mediated, at least in part, the
      uptake of DHA, whereas GLUT-3 had a minimal effect on DHA
      transport. DHA constituted a mean 8% of the total Asc in the
      synovial fluid of OA joints, in contrast to 80% of the reported
      total Asc in RA joints.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      We provide the first evidence that chondrocytes transport DHA via
      the GLUTs and that this transport mechanism is modestly selective
      for L-DHA. In the setting of up-regulated DHA transport at low
      oxygen tensions, DHA would contribute 26% of the total
      intracellular Asc in OA chondrocytes and 94% of that in RA
      chondrocytes. These results demonstrate that DHA is a
      physiologically relevant source of Asc for chondrocytes,
      particularly in the setting of an inflammatory arthritis, such as
      RA.<br>

      Processes to produce dehydroascorbic acid at the time of use are
      provided, so that this unstable form of vitamin C can be
      conveniently utilized for dietary purposes. Products produced by
      these processes are also described.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0001] 1. Field of Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] This invention relates to the field of improved absorption
      of orally ingested vitamin C, and more specifically to the form of
      vitamin C known as dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA). DHAA is the
      naturally-occurring oxidized form of vitamin C, and has many
      unique properties as compared to the reduced form, ascorbic acid
      (AA). Many of these properties are described in U.S. Pat. No.
      8,324,269 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by
      reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Absorption of orally ingested vitamin C into the cells of
      the gut is mediated by transport proteins in the cell membrane. AA
      or ascorbate ion absorption occurs via various members of the
      family of transport proteins known as SVCT, whereas DHAA is
      absorbed utilizing members of the GLUT family. GLUT transporters
      are a type known as passive transporters, which in general means
      that they transport more rapidly than the type known as active
      transporters. <br>
      <br>
      Also passive transport is not a saturable mechanism as is active
      transport. Furthermore, GLUT transporters are abundant in the
      nutrient-absorbing cells lining the gut because these transporters
      also transport common sugars like glucose. Taken together, these
      facts mean that DHAA can be absorbed much more rapidly and
      efficiently when orally ingested than can the more common AA,
      because the SVCT transport proteins are active transporters that
      can be saturated and are less abundant in the gut. Therefore oral
      consumption of DHAA has great advantages as compared to the oral
      consumption of AA that is found in common vitamin C supplements,
      including greater bioavailability of larger doses, more rapid
      absorption, and higher vitamin C blood levels post consumption.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Background art includes U.S. patent application Ser. No.
      10/572,790 (Mar. 21, 2006) of Gassier (now abandoned). Gassier
      describes a method of producing DHAA by supplying multi-part
      components that can be combined to cause the oxidation of
      ascorbate to DHAA for a cosmetic purpose. But Cassier's invention
      requires at least one cosmetic ingredient, and is silent as to the
      use of the product for oral ingestion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] DHAA is a notoriously unstable chemical compound; in
      aqueous solution, particularly at neutral or basic pH and at
      warmer temperatures, it undergoes rapid hydrolysis to
      2,3-diketogulonic acid (DKG) and irreversibly loses its vitamin C
      activity. Thus it is difficult and expensive to provide to
      consumers for convenient oral consumption. I have now found that
      DHAA can be provided conveniently and economically by creating it
      at the time of use, such that extended storage is not necessary. I
      have found that DHAA can be rapidly created by a simple method
      using AA (or some other form of reduced ascorbate, such as sodium
      ascorbate) as the substrate, using oxygen as a second substrate,
      and using an enzyme called Ascorbic Acid Oxidase that is found
      naturally in many plants, and is particularly abundant in zucchini
      fruits. Oxygen may be provided by stirring the mixture in air, or
      by bubbling air through the mixture. <br>
      <br>
      Methods and the products produced by these methods are described
      here.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] In a preferred embodiment, certain fresh, raw vegetables
      that contain the enzyme Ascorbic Acid Oxidase can be used to
      rapidly produce DHAA by oxidation of AA in a puree of the
      vegetable. For example, zucchini squash is known to contain
      extremely high levels of AAO. See Example 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In another embodiment, the peelings from the skin and
      fleshy middle layer (the epicarp and mesocarp) of zucchini fruit
      were used. It is known that the AAO enzyme is found at higher
      concentrations in the epicarp and outer mesocarp than in the
      endocarp and seeds of the zucchini fruit and other fruits and
      vegetables. By using the outer portions, a higher concentration of
      AAO can be obtained in a puree. See Example 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In another embodiment, AA was added in increments, or
      stages, to zucchini puree. It is known that AAO has an optimal pH
      range for activity, generally between about pH 4 and pH 9. It is
      also known that extreme pH values in solutions can prevent enzyme
      reactions from proceeding and even destroy the enzyme activity
      altogether. One way to take advantage of the powerful AAO enzyme
      activity of zucchini without killing the reaction with too much AA
      acidity is to add the AA in increments instead of all at once. As
      the AA is oxidized, the pH of the puree goes up since DHAA is not
      acidic. Then additional AA can be added. This process can be
      repeated many times, keeping the pH of the puree within the
      optimal pH range while accumulating very high concentrations of
      DHAA. <br>
      <br>
      See Example 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Since DHAA is much less stable at neutral pH than at acidic
      pH, it is desirable to maintain the pH of a puree below about 7.0
      during the oxidation process to avoid hydrolysis of the DHAA after
      it is produced. It is surprisingly found that a puree of zucchini
      is more acidic than pH 7.0 naturally, and it is also surprisingly
      discovered that as more AA is added, the pH of the final puree is
      more acidic. See Example 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In addition to AA, other forms of reduced vitamin C such as
      ascorbate ion can also be oxidized by AAO, including such salt
      forms as sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate, and chemical
      derivatives of AA such as ascorbyl phosphate and ascorbyl
      palmitate. All forms of reduced AA, including ascorbate and
      oxidizable derivates of AA may be employed in this process. I have
      found that concentrations of reduced vitamin C from as low as 0.1%
      w/w to as high as 20% w/w may be effectively oxidized according to
      the embodiments described here.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Acids, bases and buffers can be added to adjust the pH to
      desirable levels, before during or after the oxidation process.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Recovery of DHAA in the product is about 95%. See Example
      3.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Product can be stored for at least 13 days frozen with
      minimal loss of DHAA. Therefore the product can be distributed in
      the frozen state. See Example 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The oxidized product can be further combined with polyol
      such as glycerin for longer stability, or flavoring, or texture
      adjustment.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Zucchini fruit, other vegetable matter containing AAO, or
      parts thereof can be frozen to preserve the natural AAO activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Dried or freeze-dried zucchini fruit or parts thereof can
      be used because enzyme activity is preserved on drying. AAO, and
      other enzymes, may be extracted from vegetables to create
      partially purified or highly purified extracts. These extracts may
      be dried or crystallized, or stabilized by other means to protect
      the enzyme activity. The dried vegetable matter or purified
      extracts can be combined with water and reduced vitamin C in a
      solution to create DHAA.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Agents that solubilize enzymes that are localized in the
      cell walls or cell membranes of plants can enhance the rate or
      reliability of the enzyme reaction or enhance the recovery of
      enzymes in extracts. Such agents include surfactants and
      detergents, chaotropes, and lytic enzymes. Representative agents
      include non-ionic detergents such as Triton-X, SDS, and lytic
      enzymes that specifically degrade the cell wall or cell membrane,
      including various proteases, pectinases, cellulases and
      hemicellulases.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Other agents can enhance enzyme activity or recovery and
      include agents to control ionic strength, osmotic strength, and
      the activity of nucleases and proteases.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Peroxidases and catalases in vegetables help stabilize AAO
      to prevent inactivation and exhaustion of the AAO during reaction.
      Using certain vegetables therefore provides the unexpected
      advantage of providing both AAO and peroxidase.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Numerous other vegetables contain AAO activity and/or
      catalase and/or peroxidase activity including Arabidopsis,
      Brassica, Cucumis, Cucurbita, Myrothecium, Nicotiana, Oryza,
      Sinapis, Titicum species, cabbage, squashes, pumpkins, peas,
      string beans, Lima beans, sweet corn, Swiss chard, carrots,
      parsnips, and spinach. Other vegetables can be used in this
      process to produce DHAA product. Combinations of different
      vegetables can be used to optimize the AAO/catalase/peroxidase
      ratios and to optimize the pH of a puree, or a solution, or a
      suspension of vegetable matter. Synthetic AAO enzyme may also be
      produced by methods known in the art, and may also be used instead
      of natural vegetable matter containing AAO.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] A desirable product can be made by combining fruit(s) or
      vegetable(s) that is/are naturally high in AA content with
      fruit(s) or vegetable(s) that is/are naturally high in AAO
      content, to create a completely natural product containing a high
      content of DHAA.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] A product can be made that is dried vegetable or vegetable
      parts plus AA or other form of reduced ascorbate, either mixed
      together or separately packaged, for rehydration and mixing with
      air to produce DHAA. This has the advantage of a stable enzyme,
      providing catalase and/or peroxidase, allowing proportions of
      enzyme vs. AA and time of reaction to be pre-determined, and
      assuring the oxidation reaction will work in the hands of the
      consumer.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] A product can be in the form of a kit, including such
      additional components as a redox indicator, mixing vessel,
      instructions, gelatin, pH adjusters, mixing tools, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The dried vegetable and AA, or the mixture of the two, can
      be distributed in pouches, unitized doses, tablets, capsules, or
      other convenient containers or easy to handle forms, including
      pre-measured amounts.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Gelatin capsules would provide gelatin for the reaction,
      which stabilizes AAO.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Copper can be added to a puree or solution containing AAO
      to enhance the activity and stability of the enzyme. Copper can be
      provided in the form of a soluble copper salt, or a solution
      containing dissolved copper, or by mixing the solution in a
      container made of copper. I have found that copper in the
      concentration of about 0.01 mg/dl up to about 20 mg/dl is
      effective for increasing the activity of the enzyme, and extending
      the period of time that the enzyme remains active before it is
      exhausted. Although copper ions alone are known in the art to
      increase the oxidation rate of AA in solution, this rate is much
      slower than the rate at which oxidation occurs in the presence of
      AAO. It is an unexpected discovery that the AAO enzyme activity is
      greatly increased, i.e. to a much higher rate than would be
      expected due to the copper activity alone, by the presence of
      copper ions in the concentrations described. It is an unexpected
      and surprising discovery that the enzyme remains active for longer
      periods of time when copper ions are added. This effect may be
      attributable to providing additional copper ions that are
      available to restore the copper ions found naturally in the AAO
      enzyme, as it has been reported that copper ions are exchanged
      between the enzyme and the solution during the oxidation process.
      The applicant does not wish to be held to this explanation,
      however, as other explanations are possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] AA concentration in solution is commonly measured as the
      reducing activity of the solution using starch-iodine titration
      methods that are well-known in the art. Modification of the
      starch-iodine titration method can be used to detect AA in a
      vegetable/AA puree and therefore provide a process and a product
      for determining if and when AA has been converted to DHAA. A
      product or reagent for this process can be described as a redox
      indicator reagent.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] A redox reagent can be made by combining iodine, iodide,
      and starch in solution. Such redox reagent can be optimized in
      concentration, or utilized in various amounts, to indicate various
      concentrations of AA.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Starch-iodine redox reagent can be dried on paper or
      immobilized by other methods to provide a convenient test such as
      a paper test strip or pad.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] A redox reagent utilizing a different chemical or chemicals
      known to be indicators of reduction-oxidation potential can be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Progress of oxidation of AA to DHAA may be monitored by pH
      measurements.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] A business method can involve the production of “vegetable
      smoothies” containing DHAA in retail outlets, or licensing or
      franchise.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] A business method can involve the licensing of the rights
      or directions to produce DHAA.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] An apparatus optimized to puree the vegetable, or enhance
      air or oxygen incorporation, or otherwise improve upon available
      apparatus can be made.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] An oxygen-generating chemical additive, or air pump, or
      enriched oxygen gas can be incorporated.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Flavorings or colors can be added to enhance the flavor or
      appearance of the product. In particular, flavorings selected from
      the group not including sugars that are absorbed by the same GLUT
      transporters that transport DHAA are preferred, because sugars
      that are transported by the same transporters may competitively
      inhibit the transport of DHAA.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0038] Two cups of diced zucchini fruit were placed in a 2-quart
      blender with about 1⁄2 cup water and pureed for about 1 minute.
      Four commercially available vitamin C tablets containing 1000 mg
      AA each (Kirkland brand, Item 98268, Lot T00007 from Costco) were
      dissolved in 1⁄4 cup hot water and added to the puree. Blender was
      capped and turned on to mix and the puree was tested periodically
      using a starch-iodine redox indicator for the presence of AA
      reducing activity. <br>
      <br>
      At about one minute, the redox indicator showed the presence of AA
      reducing activity. Within 10 minutes, the redox indicator showed
      that no more AA reducing activity was present in the puree,
      demonstrating that all of the AA in the puree had been oxidized to
      DHAA by oxygen that had been mixed into the puree from the air
      inside the blender, catalyzed by the AAO activity of the enzyme in
      the zucchini.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0039] Four zucchini fruits about 6-8 inches long were purchased
      at a local grocery store. The shelf labeling indicated the fruits
      were a product of Mexico, as might be expected in Utah during the
      month of November when this experiment was conducted. Thus the
      fruit was not locally-grown and probably older (stored longer
      since picked) than known fresh-picked fruit. It is known that the
      AAO activity of zucchini fruit decreases during storage after
      being picked. The epicarp and outer portions of the mesocarp were
      peeled from the fruits, to the extent that approximately one-half
      of the weight of each fruit was included in the peelings. 300
      grams of peelings were added to a blender with 100 grams purified
      water and pureed. 20 grams of the puree was removed and reserved
      for a “blank”. To the remaining puree (380 grams) was added 1.4
      grams AA (as pure crystals approximately US mesh size 20-40) and
      the puree was mixed in the blender about 1 minute. The pH of the
      puree was measured and found to be 5.2, and a redox test indicated
      AA reducing activity in the puree. The puree was allowed to stand
      with periodic brief mixing for 35 minutes. At this point, the pH
      was 6.5 and the redox test showed that all AA was oxidized. A 20
      gram portion was removed for a “test.” The blank and test
      solutions were centrifuged to remove the pulp so that pulp-free
      solutions could be spectrophotometrically analyzed. 25 uL of each
      of these solutions were diluted in 10 mL of 0.15 M phosphoric acid
      diluent, and the absorbance of each was determined using a UV
      spectrometer at 262 nm wavelength blanked against diluent. 2 mL of
      each dilution were combined with 2 mL of a TCEP reagent, incubated
      one hour, and then the absorbance at 262 nm of these solutions
      were determined as above (TCEP reagent reduces DHAA in the
      solution to AA; absorbance measurements at wavelengths where AA
      strongly absorbs, before and after treatment with TCEP, is a
      method known to practitioners in the art to quantify DHAA
      concentration by the differential absorption principle). The
      following absorption values were obtained (TCEP values are
      corrected for the X2 dilution):<br>

      <br>
      [0040] The Abs difference demonstrates that substantial amounts of
      DHAA are present in the “Test” puree as compared to the “Blank”
      puree.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><br>
      <br>
      [0041] One whole zucchini fruit weighing 235 grams was pureed in
      120 mL water in a blender. The pH of the initial zucchini puree
      was 6.5. At time 0 minutes, 1.0 gram crystalline AA was added.
      After mixing 30 seconds, the pH was 5.0. At the times indicated in
      the table below, pH was recorded, iodine indicator redox result
      was recorded, and/or additional AA in the amounts indicated were
      added after testing the pH and redox status. The zucchini puree
      was continuously mixed in the blender during the entire time, and
      a cap in the top of the blender was left open to allow fresh air
      to be drawn into the vortex of the puree in the blender. The redox
      test results are reported + or −, ‘+’ indicating that AA reducing
      activity was detected, and ‘−’ indicating that AA reducing
      activity was not detected.<br>

        <b>STABLE COMPOSITIONS OF DEHYDROASCORBIC ACID</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The invention relates to stable liquid compositions containing the
      oxidized form of vitamin C known as dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA).
      The compositions comprise DHAA and a pharmacologically acceptable
      liquid organic polyol solvent. The polyol solvent comprises about
      50% or greater of the total weight of the composition. The
      compositions are useful as dietary supplements, skin-enhancers,
      concentrates, or research solutions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0002] 1. Field of Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] This invention relates to compositions of matter used as
      sources of vitamin C in dietary supplementation, skin care
      products, therapy, research, and manufacturing. More specifically,
      the invention relates to stable liquid compositions containing the
      oxidized form of vitamin C known as dehydroascorbic acid.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Ever since the elucidation of the chemical structure of
      vitamin C in the mid-1930's it has been known that vitamin C
      occurs naturally as two different compounds, namely, ascorbic acid
      (AA) and an oxidized form of AA called dehydroascorbic acid
      (DHAA). It also is known that AA and DHAA are unstable compounds.
      In aqueous solutions, some factors which affect the rate of their
      destruction include the pH of the solution, and exposure to
      various metal ions, heat, light and air. It also is known that
      DHAA is considerably less stable than AA when subjected to
      comparable conditions. ‘Deutsch J C. Dehydroascorbic acid. Review
      Journal of Chromatography A, 881 (2000) 299-307’ (Deutsch),
      incorporated here by reference, states en-equivocally “DHA is more
      reactive and unstable in solution than AA.” Therefore, as a
      supplement to the diet, or as an ingredient of a topically applied
      product such as a skin lotion, AA has been the preferred chemical
      form of vitamin C because of its greater stability. In fact, we do
      not know of any commercially available dietary or topically
      applied product wherein DHAA specifically has been utilized as a
      substantial source of vitamin C.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Also known is that solid AA is far more easily dissolved in
      water than is solid DHAA, as noted in ‘Pecherer B J. The
      Preparation of Dehydro-L-ascorbic Acid and its Methanol Complex.
      Am Chem Soc 73 (1951) 3827-3830’ (Pecherer) and ‘Koliou E K and
      Ioannou P V. Preparation of dehydro-L-ascorbic acid dimer by air
      oxidation of L-ascorbic acid in the presence of catalytic amounts
      of copper(II) acetate and pyridine. Carbohydrate Research 340
      (2005) 315-318’ (Koliou) which are incorporated here by reference.
      To prepare aqueous solutions of DHAA from the solid form requires
      prolonged mixing at temperatures well above 37 degrees centigrade.
      Thus solutions of DHAA are much more difficult to manufacture than
      solutions of AA. Also, since the conditions to solubilize it
      efficiently do not exist in the gut of human or other animals,
      substantial doubt exists about whether the dry, solid form of DHAA
      can be absorbed when ingested. These are also reasons why DHAA has
      not been utilized as the source of vitamin C for dietary
      supplements or topical products.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Around the same time as the chemical structures of AA and
      DHAA were elucidated in the mid- 1930's, the antiscorbutic
      properties (ability to prevent the disease called scurvy) of both
      compounds were recognized and generally accepted as being equal or
      nearly so. The oxidation of AA to DHAA was shown to be reversible
      both in vitro and in biological systems, so the equivalence of the
      two compounds could easily be attributed to simple interconversion
      within an organism. Although a few early investigators did note
      some peculiar differences in the biological utilization of these
      two compounds, at least as essential dietary ingredients for
      humans and certain other species, AA and DHAA were generally
      considered bioequivalent. The dietary supplement and skin care
      product industries developed their products using AA (and various
      more stable derivatives of AA) because of the stability and
      solubility issues with DHAA, and DHAA has essentially been ignored
      and forgotten in these industries.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Since the mid-1930's, the volume of research in vitamin C
      has been enormous, and it is possible that no single subject in
      the field of biology has been the focus of more research and more
      scientific journal articles than vitamin C. And since about the
      mid-1990's, many new discoveries about DHAA have been made. Among
      these discoveries, those of particular pertinence to the present
      invention include those which demonstrate that, although the two
      compounds are equivalent in their antiscorbutic properties, AA and
      DHAA are not “bioequivalent” in any broad definition of the word.
      Specifically it is known today that AA and DHAA are absorbed by
      different mechanisms in the gut; that they accumulate differently
      in the various tissues of an animal when ingested; that they are
      absorbed into living cells by completely different mechanisms
      utilizing different receptors on the cell surface; that the cells
      of certain important tissues of the human body (e.g., brain) have
      a very high concentration of vitamin C but completely lack cell
      surface receptors for AA; that DHAA is absorbed into cells by the
      same receptors as glucose, which are present on every cell in the
      human body; that in human skin cells, DHAA is absorbed up to 5
      times faster and to levels 2 times higher than is AA; that DHAA is
      almost instantly converted into AA once it has been absorbed into
      a cell; that both AA and DHAA have antiviral effects in vitro
      against viruses that cause disease in humans such as HSV-1 (herpes
      simplex virus type 1 that causes oral herpes and can cause genital
      herpes), influenza virus, and poliovirus; and that DHAA has much
      stronger antiviral effects than does AA. Literature that supports
      these statements, and is incorporated here by reference, includes
      ‘Savini et al. Dehydroascorbic acid uptake in a human keratinocyte
      cell line (HaCaT) is glutathione-independent. Biochem J 345 (2000)
      665-672’ (Savini) and ‘Furuya et al. Antiviral effects of ascorbic
      and dehydroascorbic acids in vitro. Int J Mol Med 22 (2008)
      541-545’ (Furuya).<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Thus it can be seen that a solution of DHAA for oral
      ingestion or topical application, while being a source of vitamin
      C much like numerous other available products that contain AA,
      also can provide specific benefits and uses unavailable in any
      other product on the market today. What is needed is a stable
      liquid solution of DHAA in an orally and topically acceptable
      medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] U.S. Pat. No. 5,140,043 (Darr) discloses topical
      compositions of ascorbic acid (or a reducing analog of ascorbic
      acid) in a water-(glycol or polyol) carrier, wherein the ratio of
      water to glycol/polyol carrier is high (e.g., at least 1:1). These
      solutions of Darr do not contain DHAA, and Darr is silent as to
      the stability of the non-reducing compound DHAA in this carrier.
      We have found that DHAA is not stable in polyol solutions
      containing such high concentrations of water, which points out
      that no assumptions about the chemical and physical behavior of
      DHAA in polyol solutions should be drawn from the behavior of AA
      in those solutions. While AA and DHAA share certain biological
      functions, they are two different molecules in regard to their
      physical and chemical behavior, including stability.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,813 (Hegenauer) discloses stable
      vitamin C compositions of mineral ascorbates in liquid organic
      polyol solvents having pH values of about 5 to 7, but is silent as
      to the stability of the non-mineral DHAA in those solvents. These
      compositions of Hegenaur do not contain DHAA. In fact, these
      compositions do not even contain a naturally-occurring form of
      vitamin C, and therefore if these compositions were applied to the
      skin, vitamin C would not be expected to be absorbed by either the
      ascorbic acid receptors or the glucose receptors of skin cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] US Patent Application 2009/0016974 A1 (Pruche et al)
      discloses DHAA-containing compositions formed “in situ” from
      ascorbic acid via chemical oxidation and/or via enzymatic
      oxidation, and a two-component agent thereof These compositions
      attempt to overcome the instability of DHAA by preparing it fresh
      as needed, but they require handling and mixing steps of the
      two-component agent. The two components must be stored separately.
      Chemical oxidizers are harsh and can be dangerous, and enzymes are
      unstable, thus these compositions are problematic in regard to
      safety and reliability. Since the two components are intended to
      be combined by the end user, the temperature of the reaction and
      other conditions necessary for reliable oxidation processes are
      beyond the control of the manufacturer. Without some separate
      indicator, the final consumer cannot be assured that the solution
      prepared by the two-component system actually contains DHAA,
      because the oxidation of AA to DHAA is not visually or otherwise
      simply detected. These compositions do not contain DHAA
      pre-prepared in a stable solution, and Pruche et al is silent as
      to the stability of DHAA in the disclosed compositions.<br>

        <br>
        DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0030] We have discovered that DHAA is stable in solutions of pure
      polyol solvents and in solutions wherein the polyol content is
      greater than about 50 percent. By “stable” is meant that DHAA in
      these solutions deteriorates very slowly over a sufficient period
      of time that it can be stored and sold as a dietary supplement or
      as a skin care product, or as a concentrate for preparing or
      manufacturing them, with a reasonable shelf life.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In one embodiment, a DHAA composition is provided wherein
      the composition comprises 50% or more polyol by weight and a ratio
      of DHAA to AA of from greater than 1:100, 1:50, 1:10, 1:5, 3:10,
      1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 10:3, 5:1, 10:1, 50:1, or 100:1.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In one embodiment, a DHAA composition is provided wherein
      the composition comprises 50% or more polyol by weight and greater
      than 0.05%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.83%, 1.7, or 2.5% DHAA.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In one embodiment, a DHAA composition is provided wherein
      the composition comprises 50% or more polyol by weight and about
      0.85% to 15% DHAA.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In one embodiment, a method of treating a disease or
      condition is provided comprising identifying an individual in need
      of treatment and administering to said individual a DHAA
      composition comprising 50% or more by weight of a polyol. In one
      aspect, the DHAA composition comprises a pharmaceutically
      acceptable carrier. In one aspect, the composition is suitable for
      oral administration. In one aspect, the composition is suitable
      for intravenous administration. In one aspect, the composition is
      suitable for intraperitoneal administration. In one aspect, the
      composition is suitable for topical administration.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In some embodiments, the method of treating a disease or
      condition comprises identifying an individual having a disease or
      condition that may be treated by DHAA, AA, or a combination
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In some embodiments, the method of treating a disease or
      condition further comprises administration of a second agent. In
      some aspects, the second agent is an anti-cancer agent, an
      antiviral agent, or an agent used for treating a neurodegenerative
      disease or condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The solutions are made by oxidizing ascorbic acid that is
      first dissolved in a pure polyol solvent, or in water, or in some
      mixture of these liquids. The polyol concentration may be adjusted
      to about 50% or greater prior to oxidizing the AA or afterwards.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The solutions can also be made by oxidizing AA that is
      dissolved in an alcohol (e.g., ethanol), and then combining the
      DHAA-containing alcohol with a polyol solvent. If it is desired
      that the final solution does not contain alcohol, the alcohol can
      be removed by evaporating the alcohol from the polyol solvent
      solution using heat or vacuum, or both.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The solutions can also be made by dissolving solid DHAA in
      a pure polyol solvent, or in water, or in some mixture of these
      liquids. The polyol concentration may be adjusted to about 50% or
      greater prior to dissolving the DHAA or afterwards.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The organic polyol solvents are chosen for pharmaceutical
      and dietary acceptability, their ability to solubilize the AA and
      DHAA component, water content, and effect on the stability of the
      DHAA component. At present we prefer to employ commercially
      available glycerol which generally contains 5% or less water. In
      general, we prefer to minimize the water content of the
      solvent(s), consistent with economic and functional
      considerations. Other polyols which can be employed include
      propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, butylene glycol and the almost
      infinite molecular weight range of polyethylene glycols, as well
      as so-called sugar alcohols, e.g., sorbitol and xylitol, and
      mixtures thereof with other polyols.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] These solutions can be prepared entirely with one polyol
      solvent, e.g., glycerol, or mixtures of polyol solvents. The final
      choice of solvent will depend on economics and other relevant
      factors.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Methods we have successfully applied for oxidizing the
      ascorbic acid include the use of halogen or ozone or
      oxygen/activated charcoal or Fenton's Reagent or ascorbic acid
      oxidase enzyme. All of these methods are known in the art, as are
      other methods; the previously cited references Pecherer and Koliou
      show typical applications of various methods for example. The
      method by which the oxidation is accomplished is not the
      determinant factor of the long term stability of the DHAA in the
      solution, and other methods of oxidation are within the scope of
      the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] AA concentration in solution is commonly measured as the
      reducing activity of the solution using starch-iodine titration
      methods that are well-known in the art. AA is also measured by
      ultra-violet spectrophotometry using a wavelength at which AA
      absorbs strongly and DHAA does not, typically about 265 nm. <br>
      <br>
      This method is also well known in the art. DHAA in solution can be
      converted into AA by reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT)
      or tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), and its concentration is
      commonly measured spectrophotometrically as the difference in
      absorbance of a solution subjected to reduction by DTT or TCEP
      versus a similar solution that is not subjected to a reducing
      agent. These methods are also well-known in the art, but see
      Deutsch for examples. In the description, claims, and the
      following examples, DHAA in the compositions of the invention is
      the vitamin C that can be measured by the difference in absorbance
      at 262 nm using TCEP reducing agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The following embodiments are exemplary of the invention:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0045] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, AA dissolved in
      glycerol and/or water is oxidized using ozone to produce DHAA
      solutions. Water-based solutions and glycerol-based solutions may
      be combined to yield stable DHAA compositions having the desired
      polyol concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] A 15% AA solution in water was prepared by adding 15 grams
      AA per 100 mL purified water with stirring. A 15% solution of AA
      in glycerol was prepared by adding 15 grams AA per 100 mL pure USP
      glycerol and stirring with heat. A corona-discharge type ozone
      generator with feed-gas of pure oxygen was used to supply an
      oxidizing gas containing about 5% ozone, and each of the 15% AA
      solutions was subjected to oxidizing conditions by bubbling the
      oxidizing gas through the solution using a glass diffuser. The
      progress of AA oxidation in each solution was monitored by the
      disappearance of reducing activity as measured by starch-iodine
      titration. Each solution was subjected to the oxidizing conditions
      until all (&gt;99%) of the original reducing activity had
      disappeared. The solution made with pure glycerol was labeled
      “100% Glycerol,” and the solution made with purified water was
      labeled “100% Water.” Portions of these two solutions were
      combined to produce solutions of various glycerol concentrations
      by weight, specifically “99% Glycerol,” “98% Glycerol,” “97%
      Glycerol,” “96% Glycerol,” “95% Glycerol”, “90% Glycerol,” and
      “50% Glycerol.” For example, 99 parts by weight of “100% Glycerol”
      was combined with 1 part by weight “100% Water” to produce the
      “99% Glycerol” solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Aliquots of each of the solutions prepared above were
      placed in translucent, screw-capped polyethylene vials and were
      stored at room temperature. No attempt was made to further protect
      the vials from ambient indoor light, and each vial contained a
      headspace of normal air. Each vial was periodically opened to
      remove a sample for stability testing over the next 229 days. The
      concentration of DHAA in each sample was measured by spectrometry
      on each testing day. <br>
      <br>
      The initial DHAA concentration of each solution on Day 1 was
      recorded and assigned a value of 100%, and the concentration on
      each subsequent stability test day was calculated as the percent
      remaining of the initial concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] FIGS. 1 through 8 show the results of stability testing of
      the various glycerol-containing solutions; each graph also shows
      the result of the “100% Water” solution for comparison. It can be
      seen that DHAA decomposes rapidly in water. By the time the water
      solution was tested at 20 days, less than 10 percent of the
      initial amount of DHAA remained. By contrast, DHAA is preserved
      very well in solutions containing high concentrations of glycerol.
      In pure glycerol for example, greater than 80% of the initial DHAA
      concentration remains even after approximately 8 months of storage
      at room temperature. As the glycerol concentration is reduced,
      stability is reduced, until only minor improvement is gained at
      50% glycerol concentration.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0049] In another embodiment, a stable DHAA composition is
      produced by oxidation of AA dissolved in glycerol using exposure
      to activated charcoal and oxygen as the oxidation method.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] A solution of AA in pure USP glycerol was subjected to
      oxidizing conditions by suspending activated charcoal in the
      solution and then bubbling pure oxygen through the solution.
      Oxidation of AA during this process was monitored by starch-iodine
      titration. After the desired amount of AA had been oxidized, the
      activated charcoal was removed from the solution by centrifugation
      and filtration. This solution was labeled “100% Glycerol.” A
      portion of the solution was then placed in a translucent,
      screw-capped polyethylene vial and was stored at room temperature.
      No attempt was made to further protect the vial from ambient
      indoor light, and the vial contained a headspace of normal air.
      The vial was periodically opened to remove a sample for stability
      testing over the next 191 days. The concentration of DHAA in the
      sample was measured by spectrometry on each testing day. The
      initial DHAA concentration of the solution on Day 1 was recorded
      and assigned a value of 100%, and the concentration on each
      subsequent stability test day was calculated as the percent
      remaining of the initial concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] FIG. 9 shows the results of the stability testing of this
      solution, and for comparison also shows the stability of a DHAA
      solution prepared in purified water (labeled “100% Water”). It can
      be seen that DHAA in glycerol produced by an alternative oxidation
      method shows excellent long-term stability.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0052] In another embodiment, stable DHAA compositions are
      produced by oxidizing AA dissolved in water using Fenton's Reagent
      as the oxidizing method, and then combining the water solution
      with propylene glycol such that the final concentration of polyol
      is 50% or greater.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] AA was dissolved in purified water to give a highly
      concentrated solution, and then sufficient 30% hydrogen peroxide
      was added to oxidize about half of the AA. Iron to catalyze the
      reaction was provided by addition of ferrous sulfate. Oxidation of
      the AA was monitored by spectrometry until the expected amount of
      AA had been oxidized. This solution was labeled “100% Water.”
      Portions of this solution were combined with portions of pure, USP
      grade propylene glycol to produce solutions of “97% Propylene
      Glycol,” “95% Propylene Glycol,” “90% Propylene Glycol,” “80%
      Propylene Glycol,” “70% Propylene Glycol,” and “50% Propylene
      Glycol.” For example, 3 parts by volume of the “100% Water”
      solution were combined with 97 parts by volume propylene glycol to
      yield the “97% Propylene Glycol” solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Aliquots of each of the solutions prepared above were
      placed in translucent, screw-capped polyethylene vials and were
      stored at room temperature. No attempt was made to further protect
      the vials from ambient indoor light, and each vial contained a
      headspace of normal air. Each vial was periodically opened to
      remove a sample for stability testing over the next 31 days. The
      concentration of DHAA in each sample was measured by spectrometry
      on each testing day. <br>
      <br>
      The initial DHAA concentration of each solution was recorded and
      assigned a value of 100% (Day 0), and the concentration on each
      subsequent stability test day was calculated as the percent
      remaining of the initial concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIGS. 10 through 15 show the results of stability testing
      of the various propylene glycol- containing solutions; each graph
      also shows the result of the “100% Water” solution for comparison.
      It can be seen that DHAA decomposes rapidly in water; after only 5
      days, less than 20 percent of the initial amount of DHAA remains.
      By contrast, DHAA is preserved very well in solutions containing
      high concentrations of propylene glycol. In fact, the DHAA
      concentration in many of these solutions actually increased
      significantly over time, a remarkable and unexpected discovery. We
      believe this phenomenon can be explained this way: residual AA
      continues to oxidize while the DHAA is stabilized and therefore
      accumulates in the solution. The spectrophotometric measurements
      support this explanation, but we do not wish to be bound by this
      explanation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0056] demonstrates that stable DHAA compositions may be prepared
      using a third alternative oxidation method as compared with the
      first two examples, and also demonstrates that an alternative
      polyol solvent can be used.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0057] In another embodiment, stable DHAA compositions containing
      various ratios of AA:DHAA are demonstrated.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] A first solution was prepared containing AA and DHAA in
      100% glycerin, wherein the ratio of AA:DHAA was about 1:1, and the
      actual concentrations of AA and DHAA was about 2.5% by volume
      respectively. Therefore the total vitamin C concentration in the
      first solution was about 5%. A second solution was prepared
      containing only AA in 100% glycerin, and wherein the AA
      concentration was about 5% by volume. Various proportions of the
      first solution and the second solution were combined to produce
      other solutions that each contained a total vitamin C
      concentration of about 5%, but wherein the ratio of AA:DHAA varied
      between about 1:1 and about 99:1. More specifically, solutions
      were prepared that contained AA:DHAA ratios of about 2;1, 5:1,
      9:1, 19:1, and 99:1.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] For comparison, a solution was prepared containing AA and
      DHAA in 100% water, wherein the ratio of AA:DHAA was about 1:1,
      and the total vitamin C content was about 5%. This solution was
      designated “Control.”<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Aliquots of each of the solutions prepared above were
      placed in transparent, screw-capped glass vials and were stored at
      room temperature. No attempt was made to further protect the vials
      from ambient indoor light, and each vial contained a headspace of
      normal air. Each vial was periodically opened to remove a sample
      for stability testing over the next 30 days. The concentration of
      DHAA in each sample was measured by spectrometry on each testing
      day. The initial DHAA concentration of each solution was recorded
      and assigned a value of 100% (Day 0), and the concentration on
      each subsequent stability test day was calculated as the percent
      remaining of the initial concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] FIGS. 16-20 show the results of stability testing of the
      various solutions; each graph also shows the result of the
      “Control” solution for comparison. <br>
      <br>
      It can be seen that DHAA decomposes rapidly in water when the
      initial ratio of AA:DHAA is about 1:1; after only 3 days, less
      than 20 percent of the initial amount of DHAA remains. By
      contrast, DHAA is preserved very well in polyol solutions
      containing AA:DHAA ratios of between 2:1 and 99:1<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0062] A solution containing both AA and DHAA dissolved in pure
      glycerol was prepared. Concentrations of AA and DHAA were about
      2.5% respectively. This solution was applied topically to the skin
      of human volunteers to compare the absorption rate of AA versus
      DHAA. To assess permeation into the stratum corneum, the solution
      was diluted 1:1 with water and applied at a rate of 1.4 mg/cm&lt;2
      &gt;to delineated skin surfaces and allowed 0, 2 or 4 hours for
      absorption. Each skin surface was then washed with deionized
      water, and the skin washings were collected and measured for AA
      and DHAA content. The amount absorbed at 2 and 4 hours was
      determined by subtraction from the amount present in the 0 hour
      washings.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] FIG. 21 shows the absorption of AA and DHAA into skin. Data
      points are the mean +/− SD of triplicate analyses on 4 subjects.
      The 2 and 4 hour values are the difference as percentage from the
      0 hour (baseline) values, determined by analysis of skin washings.
      It can be seem that after 4 hours DHAA had absorbed into the skin
      at a rate about 12 times greater than AA, and that the total
      vitamin C content of the skin was increased at a much more rapid
      rate than applying AA alone. (Asterisks on FIG. 21 indicate the
      following: * Statistically significant at P&lt;0.05. **
      Statistically significant at P&lt;0.01).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 6</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0064] A solution containing both AA and DHAA dissolved in pure
      glycerol was prepared. Concentrations of AA and DHAA were about
      2.5% respectively. One part solution was diluted with 9 parts
      water to give a working solution. The AA and DHAA concentrations
      of this working solution were measured and recorded. About 20
      grams of this solution was taken into the mouth by a human
      volunteer. Over the course of 5 minutes, the volunteer
      intermittently rinsed the oral cavity with the working solution by
      swiahing the solution about in the mouth, or gargled with the
      solution to rinse the tissues of the throat, being careful to
      avoid swallowing any of the working solution. At the end of 5
      minutes, the volunteer expectorated the fluid, which was collected
      and weighed. The AA and DHAA concentrations of the expectorated
      fluid were measured and recorded. The amount of AA and DHAA
      absorbed into the tissues of the mouth and throat was determined
      by subtraction from the concentrations determined on the solution
      before application to the mouth. Results were corrected for the
      dilution effect of accumulated saliva according to the difference
      in weight of fluid taken into the mouth as compared to the weight
      of the expectorated fluid. The results showed that approximately
      13.2% of the total AA was absorbed, and that approximately 14.8%
      of the DHAA was absorbed.<br>

      <b>Conclusion, Ramifications, and Scope</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0065] While the above description contains many specificities,
      these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the
      invention, but rather as exemplification of preferred embodiments.
      The compositions can be prepared using various methods and
      ingredients as mentioned, and their equivalents. Polyol solvents
      are known to be antimicrobial in high concentrations and therefore
      the compositions of the invention generally do not require
      preservatives. Polyol solvents are also capable of dissolving
      substances that are not soluble in water, so are capable of
      solubilizing not only AA and DHAA but additional dietary or
      skin-enhancing ingredients such as vitamin E. Many polyol solvents
      are excellent skin-enhancing substances in their own right, such
      as glycerol which is commonly utilized in skin care products as a
      humectant. Many polyol solvents are not only safe for ingestion,
      but in fact have a pleasant, sweet flavor. Thus the compositions
      have favorable properties that are synergistic with their use as
      dietary supplements, skin-enhancers, concentrates, or research
      solutions. <br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The expression of ascorbic acid oxidase was studied in zucchini
      squash (Cucurbita pepo L.), one of the most abundant natural
      sources of the enzyme. In the developing fruit, specific activity
      of ascorbic acid oxidase was highest between 4 and 6 days after
      anthesis. Protein and mRNA levels followed the same trend as
      enzyme activity. Highest growth rate of the fruit occurred before
      6 days after anthesis. Within a given fruit, ascorbic acid oxidase
      activity and mRNA level were highest in the epidermis, and lowest
      in the central placental region. In leaf tissue, ascorbic acid
      oxidase activity was higher in young leaves, and very low in old
      leaves. Within a given leaf, enzyme activity was highest in the
      fast-growing region (approximately the lower third of the blade),
      and lowest in the slow-growing region (near leaf apex). High
      expression of ascorbic acid oxidase at a stage when rapid growth
      is occurring (in both fruits and leaves), and localization of the
      enzyme in the fruit epidermis, where cells are under greatest
      tension during rapid growth in girth, suggest that ascorbic <br>
      acid oxidase might be involved in reorganization of the cell wall
      to allow for expansion. Based on the known chemistry of
      dehydroascorbic acid, the end product of the ascorbic acid
      oxidase-catalyzed reaction, we have proposed several hypotheses to
      explain how dehydroascorbic acid might cause cell wall
      “loosening.”<br>

      <br>
      Ascorbate oxidase is a multi-copper enzyme that catalyzes the
      oxidation of ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid. This copper
      containing blue enzyme is found in cucurbitaceous plants such as
      pumpkin, cucumber, and melon. It can eliminate ascorbic acid,
      which has high reducing power in clinical analyses, and detect
      levels of ascorbic acid. The biological function of ascorbate
      oxidase is still not clear. One suggestion is that the enzyme
      participates in a redox system involving ascorbic acids. It may be
      involved in the reorganization of the cell wall. In pumpkins,
      ascorbate oxidase expression increased rapidly during growth of
      callus, development of fruits, and elongation of seedlings.
      Ascorbate oxidase is present in young and growing tissues of
      tobacco. It is induced by phytohormone auxin which suggests that
      it is involved in cell growth...<br>
