      Jackson resident Raymond Green invented a wind turbine that can
      convert the air it brings in to more energy. He is competing in
      the Pepsi Refresh Project for a chance to win $250,000 to fund his
      project. Ledger Dispatch photo by Giancarlo Davis<br>
      <br>
      A wonderful idea floated into the brain of 86-year-old Jackson
      resident Raymond Green one night as he was drifting into sleep.<br>
      <br>
      His idea, a turbine that effectively harnesses the wind and
      transforms it into energy four times as much as it collects is one
      that not only has the potential to revolutionize the energy
      industry, but to create new jobs and generally make everyone's
      life easier.<br>
      <br>
      The octogenarian inventor has recently been accepted into the
      Pepsi Refresh Project, which rewards local movers and shakers who
      are working to have a positive impact on their community and on
      the world. Green is eyeing a $250,000 prize that will really set
      his turbine (figuratively) in motion, once he has garnered a
      sufficient amount of votes. Individuals can log onto the Pepsi
      Refresh Challenge website and vote for Green's turbine.<br>
      <br>
      The turbine could be designed to power everything from a computer,
      to a car and even an entire house. It collects wind through a
      cone, spinning a circle of impeller blades that, in turn, spins a
      bicycle wheel. The bicycle wheel turns an alternator via an
      automotive timing belt, thus creating a greener, alternative
      source of energy that could replace energy supplied by large gas
      companies or even Pacific Gas and Electric Co.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike a windmill that creates power by the wind pushing directly
      against its blades, Green's innovation compresses air and creates
      more torque, requiring less wind than a standard windmill. His
      apparatus also is more practical than using solar power. "Wind
      pretty much is blowing all of the time," Green said.<br>
      <br>
      The device could be deployed almost everywhere, from windswept
      coasts to remote mountaintops, and beyond. "It's something they
      could use up in Alaska or the North Pole," he said. "They can
      literally create this out of bamboo and canvas out on an island.
      Imagine, too, if they had this turbine at the Mt. Everest base
      camp at 1,000 feet. They would use this instead of relying on gas
      and other fuel supplies."<br>
      <br>
      Green has developed his turbine with almost no experience in the
      engineering field - though he does have more than a working
      knowledge of physics. In fact, he is a retired bulldozer and
      backhoe operator. But he is something of a dynamo in the invention
      department: he says he was one of the first in the 1950s to
      conceptualize the adjustable wrench - also known as the crescent
      wrench, the one with the adjustable jaw - but failed to receive a
      patent in time.<br>
      <br>
      Green's dream is that the world will catch on to his invention,
      and is working to get his prototype produced on a much larger
      scale. Already, he has patents pending in Europe and in New
      Zealand and Australia. He envisions his turbine on houses, boats,
      cars and in businesses. "Imagine how many jobs this would create,"
      Green added. "It really would stimulate things in the economy."<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a novel and useful wind power
      apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      Many systems have been proposed for harnessing the power of the
      wind. Wind power enjoys the benefit of tapping a source of energy
      which is renewable and relatively clean.<br>
      <br>
      In the past, many wind and water harnessing systems have been
      proposed including windmills and turbines of various types. For
      example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,649 shows a wind energy conversion
      system in which wind energy is channeled through a funnel to a
      propeller at the end of a channel for generation of energy.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,697, 4,868,408, 6,109,863, and UK Patent
      Application GB2283285 describe hydroelectric power generators
      which use liquid fluid to turn turbines through generators that
      are fixed beneath the surface of a body of water.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,075,500, 4,143,992, 4,204,799, and Patent
      Application Publication No. US 2004/0183310 describe wind turbines
      in which a propeller-like device is combined with a funnel to
      increase the velocity of the air to the propeller generating
      device.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,457,346 shows a windmill accelerator in which a
      frustro-conical funnel-like device directs air to the blades of a
      windmill in a swirling spiral motion.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,166,596 describes tethered wind turbines which are
      floated above the ground surface to generate electrical power,
      which are floated above the ground surface to generate electrical
      power, which is then fed downwardly to the ground surface through
      a conductor.<br>
      <br>
      United States Patent Application US 2005/0029817 shows a gimble
      mounted hydroelectric turbine which sits above a platform that
      runs along a track to generate power.<br>
      <br>
      A wind power device which is capable of easily and conveniently
      generating electrical power would be a notable advance in the
      energy field.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention a novel and useful wind
      power apparatus usable on a variety of surfaces is herein
      provided.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus of the present invention utilizes an anchor
      rotatably fixed to the surface of the ground. The anchor is
      generally upright and is not intended to be movable relative to an
      axis in the present application. The anchor preferably includes
      portions which rotate about the axis of the anchor to allow it to
      rotate as needed.<br>
      <br>
      A chute is also employed in the present invention and is linked to
      the anchor by a connector. The chute possesses a chamber which
      allows the passage of the wind from the chute entrance to the
      chute exit. The chute may be constructed of relatively light
      weight and flexible material, such as coated cloth and the like.
      The chute connector may include a series of lines which are fixed
      to the anchor and are preferably of equal length. The chute may
      take a form of a truncated cone, a cylinder, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      A restrictor is also found in the present invention which lies
      within a chamber formed by the chute. The restrictor is positioned
      immediately adjacent the chute chamber exit in order to
      concentrate the flow of air to a peripheral annular portion of the
      chute exit. For example, the restrictor may take the form of a
      cone or the like. The restrictor is mounted to a support or other
      structure located at the chamber exit.<br>
      <br>
      A nozzle or plurality of nozzles may be located at the chute
      chamber near the extremity of the restrictor. The nozzles are
      intended to direct wind from the chamber to the turbine.<br>
      <br>
      A power generator receives the wind from the chute chamber exit
      nozzle and lies adjacent the restrictor a the chute chamber exit
      nozzle. The power generator includes a mechanism, which is
      motivated by the wind received from the chute chamber exit, such
      as a propeller turbine and the like. The power generator may lie
      on a platform, linked to the chute, which is supported by a moving
      mechanism such as a set of wheels, skids, skis, and the like.
      Thus, the platform supporting the power generator is movable with
      the chute which tends to swing about the anchor depending on the
      direction of the wind being captured by the chute.<br>
      <br>
      It may be apparent that a novel and useful wind production
      apparatus has been heretofore described.<br>
      <br>
      It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a
      wind power production apparatus which is relatively simple to
      manufacture and install.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a wind power
      production apparatus which is useable on various types of terrain.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of the present invention is to provide a wind
      power production apparatus in which the velocity of the wind is
      increased or concentrated for capture by a power generator.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a wind power
      production apparatus which adjusts to a change in direction of the
      wind being harnessed to provide continual power generation.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of the present invention is to provide a wind
      power production apparatus which is relatively portable and
      dependable in generating electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a wind
      power production apparatus in which at least one nozzle directs
      wind to a power generator from a chute chamber employed to
      concentrate wind energy.<br>
      <br>
      The invention possesses other objects and advantages especially as
      concerns particular characteristics and features thereof which
      will become apparent as the specification continue.<br>

      For a better understanding of the invention reference is made to
      the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of
      the invention which should be taken in conjunction with the above
      described drawings.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Various aspects of the present invention will evolve from the
      following detailed description of the preferred embodiments
      thereof which should be referenced to the prior described
      drawings.<br>
      <br>
      One preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in the drawings
      as a whole be reference character 10. The power production
      apparatus 10 includes as one of its elements an anchor 12 which is
      fixed to ground surface 14 by any conventional means. Anchor 12
      possesses a rotatable base 16 which may be of conventional
      configuration. Rotatable base 16 allows anchor 12, which is the
      form of an upright member, to rotate according to directional
      arrow 18 about axis 92, FIGS. 1 and 3.<br>
      <br>
      A chute 20 is also included in the present invention and may be
      formed of flexible and lightweight material such as coated cloth,
      plastic, and the like. Chute 20 is intended to capture wind shown
      by directional arrows 22 and 24. As shown in FIG. 1, chute 20 is
      in the form of a truncated cone and includes an entrance 26 and an
      exit 28. When wind is traveling according to directional arrows 20
      and 22, chute is opened forming a chamber 30 therewithin.<br>
      <br>
      Connector or connecting means 32 holds chute 20 to anchor 12. As
      depicted in the drawings, FIGS. 1 and 3, connector 32 takes the
      form of lines 34, 36, 38, 40, 50 and 52. Lines 34, 36, 38, 40, 50
      and 52 may be flexible. Rings or other fasteners 42 and 44 on
      anchor 12 connect to the ends of lines 34, 36, 38, and 40, FIG. 1,
      as well as lines 50 and 52 depicted in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      A chamber exit restrictor 54 is also depicted in the drawings.
      With specific reference to FIG. 1, restrictor 54 is shown as a
      cone mounted to and fitting 68 and ring support 66, which will be
      more fully discussed hereinafter. Restrictor 54 forms and annular
      space 55 which coincides with chamber exit 28, FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      With further reference to FIG. 1, it may be observed that a power
      generator 58 in the form of a conventional bladed turbine is
      depicted in the drawings. Turning to FIG. 2, it may be seen that
      power generator 58 includes a plurality of blades 60 which rotate
      around a central axis 62. A stanchion 64 supports hub 56, FIG. 2
      to a platform 70. Hub 56 contains the conventional electrical
      components associated with generator 58. Needless to say, rotation
      of plurality of blades 50 about axis 62 creates an electrical
      power source. Support ring 66 connects to platform 70 and also
      serves as a base for connection of end fitting 68 of chute 20.
      That is to say, chute 20 is connected to end fitting 68 which is
      in turn linked to support ring 66. End fitting 68 also serves as a
      base support for restrictor 54 within chamber 30. Thus, chute 20
      is mechanically linked to generator 58 via platform 70.<br>
      <br>
      Platform 70 is also depicted in the embodiment shown in the
      drawings, namely FIGS. 1 and 2. Platform 70 is supported above
      ground surface 72 by moving mechanism 74, which is depicted as a
      plurality of wheels 76, wheels 78 and 80 being depicted in FIG. 2.
      In addition, struts 82 and 84 connect to support ring 60 and the
      upper surface 86 of platform 70. Thus, platform 70 is free to move
      in an arcuate direction according to directional arrows 88 and 90,
      FIG. 1. Such arcuate movement centers around the axis 92 of anchor
      12, FIGS. 1 and 3.<br>
      <br>
      Turning to FIG. 4, it may be apparent that another embodiment 10A
      of the present invention is depicted in which a chute 94 is
      tethered by connector 32 to anchor 12 in the same manner as chute
      20 of FIGS. 1-3. However, chute 94 is of cylindrical
      configuration, although it is composed of the same flexible and
      lightweight material as chute 20. A chamber 95 is formed having an
      entrance 97 and an exit 99. Restrictor 96 is in the form of a cone
      which is connected to end fitting 98 which is itself connected to
      support ring 100. Power generator 102 is similar to power
      generator 58 used with embodiment 10 shown in FIGS. 1-3. Thus,
      chute 94 is linked to platform 70 which supports power generator
      102.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIGS. 5-7, it may be observed that another
      embodiment 112 of the present invention embodiment 112 includes
      common components to embodiment 10 of FIG. 1. Such elements are
      designated with appropriate reference characters and will not be
      discussed in detail. However, a plate 114 is depicted at the exit
      of chamber 30 which possesses a ring 116. Ring 116 carries a
      plurality of nozzles 118, which direct wind from exit 28 of
      chamber 30 to power generator 58. Although a quartet of nozzles
      are depicted in FIG. 6, any number of nozzles 118 may be employed.
      FIG. 7 represents exemplary nozzle 120, passageway 122 through
      plate 114 leads to nozzle 120. Wind exits nozzle 120 at an angle
      which is commensurate with the blade system of power generator 58,
      allowing generator 58 to work in an efficient manner. In other
      words, the blades of generator 58 may be angulated or curved to
      directly receive the wind exiting plurality of nozzles 118.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, with respect embodiment 10, FIGS. 1-3, wind is
      directed into chute 20 via entrance 26. Wind entering chamber 30
      of chute 20 inflates or expands chute 20 which is rotatably held
      to anchor 12 by connector 32. Restrictor 54 within chamber 30
      concentrates the wind into an annular area 104 between restrictor
      54 and end fitting 68 of chute 20. This concentration of the wind
      within chamber 30 increases the velocity of the wind streaming
      through chamber 30 toward chamber exit 28 indicated by directional
      arrows 106 and 108. The wind entering the generator 58 turns
      blades 60 and produces electrical power in a conventional manner.
      Any change in the direction of the wind entering chute 20 will
      rotate generator 58, and platform 70 according to directional
      arrows 88 and 90 in an arcuate fashion. Nozzles 118 may aid in
      this endeavor. Thus, apparatus 10 moves in a generally arcuate or
      circular path depending on the direction of wind entering chute
      chamber 30. Rotatable base 16 permits anchor pole 12 to also
      rotate in this manner according to directional arrow 18. With
      respect to the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, a similar motion and
      operation takes place except that chute 94 provides a larger
      annular area at the exit 99 of chamber 95 allowing wind to hit the
      blades of generator 102, exemplified by blade 110, FIG. 4.<br>
