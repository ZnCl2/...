      </b>Little did Sonya Davidson know that dropping a glass of water
      when she was a little girl would lead her to found a company using
      water chemistry to store energy.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, Davidson’s H2 Energy Now was invited to the Alpine
      High-Tech Venture Forum in Switzerland, sponsored by Eureka, the
      EU’s R&amp;D organization, to present its radio wave-based energy
      storage technology to potential investors.<br>
      <br>
      The Israeli startup addresses the fact that although solar and
      wind farms account for about 40 percent of new energy-generating
      installations worldwide, and investment in renewable energy
      sources is skyrocketing, today’s batteries cannot store the energy
      well enough or cheaply enough to make it available around the
      clock on a mass scale.<br>
      <br>
      “We realized the solution was in water, if we could just figure
      out a new way to use it for energy storage,” says Davidson, who
      emigrated from the United States to Israel in 2007 with five
      academic degrees and a background in business.<br>
      <br>
      H2 Energy Now’s technology uses hydrogen gas to store energy and
      is based on Nobel Prize-winning research, she says. The gas is
      obtained by converting the power plant’s generated energy into
      radio waves, which in turn separate, or dissociate, water’s fused
      hydrogen and oxygen molecules.<br>
      <br>
      “Every molecule vibrates, and our radio-wave technology adds
      energy to the vibration of water molecules and causes separation.
      The formula for dissociation says energy plus water equals
      hydrogen and oxygen.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>A dropped glass of water</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Davidson tells ISRAEL21c that she has been fascinated by water and
      its properties ever since she dropped a glass of water on the
      floor when she was a child.<br>
      <br>
      “My mom, instead of getting mad, took the time to explain the
      principles of water — how it gathers and forms a shape, how you
      can float things on it. I became fascinated with water, and
      throughout elementary school, high school and college I paid
      attention to the science of it.”<br>
      <br>
      She assembled a team of chemists, engineers, business advisers and
      mentors in June 2011, and they developed product prototypes and
      have filed for patents in the United States and Europe.<br>

      One of the biggest problems with the adoption of renewable energy
      as wide-scale power sources is the difficulty and expense in
      storing energy. Batteries are expensive, heavy, and can only hold
      a limited amount of energy. According to many industry experts,
      renewable energy sources like solar and wind power will not be
      adopted on a wide scale until the storage issue is solved.<br>
      <br>
      Israeli energy start-up H2energy Now believes it has the storage
      solution – and the renewable energy source as well – that will
      enable society to easily adopt alternative energies. Hydrogen
      power isn’t new – as far back as the late 1700s it was being used
      experimentally to power machinery – but what is new is the use of
      radio waves to break down hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      The technology shows such promise, the European Union believes,
      that it invited H2energy Now to one of the most prestigious tech
      shows in the world – the Alpine High-tech Venture Forum, sponsored
      by Eureka, the EU’s R&amp;D framework organization. H2energy Now
      is the first, and so far only, Israeli company to be invited to
      the Forum, now in its 15th year.<br>
      <br>
      Sonya Davidson, the company’s president and CEO, spoke to The
      Times of Israel about her start-up at an Ashdod tech event
      sponsored by TheHive, an accelerator developed by Gvahim, an
      Israeli NGO that helps highly-skilled Olim find employment in
      Israel at the level of their qualifications. The nonprofit Gvahim
      group was founded by the Rashi Foundation in 2006, and is one its
      eight subsidiaries sponsored by Rashi.<br>
      <br>
      “We’ve developed the most efficient method for the storage of
      energy – using just water and radio waves, believe it or not,”
      said Davidson. “Our technological solution is based upon water,
      the basic foundation of life. But there is so much more in water;
      it has the power to store energy, and in fact energy – in the form
      of hydrogen – is right there inside the water.”<br>

      <br>
      H2energy Now’s system uses fresh or saltwater, which is filtered
      into droplets. Each droplet is “zapped” with radio waves, with a
      frequency that can “shake up” the hydrogen-water bond sufficiently
      to separate the two gases. If saltwater is used, the salt just
      drops out of the water, which evaporates into the two gases (one
      issue Davidson is still working on is what to do with the huge
      amounts of salt that would be generated if the system were to be
      widely adopted).<br>
      <br>
      Once “freed,” the hydrogen can be safely stored in a lightweight
      container, ready to be turned into electricity, fuel, or any other
      fossil fuel substitute. According to Davidson, storing hydrogen is
      perfectly safe, and in fact car companies such as Nissan and Honda
      – as well as public transportation firms from California to Israel
      to China – are using hydrogen power for their vehicles, with
      hydrogen storage tanks that are engineered to withstand heat and
      cold in various environments.<br>
      <br>
      “The EU has invested a billion euros in engineering safe hydrogen
      storage solutions, and the US has spend $950 million to pursue
      those solutions as well. They are doing this because they see
      hydrogen as the best renewable energy source of the future,” said
      Davidson,<br>
      <br>
      Davidson is not the first person to think of commercially
      producing hydrogen, but she is the first to think of doing it with
      radio waves, which scientific studies have shown to be an
      effective, scalable technology. Studies by H2energy Now,
      meanwhile, show that radio wave-based molecule separation is much
      more efficient than electrolysis, which is how hydrogen is
      generated from water or natural gas.<br>
      <br>
      “We ‘lose’ less hydrogen from water than our electrolysis-based
      competitors do,” said Davidson. “We can operate at 89% efficiency,
      while they can usually get only 60% of the hydrogen in the water.”<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, the radio waves used by H2 Energy Now won’t
      work with natural gas, which is where most commercially-produced
      hydrogen on the market comes from.<br>
      <br>
      But there’s no need for natural gas with her company’s system.
      “Hydrogen has no carbon, and if there is a leak in a tank it
      floats harmlessly into the atmosphere, unlike what happens when a
      gas leak occurs. Besides, saltwater is a lot cheaper than natural
      gas, and a lot more plentiful,” said Davidson. “There is no
      pollution created in our process. This is true clean technology.”<br>

      <b>How It Works</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      H2 Energy Now’s process begins by inputting fresh and/or salt
      water into the system. The water is screened into droplet
      formation and treated with radio waves (at a frequency that
      resonates with the H2O bond) forcing the vibrations to separate
      the compound into hydrogen and oxygen. The high pressure gases are
      then passed through a commercial filter to be safely stored in
      their own containers. When power is required, hydrogen energy is
      easily converted to electricity (or other useable forms such as
      fuel cells).<br>

        <b>GENERATING ENERGY FROM WATER, TO HYDROGEN SYSTEM</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A system for generating hydrogen by dissociation of water,
      characterized by a hydrogen generation chamber for generating
      hydrogen from water containing electrolytes; a source of
      radiofrequency electromagnetic energy for providing energy to
      drive the dissociation of the water; and a control unit for
      controlling the energy source and liquid and gas flow.<br>
      <br>
      FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a system for dissociating water into
      hydrogen and oxygen with high efficiency to generate hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
      <br>
      There are many sources of energy that are either significantly
      underused or are only used in limited markets. Examples of such
      energy sources are wind solar energy, and water power. Some, such
      as wind and solar power, are intermittent. All, at present,
      require connection to an electrical grid to transmit the power
      from the generation points to the points of use.<br>
      <br>
      More energy from sunlight strikes the Earth in one hour than all
      the energy consumed on the earth in a year. Although the solar
      electricity is a 7.5 billion industry which was growing at the
      rate of 35-40% per annum in 2001, in that year, it produced less
      than 0.1% of the world's electricity. The huge gap between our
      present use of solar energy and its underdeveloped potential
      defines a grand challenge in energy research. Covering 0.16% of
      the land of the Earth with 10% efficient solar conversion systems
      would provide 20 TW of power, nearly twice the world's consumption
      rate of fossil energy.<br>
      <br>
      Many renewable resources are intermittent, i.e., they are not
      available all the time. Efficient storage of energy from renewable
      sources allows supply to more closely match demand. For example, a
      storage system that can store energy captured around the clock and
      dispatch that energy into the higher priced mid-day market would
      allow solar energy to be used day or night.<br>
      <br>
      The U.S. Department of Energy has said that an improved method of
      storage of electrical energy is one of the main challenges
      preventing the substantial installation of renewable energies such
      as wind and solar power. Storage is vital for times when the wind
      does not blow or the sun does not shine. During those times,
      stored electrical energy can get to the electrical grid as needed.<br>
      <br>
      An idea of the potential of one form of renewable energy, solar
      power, is provided by Professor David Falman of Israel's Ben
      Gurion University, who says that a series of solar energy power
      stations in the Negev could supply all of Israel's power needs and
      that all of the world's electrical needs could be supplied with
      the solar power stations covering slightly less than 10 percent of
      the Sahara.<br>
      <br>
      However, use of solar power, wind power, water power, or any other
      source of power where it is desired to produce the power a
      location remote from the location of use of the power, requires a
      means for transporting the power from one location to another.
      Building electrical grids over long distances can be extremely
      costly. Furthermore, in many cases, such as automobiles,
      connection to a grid during use is not acceptable.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, there is a long-felt need for a means of production of
      energy that does not depend on connection to an electrical grid or
      other fixed installation to transport the energy to the point of
      use thereof.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The following description is provided, alongside all chapters of
      the present invention, so as to enable any person skilled in the
      art to make use of said invention and sets forth the best modes
      contemplated by the inventor of carrying out this invention.
      Various modifications, however, will remain apparent to those
      skilled in the art, since the generic principles of the present
      invention have been defined specifically to provide a means and
      method for dissociating water into hydrogen and oxygen with high
      efficiency to generate hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      The terms 'dissociate' and 'dissociation' hereinafter refer to the
      dissolution of water into hydrogen and oxygen gas. The
      dissociation reaction is commonly written 2H 20 -&gt; 2H 2+0 2.<br>
      <br>
      In the figures, identical numbers indicate similar functions. This
      invention is directed to the provision of a method of capturing
      power, such as but not limited to solar power or any alternative
      power and storing it for later use, for non-limiting example, for
      times when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing, for
      use in mobile applications, for use at locations remote from the
      source of the captureable power, or for use at times of high
      demand.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a complete system for generating power at
      the point of need through the following process:<br>
      <br>
      1. The system takes another system's power,<br>
      <br>
      2. Converts water into hydrogen and oxygen,<br>
      <br>
      3. Stores the hydrogen in a tank or other storage system, and<br>
      <br>
      4. Upon demand, converts the hydrogen back into water to generate
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      This system's key is the ability to store energy such as, but not
      limited to, solar or wind energy for use at a time when the energy
      provision means is not available, such as the sun not shining or
      the wind not blowing.<br>
      <br>
      The conversion of water is done in a unique hydrogen generation
      unit and utilizes radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation to
      convert the water to hydrogen and oxygen gas. The system includes
      means for introducing water into the top of the first portion of
      the tank. The water intake into the hydrogen generating stage is
      utilized to cool the hydrogen being generated. The hydrogen output
      is treated so moisture and heat are removed from the hydrogen and
      the oxygen separated from the hydrogen. The system includes a
      control computer, monitoring devices and numerous one-way valves
      so that data on the operation of the system can be captured and
      the operating conditions of the system modified so that the system
      is operating at optimal capacity substantially all of the time.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be noted that there is no electric current in the outer
      chamber, nor are there any electrodes in the outer chamber so that
      the dissociation of the water is not induced by electrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      At present, there are two theories for the mechanisms for
      induction of dissociation in the water. The first is that the RF
      electromagnetic energy heats the water to about 800 C, thereby
      causing it to dissociate. The second is that the RF
      electromagnetic energy excites one or more resonant frequencies of
      the covalent H-0 bonds in the water, thereby causing dissociation
      of the water. It is not known which of these postulated mechanisms
      is the operative one herein, whether both are operative, or
      whether an entirely different mechanism is operative.<br>
      <br>
      The core of the invention is a hydrogen generation system. This
      can form part of a complete energy system, or can be used to
      generate hydrogen for use elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the combination of this system with a conventional
      solar panel system and a conventional electric generator can form
      a complete alternative energy system. The solar panel system
      provides a source of energy, the present system provides the
      energy capture means, a conventional hydrogen storage system
      comprises the energy storage means, while a hydrogen-powered
      electric generator provides energy at the point of use. The system
      is not limited to solar energy; any power generating system can be
      used to power the system. Other examples of power sources include,
      but are not limited to, wind and water power.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen generated by the present system can be employed, for
      non-limiting example, as a fuel for powering automobiles, ships,
      airplanes and rockets, or for generating electricity for supply to
      a grid. Since the burning of hydrogen produces only water, the
      system enables reduction of air pollution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><br>
      <br>
      Fig. 1 schematically illustrates, in an out-of-scale manner, an
      exemplary embodiment (100) of an energy generation and storage
      system which includes the present hydrogen generation system. In
      this example, generation of energy is by solar (110) energy
      falling on conventional solar panels (1); any conventional
      electricity generating means can be used instead of the solar
      panels (1). The electricity generated by the panels (1) or other
      generating means is transmitted via a conventional electric power
      line (2) to the central command and control system (3) of the
      hydrogen generation system (dashed line, 150). The solar panels
      are exemplary; any conventional means of generating electricity
      that provides between 200 to 300 watts of power can be used in
      place of the solar panels (1).<br>
      <br>
      The central command and control system (3) controls: generation of
      electromagnetic radiation in a device comprising an antenna (7),
      the rate of hydrogen generation, temperatures throughout the
      hydrogen generation system, and the efficiency of operations
      taking place in the hydrogen generation system. In the hydrogen
      generation system (150), water is stored in a storage device (4).
      The command and control center (3) controls flow of the water from
      the storage device (4) to the hydrogen generation chamber (90).
      The water can be fresh water or water containing a desired balance
      of electrolytes. Preferably, salt water of a predetermined
      molarity is used to establish the electrolyte balance.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, fresh water is stored in the storage device
      (4), with the electrolytes being added either before or during
      entry into the hydrogen generation chamber (90).<br>
      <br>
      In other embodiments, water containing a desired balance of
      electrolytes, such as salt water of a predetermined molarity, is
      stored in the storage device (4).<br>
      <br>
      In yet other embodiments, fresh water is stored in the storage
      device (4) and is added to the hydrogen generation chamber (90),
      with the electrolytes being added directly to the hydrogen
      generation chamber (90).<br>
      <br>
      In embodiments of the device wherein the water stored in the
      storage device (4) is fresh water, addition of electrolytes is
      under the control of the command and control center (3).<br>
      <br>
      Water exiting the storage device (4) passes through a heat
      exchanger (5) where it is heated by hot gasses exiting the
      hydrogen generation chamber (90), thereby heating the incoming
      water before it enters the hydrogen generation chamber (90) and
      cooling the hydrogen before it enters the hydrogen storage device
      (not shown). The heated water then passes though an inline fluid
      communication system (6) to the hydrogen generation chamber (90).<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen generation chamber (90) comprises two separate
      chambers, an inner dry chamber, the transmitter chamber (8), which
      is at least partly surrounded by an outer wet chamber (9). The
      transmitter chamber (8) contains an antenna (7), which transmits
      RF electromagnetic energy into the hydrogen generation chamber
      (90). The antenna (7) typically comprises a means of generating RF
      electromagnetic energy. The outer wet chamber (9) is at least
      partly filled with a mixture comprising H 20, electrolytes and
      hydrogen. The transmitter chamber (8) enables continuous
      generation of hydrogen in the outer wet chamber (9). This unique
      setup incorporates an antenna, which remains separate from the
      water and which transmits RF electromagnetic energy through the
      walls of the inner dry chamber (8) into a second vessel, the outer
      wet chamber (9), at least partly filled with, preferably, salt
      water. This set up provides several unique advantages; the first
      chamber protects the antenna from the possibly corrosive
      environment of the outer wet chamber (9), which allows
      uninterrupted hydrogen generation. In the outer wet chamber (9),
      the water absorbs the transmitted electromagnetic energy so none
      reaches outside the outer wet chamber (9), thereby ensuring
      efficient conversion of the transmitted energy into hydrogen gas.<br>
      <br>
      A mixture of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas flows out of the outer
      wet chamber (9) through an in-line piping system (11) comprising
      at least one heat exchanger (5) to the hydrogen storage system
      (not shown). The oxygen is separated from the hydrogen before
      storage in the hydrogen storage system.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen generation system (150) also comprises sensors and
      other monitoring devices in communication with the command and
      control system (3). Parameters which can be monitored include, but
      are not limited to temperature, pressure, power generated by the
      power generation means (1), rate of hydrogen generation, liquid
      level in the wet chamber (9), liquid level in the storage device
      (4), flow rate of water into the outer wet chamber (9), molarity
      of the water in the outer wet chamber (9), flow rate of gas, and
      fraction of hydrogen in the gas at various positions in the
      in-line piping system (11). Temperatures that can be measured
      include, but are not limited to, at the wall of the outer wet
      chamber (9), at the wall of the inner transmission chamber (8), in
      the water, in the in-line piping system (11), and any combination
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The command and control system (3) comprises a processor adapted
      to process the measured parameters fed back from the sensors and
      monitors, and to use these data to alter control parameters such
      as, but not limited to, flow rate of water into the outer wet
      chamber (9), molarity of the water in the outer wet chamber (9),
      flow rate of gas in the in-line piping system (11), and
      transmitted radio wave intensity so as to maintain the system in
      optimum or near-optimum operating conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Control of flow control parameters such as flow rate of water into
      the outer wet chamber (9), flow rate of electrolyte into the outer
      wet chamber (9), and flow rate of gas in the in-line piping system
      (11) is typically via valves, although any conventional flow
      control mechanism can be used.<br>
      <br>
      The power to dissociate the water is provided by RF
      electromagnetic radiation generated by an antenna (7) inside an
      inner transmission chamber (8) and this transmission chamber (8)
      being at least partly surrounded by a second chamber (9) at least
      partly full of water comprising electrolytes, with the water being
      dissociated into hydrogen and oxygen by the electromagnetic
      radiation. A supply of water is maintained in a separate storage
      device (4). The water in the storage device (4) can be either
      fresh or contain a desired balance of electrolytes, preferably
      salt water of a predetermined molarity. Use of a separate storage
      device allows easy maintenance of the system, as the storage
      device (4) can be refilled with salt water without interfering
      with the operation of the hydrogen generator. Embodiments with
      fresh water in the storage device can comprise at least one
      additional storage device (not shown) containing at least one
      electrolytes. In embodiments with separate electrolyte storage,
      the electrolyte storage devices can be refilled without
      interrupting the operation of the hydrogen generator.<br>
      <br>
      Significant amounts of water vapor can be present in the outer
      chamber (9) due to evaporation of water therein, especially during
      periods when the system is not in use, e.g. it is neither charging
      nor discharging and, typically, has reached equilibrium.
      Therefore, the gas in the chamber will be a mixture of hydrogen,
      oxygen and water vapor. In systems lacking valves in the in-line
      gas piping system (11), this water vapor will diffuse through the
      entire system, leading to the presence of significant amounts of
      water vapor, and possibly liquid water, in the hydrogen storage
      system or the electricity generation system, if present. This can
      significantly degrade the efficiency of the system and can, under
      some circumstances, lead to corrosion in the in-line gas piping
      system (11), the hydrogen storage system or the electricity
      generation system, if present. Therefore, in preferred
      embodiments, the inline gas piping system (11) incorporates valves
      to limit egress of water vapor from the outer chamber (9) during
      periods of non-use. An exemplary valve (10) is shown in the
      in-line gas piping system (11), downstream of the outer chamber
      (9) and upstream of the heat exchanger (5). Typically these valves
      are conventional one-way check valves.<br>
      <br>
      One way check valves are generally disposed in a fluid
      communication means, such as pipes, and operate to permit fluid
      communication across the check valve only when the pressure on the
      fluid sending side is sufficiently greater than the pressure on
      the fluid receiving side. In the event the pressure is reversed,
      the check valve automatically closes, preventing backflow of the
      fluid.<br>
      <br>
      During periods of use, RF electromagnetic energy is present in the
      outer chamber (9), causing dissociation of water and generation of
      hydrogen (and oxygen) gas. Therefore, the pressure in the system
      increases, causing the one-way check valves (10) to open allowing
      the hydrogen to flow to the hydrogen storage system, or to an
      energy generation system.<br>
      <br>
      During periods of non-use, pressure in the outer chamber (9)
      drops, eventually dropping below the pressure in the hydrogen
      storage system. This causes the check valve (10) to close,
      preventing backflow of hydrogen from the hydrogen storage system
      to the hydrogen generation system (90).<br>
      <br>
      In preferred embodiments of the system, dual one-way check valves
      are used. The dual oneway check valves comprise two one way
      conical check valves, which permit hydrogen gas to flow in only
      one direction, e.g. from the hydrogen generation chamber (9) to
      either the hydrogen storage system or the energy conversion
      device.<br>
      <br>
      This embodiment further comprises a support stand (12) which
      serves two purposes, (1) it supports the chambers above it and (2)
      it has incorporated in it a measuring device (not shown) in
      communication with the command and control device (3). In this
      embodiment, the measuring device determines the amount of water
      inside the outer chamber (9), thereby enabling the command and
      control device (3) to increase or decrease the amount of liquid
      entering the outer chamber (9) so as to keep the total amount of
      liquid in the outer chamber (9) within predetermined limits.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 2 schematically illustrates, in an out of scale manner, an
      enlarged partially sectional side view of an embodiment of the
      hydrogen generation chamber. The hydrogen generation chamber (90)
      comprises an inner dry chamber (8) and an outer wet chamber (9) at
      least partially surrounding the inner dry chamber (8). A
      transmitter of RF energy (7) is located within the inner dry
      chamber (8). The walls of the inner chamber (8) are made of a
      material which allows the passage therethrough of RF
      electromagnetic energy, typically, but not limited to, glass or
      non-shielding plastic. However, the walls of the inner chamber (8)
      are impermeable to fluids, especially water and hydrogen or oxygen
      gas.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, the transmitter of RF energy
      (7) comprises a antenna or transmission tower.<br>
      <br>
      The walls of the outer chamber (9) comprise several layers. These
      layers can comprise: (a) Layers for absorbing and reflecting back
      the heat generated by the dissociation of water, thus increasing
      the efficiency of the process, (b) Layers reflecting back the RF
      electromagnetic energy thus increasing efficiency of the process,
      and (c) Layers absorbing the RF electromagnetic energy so the RF
      electromagnetic energy are limited to the container.<br>
      <br>
      The transmitter chamber (8) enables continuous generation of
      hydrogen in the outer wet chamber (9). This unique setup
      incorporates both the use of RF electromagnetic energy being
      generated or transmitted by an antenna (7) and transmitted through
      the walls of the inner dry chamber (8). The inner dry chamber (8)
      protects the antenna (7) from the water in the outer wet chamber
      (9). The antenna (7) and dry chamber (8) are surrounded by a
      second vessel at least partly filled with, preferably, salt water.
      This set up provides several unique advantages, the first chamber
      (8) allows for an uninterrupted hydrogen generation. In the second
      chamber (9) the water effectively shields the transmitted RF
      electromagnetic energy and more rapidly absorbs and converts the
      transmitted energy into hydrogen gas.<br>
      <br>
      A mixture of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas flows out of the outer
      wet chamber (9) through an in-line piping system (11) comprising
      at least one heat exchanger (5) to the hydrogen storage system
      (not shown). The oxygen is separated from the hydrogen before
      storage in the hydrogen storage system.<br>
      <br>
      This embodiment further comprises a support stand (12) which
      serves two purposes, (1) it supports the chambers above it and (2)
      it has incorporated in it a measuring device (not shown) in
      communication with the command and control device (3). In this
      embodiment, the measuring device determines the amount of water
      inside the outer chamber (9), thereby enabling the command and
      control device (3) to increase or decrease the amount of liquid
      entering the outer chamber (9) so as to keep the total amount of
      liquid in the outer chamber (9) within predetermined limits.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 3 schematically illustrates, in an out of scale manner an
      enlarged partially sectional side view of the foregoing multi-tier
      system. Fig. 3A shows the system with the parts separated, whereas
      Fig. 6B shows them assembled.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen generation chamber (90) comprises two separate
      chambers, an inner dry chamber, the transmitter chamber (8), which
      is at least partly surrounded by an outer wet chamber (9). The
      transmitter chamber (8) contains a device, the transmitter device
      or antenna (7), which transmits RF energy into the hydrogen
      generation chamber (90). The transmitter device (7) typically
      comprises a means of generating RF electromagnetic energy. The
      outer wet chamber (9) is at least partly filled with a mixture
      comprising H 20, electrolytes and hydrogen. The transmitter
      chamber (8) enables continuous generation of hydrogen in the outer
      wet chamber (9). The entire system is stably retained in its
      upright position by the support (12).<br>
      <br>
      During assembly, the transmitter device (7) is inserted inside the
      dry inner chamber (8). The dry inner chamber (8) is positioned
      within the outer wet chamber, the hydrogen generation chamber (9).
      Fig. 4 schematically illustrates, in an out of scale manner a
      partially cutaway perspective view showing an exemplary hydrogen
      storage system (170).<br>
      <br>
      In the exemplary hydrogen storage system (170), hydrogen from the
      hydrogen generation chamber (90, not shown), passes through the
      inline gas piping system (11) either to the hydrogen storage
      system (170) or to an energy generation system (not shown) such as
      a hydrogen-powered generator or other means of generating
      electrical energy from the hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 4 illustrates two of the valves in preferred embodiments of
      the system. The check valve (14), as described above, prevents
      hydrogen from returning to the hydrogen generation chamber (90,
      not shown). The Y control valve (15) has three positions: (1) Gas
      passes from the hydrogen generation chamber (90, not shown) to the
      hydrogen storage device (16). (2) Gas passes from the hydrogen
      generation chamber (90, not shown), via the in-line gas piping
      (17) to the energy generation system (not shown). (3) Gas passes
      from the hydrogen storage device (16) via the in-line gas piping
      (17) to the energy generation system (not shown). The positions of
      the Y valve are under the control of the command and control
      device (3, not shown).<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the check valve (14) in under the control of
      the command and control device (3, not shown). In preferred
      embodiments, the check valve (14) operates automatically, as
      described above.<br>
      <br>
      In all of the above embodiments, the water is heated before being
      dissociated by the RF energy, since the hot water is more
      efficiently dissociated than cold water.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 5 schematically illustrates, in an out of scale manner,
      another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment,
      the water plus electrolyte is converted to a mist before being
      heated, since the small droplets in a mist have a much larger
      surface area than a single body of water. Since the droplets have
      a large surface area, they heat more readily than the single body
      of water. In addition, droplets are more efficiently irradiated
      than larger bodies of water. If the water in the chamber formed a
      single body, most of the radiation would be absorbed in the parts
      of the body of water closer to the source of radiation, causing
      differential heating of the water and differential generation of
      hydrogen. If the water is in the form of a mist of small droplets,
      irradiation and heating will be much more uniform, which will
      improve the efficiency of the device. In the embodiment disclosed
      in Fig. 5, the water plus electrolyte enters through the top of
      the hydrogen generation chamber (90), passes through nozzles 50
      and is sprayed as a mist into the outer chamber (9). The outer
      chamber (9) is lined with layers of webbing (55) to catch the mist
      and suspend it as small droplets on the webbing. The webbing has
      holes (56) so that the mist can reach all parts of the outer
      chamber (9). The webbing (55) immobilizes and stabilizes the
      droplets, so that the mist does not condense back into water
      before it has been heated and dissociated, thereby increasing the
      efficiency of the system compared to the embodiments shown in
      Figs. 1 to 3.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 6A-C schematically illustrates, in an out of scale manner, a
      preferred embodiment of the hydrogen generation chamber (90). In
      this embodiment, the hydrogen generation chamber (90) comprises a
      flexible outer chamber (18) and a flexible inner chamber (8)
      instead of the rigid chambers disclosed in the embodiments of
      Figs. 1-5.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 6A schematically illustrates, in an out of scale manner, a
      partly cutaway view of the preferred embodiment of the hydrogen
      generation chamber (90). The inner (8) and outer (18) chambers
      have substantially the same cross-sectional shape; in preferred
      variants of this embodiment, the cross-sectional shape is
      circular. In other variants, the cross-sectional shape is oval or
      elliptical.<br>
      <br>
      The walls of the inner chamber (8) are substantially transparent
      to RF electromagnetic energy, and are substantially fluid-tight.<br>
      <br>
      The walls of the outer chamber (18) reflect substantially all of
      the RF electromagnetic energy falling on them, so that
      substantially no RF electromagnetic energy escapes from the
      hydrogen generation chamber (90). The walls of the outer chamber
      (18) are substantially fluid-tight.<br>
      <br>
      There is at least one port for egress of gas, which is not shown
      in Fig. 6A-C.<br>
      <br>
      The antenna (7) is held inside the dry container in at least one
      holder (51) substantially transparent to RF electromagnetic
      energy, so that substantially all of the radiating surface of the
      antenna (7) is an equal distance from the side walls of the inner
      chamber (8). The inner chamber (8) is held in at least one porous
      holder (52) so that the distance between the outer wall of the
      inner chamber (8) and the inner surface of the wall of the outer
      chamber (18) is everywhere substantially the same.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the porous holder (52) supports and
      stabilizes the water droplets in the mist. In this embodiment, the
      water comprising electrolyte enters the outer chamber (18) and is
      converted to a mist by nozzles (50). The nozzles (50) are located
      close to the perimeter of the outer chamber (18), so that there is
      at least one mist entry region extending along substantially all
      of the length of the outer chamber (18). The mist production
      mechanism can comprise a single long nozzle or a plurality of
      shorter nozzles.<br>
      <br>
      In the preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 6, there are two mist
      entry regions, spaced 180° apart on the perimeter of the outer
      chamber (18). The number of mist entry regions can be between 1
      and 6.<br>
      <br>
      In this embodiment, the water comprising electrolyte is converted
      to a mist before being heated, since the small droplets in a mist
      have a much larger surface area than a single body of water. Since
      the droplets have a large surface area, they heat more readily
      than the single body of water. In addition, droplets are more
      efficiently irradiated than larger bodies of water. If the water
      in the chamber formed a single body, most of the radiation would
      be absorbed in the parts of the body of water closer to the source
      of radiation, causing differential heating of the water and
      differential generation of hydrogen. If the water is in the form
      of a mist of small droplets, irradiation and heating will be much
      more uniform, which will improve the efficiency of the device<br>
      <br>
      The mist is heated and dissociated by the RF electromagnetic
      energy radiated by the antenna (7). The hydrogen gas exits the
      system via exit ports (not shown) and passes from thence to a
      hydrogen storage device or power generator, as described
      hereinabove.<br>
      <br>
      The walls of the outer chamber (18) comprise several layers. These
      layers can comprise (a) Layers for absorbing and reflecting back
      the heat generated by the dissociation of water, thus increasing
      the efficiency of the process, (b) Layers reflecting back the RF
      electromagnetic energy thus increasing efficiency of the process,
      and (c) Layers absorbing the RF electromagnetic energy so the RF
      electromagnetic energy are limited to the container.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 6B schematically illustrates, in an out of scale manner, a
      partly cutaway view of the hydrogen generation chamber (90) from
      the outside, showing the antenna (7), the inner chamber (8) and
      the outer chamber (18). Inside the inner chamber is a support (51)
      substantially transparent to RF electromagnetic energy to hold the
      antenna (7) at a substantially constant distance from the walls of
      the inner chamber (8). Between the walls of the inner chamber (8)
      and the walls of the outer chamber (18) is a porous support (52)
      so that the distance between the walls is substantially uniform.
      Fig. 6C schematically illustrates, in an out of scale manner, an
      end view of the RF transparent inner holder (51) and the porous
      outer holder (52).<br>
      <br>
      Advantages of the preferred embodiment of Fig. 6A-C include:<br>
      <br>
      (a) It is long and narrow, enabling use of a longer antenna (7)
      and providing reduced distances between the antenna (7) and the
      mist. This means that an increased fraction of the water is close
      to the antenna compared to the other embodiments of the invention,
      so that less power is needed to heat and dissociate substantially
      all of the water, thereby increasing the efficiency of the system.<br>
      <br>
      (b) It is flexible, so that it can be arranged linearly or bent to
      form an arc, an S-shape or any other desired shape. Therefore, it
      can be shaped to fit efficiently within the power generation
      system. For non-limiting example, if the power supply is provided
      by solar panels, a linear shape could take advantage of waste heat
      not absorbed by the solar panels. In another non-limiting example,
      in an outdoor installation, a device bent into a circle would cool
      more slowly than a straight device, since the curved device has
      less exposed surface area than the straight device.<br>
      <br>
      In the system as disclosed hereinabove, the frequency of the RF
      electromagnetic energy is in a range between about 1 MHz and about
      30 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      The combination of this system with another energy conversion
      system such as an electric generator allows the stored energy to
      be converted to electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      The goal of the present invention is to convert is to generate and
      store hydrogen gas, and to enable the conversion of the hydrogen
      gas back into electricity by the most efficient means possible.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the advantages of the invention set forth above,
      the effect of the invention is:<br>
      <br>
      1. It is possible to make electricity driven by hydrogen only,
      i.e. an electric generator driven by water.<br>
      <br>
      2. In accordance with the invention it is possible to drive a
      motor bicycle, vessel, jet airplane, and rocket (solar battery is
      used for power source and water is obtainable from space) and also
      to operate an electric power generator, aluminum refinement,
      furnace, iron manufacture, burner, etc. by using water.<br>
      <br>
      3. Since energy that has a clean exhaust can be obtained, such
      problems as the pollution from exhaust gasses of other power
      sources do not occur. 4. A particular liquid such as an
      electrolytic liquid is not required and regular water is usable.
      Therefore, water obtainable from water taps can be used, with the
      addition of salt or other electrolytes to establish the correct
      salt content, and there is no need to go to a special location,
      such as a gas station or battery switching station, to refill the
      device.<br>
      <br>
      5. The energy conversion ratio can be as high as 95%.<br>
      <br>
      6. The source of the RF energy can heat the water and, at the same
      time, be cooled by the water, which increases the efficiency of
      the device and reduces its size.<br>
      <br>
      7. Heating the water increases the efficiency of the device. The
      operating voltage of the device can be reduced by up to about 10%
      if the water temperature is increased.<br>
      <br>
      This invention can effectively take houses and businesses off the
      grid, making them self- sufficient and potentially able to return
      power to the grid.<br>
      <br>
      Since a complete power generation system which includes the
      hydrogen generation chamber of present invention generates power
      locally, transmission losses are minimized. Typically, grid
      transmission losses are about 8% so that, if the such a power
      generation system is approximately as efficient as conventional
      power generation systems supplying power via the grid, it will
      effectively be about 8% more efficient than the grid generation
      system..<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the above, the invention can be used with a
      methanol car, a solar cell car, an electric car, a CNG car, a
      hydrogen car, a gas turbine car, a Sterling cycle engine, a hydro
      car (electric + diesel), and a car jointly using LPG, etc.
      Variations other than those mentioned above are contemplated and
      considered to be within the scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also relates to a method for producing
      hydrogen comprising the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      1. Taking electricity produced from a solar panel or any
      alternative energy system;<br>
      <br>
      2. Transmitting said electricity to a transmitting device within
      an inner chamber of a vessel, the inner vessel remaining dry at
      all times;<br>
      <br>
      3. Transmitting RF electromagnetic energy from the transmitting
      device within the inner chamber to into an outer chamber of the
      vessel , where the outer vessel is at least partly filled with
      water;<br>
      <br>
      4. Collecting hydrogen produced from the water within the outer
      chamber of the vessel; 5. Separating the hydrogen from the oxygen
      through the use of a filter;<br>
      <br>
      6. Storing the hydrogen; and<br>
      <br>
      7. Converting the hydrogen into electricity.<br>
