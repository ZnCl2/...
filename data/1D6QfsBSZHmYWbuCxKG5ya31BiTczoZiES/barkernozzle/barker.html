      End of new hose nozzle, showing the sets of fins that straighten
      the stream of water. The inventor is seen with one of the nozzles.
      Below, a test of the long-range effectiveness it affords.<br>
      <br>
      Metal "feathers" built into a new type of hire-hose nozzle
      increase the effective range of streams of water. Invented by
      Horace Barker of Springfiield,&nbsp; Mass., the nozzle has two
      sets of transverse fins; one set counteracts the swirls of the
      water as it emerges from the hose, while the other straightens the
      stream, reducing its spiral motion and its tendency to break into
      spray as it travels through the air. Exerts state that the new
      nozzle will not only add "punch" and distance to fire-hose
      streams, but will increase their fire-extinguishing effectiveness
      as well.<br>

      Inventor(s): BARKER HORACE R <br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to improvements in apparatus for
      discharging fluid and is directed more particularly to
      improvements in nozzle devices to be used in connection with
      fire-fighting apparatus or the like.<br>
      <br>
      The principal objects of the invention are directed to the
      provision of water discharge apparatus which is particularly j!
      adapted for use in connection with fire fighting apparatus, the
      same being characterized by means adapted to facilitate the |j
      discharging of a smooth stream of water over a greater distance !
      than is possible by apparatus now in common use.<br>
      <br>
      In connection with fire-fighting apparatus it is desired to
      deliver a smooth stream of water over a considerable distance or
      height at a considerable pressure. With present day apparatus it
      is more or less difficult, if not impossible, to discharge a
      stream at the desired pressures for the height or distances
      desired and necessary. This is due to the fact that the water in
      passing through the nozzle is swirled, rolled, or becomes
      turbulent so that the discharged stream swirls, rolls or becomes
      turbulent and consequently fans out, brooms or breaks. This
      reduces its effectiveness since of course a smooth, well-defined
      stream at the; desired pressures is necessary for the greater
      distance or height.<br>
      <br>
      According to this invention means is provided within the nozzle or
      water-discharge means which tends to eliminate the ! turbulent
      rolling or whirling action of the water during its passage
      therethrough so that there is discharged from the discharge outlet
      a smooth, uniform stream which by reason of its novel
      characteristics I have found will carry a greater distance at the
      desired pressures than is possible with present day nozzles. In
      this way the nozzle at the end of a hose, stand pipe, or other
      apparatus, more effectively discharges water. This is accomplished
      by the provision of means in the form of plates in the water
      passage which are disposed so that they are substantially in
      parallelism with the axis of the water passage thereby.<br>
      <br>
      Many and various other novel features and advantages of the
      invention will be hereinafter more fully referred to in connection
      with the accompanying description of the preferred form thereof,
      reference being had to the drawings wherein:<br>

      Referring now to the drawings more in detail, the invention will
      be fully described.<br>
      <br>
      A base is shown at 2 and this may be of the Siamese type i; having
      separate water passages ij. and 6 which converge into a throat I:
      indicated generally by 8.<br>
      <br>
      The base 2 may take any form desired since it is not desired to be
      limited to the particular form shown. It will be understood that
      the base shown or any equivalent structure will be provided with a
      throat such as 8 on its upper or outer end.<br>
      <br>
      The nozzle member is indicated by 10. This nozzle member may be
      carried' by the base and in the form of the invention shown it has
      its lower or inner side in threaded engagement with the outer or
      upper end of the base member 2.<br>
      <br>
      The nozzle member 10 has a discharge outlet 12 at a more or less
      distance from a throat or barrel portion 14. The discharge outlet
      12 is preferably somewhat less in diameter than that of the throat
      11, so that a water passageway 15 converges from the throat to the
      discharge outlet 12.<br>
      <br>
      The throat of the nozzle member is somewhat less in diameter than
      that of the throat 8 of the base so that a water passageway is
      provided which converges as shown.<br>
      <br>
      In the throat 8 there are provided a plurality of relatively thin
      plates or vanes 20 and 21 which extend transversely of the said
      throat. These provide a plurality of passageways 22 therebetween.
      These plates 20 and 21 are arranged so that the plane of their
      surfaces are in substantial parallelism with the axis of the
      throat 8. The plates 20 and 21 may be secured together and
      associated with the throat in any desired manner. For instance the
      plates may be slotted so as to be interlocked like the partitions
      of a box.<br>
      <br>
      In the form of the invention shown, the plates 20 and 21 are
      associated with a sleeve 24 which is disposed in the throat 8 and
      said plates may be secured to this sleeve in any desired and well
      known manner.<br>
      <br>
      The throat 11 of the nozzle member has a central tube member 50
      associated therewith and plates 52 and extend transversely of the
      throat so that there are provided water passages around a central
      passageway 58.<br>
      <br>
      The central tube 10 may be supported by or associated with the
      plates 52 and 54 and as in the former case the tube 50 and plates
      are disposed in a sleeve inserted in the throat 11. In accordance
      with the invention the plates 52 and 54&nbsp; and tube 50 may be
      connected or associated in any convenient way but it is preferable
      that the plates and tube be arranged in substantial parallelism
      with the axis thereof.<br>
      <br>
      As water is delivered to the throat 8 of the base 2 its tendency
      to swirl or become turbulent is overcome by the plates 20 and 21
      forming the passageways 22 through which the water travels.<br>
      <br>
      The plates 20 and 21 are of considerable length. As will be seen,
      the plane of their surfaces is substantially parallel to the axis
      of the throat so that water is guided in a straight path and as it
      passes through the tapering passageway 15 into and through a
      throat 14 of the nozzle member it is again brought into contact
      with the plates 52 and 51 As it travels through the central tube
      50 passageways formed by the plates 52 and 54 its tendency to
      swirl is overcome. The water, being controlled as it is, will, on
      being discharged from the discharge outlet 12, emerge as a smooth
      uniform stream which does not have the objectionable swirling,
      rolling or turbulent tendency which would result in fanning out or
      breaking. Thereby it is possible to discharge a stream of water at
      the desired pressure and velocity which will carry over the a
      relatively long distances or heights desired.<br>
