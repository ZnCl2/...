      <p>&nbsp;LONGMONT — Like most American manufacturers, Avedon
        Engineering was hit hard by jobs moving offshore — first to
        Mexico and then to the Pacific Rim and China. </p>
      <p>The contract manufacturing company, which founder and president
        Ray Avedon brought to Longmont from Boulder in 1969, once did
        $25 million worth of business out of its 165,000-square-foot
        design and manufacturing facility in Longmont and employed 450
        people. Today, the company is down to 50 workers. </p>
      <p>But the drop in business gave Avedon an opportunity to take a
        hard look at an idea he’d been kicking around in his head for 20
        years: the Thermal Equalizer. </p>
      <p>Avedon markets and sells the Thermal Equalizer through a
        spinoff company, Airius. </p>
      <p>He invented the device out of necessity. No matter how high the
        thermostats were set in his factory, the warm air would quickly
        rise to the 30-foot ceilings, and the workers down below would
        be cold. </p>
      <p>“I knew I wanted an invisible column, an invisible duct” to
        keep the warm air moving down, he said. </p>
      <p>Out of much trial and error came the Thermal Equalizer. </p>
      <p>“Over the years, I’ve probably done 500 products,” Avedon said.
        “When I did this one, the Airius, this one we did for
        ourselves.” </p>
      <p>His company has sold about 12,000 of the Thermal Equalizers so
        far, Avedon said, and continually improving the product has
        helped his current units be about 11 times more energy efficient
        than the prototype he started with. </p>
      <p>The cylindrical unit typically hangs from the ceiling and
        collects the rising warm air. It sends this air back down to the
        floor in a straight, round column. </p>
      <p>When the air hits the floor, it disperses the cold air and
        pushes it upward, creating a cyclical effect that keeps the air
        at an even temperature throughout the room. </p>
      <p>The concept is based on destratification, Avedon said. Instead
        of having layers of different temperatures in a room, his
        invention creates an environment where it’s just as warm at the
        ceiling level as it is on the floor. </p>
      <p>It works better than a ceiling fan, Avedon said, because a fan
        simply moves the air near the ceiling around and uses much more
        energy. The average Thermal Equalizer, Avedon said, uses the
        energy equivalent of a 35-watt light bulb. </p>
      <p>The Thermal Equalizer comes in a variety of sizes, including
        some powerful enough to work in airplane hangars. Costs of the
        units range from $400 to $2,500 each, depending on size and
        configuration. </p>
      <p>Because the unit keeps air at a uniform temperature, it saves
        users money because their furnaces will have to run less often.
      </p>
      <p>Todd Isaacson, owner of Express Employment Professionals in
        Longmont, said he bought two units two years ago and uses them
        in areas with 9- to 12-foot ceiling heights. </p>
      <p>“I definitely saved 20 percent (on my heating bill), and I have
        to say it’s because of them,” Isaacson said. “I was surprised at
        the savings, to be honest with you, because I had been in that
        space five years.” </p>
      <p>In Longmont, the Pumphouse and Mike O’Shay’s also have Thermal
        Equalizers. Outside of Longmont, Boeing is a customer, Avedon
        said, and the U.S. Air Force uses the devices in its B-52
        hangars at a base in Minot, N.D. </p>
      <p>Because of its energy efficiency, Avedon’s product has received
        awards from the U.S. Green Building Council and, most recently,
        from Connected Organizations for a Responsible Economy — CORE —
        a Colorado-based trade organization focused on sustainable
        business practices. </p>
      <p>Not long after introducing the Thermal Equalizer, Airius came
        out with another product: a Thermal Equalizer equipped with an
        ultraviolet light that kills airborne and surface microbes such
        as mold, fungus and odor. </p>
      <p>The Boulder County Jail is one of Airius’ customers for that
        product, Avedon said. </p>
      <p>So far, his contract manufacturing business still accounts for
        about 70 percent of his companies’ revenues, Avedon said, but he
        expects that percentage to change as more people learn about the
        two lines of Airius Thermal Equalizers. </p>
      <p>Customers in England, for example, “are talking about buying
        $60 million worth of product in the next few years,” Avedon
        said. </p>

        also includes directing warm air from the ceiling to the floor

        under the floor. The stored heat is released when the ceiling is
        cooler than the floor. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] The present invention relates to heating, ventilating
        and air conditioning air spaces, and more particularly to
        systems, devices and methods for moving air in a columnar
        pattern with minimal lateral dispersion that are particularly
        suitable for penetrating air spaces and air temperature
        de-stratification. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND ART</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] The rise of warmer air and the sinking of colder air
        creates significant variation in air temperatures between the
        ceiling and floor of buildings with conventional heating,
        ventilation and air conditioning systems. Such air temperature
        stratification is particularly problematic in large spaces with
        high ceilings such as warehouses, gymnasiums, offices,
        auditoriums, hangers, commercial buildings, and even residences
        with cathedral ceilings, and can significantly decrease heating
        and air conditioning costs. Further, both low and high ceiling
        rooms can have stagnant or dead air. For standard ceiling
        heights with duct outlets in the ceiling there is a sharp rise
        in ceiling temperatures when the heat comes on. </p>
      <p>[0004] One proposed solution to air temperature stratification
        is a ceiling fan. Ceiling fans are relatively large rotary fans,
        with a plurality of blades, mounted near the ceiling. The blades
        of a ceiling fan have a flat or airfoil shape. The blades have a
        lift component that pushes air upwards or downwards, depending
        on the direction of rotation, and a drag component that pushes
        the air tangentially. The drag component causes tangential or
        centrifugal flow so that the air being pushed diverges or
        spreads out. Conventional ceiling fans are generally ineffective
        as an air de-stratification device in relatively high ceiling
        rooms because the air pushed by conventional ceiling fans is not
        maintained in a columnar pattern from the ceiling to the floor,
        and often disperses or diffuses well above the floor. </p>
      <p>[0005] Another proposed solution to air temperature
        stratification is a fan connected to a vertical tube that
        extends substantially from the ceiling to the floor. The fan may
        be mounted near the ceiling, near the floor or in between. This
        type of device may push cooler air up from the floor to the
        ceiling or warmer air down from the ceiling to the floor. Such
        devices, when located away from the walls in an open space in a
        building, interfere with floorspace use and are not
        aesthetically pleasing. When confined to locations only along
        the walls of an open space, such devices may not effectively
        circulate air near the center of the open space. Examples of
        fans connected to vertical tubes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.
        3,827,342 to Hughes, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,973,479 to Whiteley. </p>
      <p>[0006] A device that provides a column of air that has little
        or no diffusion from the ceiling the floor, without a vertical
        tube, can effectively provide air de-stratification. U.S. Pat.
        Nos. 4,473,000 and 4,662,912 to Perkins disclose a device having
        a housing, with a rotating impeller having blades in the top of
        the housing and a plurality of interspersed small and large,
        vertically extending, radial stationary vanes spaced below the
        impeller in the housing. The device disclosed by Perkins is
        intended to direct the air in a more clearly defined pattern and
        reduce dispersion. Perkins, however, does not disclose the
        importance of a specific, relatively small gap between the
        impeller blades and the stationary vanes, and the device
        illustrated creates a vortex and turbulence due to a large gap
        and centrifugal air flow bouncing off the inner walls of the
        housing between the blades and vanes. Perkins also discloses a
        tapering vane section. The tapering vane section increases
        velocity of the exiting air stream. </p>
      <p>[0007] A device with a rotary fan that minimizes the rotary
        component of the air flow while maximizing the axial air flow
        quantity and velocity can provide a column of air that flows
        from a high ceiling to a floor in a columnar pattern with
        minimal lateral dispersion that does not require a physical
        transporting tube. Such a device should reduce the energy loss
        by minimizing the rotary component of the air flow, and
        therefore minimizes turbulence. Such a device should minimize
        back pressure, since a pressure drop at the outlet of the device
        will cause expansion, velocity loss and lateral dispersion. The
        device should have minimum noise and low electric power
        requirements. </p>
      <p><b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0008] An air moving device which has a housing with an air
        inlet and an air outlet spaced from the inlet. A rotary impeller
        with a plurality of blades is mounted in the housing at the air
        inlet end and produces air flow with an axial component and a
        rotary component. A plurality of spaced, longitudinally
        extending, radial air guide vanes in the housing downstream of
        the impeller are in close proximity to the impeller blades to
        minimize the rotary component and change the air flow to a
        laminar and axial flow in the housing that exits the outlet end
        in a columnar pattern with minimal lateral dispersion. A method
        of moving air includes producing an air flow through a housing,
        and directing the air flow through the housing in a laminar and
        axial flow and exits an outlet so as to produce a columnar
        pattern with minimal lateral dispersion. The method also
        includes directing warm air from near the ceiling toward the
        floor, allowing the heat from the warm air to be stored in the
        floor, articles on the floor and the earth under the floor. The
        method includes directing air in a generally horizontal
        direction to allow penetration of an air space in a container,
        trailer truck or a room to promote flushing of that air space
        and circulation thereof. The device and method are particularly
        suitable for high efficiency, low power usage, air temperature
        de-stratification, and to improve air quality and circulation. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0034] Referring now to FIGS. 1 to 9, there is shown an air
        moving device 12 having an elongated outer housing 13, an
        electric rotary fan 14 in the housing for producing air flow in
        the housing and a plurality of longitudinally extending, outer
        radial vanes 15 and an inner housing hub 16 opposite the vanes
        in the housing downstream of the fan for directing air flow in
        the housing. </p>
      <p>[0035] The housing 13 has a circular cross section, and an open
        first end 17 and an open second end 18 spaced from the first end
        17. In the illustrated embodiment, a detachable, axially
        outwardly convex cowling 19 forms the first end 17 and provides
        an air inlet 21 with a diameter slightly smaller than the outer
        diameter of the cowling 19. </p>
      <p>[0036] The housing 13 has a first section 25 extending from the
        cowling 19 to an interior shelf 26. A generally C-shaped hanger
        23 mounts at opposite ends 24 to opposite sides of the housing
        13 at the upper end of the first section 25, for mounting the
        air moving device 12 to a support. The first section 25, when
        viewed from the side, has a curved, slightly radially outwardly
        convex shape that conforms to the curvature of the cowling 19.
        The shelf 26 extends radially inwardly to join with the upstream
        end of a second section 27. The second section 27 tapers
        inwardly and extends axially from the shelf 26 to the second end
        18 along a smooth curve that goes from radially outwardly convex
        near the shelf 26 to radially outwardly concave near the second
        end 18. The second end 18 forms an air outlet 28 that has a
        smaller diameter than the air inlet 21. A plurality of
        circumferentially spaced external fins 29 extend from the shelf
        26 to the second section 27 to provide the appearance of a
        smooth curve from the air inlet 21 to the air outlet 28 when the
        housing 13 is viewed from the side. </p>
      <p>[0037] The fan 14 includes an impeller 31 having a cylindrical,
        inner impeller hub 32, with an electric motor 34 therein, and a
        plurality of rigidly mounted, circumferentially spaced blades 33
        extending radially from the impeller hub 32. In the illustrated
        embodiment the impeller 31 has three equally spaced blades 33
        and rotates about an axis in a counter-clockwise direction when
        viewed from above. Each blade 33, in side view, extends from an
        upstream edge 35, downwardly and leftwardly to a downstream edge
        36 with each blade 33 being slightly concave, in an airfoil or
        wing shape, downwardly to propel air rightwardly as shown by the
        arrow. Each blade 33 then inclines at a selected angle to the
        axis of rotation of the impeller. Each blade 33 shown extends
        axially and radially toward the outlet or second end 18 to
        direct air axially with a rotary component. If the motor 34 runs
        in the opposite direction, the incline of the blades 33 would be
        reversed. The fan 14 includes a stationary cylindrical mounting
        ring 38 that extends around the blades 33, with the impeller hub
        32 being rotably mounted relative to the mounting ring 38. The
        mounting ring 38 has spaced, protruding upstream and downstream
        rims 40 and 41. The fan 14 mounts in the housing 13 between the
        cowling 19 and the shelf 26. </p>
      <p>[0038] Each of the vanes 15 is identical and includes upstream
        portion 43 and a downstream portion 44. The upstream portion 43
        is carried in a stator 46. The stator 46 has a cylindrical
        stator hub 47 with a diameter substantially equal to the
        diameter of the impeller hub 32. The upstream portions 43 of the
        vanes 15 are mounted in a circumferentially spaced arrangement
        around the stator hub 47, and extend longitudinally along and
        radially from the stator hub 47. Each upstream portion 43 has an
        upstream end 48 and a downstream end 49. A support body 50
        includes a cylindrical stator ring 52 that extends around the
        upstream portions 43 and connects to the outer ends of the
        upstream portions 43 of the vanes 15 near the upstream ends 48.
        The support body 50 also includes a protruding stator rim 53
        that is substantially planar with the upstream ends 48 of the
        upstream portions 43 of the vanes 15, and that connects to the
        stator ring 52 and extends radially outwardly therefrom. </p>
      <p>[0039] The housing 13 has an inner surface and the inner
        housing hub 16 has an outer surface concentric with a spaced
        from the housing inner surface to define an air flow passage
        through the housing. The inner housing hub 16 includes the fan
        hub 32, stator hub portion 47 and downstream hub portion 57,
        each having an outer surface and arranged end to end along the
        center of the housing and opposite and spaced from the housing
        inner surface to define the air flow passage. In particular,
        these outer surfaces shown are cylindrical and substantially the
        same diameter for a substantial portion of the passage and as
        the housing 13 converges the downstream hub portion 57 converges
        to generally follow the curvature of the inside surface of the
        housing. </p>
      <p>[0040] The stator 46 nests in and is separable from the housing
        13 with the stator rim 53 between the shelf 26 of the housing 13
        and the downstream rim 41 of the mounting ring 38 of the fan 14,
        and with a gap 55 having a selected size between the downstream
        edge 36 of the blades 33 of the impeller 31 and the upstream
        ends 49 of the upstream portions 43 of the vanes 15. If the gap
        55 is too large, turbulence will be generated in the air flow
        between the impeller 31 and the vanes 15, reducing the velocity
        of the air flow. If the gap 55 is too small, fluid shear stress
        will generate noise. The size of the gap 55 is generally
        selected as no greater than a maximum selected dimension to
        avoid turbulence and no less than a selected minimum dimension
        to avoid noise, and more particularly selected as small as
        possible without generating noise. </p>
      <p>[0041] The selected size of the gap 55 is generally
        proportional to the diameter of the impeller 31 and may further
        be affected by the speed of the impeller 31. The following are
        examples: For an impeller 31 with a diameter of 6.00", at 1800
        rpm, the maximum size of the gap 55 should be 1.25" and the
        minimum gap should be 0.2". For an impeller 31 with a diameter
        of 8.5", at 1400 rpm, the maximum size of the gap 55 should be
        1.25", and the minimum gap should be 0.2" but could be 0.020 for
        lower rpm's as the size of the gap is rpm dependent. Generally,
        the maximum size of the gap 55 should be less than one half the
        diameter of the impeller 31. </p>
      <p>[0042] In the illustrated embodiment, eight equally spaced
        upstream portions 43 of the vanes 15 are provided, and when
        viewed from the side, the upstream portions 43 of the vanes 15
        extend straight upwardly from the downstream ends 49 and then
        curve leftwardly near the upstream ends 48. The upstream portion
        43 of each curved vane portion is inclined at an angle opposite
        the incline of the blade 33 that extends axially and radially
        inward toward the outlet or second end 28 to assist in
        converting the rotary component of the air flow into laminar and
        axial flow in the housing. </p>
      <p>[0043] Straight upstream portions 43A of the vanes 15 may also
        be used, as shown in FIG. 7, and other numbers of vanes 15 may
        be used. Further, if the motor 34 runs in the opposite
        direction, the incline of the curvature near the upstream ends
        48 would be reversed. </p>
      <p>[0044] The downstream portions 44 of the vanes 15 attach at an
        inner end to a downstream inner housing hub portion 57, are
        circumferentially spaced and extend radially outwardly from the
        housing hub portion 57 to the housing 13. The housing hub
        portion 57 and the downstream portions 44 of the vanes 15 extend
        axially from the stator 46 to or near the air outlet 28. The
        housing hub portion 57 has a circular cross section, has a
        diameter substantially equal to the diameter of the stator
        housing hub portion 47 at the upstream end adjacent to the
        stator housing hub portion 47, and tapers downstream to a point
        58 near the air outlet 28. This hub portion may be characterized
        as torpedo shaped. In the illustrated embodiment there are four
        downstream portions 44 of the vanes 15 circumferentially spaced
        at 90 degrees, with each downstream portion 44 being aligned
        with an upstream portion 43 of a vane 15. Other numbers of
        downstream portions 44 of the vanes 15 can be used. </p>
      <p>[0045] The number of the blades 33 may be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or
        8. The number of the vanes 15 may be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8. The
        number of vanes 15 should be different from the number of blades
        33. If the number of vanes 15 and blades 33 are the same, added
        noise is generated due to harmonics. </p>
      <p>[0046] The air moving device 12 discharges air at a high
        velocity in a generally axial flow having a columnar pattern
        with minimal lateral dispersion after exiting the air outlet 28.
        The cowling 19 extends along a curve toward the inside to reduce
        turbulence and noise for air flow entering the air inlet 21. The
        impeller hub 32, the stator hub 47 and the housing hub 57 form
        the inner housing hub 16. The taper of the housing hub 57
        generally follows the taper of the housing 13 so that the cross
        sectional area for air flow decreases about 10% to 35% through
        the air moving device 12 to avoid back pressure and at the same
        time increase air flow velocity. In the embodiment shown the air
        flow decreases about 22%. </p>
      <p>[0047] The vanes 15 convert the rotary component of the air
        flow from the impeller 31 into laminar and axial air flow in the
        housing. The leftward curve of the upstream ends 48 of the
        upstream portions 43 of the vanes 15, in the illustrated
        embodiment, reduces the energy loss in the conversion of the
        rotary component of the air flow from the impeller 31 into
        laminar and axial air flow in the housing. The small gap 55
        between the impeller 31 and vanes 15 prevents the generation of
        turbulence in the air flow in the gap 55. The taper of the
        housing 13 in combination with the taper of the housing hub 57
        to the point 58 allows the air flow to exit the air outlet 28 in
        a continuous, uninterrupted columnar pattern with minimal
        dispersion, with no center hole or gap at a linear speed greater
        than would be imparted by a fan alone. The inside surface of the
        housing 13 is a substantially smooth uninterrupted surface to
        minimize turbulence and energy loss. </p>
      <p>[0048] The hanger 23 is mounted to rotate and lock relative to
        the housing 13, so that when the hanger 23 is attached to an
        overhead support such as ceiling, the air flow from the air
        moving device 12 may be directed vertically or aimed at any
        selected angle from the vertical as shown in FIG. 8. As shown in
        FIGS. 1 and 9, the first section 25 of the housing 13 includes
        mounting tabs 91 on opposite sides on the upper edge of the
        first section 25. Each mounting tab 91 includes a round,
        outwardly directed mounting face 92, and a housing aperture 93
        that extends inwardly through the center of the mounting tab 91.
        A pair of outwardly projecting housing ridges 94 extend radially
        on the mounting face 92 on opposite sides of the housing
        aperture 93. </p>
      <p>[0049] Each end 24 of the hanger 23 has a round, inwardly
        facing hanger end face 96, similar in size to the mounting face
        92 on the housing 13. A hanger end aperture 97 extends through
        the center of the hanger end face 96. A plurality of spaced,
        radially extending grooves 98, sized to receive the housing
        ridges 94, are provided on each hanger end face 96. Bolt 100
        extends through the hanger end aperture 97 and threads into an
        internally threaded cylindrical insert 101, rigidly affixed in
        housing aperture 93. The angle of the housing 13 is chosen by
        selecting a pair of opposed grooves 97 on each hanger end 24 to
        receive the housing ridges 94. The pivotal arrangement enables
        the housing to move to a selected angle and is lockable at the
        selected angle to direct air flow at the selected angle. </p>
      <p>[0050] FIG. 10 shows an air moving device 12 mounted to the
        ceiling 62 of a room 63 shown as being closed sided with opposed
        side walls. Warm air near the ceiling 62 is pulled into the air
        moving device 12. The warm air exits the air moving device 12 in
        a column 64 that extends to the floor 65. When the column 64
        reaches the floor 65, the warm air from the ceiling pushes the
        colder air at the floor 65 outward towards the opposed side
        walls 66 and upward towards the ceiling 62. When the column 64
        reaches the floor 65, the warm air from the ceiling will also
        transfer heat into the floor 65, so that heat is stored in the
        floor 65. The stored heat is released when the ceiling is cooler
        than the floor. The heat may also be stored in articles on the
        floor and earth under the floor. The air moving device 12
        destratifies the air in a room 63 without requiring the
        imperforate physical tube of many prior known devices. The air
        moving device 12 destratifies the air in a room 63 with the
        warmer air from the ceiling 62 minimally dispersing before
        reaching the floor 65, unlike many other prior known devices.
        The air moving device 12 will also remove dead air anywhere in
        the room. It is understood that the air moving device 12 may
        also be mounted horizontally in a container, trailer truck or
        room as is describe hereafter. </p>
      <p>[0051] Referring to FIG. 11, an air moving device 12 is fitted
        with an inlet grill 68 and an electric connector 69 for
        attachment to a light can 70 with a light bulb socket 71 at the
        upper end. The inlet grill 68 includes a plurality of
        circumferentially spaced grill fins 72 that attach to the first
        end 17 of the housing 13. The grill fins 72 are separated by air
        intake slots 73, and extend axially outwardly from the first end
        17 and curve radially inwardly and are integral with a flat
        circular mounting plate 74 that is substantially parallel with
        the first end 17. The electrical connector 69 has a tube 76 that
        is integral at one end with the center of the mounting plate 74
        and extends axially therefrom, and a light bulb type, right hand
        thread externally threaded male end 77 attached to the other end
        of the shaft 78. Grill 68, plate 74 and tube 76 are shown as
        made of a one piece construction. Plate 74 has holes that
        received screws 83 or like fasteners to fasten plate 74 to
        ceiling 62. </p>
      <p>[0052] The shaft 78 telescopes in the tube 76. The tube 76 has
        a pair of opposed keyways 76A that receive keys 78A on the shaft
        78 which allow axial sliding movement of the shaft 78 in the
        tube 76. A compression spring 75 fits in the tube and bears
        against the bottom of shaft 78 and top of plate 74. Preferably
        the shaft 78 has a selected length relative to the length of the
        can 70 such that when the air moving device 12 is mounted in a
        can 70 in a ceiling 62, the threaded male end 77 engages the
        socket 71 before the mounting plate 74 contacts the ceiling 62
        and when the threaded male end 77 is screwed into the socket 71,
        the mounting plate 74 bears against the ceiling 62. The spring
        75 is compressed between plate 74 and shaft 78. Screws 83 fasten
        the plate to the ceiling 62. Since the light can 70 may be open
        to air above the ceiling 62, the mounting plate 74 is preferably
        sized to cover the open lower end of the can 70, so that only
        air from below the ceiling 62 is drawn into the air moving
        device 12. The air moving device 12 fitted with the inlet grill
        68 and the electrical connector 69 can also be used with a
        ceiling light socket. </p>
      <p>[0053] The air moving device 12 may include an intake grill 79
        for preventing objects from entering the impeller 31, as shown
        in FIG. 12. The intake grill 79 shown has a substantially
        hemispherical shape, and includes a plurality of
        circumferentially spaced grill fins 80 separated by intake slots
        81. The grill fins 80 extend axially outwardly and curve
        radially inwardly from the first end 17 of the housing 13 to a
        central point 82 spaced from the first end 17. Other shapes of
        intake grills are suitable for the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0054] FIG. 13 shows an air moving device 12 with a misting
        nozzle 84. The nozzle 84 extends through the point 58 of the
        housing hub 57 to spray water into the column of air exiting the
        air outlet 28 to cool the air through evaporation. The media
        exiting the nozzle 84 and being supplied through tube 85 can
        have other purposes such as a disinfectant or a fragrance or a
        blocking agent for distinctive needs. The nozzle 84 connects to
        a water line 85, in the housing hub 59 that connects to a water
        source (not shown). </p>
      <p>[0055] FIG. 14 shows an air moving system 86 for use in
        buildings with very high ceilings, including an air moving
        device 12, an upwardly extending, tube 87 (shown cut away)
        connected at a lower end to the air inlet 21 of the air moving
        device 12, and a truncated upper air moving device 88 having an
        air outlet 89 connected to the upper end of the tube 87. The
        housing of device 88 is called truncated because it may be
        shortened or cut off below the fins 29. A conventional air
        moving device 12 may be used for device 88. The tube 87 may be
        flexible and is preferably fire resistant. The air moving system
        86 is mounted to a ceiling or like support with the air outlet
        28 of the air moving device 12 spaced above the floor,
        preferably about 10 to 50 feet. The tube may be for example from
        30 to 100 feet long. The upper air moving device 88 at the top
        of the system 86 has a higher air moving flow capacity than the
        air moving device 12 at the bottom of the cascading system 86.
        By way of example, and not as a limitation, the upper air moving
        device 88 may have a capacity of 800 cfm and the air moving
        device 12 may have a capacity of 550 cfm. </p>
      <p>[0056] FIGS. 15, 15A, 15B, 15C, 15D and 16 show the air moving
        device 12 mounted in an opening 103 in a ceiling 104. A
        generally cylindrical can 105 mounts on and extends above the
        ceiling 104, and has an open can bottom 106, and a closed can
        top 107. The can top 107 includes a semi-circular, downward
        opening, circumferentially extending channel 108. A
        semi-circular fin 111 extends radially across the channel 108 to
        prevent swirling of the air before entering the air inlet 21.
        Additional fins may be used. A grill and support assembly 125
        mounts to the ceiling and extends and connects to the exterior
        of the housing of device 12. A grill including spaced openings
        110 between fins 109 to allow air to flow up from the room along
        the housing and past the cowling 19 into the inlet 21. The grill
        and support assembly 125 includes an outer ring 120 fastened to
        the underside of the ceiling including the convexly curved grill
        fins 109 with air openings 110 between connected outer ring 120
        and an inner ring 121. Ring 121 has a spherical concave inner
        bearing surface 122. A ring 123 has a spherical convexly curved
        exterior bearing surface 124 is mounted on and affixed to the
        housing with bearing surfaces 122 and 124 mating in a frictional
        fit to support the housing to be at a vertical position or
        tilted at an angle to the vertical axis and be held by friction
        at the vertical axis or a selected angle relative to the
        vertical axis to direct air flow as required. </p>
      <p>[0057] The can 105 has an outwardly extending bottom flange 140
        that fits against the underside of the ceiling 104. The can 105
        preferably has four circumferentially spaced bottom openings 141
        at 90 degree intervals that are rectangular in shape and extend
        up the can wall a short distance from the bottom flange 140. A
        clamping member 142 preferably made as a molded plastic body has
        a main body portion 143 above the ceiling 104 outside the can
        wall and an end flange portion 144 that fits inside the can
        opening 142. The main body portion 143 has a U-shaped outer wall
        portion 145 and an inner hub portion 146 having an aperture 147.
        The clamping member 142 inserts into the opening 141 via the
        open end of the can. A bolt fastener 151 extends through a hole
        in the flange, through a hole in the ceiling and threads into
        the aperture 147 in the main body portion to clamp the can 105
        to the ceiling 104. </p>
      <p>[0058] As shown in FIG. 15D the grill and support assembly 125
        is mounted to the ceiling 104 and can 105 by a bolt fastener 149
        extending through an aperture in ring 120, through the ceiling
        104 and into a nut 150 in flange 140 in the can. Preferably
        there are four bolt fasteners 149 at 90 degree intervals midway
        between fasteners 151 above described. The ceiling 104 typically
        would be a plasterboard ceiling in which a suitable hole is cut.
        A variation of FIG. 15 would be to extend or form the peripheral
        of outer ring 120 into a flat panel having a dimension of 2 ft.
        by 2 ft. that would fit in and be held by a grid that holds a
        conventional ceiling panel. </p>
      <p>[0059] Referring to FIG. 17, an air moving device is fitted
        with an inlet grill 113, a light bulb style threaded male end
        114 for threading into a light bulb socket, and a light bulb
        socket 115. The inlet grill 113 includes a plurality of
        circumferentially spaced grill fins 116 that attach to the first
        end of the housing 13. The grill fins 116 are separated by air
        intake slots 117, and extend axially outwardly from the first
        end 17 and curve radially inwardly to a flat circular mounting
        plate 118 that is substantially parallel with and spaced axially
        from the first end 17. Threaded male end 114 is mounted on and
        extends upwardly from the mounting plate 118. The socket 115 is
        mounted inside the housing 13 in a downwardly opening fashion so
        that light from a bulb 119 threaded into the socket 115 is
        directed downwards. </p>
      <p>[0060] Referring now to FIG. 18, there is shown a tent having
        an inclined top 132 extending down from an apex and connected at
        the lower end to a vertical side wall 131 and terminating above
        a floor 133 to provide a side opening 134 so that the tent is an
        open sided room. The air moving device 12 is mounted below the
        top apex and directs the air in the room downwardly in a
        columnar pattern to the floor and along the floor and then back
        with some air passing in and out the side openings 134 along the
        floor 133. For wide tents, the air will pass up before it
        reaches the side walls. </p>
      <p>[0061] The air moving device and system herein described has
        relatively low electrical power requirement. A typical fan motor
        is 35 watts at 1600 rpm for an impeller of 8.5" that will
        effectively move the air from the ceiling to the floor in a room
        having a ceiling height of 30 ft. Another example is 75 watts
        with an impeller diameter 8.5" at 2300 rpm in a room having a
        ceiling height of 70 ft. </p>
      <p>[0062] Referring now to FIG. 19, there is shown a shipping
        container 161 having an air moving device 12 disposed
        horizontally in the lower left end. The device 12 directs the
        air horizontally along the bottom wall or floor, up the opposite
        side wall and across the top wall to exit an outlet duct 162
        above and spaced from the device 12 of the air moving device.
        The device 12 will penetrate the air and promote flushing and
        circulation of the air space. The device 12 may be mounted to
        direct the air generally horizontally or up or down at an angle
        to the true horizontal. This arrangement may be provided in
        other air spaces such as a trailer truck, room or the like. </p>
