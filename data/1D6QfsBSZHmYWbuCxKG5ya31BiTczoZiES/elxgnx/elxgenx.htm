          The world food crisis may well be averted because a handful of
          innovative men have dared challenge established agricultural
          dogma and have brought technology to the verge of a
          revolution.<br>
          <br>
          Electrogenic crop stimulation is the name of the game, and
          though it sounds like man is messing with God's business, it
          isn't what you might think and the ramifications of this
          technical revolution are far more beneficial that today's
          chemical fertilizer, agribusiness methods.<br>
          <br>
          Based on 5 years of intensive research and experimental
          plantings in all areas of the country, the ECSS (Electronic
          Crop Stimulation System ) accomplished the following:<br>
          <br>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight:

              germination rates of seeds.</span><br style="font-weight:

            <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">2.

            <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">4.
              Increased resistance to adverse weather conditions such as
              drought, high winds and low temperatures.</span><br
              style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">

              Vastly increased per acre.</span><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Additionally, the experimentors now have produced and enzyme
          that literally reconsitutes soils, meaning that more land
          around the world can be made productive.<br>
          <br>
          Claude Corson, president of Intertec Inc of Eckhart IN, one of
          the key men in the ECSS program, told the <span
            style="font-style: italic;">Exchange</span> :<br>
          <br>
          "If you are a farmer, you doubt what we have to say until you
          try it. If you are an agricultural professor, you doubt it so
          much you won't bother to try it. But if you try it, you'll
          like it".<br>
          <br>
          Most Americans have heard vague references to the crisis in
          world food production and threats of terrible famine, but the
          populace is generally unaware of agricultural problems.<br>
          <br>
          "The Universities have reacted negatively to our experiments,
          but we are going ahead without their endorsement because we
          get results at harvest time whether they agree or not", Corson
          added.<br>
          <br>
          The idea of crop stimulation is not new. Experimenters have
          been trying to stimulate seeds with magnets and
          electromagnetic incluences for the past 200 years.<br>
          <br>
          "The literature is full of experiments that didn't work&nbsp;
          very well, so the professors don't give us much credence",
          Corson added. "However, technology has improved since those
          other experiments and we now know what we are doing".<br>
          <br>
          The story of the development of ECSS is long and complicated.
          It began with two curious laymen many years ago and slowly
          evolved to the point where scientist Andrew Zaderej (
          Exchange's first Profile in Excellence ) put it together with
          sound scientific support in both theory and practice.<br>
          <br>
          The two laymen were the late Jimmy Scribner of Greenville SC,
          and Joe Smith of Levelland TX. Both men found that they could
          grow superior crops with electronic stimulation. Their methods
          were crude and their scientific theory totally confused, but
          their results were intriguing.<br>
          <br>
          Corson, who has provided the finances to develop the program,
          came along and brought in the thinking of colorful
          pyramidologist Pat Flanagan of California.<br>
          <br>
          "I was convinced then, and I'm more convinced now, that there
          is a mystery force or energy at work here and Flanagan has the
          courage to openly investigate such a prospect", Corson said.<br>
          <br>
          Though Flanagan is considered a kook by many scientists, he
          did make improvements in the systems as conceived by Scribner
          and Smith.<br>
          <br>
          The fledgling ECSS program produced remarkable yields in both
          cotton and maize for two years in the area around Lubbock TX.<br>
          <br>
          "The yields were nearly doubled from the average and that was
          in a bad year", Smith reported. Exchange has visited the area
          and verified the crop yields at harvest time.<br>
          <br>
          The crops, grown by veteran cotton and maize farmer Charles
          Macha of Levelland, doubled in yield although he used no
          chemical fertilizers that year and required less than half the
          normal amount of water. The implications were staggering.<br>
          <br>
          Of course the stronger, healthier, stimulated plants were able
          to take more nutriments from the soil and it is yet to be
          determined what role fertilizers will play.<br>
          <br>
          "Naturally, the soils must be periodically replenished, but
          not with the expensive, imbalanced chemical fertilizers used
          today", Corson pointed out.<br>
          <br>
          "We have a black mineral deposit that is being mined for both
          fertilizer and animal feed supplement. Minerals are vital and
          it seems they must be available to plants in a particular
          balance", Corson stressed.<br>
          <br>
          Today's petroleum-based chemical fertilizers do not provide a
          balance and the soils have suffered tremendously. The powerful
          fertilizer industry denies this, but the facts are speaking
          for themselves; something must be done to replenish our soils.
          ( <span style="font-style: italic;">Sea Energy Agriculture</span>,
          a book by Dr Maynard Murray and Tom Valentine, clearly
          explains the solution and sea-solid fertilzers would fit well
          in the plans of ECSS backers. )<br>
          <br>
          "As we continue to prove our system works, we expect to feel
          pressure from the fertilizer industry, but we are not looking
          for a fight, only facts and the future of world food
          production", Corson said.<br>
          <br>
          Two years ago Corson added the energetic thinking and
          abilities of Zaderej and his cousin Charles "Doc" Corson, a
          veterinarian of 35 years experience to the team.<br>
          <br>
          Zaderej, one of world's leading electronic engineers and a
          versatile scientist educated at the famed Kiev Polytechnic
          Institute in the Ukraine, combined known scientific principles
          with the methods of the earlier experimenters and by using
          superior solid state electronic technology he developed&nbsp;
          a seed-treating machine that promises to revolutionize
          agriculture.<br>
          <br>
          Doc Corson, with his knowledge of animals, plants and soils
          and his practical ingenuity, became the spokesman for the team
          and has managed to convert thousands of acres of farmland to
          the process for experimental purposes.<br>
          <br>
          "The farmers who trusted me in the beginning are glad they
          did, we've increased their yield and their income
          considerably", Doc Corson explained.<br>
          <br>
          The ECSS program recently added the fascinating enzyme
          developed by Dr Keith Richardson of Albuqueque NM. Dr
          Richardson's years of research have produced a stable enzyme
          that acts to help inorganic elements convert to organic forms
          and vice-versa. In crop tests it has proven to be extremely
          beneficial and experiments show that this enzyme, derived from
          cultured bacteria, can actually convert hardpan&nbsp; (useless
          soil) to "living" soil.<br>
          <br>
          Corson told <span style="font-style: italic;">Exchange</span>
          that the work of Zaderej and other scientists prove the
          "enzyme is the key to all life. Life in plants and animals is
          elcetrogenic and we utilize two key factors in teh
          electrogenic process -- enzymes and ions".<br>
          <br>
          The ECSS works in three stages. Step one is coating the seeds
          with multimineral coloidal formulation. This means the seeds
          are covered with a charged liquid substance before they move
          into the second stage.<br>
          <br>
          Step two is processing the seeds through an ion field and an
          electrostatic field in the machine developed by Zaderej.
          Finally, the soil is treated with the enzyme ( one gallon per
          acre ) and perhaps balanced mineral fertilizer.<br>
          <br>
          Zaderej designed the seed-treating machine to incorporate ion
          flow that implants particles of the selected minerals on the
          coating inside the seeds. The seeds also pass through an
          infrared wave spectrum and finally through a static energy
          generator where a negative charge of 100,000 volts provides
          "cathodic" protection for the seeds and gives them "shelf
          life".<br>
          <br>
          Claude Corson told <span style="font-style: italic;">Exchange</span>,
          "We have discovered that the combined use of the multimineral
          solution and the negative ion generaotrs has had a synergistic
          effect on all biochemcial processes within the seed, making
          the total effect greater than the sum of the effects taken
          independently".<br>
          <br>
          The ECSS team is making inroads in the agriculture community,
          despite the failure of the academic agronomists to endorse
          their concept.<br>
          <br>
          One day soon the world may have true abudance because of the
          foresight and determination of these men.<br>

      <p>“The world has been good to me, and it’s time I paid it back”.
      </p>
      <p>Those are the words of Claude E. Corson, a self-made Indiana
        millionaire who founded Coachman Industries with his brothers
        back in the mid-1960’s. Corson remains a director with Coachmen,
        but is no longer active in management as he has chosen to go in
        another business direction. </p>
      <p>“I want my money to benefit humanity. I’m not in business for
        profit alone. We want to improve the quality of life for our own
        profits”. </p>
      <p>Those are noble aspirations indeed --- and nobler still when
        one realizes that Corson has put his money where his mouth is. </p>
      <p>“I’ve spent a lot of money and eight long years building this
        program for international food production, and now we are ready
        for the seeds of our ideas to grow into a major economic force
        in this world”. </p>
      <p>Corson developed a series of business entities that interrelate
        and build upon one another to help bring his dream of better
        quality and more quantity foods to a hungry world closer to
        reality. </p>
      <p>The six-pronged program has emerged suddenly with world
        leadership in critical areas of food production and agriculture.
        The first stage of Corson’s program was to establish a
        world-wide trading company with a sound reputation and track
        record. </p>
      <p>That company is Intertek, Inc., of Elkhart, Indiana. It is the
        core for distribution of the innovative products flowing from
        other Corson enterprises. </p>
      <p>The development of these firms is not an ego trip for the
        determined businessman. He seeks quality people to include in
        his program and he’s always quick to make sure everyone gets the
        credit and compensation for their efforts. </p>
      <p>A few years ago Corson was intrigued by the idea of plant
        growth stimulation demonstrated by the late Jimmy Scribner of
        South Carolina and by the curious phenomenon called the Pyramid
        Effect. </p>
      <p>Corson helped Scribner with joint-venture capital and formed a
        research institute t learn about these phenomena that other
        scientists considered pseudo-science. </p>
      <p>“There were a lot of problems; a lot of inconsistencies, but
        something was happening that could improve the quality of plant
        life and the size of crop yields”, Corson explained. </p>
      <p>Doggedly he spent his own cash and worked to stabilize and
        utilize the effect that could be observed but hardly controlled.
        He met and joined forces with Joe Smith of Levelland, Texas ---
        another eager but amateur experimenter who was ionizing seeds to
        stimulate plant growth. </p>
      <p>He met and financially aided G. Patrick Flanagan, the
        self-proclaimed boy wonder of the pyramid mystique. While
        Flanagan was being denounced by others as a pseudo-science nut,
        Corson was listening attentively and seeking the positive value
        while sublimating the negative factors in the association. </p>
      <p>Then Corson met a South Bend, Indiana scientist who was more
        than brilliant in several fields of knowledge. The man is Andrew
        Zaderej and his firm Unitron, Inc., an electronics research and
        development company. </p>
      <p>The merger was a natural. Corson plunged in with enthusiasm and
        capital --- ignoring the downward trends in American business at
        the time. </p>
      <p>Zaderej, who was featured as the first profile in excellence
        with the maiden issue of National Exchange, s a scientist with
        few peers. His abilities in electronics, chemistry, biology and
        physics are renowned among technical insiders. Zaderej had
        know-how, and more importantly, credibility. </p>
      <p>The Ukrainian-born engineer rejected some of the theories
        behind the claims of Flanagan, Scribner, and others --- but in
        the spirit of true science he did not reject that the phenomenon
        indeed occurred. </p>
      <p>Corson and Zaderej co-authored a brief explanation of the
        patented process and Zaderej has authored a major scientific
        paper on the subject. </p>
      <p>“This is not the work of one man”, Corson explained. “This is
        the combination of many years of science and the brilliant
        research of hundreds of scientists around the world”. </p>
      <p>The purpose of the Unitron system is to improve plant life and
        help overcome the need for the heavy chemical fertilization that
        is threatening the world’s soil balances today. </p>
      <p>“We are not organic gardeners or fanatics”, Corson stressed.
        “We know the value of fertilizers and also the value of organic
        farming methods --- we effect a balance between the two and
        while helping to reconstitute the soils we are capable of
        producing better quality produce and more of it”. </p>
      <p>The Corson-Zaderej explanation of the Electrogenic postulate of
        plant life appears on these pages. </p>
      <p>In addition to the electrogenics, Corson and Joe Smith chanced
        upon an enzymologist who had developed a unique enzyme for
        agricultural uses. </p>
      <p>Enzymes make up the majority of life’s essence --- protein. All
        enzymes are protein molecules, but not all proteins are enzymes.
        Enzymes are life’s workers; while they are not themselves
        “alive”, they are catalysts for the biochemical changes that
        must take place wherever life is concerned. </p>
      <p>Corson’s third firm is the Electrozyme Corp., a venture with
        Joe Smith that manufactures and markets a stabilized,
        multi-substrate enzyme for agriculture. The term multi-substrate
        is key in this instance --- it means that this particular enzyme
        reacts with numerous substances, not merely a few. </p>
      <p>An enzyme effects chemical change without itself being changed.
        This enzyme effects numerous changes --- all beneficial to plant
        growth, such as nitrogen fixation, and literally helps “sweeten”
        harsh sols and balance where chemicals have caused an imbalance.
      </p>
      <p>“A farmer may place 160 pounds of ammoniated nitrates on the
        soil, but his crops will only utilize about 16 of those pounds.
        One of the functions of our enzyme is to make the nitrogen more
        available to the plants, allowing the farmer to use less and get
        optimum results”, Corson explained. </p>
      <p>While most Americans are ignorant of today’s farming
        technology, there are many who cheer such news. During the past
        three decades the rich soils have been made more and more
        imbalanced by the need for heavy amounts of chemical
        fertilizers. The Electrozyme product will help restore a natural
        sweetness to farmlands. </p>
      <p>Bringing new ideas to the world is never easy --- and Corson is
        well aware of the difficulties. The final three prongs in his
        six-pointed program are designed to help to overcome the
        difficulties. </p>
      <p>Intertec obtained the marketing rights for a mineral that is
        mined in Oregon. The bionutritional substance is a coal-like
        fossil seaweed bed that provides all the minerals and trace
        elements needed to grow healthy plants and animals. </p>
      <p>Charles “Doc” Corson, a veteran veterinarian with nearly 40
        years experience with farm animals and farming is Claude’s
        cousin, and also the head of marketing for the enzyme, mineral
        and seed treatment program.’ </p>
      <p>“That mineral is the best doggone animal and plant food you can
        imagine. Even I found it hard to believe at first when I saw the
        changes in pigs, chickens and cattle. And what it does for crops
        would make an organic gardener’s heart swell with pride”. </p>
      <p>The Corsons are not taking sides in the ideological feud
        between organic farmers and chemical farmers --- they are
        proving that a happy medium exists. </p>
      <p>“Our mineral, enzyme and treatment is organic all the way
        insofar as we don’t utilize any commercial chemicals”, Doc
        explained. </p>
      <p>“On the other hand there is a need for fertilizer to maintain
        the necessary production. Our product utilize the fertilizer to
        maintain the necessary production. Our products utilize the
        fertilizers more adequately and help sweeten the soils after
        their use”. </p>
      <p>It is apparent that Corson’s program is designed to accomplish
        his original goal --- benefit mankind. To effect a workable
        compromise between the organic and the inorganic theories and
        practices of farming can not only maintain needed food
        production, but can prevent further pollution, but can prevent
        further pollution, but can prevent further pollution of the
        soils. </p>
      <p>“Food is more important to the world of tomorrow than oil”,
        Corson stressed. Even with the mineral, the enzyme and the
        treatment the innovations are difficult to market in a system
        that fights change with bureaucratic efficiency. </p>
      <p>In order to bring his products to the world rapidly, Corson has
        added two final prongs to the program: comfrey and aquaculture!
        This curious pair makes more sense than you think </p>
      <p>“I can’t take any credit for being a brilliant, far-seeing
        visionary and picking those two on purpose”, Corson explained.
        “It’s as if the powers that be are directing our operations ---
        we seemed to fall into the right patter”. </p>
      <p>Comfrey is renowned as an herb. It should be a food, and it
        will be a major livestock feed soon --- rivaling alfalfa, corn
        and soybeans. </p>
      <p>Phil Peters of Canby, Oregon is the world’s leading grower and
        marketer of comfrey. Next month’s Exchange will cover his firm
        and his visions in detail. </p>
      <p>“Comfrey is the electrogenic crop”, Corson proclaims. </p>
      <p>Comfrey roots respond well to electrogenic treatment and
        comfrey is like potato --- planted from portions of the root.
        The plant grows practically anywhere and it has more amino acids
        than any other plant. It is also loaded with a substance called
        allantoin, a cell-proliferant and this is the reason comfrey has
        been called knitbone for centuries. </p>
      <p>In concert with Corson and an innovative Hawaiian farming firm,
        Lowe, Inc., comfrey has been introduced to the greatest
        agricultural land in the world --- Hawaii. </p>
      <p>On these islands where nature grows abundant crops of all kinds
        year round, comfrey will flourish and provide feed for
        livestock, roots for planting around the world, and perhaps feed
        for marine animals. </p>
      <p>That’s right, marine animals! </p>
      <p>The final prong in the program is the glamour and capital
        prong. Aquaculture is the process for farming marine life and
        providing excellent, pollution-free seafood protein for fun and
        profit. </p>
      <p>While Corson’s first love is electrogenics, his common sense
        told him he needed some international clout. Opportunity came
        while he was introducing electrogenics to Hawaii, and he made a
        bold move. </p>
      <p>“We now have world leadership in Aquaculture, in Electrogenics
        and in Comfrey”, Corson proclaimed. </p>
      <p>Art Lowe, like Phil Peters, Joe Smith and Doc Corson before him
        fits the model for this innovative team. </p>
      <p>“If a person can’t have fun in business and can’t get the feel
        for what we are going to accomplish --- then all the money in
        the world won’t help him join in”, Corson said. </p>
      <p>Lowe and his associates blended into the expanding picture as
        if someone had scripted the characters and events. This
        fair-haired boy of Hawaiian agriculture shares with Corson a
        disdain for bureaucratic and corporate bungling and a feel for
        getting things done with a minimum of paperwork. </p>
      <p>Lowe, Inc., has a lease on some of the prime lands on the
        Island of Oahu. The Campbell Estate owns the property leased by
        Lowe that borders on the famous Pipeline surfing area at the
        northern tip of the island. </p>
      <p>Lowe used that land to develop a hybrid corn which thrives in
        Hawaii, and he has a number of other vital agricultural
        innovations pending --- including a joint venture with Corson,
        Peters and Western Comfrey. </p>
      <p>But even the most productive land in the world cannot rival
        bodies of water for food production. Man can grow hundreds times
        more protein in an acre of ponds than he can on an acre of soil.
      </p>
      <p>The art of farming aquatic life is more than 5,000 years old in
        the Orient --- and today’s population crunch is causing the
        world to take a serious look at all the prospects. </p>
      <p>Corson and Lowe joined forces in the nick of time to take the
        world leadership in the ability to produce prawns, oysters and
        other sea life profitably. Congress just passed a bill called
        the national Aquaculture Organic Act, in which more than $750
        million in funding will be made available for the commercial
        development of aquatic farming. </p>
      <p>Hawaii is the leading state in aquaculture, and Lowe, Inc., is
        well out in front even without government support. </p>
      <p>The crux of the program is a prototype farm established with
        the help of government funds a few years ago --- the Aquatic
        Farms operated by outstanding marine biologists has proven the
        economics of aquaculture; they can provide food profitably and
        this is the key to all human endeavor. </p>
      <p>The team of experts solved a myriad problems in cultivating
        prawns, the large, tasty shrimp enjoyed by gourmets and
        gourmands around the world. They have also vastly improved
        oyster farming and can obtain market size oysters in six months,
        whereas it takes nearly three years in nature. </p>
      <p>There are no chemical additives, nor hormones involved in this
        program of aquatic farming --- in fact, the sea foods are
        pollution-free. The secret is to provide quality deed around the
        clock and to let nature do the providing. </p>
      <p>For example, in nature oysters filter dying one-celled plant
        life called phytoplankton from the water as the microscopic
        critters die and slowly sink toward the bottom. Phytoplankton
        are the key to the food chain --- they are plants that convert
        sunlight to oxygen and they reside in the top two feet of
        surface water. </p>
      <p>At Aquatic Farm, and soon at the new Lowe-Corson facility,
        oysters don’t have to wait for the dying plankton, they happily
        filter live bacteria around the clock. </p>
      <p>Since nearly half the oyster beds on the coasts of the US have
        suffered from pollution to the point where many people are
        afraid to eat the tasty bivalves, this pollution-free method is
        vital. </p>
      <p>The brilliant team of marine biologists, headed by Dr Ed Scura
        and Dr Kynn Burzell are under contract to Lowe and as additional
        incentive, their pay is based on performance. </p>
      <p>Part of the prawn farming operation is to throw feed mash into
        the ponds to help with the biomass concentration upon which the
        prawns feed. It is anticipated that a comfrey mash will
        considerably improve the quality of the biomass. This remains to
        be tested. </p>
      <p>“World leadership in aquaculture will lead to agricultural
        contracts with nations around the world and we will bring our
        integrated program to these countries expeditiously. This
        organization is becoming a major economic force in the world and
        it will be done with a minimum of waste and political
        interference”, Corson concluded. </p>

      <center><b><font size="+1">The Electrogenic Postulate of Cell
            Growth</font></b>
        <p><b><font size="+1">By Claude Corson and Andrew Zaderej</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>If we are to understand why a seed germinates, sprouts,
        develops roots and grows to become a mature fruit-bearing plant,
        it is first necessary to observe the anatomy of a seed, plus the
        anatomy of the typical plant cell. </p>
      <p>A seed contains an embryo which is surrounded by an envelope of
        cells, which act as small energy storage units, similar to an
        electrical capacitor. The larger part of the seed contains
        carbohydrates or stored food which is surrounded by the shell of
        the seed. </p>
      <p>A dry seed, like you purchase for planting, is alive but
        relatively inactive. The metabolic processes operate at a very
        slow rate. To become activated, the seed must come into contact
        with moisture. Let us think of the soil as the media for
        moisture in this explanation. </p>
      <p>The cell is the basic unit of life, both in plants and in
        animals. They are a remarkable microscopic miniaturization of
        life function, they are born of another, move, grow, react,
        protect themselves, reproduce, perform purposeful functions and
        die. They are drum-shaped organisms made up of a nucleus,
        nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm within a cellular membrane that
        encloses a host of other subcellular components that are support
        systems for the cells’ production of amino acids, hormones,
        enzymes, and proteins for the purpose of sustaining physical
        life. In fact, the cell closely resembles our solar galaxy. </p>
      <p>Moisture enters the cellular storage area of the seed which
        contains the plant embryo, which is made up of plant cells,
        sometimes called the eye of the seed. At the same time water
        molecules penetrate the pores of the seed coat, also called
        lipids, to soften the shell and to set up the conditions for the
        transport of stored food to the embryo. </p>
      <p>Water flux is the media of exchange, by recombination, of
        interior ions and exterior ions that are separated by the
        cellular membranes. Differing polarities of ions initiate an
        oscillating (vibrating) action in the membranes to activate the
        electrogenic pumps that enable the cells to convey materials
        from its surface to the interior through pinocytosis vesicle ---
        portholes --- in the external membrane. </p>
      <p>Combined cellular pumping (vibratory) action of many cells
        stimulate the membrane to excrete hormones for availability to
        surrounding cells to allow production of enzymes. The enzymes,
        large protein molecules, convert or digest the stored food in
        the remainder of the shell into simple compounds that the embryo
        can use as an energy source in the initial growth process of
        germinating and sprouting. </p>
      <p>DNA molecules in the nucleus, containing nature’s hereditary
        code, deliver the collective growing pattern in relation to the
        ambient, to the control center, also within the nucleus. RNA
        messengers molecules pick up this code and with the assistance
        of hormones and enzymes deliver it through a plasmic energy
        media of ions to the ribosomes of the cell that transcribe the
        message into microfilament and microtube tuners that shape the
        membrane to control the rate of vibration. Also the many needed
        proteins are fashioned from the amino acids by the ribosomes. </p>
      <p>The rate of oscillation of the cellular membranes coupled with
        the corresponding voltage potential, allow selectivity from a
        wide spectrum of nutrient elements, first selecting from the
        stored food in the shell for initial sprouting, then from the
        soil for growth and development. For example, if calcium is
        needed by the plant the DNA request is delivered to the control
        center to set up the correct oscillatory or vibratory rate to
        attract elemental calcium, whose identity is revealed through
        its own electromotive constant, or voltage potential level, for
        transport to the stomata of the plant for biological conversion
        to usable plant form. </p>
      <p>If iron, or zinc or copper, or boron, or nitrogen, or
        phosphate, or potassium, etc., all of which respond to their own
        individual electromotive force series, are called for by the
        control center of the cell upon instruction from DNA heredity
        code, ionic attraction is set up in cellular membranes that will
        provide the ion transport system through the living tissues that
        will accumulate according to the code of genetic heredity. In
        other words, the plant grows. </p>
      <p>Because rate of vibration is so deeply involved in the
        development of living systems, we can truly describe the
        harmonics involved as the “music of the spheres in miniature”. </p>

      <center><b><font size="+1">Application of Electronic Technology to
            the Electrogenic Treatment of Seeds</font></b>
        <p><b><font size="+1">By Andrew Zaderej and Claude E. Colson</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The Electrogenic Seed-Treating Machine incorporates seven base
        functions that, separately or in combination, are known to
        benefit plant development and growth. </p>
      <p>In this Technology Application Section, physical movement of
        the seeds through the machine is first described, then followed
        by an explanation of the physiological effect upon the seeds. </p>
      <p><b>Forward ~</b> </p>
      <p>The natural electrophysical forces at work within the cells of
        seed before, during, and after electrogenic treatment are the
        subject of this section. </p>
      <p>Seeds are alive, but relatively dormant until they are planted
        in the soil. Electrogenic treatment of seeds described herewith,
        condition and rejuvenates seeds for more rapid germination into
        a plant that will have increased vigor to develop to maturity
        with improved yield. </p>
      <p>The numerous cells of dormant seeds can be likened to
        electrical capacitors or tiny storage batteries in ground state;
        but have enormous potential once they are properly charged. A
        heavy charge of negative ions increases the exchange potential
        of internal and external ions to activate and operate the
        “electrogenic pumps”, made up of cellular structures, once the
        seeds are brought into contact with their growth medium. The
        reactant electrogenic pumps bring about more ion transport of
        growth substances controlled by the DNA heredity code to form
        the best possible combination of genes for optimum plant growth.
      </p>
      <p>If the reader can visualize the electronically stimulated
        “beehive of activity” within each one of the millions of cells
        of a seed after they have received a charge, he can then
        visualize and understand why electrogenic treatment of seeds
        will result in more rapid growth of a more vigorous plant with
        optimum yield under any growing condition. </p>
      <p>The basic objective of the multiple-process seed-treating
        machine is to intensify the energy level of the many components
        that make up each cell. It is the basis for the Unitron/Intertec
        electrogenic principle of Agriculture. </p>
      <p><b>Electrogenic Blender </b>--- </p>
      <p><i>The Physical Action</i>: Seeds are fed into the electrogenic
        machine through blending chamber (A) tat atomizes electrically
        charged particles of air and water containing enzymes and trace
        elements for application to the seeds. By the time the seeds
        reach the conveyer belt they have been coated in preparation for
        their journey through a variety of electronically simulated
        atmospheric conditions that are known to be beneficial to plant
        development. </p>
      <p><i>The Electrogenic Explanation</i>: As spray or mists are
        generated within specially designed nozzles in the presence of
        electrode fields, they take on a negative charge by
        electrostatic induction and are propelled to the area of the
        seeds by a stream of compressed air/water. </p>
      <p>As the negatively charged cloud enters the electrogenic
        chamber, two phenomena occur. First, the constraint to remain at
        ground level voltage induces into the seeds, a charge opposite
        to that of the cloud. Since opposites attract, the negative
        spray particles are drawn onto the seeds. At the same time a
        second electrical force becomes active, driving the droplets
        onto even the undersides of the seeds. </p>
      <p>Of particular importance is the fact that not only is more
        liquid enzyme deposited on the seeds, but high energy ions are
        distributed onto seeds which produce nitrogen (Ref. 54) fixation
        from the ambient and deposits them through inorganic processes
        such as the formation of nitrates in electrostatic discharge. </p>
      <p>The artificial precipitation (mist) causes the atmospheric
        fixation of nitrogen into nitrite for distribution onto the
        seeds (Ref. 63). </p>
      <p>This is the mechanism for the formation of negative ions
        through the negatively charged fragments to the species that
        have a higher electron affinity than the parent molecule, will
        produce a field-induced negative ion formation, which will
        enhance acceleration of chlorosis by exposure of the seeds to
        negative ions charges to develop a large increase in content of
        cytochrome C (Ref. 60). </p>
      <p>This stimulates the ferrous ion in chloroplasts, and helps
        chlorophyll biosynthesis and the ferrous ion is diverted to the
        enzyme systems concerned in germination. </p>
      <p>The Fe-containing enzymes are stimulated by the negative charge
        in the seeds to provide metabolic equipment essential for the
        support of an increased rate of growth. In contrast, dry seeds
        do not have sufficient moisture to permit the aqueous-phase
        enzyme reaction to biological membranes associated with lipid
        peroxidation in mitochondria, microsomes, and lysosomes. Thus,
        damage induced by free radicals accumulated in dry seeds,
        whereas in hydrated tissue such damage will be repaired. </p>
      <p>It is very important to have seeds moisturized before
        delivering onto the conveyer of the electrogenic chamber to
        improve the seeds’ ability to absorb the electrical charge. </p>
      <p><b>Electrogenic Chamber/Ion Chambers 1 and 2</b> --- </p>
      <p><i>The Physical Action</i>: Seeds are dropped onto the conveyer
        belt, driven by a variable speed motor, in a moist condition
        coated with an enzyme solution that contains minerals and trace
        elements. They are carried into an induced negative ion field
        (B) to excite intracellular components and to implant enzymes
        and trace elements into the seeds (C) with accelerated ion
        bombardment, a process known as electrophoresis. The atmospheric
        effect can be likened to that of lightning discharge. </p>
      <p><i>The Electrogenic Effect</i> : Using the electrical
        deposition fields (field-induced) and atmospheric air to
        transport and implant negative charge particles onto incoming
        seeds. </p>
      <p>Ion generators (Gun) No. 1 and No. 2 generate within the
        electrode needles an ion-flux field, (molecular ions, atom-ions,
        electrons and protons) that take on a negative charge by
        electrostatic induction and are carried outward to the seeds in
        a stream of field-induced negative ions (electrons). </p>
      <p>As the charged atmospheric air enters the Generator Fields, No.
        1 and 2, two phenomena occur. First, the small particles (atoms,
        electrons) will be induced into the seeds and larger particle
        molecules will be implanted into the seeds, which, at ground
        level voltage induces into the seeds a charge opposite to that
        of the negative charge. Since opposites attract, the negative
        air-particles are drawn onto the seeds, and at the same time a
        second electrical force becomes active, driving the negatively
        charged air-particles from the ambient onto even the undersides
        of the seeds. </p>
      <p>The strong fields in the vicinity of needle-electrodes induces
        field emission so that the electron affinity of molecules in the
        area close to the needles induces electron transfer. This
        electron affinity, enhanced by the field, will repel electrons
        of the absorbed polarized molecules from the pointed electrodes.
        The electron transfer from the electrode to the polarized
        substrate is exoergic (positive electron affinity) with the
        highly excited primary species that will undergo dissociative
        electron attachment. </p>
      <p>The negatively charged fragments (atmospheric air) are of a
        species that have a higher electron affinity than the parent
        molecule. The molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere converts
        (fixes) into nitrate and nitrite (Ref. 63) </p>
      <p>The mechanisms of the bio-atmosphere manufacture lightning and
        precipitation, and fix atmospheric nitrogen into amines. </p>
      <p>This mixture of water vapor and gases drifts continuously
        through the strong field in the vicinity of the needles (Ion
        Generators No. 1 and 2). Absorbed polarized molecules from the
        electrode attracted to the polarized substrate will produce an
        assortment of biochemicals which play important roles in the
        growth of living cells. Perhaps the most important is that the
        seeds, exposed to the highly accelerated air-ion field effects
        the onset of chlorosis and concurrently develop a large increase
        in the content of cytochrome C (Ref. 64). The strongly
        accelerated air-ion field affects the distribution of iron
        between active and residual pools. Active Fe which is located in
        the chloroplasts is not concerned with chlorophyll biosynthesis.
        The accelerated air-ion field decreases the active Fe content
        during the period when the chlorophyll declines; at the same
        time there occurs an increase in the residual Fe and cytochrome
        fractions. The Fe originally contained within the seed exists in
        a non-specific form and can be used as required for any purpose.
        The Fe is diverted to the enzyme systems involved in germination
        (Ref. 52). </p>
      <p>Throughout many multiple functions of ion-inducing fields it is
        possible to produce electro-synthesized biochemical groups
        bonded one to the other. They synthesis by electricity produces
        the carbon-containing organic compounds, four different kinds of
        amino acids, the building blocks of enzymes and other proteins,
        even urea in the “soup”, which are essential components of the
        biochemical pathways of modern organisms (Ref. 52). </p>
      <p>The mechanism for formation of field-induced negative ions
        through the negatively induced fragments to the species (cells),
        is applied to restore genetic structures of individual cells. </p>
      <p>The field-induced negative ions, into the cells, gives evidence
        that various genes and segments of DNA move onto and off of
        chromosomes and move from place to place on a specific site of
        chromosomes, or move elsewhere or undergo recombination. </p>
      <p>There are two different movements by two independent means.
        First, movements of short segments of DNA, about the size of
        genes, which turn off the expression of entire blocks of genes
        expressed subsequent to, and second, controlled along with the
        gene at the site to which they move. </p>
      <p>For all practical purposes, the field-induced negative ions
        help restore genetic structures in individual cells, and develop
        the site of air-ion action in cells, the regulatory systems
        which control iron metabolism in seeds and young seedlings (Ref.
        81). </p>
      <p>The electrical deposition fields of induced ions, take on the
        negative charge by electrostatic induction into cells, to
        biomembrane and mitochondria. Steady charges carry velocities of
        component patterns of migration proteins, in high field strength
        forces of electrophoresis. </p>
      <p>Utilizing the electrical deposition field-ions to organic
        (biochemical composition of carbonaceous shale),
        electro-physical techniques become possible to produce the
        nature of enzymatic catalysis (Refs. 8-13). </p>
      <p>The interaction of metal ions with amino acids, peptides, and
        proteins, and enzymatic oxidation-reduction systems, produce
        metal enzymes and catalytic reactions with molecular oxygen, and
        finally produces fixed molecular nitrogen. </p>
      <p>Metallo-proteins are involved in the storage and transfer of
        iron and copper on the activation of small molecules by means of
        coordination. </p>
      <p>The inducing field for charging aerosol particles depends upon
        the diffusion of gaseous ions to the particles as a result of
        their random thermal motion. The ions impart their electrical
        charge to the surface of the particles and the charged aerosol
        comes to equilibrium with the ionic atmosphere. This situation
        is described in the following equation, where: </p>
      <p>N<sub>c</sub> = electrical charge of particle elementary unit.
      </p>
      <p>D<sub>p</sub> = diameter of particle, cm </p>
      <p>k = Boltzmann constant </p>

      <p>c- = average speed of ion, cm/sec </p>
      <p>n = ion concentration n<sub>o</sub>/cm<sup>3</sup> </p>
      <p>t = time, sec. </p>
      <p>N<sub>c</sub> = ( D<sub>p</sub> Kt / 2 e<sup>2</sup> ) n ( 1 =
        Dpc pi 2<sup>2</sup> nt / 2 Kt ) </p>
      <p><b>The Electrogenic Aeration Tank</b>: </p>
      <p><i>The Physical Action</i> --- The bottom of the electrogenic
        chamber is a sealed tank through which the coating liquid (water
        containing enzymes) continuously recirculated between the
        storage area and the tank. The liquid used in the
        blender-sprayer for coating seeds comes from the electrogenic
        tank. Air currents are set up in the chamber to create moist air
        which simulates favorable atmospheric conditions for discharge
        from the ion generator guns for stimulation and implantations
        that occur. </p>
      <p><i>The Electrogenic Effect</i> --- The water with diluted
        enzymes in the electrogenic tank on the bottom of the
        Electrogenic Chamber serves as an electrode for Ion Generators 1
        and 2 and provide a useful function as a decomposer of ozone
        into more reactive intermediates. The principle oxidizing
        intermediates formed in the decay of ozone are catalyzed b
        hydroxide (-OH) ions in water. OH radicals in water provide a
        useful background for the evaluation of reactions of OH radicals
        with inorganic, organic and biological substrates. </p>
      <p>Inorganic ions in water act as catalysts, and will enhance
        certain useful reactions to serve as mechanisms for producing a
        rich assortment of polymers. This acts as catalyzation reactions
        to polarize electrons and bonds enzyme substrate intermediates
        (Ref. 4). </p>
      <p>The field-induced ions (atmospheric air) will be absorbed by
        incoming seeds, and the remaining charges will be absorbed by
        water in the electrogenic tank. This will enhance the
        colloid-chemical effect and depolymerization of large molecules
        and will cause direct biochemical effects in living organisms,
        extending plant seed germination, and on subsequent plant
        growth. The increase in metabolism stimulates cell division and
        growth (Ref. 5). </p>
      <p>The surface of the flowing water acted upon by aspirated air
        currents creates distribution of oxygen and moisture, in the
        ionized chamber to form air ions in a quasi-equilibrium
        atmospheric state, to seeds during treatment. </p>
      <p>The essential requirements for germination of seeds are
        moisture, oxygen, and a favorable temperature in an ionized
        atmosphere. </p>
      <p>In the earth’s atmosphere the air-to-earth current is
        approximately 2 x 10^-12 amperes per square meter. The exact
        value depends on the potential gradient number of ions per unit
        volume of air and the mobility of the ions. This current flow is
        due to lightning, ion movement, motion of charged rain droplets,
        dust particles and other particles in a state of motion in the
        air. </p>
      <p><b>Thermo-Generator Fan:</b> </p>
      <p><i>The Physical Action</i> --- As the seeds are emitted from
        the conveyer of the Electrogenic Chamber into the Cathodic
        Protection Chamber, they are exposed to a sequence of
        atmospheric and electronic influences designed to enhance their
        ability to become viable fruit-bearing plants. </p>
      <p><i>The Electrogenic Effect</i> --- An electric heater coupled
        with forced air (F) reduces moisture and hard seed content of
        the seeds. The heat produces the necessary thermal stress to
        break down the moisture permeability barrier in the seeds. Also,
        hard seed percentages are substantially reduced by this method
        of application. </p>
      <p><b>Infrared Spectrum: The Physical Action</b> --- Below the
        Thermo-Generator Fan is located a quartz-tube infrared lap (D).
        In less than a second the seeds absorb enough energy from the
        intense IR radiation field to allow the seed coat to become
        permeable. </p>
      <p><i>The Electrogenic Effect</i> --- Studies have shown that the
        quality of IR-treated seed held well in storage even 5 years
        after treatment. It appears that IR is the active agent in
        treatments of seeds to reduce and change the hard-seed content.
        (Ref. 32) </p>
      <p>A few seconds exposure to IR radiation may double the
        germination of some seed lots. </p>
      <p>The seed crops grown in some years contain as much as 50% hard
        seed. The farmers and seed growers could find that the few
        seconds of IR treatment mean better stands and better crops
        (Ref. 14). </p>
      <p>Induced IR radiation effects a physiological activity of
        chloroplast in cells. Cellular chloroplasts shrink when stored
        in darkness and swell again when exposed to IR radiation. The
        rate of swelling is determined by the heat effect which involves
        expenditure of energy from ATP hydrolysis. The IR radiation
        increases the activities and stimulates ATP metabolism. Induced
        IR light increase the intercellular calcium concentration which
        is a controlling factor of light adaptation (Ref. 51). </p>
      <p>The IR radiation controls the protoplasts which are isolated
        from guard cells and by enzymatic digestion. The protoplasts
        swell when illuminated with a preselected band of the IR
        spectrum. </p>
      <p>The IR light-stimulated mechanism as an attraction of
        membrane-bound electron transport chains results in an influx of
        K+ into the cell. </p>
      <p>The resulting decrease in water potential mediates in an influx
        of water, which leads to an increase in the protoplast volume. </p>
      <p>Light induces opening of intact stomata, and drives ion
        movements in several cellular systems and directly stimulate a
        membrane transport phenomenon in guard cells. </p>
      <p>Cathodic Protection Plates: The Physical Action --- Seeds from
        the conveyer belt are passed onto a vertical series of
        negatively-charged high voltage conductive plates (E) where a
        negative potential of 100,000 volts is applied. </p>
      <p>Cathodic protection for seeds controls the free radical which
        initiate peroxidative degradation of unsaturated tissue lipids
        which creates damage to cellular membranes, Lipid peroxidation
        in monomolecular and biomolocular filns leads initially to an
        increase in membrane permeability and then to a decrease in
        membrane stability. Damage to biological membranes is associated
        with lipid peroxidation in mitochondria, microsomes, and lysomes
        of cells (Ref. 16). </p>
      <p>Air-dried seeds do not have sufficient moisture to permit
        aqueous-phase enzyme reactions to occur, and repair mechanisms
        are unlikely to be operative in such a system. Thus damage
        induced by free radicals would accumulate in dry seeds whereas
        in hydrated tissue such damage will be repaired. </p>
      <p>The cathodic-protection increases viability of seeds, and in
        addition, the conductivity of water decreases. The mortality
        rate of seeds will be considerably reduced. Cathodic protection
        will reduce free radical attack on biological macromolecules by
        providing a source of electrons to react with the free radicals.
      </p>
      <p>In a system such as dry seeds, where repair mechanisms are
        probably inoperative, the damage could accumulate to such an
        extent that cell death and consequent loss of embryo viability
        occur. However, for all practical purposes this type of damage
        might be controlled with the repairing ability of cathodic
        protection. </p>
      <p>In some cases, viability and germination was extended to twice
        that of control seeds. </p>
      <p><b>RF Frequency Generator:</b> </p>
      <p><i>The Physical Action </i><b>---</b> After the seeds tumble
        through the cathodic chamber they are discharged through a radio
        frequency coil (F) that is the final process of Electrogenic
        Seed Treatment. </p>
      <p><i>The Electrogenic Explanation</i> --- The RF treatment
        involves exposing seeds to the high frequency electric field,
        which affects intercellular orientation of subcellular
        particles, and affects chromosome activity. </p>
      <p>The effects of RF seed treatment on germination and
        morphological and cytological changes in seedlings is most
        favorable for germination. They effectively lower hard seed
        content, and the quality of the treated seed holds up very well
        in storage (Ref 5). </p>
      <p>The RF seed treatment increases the degree of the water
        absorption, leachate solution conductivity, and oxygen uptake of
        seeds increases. </p>
      <p>Frequencies of the alternating fields used have ranged between
        800 KHz and 1.5 MHz with electric field intensity of 3.2
        watt/cm2. </p>
      <p>The electrogenic field seems to control and regulate the
        development of every component part of a growing biological
        system. Scientific observations underscoring the validity and
        efficiency of the electrogenic principle of life are today well
        established. </p>

        <p>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
        <p>This invention relates to a method and apparatus for treating
          seeds by electronic stimulation to increase the embryonic
          potential of the seed and improve plant development and
          growth. </p>
        <p>As early as 1746 plants were treated with electricity for the
          purpose of increasing growth and blossom production. Through
          the years and into the 20th century efforts have been directed
          to improving plant development and growth by the utilization
          of electrical energy. In the following described invention
          high energy electronics in conjunction with bio-chemical
          principles is utilized to provide an improved method and
          application of electrical energy for seed treatment. </p>
        <p>The seeds are first coated with a mixture of water and enzyme
          and then subjected to an electrical potential which causes the
          water and enzyme coating about the seed to be driven into the
          embryo of the root cell and other internal parts of the seed.
          the moistened seeds are then subjected to a second electrical
          potential which causes the seeds to be bombarded with ions,
          electrons and protons as well as with elements of fixed
          nitrogen formed by the fixation of the composition of ambient
          air about the seeds. These particles enter the seed to serve
          as a stored energy source and material source for later plant
          growth and development upon seed planting. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a
          process by which seeds are electronically stimulated to
          improve their embryonic potential. <br>
          Another object of this invention is to provide a process by
          which the root cell of a seed receives energy and food
          material through electronic stimulation prior to planting. </p>
        <p>Another object of this invention is to provide a method to
          improve plant growth and development through electronic
          stimulation of the internal parts of the seed cell, such as
          methachondria, cytochrome, chloroplast, and cell membrane. </p>
        <p>Another object of this invention is to provide apparatus for
          electronically bombarding a free falling object with
          electrons, ions and protons. </p>
        <p>Still another object of this invention is to provide
          apparatus for subjecting an object to high energy particle
          bombardment in ambient air with low ozone production. </p>
        <p>Still another object of this invention is to provide
          apparatus for subjecting an object to ion and fixed nitrogen
          particle bombardment from a high energy potential within the
          presence of air. </p>
        <p>Still another object of this invention is to provide a single
          shot starter for a push-pull inverter. </p>
        <p>And still another object of this invention is to improve
          working characteristics for switching transistors and power
          transformers. </p>
        <p>Still another object of this invention is to provide means
          for modulating the pulse width of rectified AC voltage. </p>
        <p>Other objects of this invention will become apparent upon a
          reading of the following description. </p>

        <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
        <p>The preferred embodiment illustrated is not intended to be
          exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form
          disclosed. It is chosen and described in order to best explain
          the principles of the invention, its application and practical
          use to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best
          utilize the invention. </p>
        <p>APPARATUS </p>
        <p>Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, seed treater 10 of this invention
          includes a housing 12 supported upon a frame 14. Frame 14
          includes legs 16 for contact with a suitable foundation or the
          ground. A control panel 18 is carried at the front of housing
          12 and behind which, located within the housing, is the
          circuitry shown partly in FIGS. 7A-7E for controlling the
          operation of the treater. A tank 20, seen in FIGS. 2, 6 and 7
          is carried within the upper portion of housing 12. A conveyor
          22 is positioned above tank 20. Located above conveyor 22 are
          three work stations, namely, a seed blender station 24, a
          primary energy generator 26, and a secondary energy generator
          28. The head of belt 30 of conveyor 22 is located with its
          upper run 32 positioned under blender station 24. The foot of
          conveyor belt 30 at its upper run 32 is located within a
          cathodic discharge station 34, which constitutes the fourth
          and final work station of the illustrated treater 10. </p>
        <p>Belt 30 of conveyor 22 is supported upon rollers 36 with the
          belt being formed of a dielectric screen material to allow for
          the passage of liquid and ions through the belt. Housing 12
          houses a motor 38 which is drive-connected by a chain and
          sprocket drive 40 to conveyor 22. Actuation of motor 38 causes
          the rotative movement of conveyor belt 30 with upper run 32 of
          the belt traveling in an inclined direction from blender
          station 24 to discharge station 34. The speed of motor 38 and
          thus the speed of conveyor belt 30 is variable to permit the
          travel time of upper run 32 of the belt to be selectively set
          for the particular seed and type treatment desired. </p>
        <p>Blender station 24 of treater 10 includes a hopper part 42
          with a lower opening 44 through which seed when transported by
          a conveyor or other means (not shown) can fall. The size of
          opening 44 in hopper 42, and thus the discharge rate of the
          seed through blender station 24, can be varied by adjusting
          the spacing between overlying side wall plates 46. A pair of
          electrical probes 48 forming a part of blender station 24 are
          mounted below the discharge opening 44 in hopper 42 at
          oppositely located positions. Probes 48 are of like
          construction and are shown in detail in FIG. 3. Each probe 48
          includes a dielectric cone-shape nozzle 50 having an orifice
          part 52 mounted along the axis of the nozzle. Each orifice
          part 52 is connected by a plastic or similar dielectric tubing
          54 to a pump 56 driven by a motor 58, both housed within
          housing 12. Preferably several feet of tubing 54 extends
          between orifice parts 52 and pump 56 so as to create an
          electrical resistance to minimize feed back of the high
          voltage potential created about nozzles 50. The axes of nozzle
          50 are preferably inclined approximately 30.degree. from the
          horizontal with the orifice parts 52 of probes 48 being spaced
          approximately 14" apart within blender station 24. A plurality
          of conductive metal needles 60 are carried by each nozzle 50.
          Needles 60 are equally radially spaced from the axis of the
          nozzle and extend from the base of the nozzle adjacent orifice
          part 52 to the exterior edge 62 of the nozzle. Needles 60
          which may be formed of stainless steel are also equal
          angularly spaced apart and number approximately 100 for each
          nozzle. The needles 60 of one probe 48 are connected to a
          negative high voltage potential of approximately 10,000 volts
          while the needles 60 of the remaining probe 48 are connected
          to a negative high voltage potential of approximately 60,000
          volts. </p>
        <p>Pump 56 has its outlet connected to tubing 54 which extends
          to probes 48. The inlet of pump 56 is connected to a tube 64
          which extends into a reservoir tank 66 carried within seeder
          housing 12. Tank 20 which extends under the work stations of
          treater 10 includes an overflow drain pipe 68 which is
          connected by tubing 70 to reservoir tank 66. Liquid 72 is
          drawn from reservoir tank 66 by pump 56 and is expelled
          through orifice parts 52 of probes 48. The liquid thereafter
          drains into tank 20 which is maintained at a selected level by
          overflow pipe 68. Excess liquid delivered to tank 20 flows
          through tubing 70 and by gravity through a filter (not shown)
          for straining solid material particles into reservoir tank 66.
          Housing 12 and tanks 20 and 66 are almost entirely of a
          dielectric construction. </p>
        <p>The work stations of treater 10 represented by primary energy
          generator 26 and secondary energy generator 28 are of similar
          construction. Each generator 26, 28 includes a spherical
          discharge part 74. Each spherical discharge part 74 is
          suspended spacedly above upper run 32 of conveyor belt 30 by a
          rod part 76. A connector 78 secures each rod part 76 in a
          spaced orientation from the pyramidal housing side walls 77
          forming each energy generator work station. Each discharge
          part 74, rod part 76 and connector 78 are of a dielectric
          construction. A detailed view of the discharge part 74, rod
          part 76 and connector 78 of an energy generator 26, 28 is
          shown in FIG. 4. Each connector 78 is provided with a
          plurality of openings 80 which extend peripherially about its
          connected rod part 76 and which are located between the rod
          part and pyramidal side walls 77 of the treater housing 12.
          Housing 12 at the top of side walls 77 of each energy
          generator 26, 28 is open at 82 to allow ambient air flow
          downwardly through the housing and through openings 80 in
          connector 78 and about discharge part 74. A dielectric dome 84
          is located spacedly over each upper opening 82 into housing 12
          to prevent foreign matter and seeds from falling into the
          energy generators 26, 28 during operation of the seed treater.
        </p>
        <p>A plurality of needles 86 extend radially outwardly from each
          discharge part 74. Needles 86 which cover the approximate
          lower 1/4 spherical quadrant of each discharge part 74 are of
          an electrically conductive metal, such as stainless steel, and
          number between 500 and 1,000. Each needle 86 is embedded
          within the outer surface of its connecting discharge part 74
          and is connected by a conductive sleeve or coupler 88 to a
          resistor 90 of 10 G ohms. Each resistor 90 is commonly
          connected to a wire 92 extending longitudinally through rod
          part 76. Each wire 92 is connected to a ripple DC voltage
          source having a peak voltage of approximately 150 KV. A grid
          94 is located under discharge part 74 of primary energy
          generator 26 and is adjacently spaced below upper run 32 of
          conveyor belt 30. Grid 94 is connected to a slightly negative
          voltage source and acts as a bias during the operation of
          energy generator 26. </p>
        <p>Cathodic discharge station 34 of seed treater 10 includes a
          housing 96 which like main housing 12 of the treater is also
          of a dielectric construction. An air blower 98 and heating
          coils 100 are located above the discharge end of conveyor belt
          30 which terminates within housing 96. Heating coils 100 are
          shown schematically in FIG. 7. Also located above the
          discharge end of conveyor belt 30 is a quartz-tube infrared
          lamp 102. </p>
        <p>Located within housing 96 but positioned below the discharge
          end of conveyor belt 30 is a plurality of negatively charged
          high voltage conductive plates 104. The uppermost plate "a" of
          plates 104 is supplied with a voltage of approximately 60,000
          volts, plate "b" of approximately 50,000 volts, plate "c"
          approximately 40,000 volts and plate "d" approximately 30,000
          volts. Additionally, each of the plates 104 is pivotally
          mounted within housing 96 with the plates being interconnected
          by cables 106 and crank arm 108 for shaking movement to clean
          the plates. During treater operation plates 104 are in a
          fixed, inclined overlapping orientation as shown. The lower
          discharge end of housing 96 includes coils 110 through which
          all seed must exit when passing through treater 10. Coils 110
          produce R.F. energy in the range between 800 K Hz and 1.5 M Hz
          with an electric field intensity of approximately 3.2
          watt/cm2. </p>
        <p>METHOD OF OPERATION </p>
        <p>A mixture of tap or similar conductive water and enzyme 72
          fills tank 20 to its operating level. This liquid is also
          present within supply tank 66. The type of enzyme in liquid 72
          will vary but is preferably of the MFO type. Operation of pump
          56 causes liquid 72 to be emitted under pressure from orifice
          parts 52 of probes 48, filling the blender station 24 below
          hopper 42 with a mist. Liquid 72 is provided to orifice parts
          52 at about 100 pounds per square inch pressure which reduces
          the liquid particle size within the blender station to between
          5 to 15 microns. At the same time liquid 72 is emitted from
          probes 48, needles 60 of each probe are subjected to the high
          energy negative potential, one probe having a potential of
          approximately 10,000 volts and the other probe having a
          potential of approximately 60,000 volts. The liquid 72 in its
          mist form is directed across needles 60 due to the relative
          position of the needles and orifice parts 52 and is subjected
          to potentials provided by needles 60. This transforms the
          liquid mist into a flux field consisting of positive and
          negative ions, protons and electrons. </p>
        <p>Seed, such as corn, soy beans, rice or other types of grains,
          are introduced by a conveyor or similar means into hopper 42
          of blender station 24. The seeds fall through opening 44 in
          hopper 42 and pass between probes 48 within the mist of liquid
          72. When the seeds are subjected to the potential of probes
          48, the polarity inside the root cell of the seed embryo is
          improved. Also the ions, protons, and electrons formed by the
          energy recombination caused within the liquid mist on
          potential contact are driven into the root cell and other
          parts of the seed. Further, the enzyme in the liquid
          combination allows the tiny flux of water and the particles
          thereof to be driven into the seed past its lipid layer. The
          liquid coated seeds then fall onto upper run 32 of conveyor
          belt 30 with the seeds being placed into a electrical
          conductive mode for the next treatment step. </p>
        <p>During the operation of blender station 24, motor 38 is in
          operation serving to continuously rotate conveyor belt 30. The
          coated seeds passing through the blender station fall upon the
          upper run 32 of the conveyor belt and are transmitted to
          primary energy generator 26, passing between discharge part 74
          and grid 94 of the generator. With needles 86 of generator 26
          acting as negative electrodes, liquid 72 within tank 20 acting
          as a positive electrode and with grid 94 acting as a bias, the
          seeds are subjected to electron, proton and positive and
          negative ion bombardment caused by the ambient air break down
          when contacted by the potential at discharge part 74. This
          directed potential and particle movement toward liquid 72 in
          tank 20 causes additional air to be drawn through opening 82
          in the generator under dome 84 and through openings 80 in
          connector 78, past needles 86, like an air pump, where
          additional particles are produced. These particles of ions,
          electrons and protrons are directed towards liquid 72 within
          tank 20 with grid 94 serving to control the density and
          acceleration of the particles, especially the ions. Many of
          these particles enter the seed, including the root cell of its
          embryo. Additionally, the break down of the ambient air forms
          nitrogen particles which are transformed into fixed nitrogen
          and amino acids. Such <br>
          nitrogen and amino acids are driven into the seed cells. </p>
        <p>After passing through primary energy generator 26, the seeds
          are transported by conveyor belt 30 into secondary energy
          generator 28 which is similar in operation to the primary
          energy generator but which does not include a grid for the
          control of particle movement. As in energy generator 26, the
          operation of energy generator 28 causes ambient air to be
          drawn into the interior of the generator past needles 86 and
          into the flux field where the air is broken down into nitrogen
          particles with the formation of electrons, positive and
          negative ions and protons. These particles enter the
          underlying passing seeds in the same manner previously
          discussed for energy generator 26. </p>
        <p>The internal structure of the seeds are enhanced in two ways
          by the energy imparted through generators 26, 28. The
          generators serve as an energy source for the seeds and as a
          material source depositing fixed nitrogen and amino acids
          within the root cell, chloroplast and metachondria of the
          seed. In this manner the imparted energy and material sources
          are used for genetic recombination in the DNA molecule with
          the embryonic potential of the seed being increased, thereby
          improving plant growth, vitality, yield, and germination. </p>
        <p>The water and enzyme liquid coating about the seed acquired
          while passing through the blender station 24, serves to
          improve the electrical conductivity and receptiveness of the
          seed to the particle bombardment imparted in generator
          stations 26 and 28. The particles formed by generators 26 and
          28 which do not contact or which are not absorbed by the seeds
          contact the liquid 72 in tank 20 which serves as a positive
          electrode. This creates more mobility of suspended colloidal
          particles and resistivity of pure water. The liquid viscosity
          is increased under these conditions and there is an increase
          in reactive water which improves the ability of the liquid to
          penetrate the seeds and to form amino acid and fixed nitrogen
          components as the liquid is recirculated from tank 20 to tank
          66 and into blender station 24 by pump 56. </p>
        <p>The seeds pass from secondary energy generator 28 to the
          discharge end of conveyor belt 30 where they fall by gravity
          through cathodic discharge station 24. Ambient air is forced
          by blower 98 across heating coils 100 which heats the air to
          approximately 130.degree. F. The heated air contacts the
          falling seeds to reduce the hard seed content of the seeds.
          Additionally, as most seeds are stored before planting, the
          heated air further serves to reduce the moisture content of
          the seeds. The seeds are also subjected to the I.R. radiation
          from lamp 102 which improves the germination rate of the seeds
          as well as to increase the physiological activity of the
          chloroplast in the seed cell. </p>
        <p>As the seeds fall through discharge station 34, the seeds
          contact each of the plates 104 in alternating zig-zag sliding
          motion to improve cell membrane stability and permanentability
          and to improve the viability and germination probabilities of
          the seed. The potentials of plates 104 are in decreasing order
          as contacted by the seeds. Finally, the seeds are discharged
          through coils 110 where they are subjected to R.F. energy.
          This increases the degree of water absorption, leaching
          solution conductivity and oxygen uptake. After passing through
          discharge station 34, the seeds are collected in a suitable
          receptacle for storage and eventual planting. </p>
        <p>It is to be understood that the treatment above described is
          continuous with the seeds being introduced into hopper 42 of
          blender station 24, passing downwardly through the blender
          station, and thereafter through the primary and secondary
          energy generators 26 and 28 and out discharge station 34 in
          even flow. </p>
        <p>Experimental field testing of seeds treated in accordance
          with the above described method of operation has revealed a
          substantial increase in yield. Corn seeds not treated produced
          a yield of 100.0 bushels per acre while corn seeds treated in
          accordance with the above described method produced a yield of
          125.7 bushels per acre or an increased yield of 25.7% over the
          untreated seeds. Soy bean seeds untreated produced a yield of
          37.0 bushels per acre. Soy bean seeds treated in accordance
          with the above described method produced a yield of 46.2
          bushels per acre or an increased yield of 24.8% over the
          untreated seeds. </p>
        <p>POWER AND CONTROL CIRCUITS FOR BLENDER STATION, PRIMARY AND
          SECONDARY ENERGY GENERATORS, AND CATHODIC DISCHARGE STATION. </p>
        <p>In FIG. 7A the preferred circuitry for providing electrical
          energy for the operation of primary energy generator 26 is
          shown. SCR'S 114, diodes 116 and power supressor diode 118 in
          conjunction with the noted resistors serve as a bridge circuit
          which rectifies the 120V, AC input to DC. Item 120 is a
          step-down transformer. A pulse width modulated control circuit
          is operationally connected to transformer 120 and the above
          described bridge circuit. Pulse width modulated control
          circuit includes transistors 122, an IC (LM 3900) identified
          as four individual operational amplifiers Z1, diodes 124,
          zener diode 126 and the resistors and capacitors shown. A
          detailed description of the pulse width modulated control
          circuit may be found in commonly owned U.S. application Ser.
          No. 898,514, filed Apr. 20, 1978. </p>
        <p>Included within the figure of 7A is a push-pull inverter
          which is utilized to invert the DC from the bridge circuit to
          square wave AC at high frequency, in the range of
          approximately 10 to 20 KHz. The push-pull inverter includes
          secondary transformer windings 130, main transformer windings
          132, return transformer windings 134, high voltage switching
          power transistors 136 working in a saturable mode, diodes 138
          which are of the fast recovery type, such as having a trr of
          100-150 nS, and a DC filtering capacitor 140. Capacitor 142,
          resistor 144 and transformer winding 146 constitute a
          feed-back circuit for each transistor 136. </p>
        <p>Each paired main winding 132 and return winding 134 are wound
          together or bifilar with the return windings being in reverse
          polarity to the main windings as illustrated. During operation
          of the push-pull inverter with alternating transistor 136
          cut-off, the back emf in windings 132 will be transferred to
          mutually coupled windings 134 and returned to the power source
          through connecting diodes 138. Such emf utilization improves
          the circuit efficiency for transistors 136 and the
          transformer. </p>
        <p>The starter circuit for the push-pull inverter includes SCR
          148, resistors 150 and 152, capacitor 154 and transformer
          winding 156. Winding 156 is mutually coupled to the main
          windings 132 and has but a few turns, two in the illustrated
          embodiment. Upon power turn-on, filtering capacitor 140 and
          capacitor 154 are charged at different rates. SCR 148,
          properly biased by resistors 150 and 152, then triggers
          capacitor 154 which causes winding 156 to receive a charge.
          Each mutually coupled main winding 132 is then also charged
          with the one mutually polarized transistor 136 receiving its
          starting voltage. This starts the push-pull inverter
          operation. The starter circuit after having delivered its
          single shot now remains dormant for the remainder of the
          inverter operation. </p>
        <p>The output from secondary transformer windings 130 passes
          into a voltage multiplier identified by interconnected diodes
          158, capacitors 160 and resistors 162. The multiplier
          rectifies and increases the secondary transformer winding
          voltage 12 times or up to its maximum operating peak voltage
          of approximately 150,000 volts of ripple DC. Line 164 connects
          the multiplier with wire 92 of primary energy generator 26.
          Line 166 is connected to a metal plate 168, preferably formed
          of stainless steel, submerged within the liquid 72 in tank 20.
          Plate 168 serves to provide a positive charge for energy
          generators 26, 28 and for blender station 24. A variable
          resistance or control 170 associated with resistors 162 is
          connected to grid 94 of primary energy generator 26. Control
          170 regulates the density of the particle bombardment and
          energy production of the primary energy generator with grid 94
          serving as a bias. </p>
        <p>Variable resistor 128 in the pulse width modulated control
          circuit serves to control or modulate the duty cycle of the
          circuit of FIG. 7A and to vary the negative peak voltage of
          primary energy generator 26 between 75,000 and 150,000 volts.
          Thus the negative potential output of the primary energy
          generator 26 can be varied in intensity to accommodate
          different types of seeds. </p>
        <p>The control and power supply circuit of FIG. 7B has its
          output, designated by line 172, connected to wire 92 in
          secondary energy generator 28. The operation of this circuit
          with its inter-related bridge circuit, pulse width modulated
          control circuit, push-pull inverter circuit, starter circuit,
          and voltage multiplier is like that previously described for
          FIG. 7A with the components thereof being correspondingly
          lettered and numbered. The circuit of FIG. 7B differs in one
          respect in that no control or variable resistor 170 is
          utilized. In all other respects the operation of the circuit
          of 7B is like that of FIG. 7A. Variable resistor 128 through
          pulse width modulation varies the intensity of secondary
          energy generator 28 between 75,000 and 150,000 peak negative
          volts. </p>
        <p>The control and power circuit shown in FIG. 7C is like that
          of the circuit of FIG. 7B with the components thereof being
          correspondingly lettered and numbered and their functions
          being previously described for the circuit of FIG. 7A. Line
          174 of this circuit is connected to one probe 48 of blender
          station 24, while line 176 from this circuit is connected to
          the remaining probe 48 of the blender station. Line 174 serves
          to provide its connected probe 48 with a 10,000 KV negative
          potential and line 176 serves to provide its connected probe
          48 with a 60 KV negative potential. Line 178 connects the
          voltage multiplier of circuit 7C with plates 104 in cathodic
          discharge station 34. The difference between the circuit of
          FIG. 7C and that of 7B is in the size of the voltage
          multiplier. The blender station and cathodic plates of the
          cathodic discharge stations need less voltage than that of
          secondary energy generator 28. This circuit also includes a
          variable resistor 128 which serves as a control for varying
          the power output to accommodate different types of seeds. </p>
        <p>The power and control circuit of FIG. 7D includes only the
          pulse width modulated control and bridge circuits shown and
          described in the circuit of FIG. 7A. The manner of operation
          of the circuit of 7D is like that described for the pulse
          width modulated control and bridge circuits of FIG. 7A with
          the components thereof being correspondingly numbered and
          lettered. Lines 180 in this circuit are connected to lamp 102
          of the cathodic discharge station 34. A like circuit,
          consisting of the pulse width modulated control and bridge
          circuits of FIG. 7A is connected by lines 182 to the heating
          coils 100 within the cathodic discharge station. The power to
          lamp 102 is variable through the utilization of variable
          resistor or control 128 to vary the IR spectrum emitted from
          the lamp. A similar power control is utilized to vary the heat
          output from heating coils 100. </p>
        <p>The power circuit of FIG. 7E is utilized with coils 110 in
          the cathodic discharge station 34. Line 184 of this circuit is
          connected to terminal "a", line 186 is connected to terminal
          "b" and line 188 is connected to terminal "c" of the
          interconnected coils shown schematically in FIG. 7. The
          circuit of FIG. 7E includes an oscillator transistor 190,
          power transistors 192, driving transformer 194, diodes 196 and
          associated resistors and capacitors. The circuit represents a
          dual push-pull power oscillator for a high power, high
          frequency output. </p>
