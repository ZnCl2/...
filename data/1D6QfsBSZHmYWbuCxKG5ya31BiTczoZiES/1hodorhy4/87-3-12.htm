        <p><b><font size="+1">A Recently Observed Explosive Event in the
              Galaxy Center is Predicted to Affect Conditions Here on
              Earth</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The Galaxy Center, which had been relatively stable for at
        least the past 30,000 years or so, had apparently undergone a
        drastic change on about December 5, 1986, according to
        information obtained from a gravity signal detection system
        invented by Gregory Hodowanec of Newark, NJ, a retired research
        physicist. The system is based on a new cosmology developed by
        the inventor and depends upon electrogravitic effects for its
        operation. The units, according to the inventor, detect
        variations in the Earth’s gravity field due to perturbations of
        this field by various gravitational effects in the universe such
        as the dynamic mass movements caused by novae, oscillating,
        rotating, or otherwise moving large masses, as well as the dense
        static masses, such as apparent ‘black hole’ structures which
        can cause gravitational ‘shadows’ to appear in the system’s
        response. According to the inventor’s theories, these
        gravitational signals are of longitudinal type and ‘propagate’
        essentially instantaneously and not at the speed of light as is
        predicted for the Einstein quadrature-type signals. </p>
      <p>The inventor had been ‘observing’ the Galaxy Center recently in
        order to obtain some recorded strip chart scans of the structure
        there which could be helpful to some amateur radio astronomers
        who were interested in these techniques. On December 1 and 2,
        1986, the inventor noted what appeared to be a movement of a
        mass in that structure towards the central mass in the
        structure. This may have been initiated by what appeared to be a
        close-by supernova event also noted on December 1 and 2, 1986.
        Unfortunately, the Center was not scanned again until December
        6, 1986, at which time it was noted that the original Galaxy
        Center structure (which was relatively unchanged during the past
        5-6 years of observation) had disappeared and a new very deep
        ‘black hole and accretion ring’ type of structure now appeared
        here! Operation of the detection system in its gravity ‘noise’
        mode at this time indicated a sharp and very turbulent increase
        in noise response, probably due to the outward-moving shock wave
        induced ‘debris ring’ proceeding from this supernova-type event
        that occurred at the Galaxy Center. Because of the violence and
        rapid velocity of these gravitational ‘winds’, the scientific
        community was alerted on December 8, 1986 (through the National
        Science Foundation) to look for possible reactions here on
        Earth, mainly changes in the atmosphere in the northern
        hemisphere around the 60 N Latitude which could affect the
        weather patterns in those latitudes. A request was also made to
        look for possible effects in the atmospheres of the sun and
        pertinent planets. While further observations and the
        development of the new Center were noted and reported to NSF, it
        is not known if those inputs were heeded by that agency.
        However, as is well known now, the weather patterns in the
        northern hemisphere have been highly unusual since about the
        middle of December 1986, and that could well be attributable to
        the very strong ‘gravity winds’ which introduced a new
        horizontal component of gravity in those latitudes. The winds
        which are proceeding from the direction of the Galaxy Center are
        probably affecting the normal jet stream patterns. </p>
      <p>In addition to the prediction that weather conditions around
        the 60 N Latitude regions (much land mass there) could be
        affected by this event at the Galaxy Center, it was also
        predicted that any unstable Earth structures in the region of 30
        S Latitude could also be affected as possible increases in
        earthquake activity. Since the vertical component of the gravity
        ‘winds’ would apparently increase the normal gravity force
        there. Another prediction was that starlight traveling through
        ‘disturbed’ gas clouds could result in an increased ‘twinkling’
        effect. Such effects would be initially noted by the effects of
        ‘nearby’ clouds, but should become more pronounced in time as
        the more distant clouds become effective (due to the finite time
        for propagaton of light signals). At the present time, the
        inventor has noted a possible increase for the ‘twinkling’ of
        the star Sirius. </p>
      <p>The observational techniques of the inventor are very simple
        and are very low in cost and have been released to some
        experimenter and amateur radio astronomer publications, as well
        as directly to some interested private researchers. The
        conventional (orthodox) scientific community has, thus far,
        chosen largely to ignore these techniques. The inventor will
        leave it to independent observations of the predicted
        ‘observable’ results of the event in the Galaxy Center to
        confirm the reality and validity of his gravity detection
        methods, and thus the possible long-range effects of the event
        on conditions here on our Earth as well as other planets (as
        well as the Galaxy itself). </p>
      <p><b>Note added (August 15, 1987):</b> </p>
      <p>It is believed tat the Galaxy Center event of about Dec. 5,
        1986, also triggered at the same time a supernova much closer-by
        which lay on the same meridian as the Galaxy Center. These
        events were observed on Dec. 6, 1986 and the resulting ‘black
        holes and accretion rings’ have been present since that time.
        The two events can be separated when observing the Galaxy Center
        through the Earth. The other event, which appears to be in-line
        with the star Betelgeuse in Orion, might have been the demise of
        Betelgeuse. The strong ‘gravity winds’ which have caused so much
        abnormal weather changes since about Dec. 5, 1986, may have come
        from the Betelgeuse event, rather than from the Galaxy Center
        event. More important, if Betelgeuse did go supernova, the Earth
        can expect a ‘firestorm’ of EM radiations in about 300 years
        time! </p>
      <p><b>Note added (October 8, 1987):</b> </p>
      <p>A supernova event from the general direction of Betelgeuse in
        the constellation of Orion could also result in an increase in
        gravity in the general region of 30 N Latitude. Perhaps, a
        slight increase in gravity levels was responsible for the recent
        series of California earthquakes? While the event at the Galaxy
        Center would have the effect of reducing gravity, the closeness
        of the Betelgeuse event would prevail, resulting in a net
        increase of gravity levels there. </p>
      <p><b>Note added (April 30, 1988):</b> </p>
      <p>A new supernova-type event was noted on the same meridian as
        the Galaxy Center on March 31, 1988. This new event ‘swamped’
        the scan of the Center and did not move off for many days. After
        about two weeks time, the ‘interloper’ was not longer ‘seen’.
        However, very strong gravity ‘winds’ from this event are still
        present at this date. GW detectors, weight scales, and l/f noise
        detectors, including the gas tube device are much noisier than
        they have ever been! Perhaps, this may have been a more ‘local’
        event than at the Galaxy Center region.</p>
