      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>The concepts of rhysmonic cosmology are used to show the
        gravitational nature of the so-called microwave radiation.
        Simple experiments, which use a shielded electronic
        gravitational signal generator, are shown to confirm the
        rhysmonic interpretation for these effects. Therefore, this
        radiation is not the ‘relic’ radiation as presented in the ‘Big
        Bang’ cosmological theories of the origin of the universe. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>That the universe is permeated with a background radiation of
        electromagnetic waves ranging from the very short wavelengths of
        gamma rays (order of 10<sup>-14</sup> cm) to the extremely long
        wavelengths of some noted micropulsations (orders of many
        millions of cm) has been recognized for many years. The sources
        of this radiation are the many physical processes found in the
        stars and galaxies, as well as the intervening regions of space.
        In general, ionization processes are found in stars which are
        stable, while other processes, which generate a wide range of
        electromagnetic wave radiations, are found in unstable stars and
        galaxies. Three generally recognized processes are synchrotron
        radiation, Bremsstrahlung radiation, and Compton scattering.
        Other processes also contribute to this general background. Of
        particular interest is the so-called microwave background
        radiation which falls in the range of about 500 MHz to about 500
        GHz. </p>
      <p><b>Microwave Background Radiation</b> </p>
      <p>This radiation was discovered serendipitiously in 1965 by
        Penzias and Wilson in the course of making radio-astronomical
        measurements using a microwave horn antenna at about a 7 cm
        wavelength (1). During the course of these tests, a residual
        radiation which was isotropic in nature, remained unaccounted
        for. This radiation was eventually attributed to being a ‘relic’
        radiation of the recently proposed Big Bang theory of the origin
        of our universe. This relic radiation had been predicted by
        Gamow in 1948 and was further elaborated upon by Dicke and
        others in 1964. That this radiation is of a black-body nature
        and highly isotropic has been determined in many tests since
        that time. Today the radiation has been sown to pretty much
        follow the curve for a black-body at temperature of about 2.7°
        K. However, some questions still remain concerning the isotropy
        of this radiation. Experimental observations, although some were
        crude in a way, indicated a large measure of isotropy, also
        indicated some possible variations, some repeatable and some
        perhaps more random in nature. The author, in developing a ‘new’
        theory of the nature of the universe, has come up with an
        alternate explanation for this radiation which is gravitational
        in nature. This theory, called rhysmonic cosmology (2), is
        briefly presented here in essential form in order to provide a
        basis for the author’s interpretation of this observed microwave
        background radiation. </p>
      <p><b>Rhysmonic Theory</b> </p>
      <p>The new cosmology developed by the author is based upon what
        amounts to as an updated version of the aether theory. A
        substratum particle which is termed a rhysmon, after another
        early Greek term for the original atom, forms a matrix structure
        which can be recognized as the ‘vacuum’. Thus the vacuum is the
        very fabric of the universe. The substratum, or the new aether
        of the vacuum, is also a storehouse of potential energy provided
        by the extremely small objects called the rhysmons. The rhysmons
        are contained within independent ‘orbits’ and have energies
        equal to one Planck Constant quantum of action, h. Individual
        rhysmons intertwine with other rhysmons in a matric structure as
        is shown in planar form in Figure 1. In this planar view, it is
        seen that interweaving results in short directed vectors which
        now have energies of h/2 pi, or <strike>h</strike>, quantum of
        action. From this construction, one can define some additional
        parameters based upon Planck’s Constant and his system of
        Natural Units (3). These are given in Appendix I for reference.
        The complete matrix structure is seen in Figure 2 in
        three-dimensional form. This basic cell is reminiscent of R.
        Buckminster Fuller’s vector equilibrium (4) in that all directed
        energy vectors in the pure rhysmoid, i.e., the undisturbed
        vacuum, cancel their energies and thus display no effects or
        phenomena which can be observable. Observable effects, such as
        particles and fields, require perturbations or disturbances in
        this ‘perfect mechanical’ matrix structure. The basic cell
        structures interlock with other cell structures in forming the
        vacuum of the universe. This interlocking is depicted for an
        extended planer view in Figure 3. The maximum use of available
        energy content, however, would require that the
        three-dimensional build-up of the universe be in spherical form,
        i.e., the universe must be a sphere. </p>

      <p>Depicted in Figure 3 are the directed rhysmonic vectors as
        given in some single instant of time, having the duration of
        Planck Time, T*, or about 5.4 x 10<sup>-44</sup> sec. In the
        next instant of time, T* later, all vectors reverse direction,
        as new rhysmons ‘orbit’ into these same positions. In time T*
        later again, the vectors are restored to the original
        directions, but the original rhysmon does not return to its
        original position until a time period of 6T* has passed. Thus
        the universe is like a movie, in which each frame of the cinema
        of existence lasts for only Planck Time, T*. As seen in Figure
        3, directed rhysmonic vectors join head-to-tail to form an
        ‘instantaneous’ vector which can span the universe. These
        instantaneous vectors are fundamental to the rhysmonic
        explanation of the nature of gravitation and is further
        developed in Reference 5. </p>
      <p><b>Rhysmonic Gravitation</b> </p>
      <p>Gravitation in terms of rhysmonic theory will be only briefly
        summarized here. In essence, the instantaneous rhysmonic vectors
        ‘exist’ universe wide for the interval of Planck Time, T*, and
        thus are effectively ‘action at a distance’ in this time period.
        Gravitation in rhysmonic theory is the result of the ‘screening’
        action between masses in the universe. The force of gravitation
        is found to be actually a force of ‘impellment’ between the
        masses rather than a force of ‘attraction’ between the masses.
        This is because shielding action of the masses results in more
        instantaneous impulse vectors on the sides of the two reference
        masses facing away from each other than on the sides facing each
        other. Since this force acts in time period, T*, or about 10<sup>-44</sup>
        seconds for any distance between the test masses, it is
        essentially an instantaneous force. Thus gravitation is a ‘force
        field’ and can transfer energy between distant objects in a
        process called ‘induction’. Therefore, moving masses can ‘vary’
        the instantaneous rhysmonic vector flux field, and by the same
        token, variations in the rhysmonic vector flux field can affect
        masses. This is a very important concept and is fundamental to
        the rhysmonic interpretation of gravitational ‘waves’. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>Gravitational ‘Waves’</b> </p>
      <p>Gravitation in terms of rhysmonics is depicted in Figure 4.
        Here, two masses in the universe, A and B, are ‘impelled’ toward
        each other by rhysmonic instantaneous vectors due to the reduced
        impulses present in the depicted ‘screened’ region. Consider now
        another effect which is also gravitational in nature. Suppose
        that mass A or B is set into physical ‘oscillation’ by an
        external force in some direction; it does not matter which
        direction is chosen. If this energy increase is unidirectional,
        the mass affected will continue to translate in this direction
        in the process of inertia (see Ref. 2). In essence, the
        component of increased energy is superimposed on the
        instantaneous rhysmonic vectors contained in this ‘straight
        Euclidan line’ in the universe. Consider now, that mass A, for
        example, is given instead an oscillatory motion in the
        directions depicted. This requires that the mass be accelerated
        and then decelerated to a halt, re-accelerated in the opposite
        direction and again decelerated to a halt again. While external
        energy is required to initiate this process, once initiated, the
        energy of the vacuum, i.e., the rhysmonic matrix structure, will
        maintain this oscillation until dissipated in some fashion. This
        is because of the interactions mentioned above. Movement of mass
        interacts with rhysmonic vectors, and affected rhysmonic vectors
        interact with mass. Thus, an oscillating mass, in principle,
        should initiate a disturbance in the vacuum which would be
        perpetuated forever by the intrinsic energy of the vacuum as was
        seen in the case of inertia and the propagation of
        electromagnetic fields. </p>

      <p><b>Experimental Verifications</b> </p>
      <p>Quadrature-type gravitational waves which propagate at the
        speed of light were predicted by Einstein. However, unequivocal
        detection of such waves has not been made to date. The
        monopole-type inductive field gravitational ‘waves’, or more
        correctly, rhysmonic impulse flux field variations, as generated
        by the oscillatory mass movements of the ‘imploding’ core of the
        supernova star in its motion to a neutron star or black hole,
        have been unequivocally detected electronically with the simple
        circuit of Figure 5. This circuit operates essentially in that
        the oscillatory gravitational signals, i.e., the affected
        rhysmonic instantaneous vectors, appear equivalent to the action
        of an alternating electric field with respect to the loosely
        bound electrons in the detecting capacitor. The small current
        fluctuations (impulses) generated in this capacitor by these
        gravitational variations, are highly amplified and converted to
        voltage fluctuations by this circuit. These voltage fluctuations
        can thus be displayed on recording meters and/or an
        oscilloscope, as well as heard on audio equipment. The circuit,
        in the ‘ringing’ version will actually display the Gaussian
        amplitude variations of nova and supernova ‘bursts’ as well as
        other disturbances in the universe (see Ref. 6). </p>
      <p>The simple circuit of Figure 5, when operated with stabilizing
        capacitor C<sub>x</sub>, in the circuit, will respond to most
        gravitational impulse processes as a general background
        radiation or l/f noise, as well as other more ‘musical’
        responses. Audio amplification of the AC output of the detector
        will evidence these many ‘sounds’ of our very active universe.
        That these are gravitational responses are made quite evident
        when the circuit, power supplies, and the audio amplifiers are
        all totally and completely shielded against any possible
        electromagnetic wave effects, or lone magnetic effects. Some
        interesting experiments can now be performed under these
        shielded conditions as depicted in Figure 6. </p>
      <p><i>Experiment I</i> --- Slowly move a mass, any mass, near a
        shielded gravitational ‘wave’ detector operating in the l/f
        mode, i.e., the capacitor, C<sub>x</sub>, is in the circuit.
        With the audio output adjusted to a suitable level, it will be
        noted that the background noise level can be ‘modulated’ by this
        movement. It will be ascertained that a movement of about 0.35
        cm will result in peaks or nulls in this noise level. It is as
        if the gravitational noise in space has a natural physical
        wavelength of 0.25 cm, and local perturbations causes these
        signals to interfere, typical of standing waves in wave
        theories. This effect is found to be present at all laboratory
        distances, up to the maximum available 75 feet. Thus this noise
        is a gravitational effect and a summation or integration of all
        rhysmonic impulses generated in the universe, and thus averaged
        out as a general noise background level. While this noise level,
        or if you wish, this microwave background level, is quite
        isotropic, since it exists in a black-body universe, measurable
        anisotropies will also exist due to our off-center location in
        this spherical universe, and the random nature of supernova
        ‘bursts’ as well as random concentrations of mass in portions of
        this universe. (See Ref.7 and 8). </p>

          background levels.</b> </p>

        <p><img src="fig6.jpg" width="662" height="481"></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Experiment II</i> --- Using the same totally shielded setup
        of Figure 6, slowly oscillate a mass (this could be your arm,
        for example) at a rate of 1 or 2 cycles per second. Note that
        the audio output of the detector responds with a rushing sound
        which reflects the disturbance your arm is creating in the
        rhysmonic universe. Repeat until a well-defined modulation o
        noise takes place, and then cease this perturbation by your arm.
        You will now note that the oscillations in the detection circuit
        will continue on at this same rate for many minutes, or until
        other perturbations in the universe destroy this coherent
        effect. A local effect which usually takes over is the beating
        of the observer’s own heart! </p>
      <p><b>Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>The two simple experiments of the previous section confirm the
        gravitational nature of the so-called microwave background
        radiation which is presently being attributed to being a ‘relic’
        radiation of the ‘Big Bang’ theory of the origin of our
        universe. What Penzias and Wilson measured was the microwave
        energy generated by the thermal heating of their horn antenna by
        these gravitational impulse signals. Rhysmonics has shown that
        the universe must be essentially a static and spherical entity.
        The red-shift phenomenon has also been shown to be but a
        function of the electromagnetic wave propagation process. It has
        now been shown that the so-called microwave background radiation
        is also a rhysmonic impulse flux field effect and gravitational
        in nature. Therefore, there is no need to postulate a Big Bang
        or an expanding universe to account for these observed effects.
        The universe consists of but rhysmons and a void, in a finite
        and black-body structure. </p>
