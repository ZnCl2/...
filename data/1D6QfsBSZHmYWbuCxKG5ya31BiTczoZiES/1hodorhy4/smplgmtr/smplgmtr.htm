      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Astrophysicists have been attempting to detect the elusive
        quadrupole-type gravity signals predicted by Einstein without
        unequivocal success so far. However, Newtonian-type
        gravitational force field gradients have actually been detected
        for many years now as noise in electronic devices. The simple
        electronic-type of gravimeter described here greatly amplifies
        electronic noise and resolves it into meaningful displays on an
        analog meter or a strip recorder unit. The inquisitive and
        interested electronic experimenter can thus enter at a low cost
        into an exciting exploration of our universe in terms of these
        gravity signals, especially if a strip chart recorder unit or a
        computer unit is used to store and display the tremendous amount
        of information present in these data. The author hopes that many
        will opt to do so. </p>
      <p><b>Background</b> </p>
      <p>Gravimeters (or gravity meters) are used to measure the
        relative strength of a gravitational force field at some
        particular location for a number of reasons. One very common
        reason is to determine the possible presence of large
        underground mass anomalies which, in turn, could signify the
        presence of potential mineral, oil, or gas deposits. The
        commercial gravimeters used in many of these evaluations are
        generally both very expensive and also very delicate. However,
        the electronic experimenter may construct a very simple low-cost
        electronic-type gravimeter which is highly portable, rugged, and
        yet extremely sensitive to even minor variations in the earth’s
        g-field. Therefore, it will not only indicate variations in
        gravity due to local mass variations, but it will also respond
        to the many fluctuations in the earth’s gravity field which are
        due to cosmic-generated gradients and even the presence of
        astronomically-distant very dense masses which may happen to lie
        on the instantaneous astronomical meridian position of the
        gravimeter. The meridian position as defined here is essentially
        the same as the geographical longitude of the location of the
        gravimeter unit. </p>
      <p>Newtonian gravitational force field gradients, i.e., scalar
        field type gradients, have been noted by the author for many
        years now (Ref. 1). Simple detectors of the electronic type
        (Ref. 2) and the spring scale type (Ref. 3) have been used in
        these detections. The electronic version to be considered here
        is extremely simple, requiring but a few readily available
        electronic components which may be easily assembled by the
        average electronic experimenter or amateur scientist. It should
        be of special interest to amateur astronomers engaged in either
        optical or radio astronomy as well as to many professional
        astrophysicists. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>How it Works</b> </p>
      <p>The circuit for these particular demonstration units is given
        in Figure 1. One version uses a single low-cost C-MOS type
        operational amplifier device (a dual section unit) which can
        work well with but a low level 1.5 volt battery supply. The low
        current drain of these op-amps should enable long life fro the
        small alkaline AAA cells used to internally power this unit. The
        second version is similar in design but uses the ore generally
        available low-cost bipolar-type of op-amp devices. The operation
        of the C-MOS unit will be described in detail here. However, the
        bipolar unit, while quite similar, requires some component value
        changes as well as a higher power supply voltage. These changes
        are noted in the Parts List for these units. </p>
      <p>In the C-MOS version, Newtonian gravitational force field
        gradients interact with the electron-ion structure of the
        dielectric in the 1000 uF input capacitor C<sub>1</sub>, to
        generate small current fluctuations from that capacitor and
        these fluctuations will reflect the gravity gradients being
        intercepts by that capacitor. Section IC<sub>1</sub> of the
        op-amp is operated in the current-to-voltage conversion mode and
        the small input current fluctuations from capacitor C<sub>1</sub>
        are converted to much higher voltage fluctuations. The
        sensitivity of this stage is controllable by the high resistance
        feedback resistor, R<sub>1</sub>. Output from the detector
        section IC<sub>1</sub> is then coupled out through a gain
        control potentiometer, R<sub>2</sub>, to drive a conventional
        inverting amplifier, IC<sub>2</sub>, which has about a x20
        voltage gain. An offset control, R<sub>6</sub>, in the
        non-inverting input of IC<sub>2</sub> is used to establish the
        operating position of the averaged gravity-induced output levels
        on the analog display meter, M<sub>1</sub>. the display meter is
        a 100 uA meter operated as a 0-1 volt voltmeter in conjunction
        with the series resistor, R<sub>5</sub>. Capacitors C<sub>3</sub>
        and C<sub>4</sub> form part of a low-pass filter network
        (utilizing R<sub>5</sub> also) to establish a time constant for
        integration of the meter response to the gravity fluctuation
        signals. A very long time constant, i.e., a very low cut-off
        frequency for the LP filter, is used to largely measure the
        averaged gravity levels, while the shorter time constants are
        used to monitor the more rapidly varying responses of the ore
        distant astronomical events. The switch SW<sub>2</sub> provides
        for three levels of integration. A DPST switch, SW<sub>1</sub>,
        is used to interrupt the common return leads of the dual power
        supply used separately while in the off position. This is
        necessary to avoid the small battery drain that would occur is a
        SPST switch were used here. The output jack, J<sub>1</sub>,
        provides for an output to any external device such as an
        external meter, an audio amplifier, a strip chart recorder, or a
        computer unit, if desired. To avoid possible RFI problems, the
        unit should be fabricated in a Faraday type shielded enclosure.
        A simple aluminum box enclosure containing the entire circuitry,
        including the battery supply, should be adequate for most
        observing locations. </p>
      <p><b>Testing The Unit</b> </p>
      <p>After the electronic experimenter has checked out his circuit
        components and the circuit wiring, the 1.5 volt batteries may be
        inserted into their holders. Keep the power switch, SW<sub>1</sub>,
        off at this time. Turn the sensitivity (feedback) control, R<sub>1</sub>,
        to its mid-position, the gain control, R<sub>2</sub>, to its
        minimum position, the offset control, R6 to its mid-position,
        and the integration switch, SW<sub>2</sub>, to the off position.
        Now turn on the power switch and if the unit is operating
        properly a meter deflection near center scale should be noted.
        Center the pointer with the off-set control, R6. The off-set
        control is very sensitive and should adjusted carefully. Now
        slowly increase the gain control about one-quarter turn. If no
        indications are seen on the display meter, or if the meter foes
        of scale, the input capacitor may have an excess residual charge
        on it. This charge should leak off in a minute or so but may be
        discharged more rapidly by turning down the sensitivity control
        to its shorted position momentarily, and then returning it to
        the mid-position again. Since the integration switch, SW<sub>2</sub>,
        had been set to its fastest response time, rapid fluctuations
        should now be seen on the analog meter output, that is if good
        components were used and the circuit wiring was correct. The
        fluctuations may now be better centered on the display meter
        with the off-set control and their amplitudes adjusted to
        suitable levels with the gain control. Do not increase the gain
        to the point of overdrive or to the point where there will be a
        tendency to low frequency oscillations which will be sustained
        by occasional high level fluctuations from the cosmos. Notice
        the varied and wide amplitude ranges of the display! </p>
      <p>With the integration switch in its off position, the unit
        largely responds to the rapid fluctuations due to distant cosmic
        events. With the switch in the Lo position, it will respond
        mainly to colder-by cosmic events and this position may also be
        used to determine the averaged gravity field levels, especially
        if even a longer integration time is used, e.g., the output
        shunt capacitance is increased more. When the integration switch
        is in the Hi position, the unit will respond to many interesting
        cosmic events in our own Galaxy region as well as the Local
        Group of galaxies. The reason for this type of response is that
        the resolution of the detector ‘beam’ is extremely fine, since
        the aperture for this detection system is essentially the active
        area of capacitor C<sub>1</sub>, and that may be only in the
        order of 1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter. Thus this fine beam sweeps
        the meridian position of the detector as a function of the
        rotation of the earth. Simple geometry shows that such a fine
        beam would sweep across some distant object more rapidly than it
        would do so for some similar but much nearer object. Thus the
        difference in response times. </p>
      <p><b>Typical Responses</b> </p>
      <p>Since these fluctuations are a function of time, they are best
        displayed on a strip chart recorder unit running at about a
        chart speed of 2 to 4 inches per minute. A high input impedance
        strip chart reorder unit must be used with the C-MOS deice
        detector unit, but a low impedance strip chart recorder unit
        could be used with the bipolar detector unit, e.g., a D’Arsonval
        meter type unit. In both cases, the output voltage could range
        between 0 volts and about 1.5 volts. Some typical responses as
        seen on a strip chart recorder are shown in Figure 2.
        Experimenters who lack a strip recorder or a computer unit ay
        try to follow some of the slower responses by hand recording the
        output data being received when the unit is operated with very
        long output integration times. Even here, the experimenter can
        expect to observe some local cosmic events of the type shown in
        Figure 2. However, recording the data by hand can be quite
        tedious and very difficult at best. </p>

      <p>Briefly stated, some of the cosmic events detectable with these
        units are cosmic events which were predicted by the
        astrophysicists but not yet detected by them, primarily because
        most of these astrophysicists are still looking for the elusive
        quadrupole-type gravity signals which were predicted by
        Einstein. However, these units detect the longitudinal
        gravitational force field gradients of the Newtonian type (which
        were no supposed to exist, incorrectly so, in terms of the
        presently prevailing relativity theories!). Therefore, the
        interested electronic experimenters, amateur scientists, as well
        as the professional researchers, now have a golden opportunity
        to enter into a low-cost exploration of our universe using the
        proven techniques disclosed here. </p>
      <p>Many of the active astronomical events detectable with these
        units appear to be nova and supernovae. Novae are believed to be
        stars which lose much of their outer layers in a nuclear-type
        explosion. These events are detectable (and quite often) since
        the rapid expansion of the star’s outer mass causes a Newtonian
        force field gradient, which, if it happens to lie on the
        detector’s meridian position, causes a superposition of fields
        on the earth’s gravity field, and thus results in a measurable
        change in the earth’s gravity field. Supernovae are believed to
        be large stars which implode to a neutron star or black hole
        type of structure, and then blasts of much of their volume and
        atmosphere. The response as detected by these units shows both
        the implosion and the explosion of the event. After a massive
        supernova event, the neutron star or black hole type of
        structure, i.e., a very small very dense mass, is generally seen
        at that location, often accompanied by what the astrophysicists
        have termed an accretion ring. The units also detect what appear
        to be very dense masses but without an accretion ring. These may
        be very old black holes which have since lost their accretion
        rings. </p>
      <p><b>The Bipolar Detection Unit</b> </p>
      <p>The bipolar device detection unit is very similar to the C-mos
        device unit described above, but requires some component value
        changes as well as the power supply change as shown in the Parts
        Lists. These changes were made in order to essentially duplicate
        the responses as seen wit the C-mos device unit. The bipolar
        device unit works well with an internal 9-volt battery supply.
        Most experimenters may prefer to use the bipolar device op-amps
        since they are generally available. The author uses the bipolar
        device design to drive his D’Arsonval meter type strip recorder
        unit. </p>
      <p>The experimenter is cautioned here that while the basic design
        of these detectors is very simple, components and devices do
        vary. The experimenter may wish to try several electrolytic
        capacitors or op-amp devices if difficulty is seen in achieving
        the effect given here. Especially the bipolar op-amp devices,
        even if they are labeled the same, may be quite different in
        structure and performance; some might even have different
        pin-outs. The author has constructed many detector units (and
        many colleagues also have done so) so that he has confidence
        that the careful and patient researcher, amateur and
        professional, will be able to duplicate these results. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>The simple low-cost electronic type gravity meters described
        here should enable the electronic experimenter not only to
        determine the averaged gravity forces at various locations, but
        also enter into the fascinating and quite unexplored area of
        gravitational field astronomy. Outside of possibly obtaining a
        strip chart recorder as a highly desirable component for use in
        these studies, the experimenter is not otherwise limited by
        extensive or expensive facilities or preferred locations in
        pursuing these objective. Many experimenters, mainly amateur
        radio operators (hams) have entered the area of radio astronomy
        successfully. However, compared to the above disclosed gravity
        field astronomy, radio astronomy is rather expensive, tricky,
        and involves fairly massive antennas as well as requiring fairly
        radio-quiet, i.e., EMI-free locations. Gravity signal astronomy
        can be done at any location, even electrically noisy locations,
        provided the units are adequately Faraday shielded. Simple
        aluminum box enclosures are adequate for most locations. The
        author does his observing in a corner of his basemen lab area.
        The author hopes that many experimenters, both amateur and
        professional, will opt to enter into these investigations. Good
        luck with your experiments! </p>
