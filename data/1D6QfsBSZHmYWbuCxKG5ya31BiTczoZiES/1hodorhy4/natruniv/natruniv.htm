      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>The methods of Rhysmonic Cosmology are used to develop a
        plausible explanation as to the nature and development of Our
        Universe. The purely intellectual development of the theory is
        further enhanced with some experimental confirmations which were
        derived from this theory. It is shown that much of the
        experimental data agreed quite well with present-day
        observational material, and also agreed very well with data as
        predicted by this theory. With the foundations laid here,
        mankind should be able to further develop a knowledge of our
        Universe, both for the benefit of mankind, as well as sate the
        quest for answers to the reason ‘why’ for the existence of man
        in this, Our Universe. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>Many theories have been advanced concerning the nature and the
        development of Our Universe. There is not question that Our
        Universe has been of concern to mankind from the very beginnings
        of the development of intellectual reasoning in man. The
        wonderful beauty and complexity of life and nature here on Earth
        has inspired mankind, in general, to look toward a Supernatural
        Force or Supreme being as the Prime Cause of such Existence.
        Unfortunately, much of the attributes given to such a Supreme
        being were but human attributes, and thus the many theological
        explanations for the nature and development of Our Universe
        simply reflected a particular group’s reflections of itself and
        its own mores. However, with the development of the scientific
        method, most present day attempts to understand the nature of
        Our Universe are divorced from these local mores and proceed on
        a purely intellectual basis, but many will still recognize the
        need for a Prime Cause for this Existence. </p>
      <p>It was only recently, in the 1920s, that mankind finally
        realized that Our Universe was very much vaster than had been
        previously imagined, mainly by optical detection of other
        galaxies which were ‘island universes’ in their own right and
        thus separate from our originally recognized Milky Way Galaxy
        ‘universe’. Developments in physics and astronomy have proceeded
        rapidly since that time, leading to two general approaches to
        the nature of Our Universe: the ‘Steady State’ and ‘Big Bang’
        universes. </p>
      <p>The steady state universe reflects the belief that the Universe
        is, has been, and always will be, and seeks to back that up with
        scientific theory and evidence. The big bang universe reflects
        the belief, in a way, of an ‘instantaneously’ created universe
        from a very small and very dense ‘mass’ which has sicne expanded
        to our present day size. There is some question, yet, as to
        whether this is a one-way process, or an oscillatory process,
        leading to an eventual contraction, or ‘Big Crunch’, and then to
        a renewed big bang. </p>
      <p>The steady state universe has lost ground in recent years to
        the big bang version in the development of Our Universe, mainly
        due to the apparent ‘expansion’ noted in our Universe (in terms
        of the so-called red shift). This essay, however, will attempt
        to show that Our Universe is basically a steady state universe
        and that the expansion noted by the big bang advocates is really
        based upon a ‘false physics’ for the red shift effect. Rhysmonic
        Cosmology, as developed by the author, makes no pretense as to
        the nature and source of the ‘rhysmons’ which fundamentally make
        up this Universe, and thus must also invoke the need for a Prime
        Cause. However, on the basis of this theory, the nature and
        development of Our Universe can proceed from just a few
        postulates, which are tied in with a fresh view on the nature of
        the force fields and also their relation to some of the
        fundamental constants now recognized in physics, primarily the
        basic Planck related constants. That these could lead to a
        plausible explanation of the nature and development of Our
        Universe will be the prime effort of this essay. </p>
      <p><b>Birth of Our Universe</b> </p>
      <p>A major premise in Rhysmonic Cosmology is that the original
        primordial Universe consisted of but a pure rhysmonic matrix
        structure, which we call the rhysmoid. This rhysmoid contained
        an extremely large number of rhysmons, the fundamental particle
        of this Universe. This number probably exceeded 10<sup>200</sup>
        rhysmons, and the energy content of the total rhysmons probably
        also was in the order of 10<sup>200</sup> ergs (See Ref.1 for
        more details). How this primordial Universe came into existence
        is a matter of conjecture. It may have resulted from the
        long-term collection of ‘free’ rhysmons from extremely deep
        space, or it may have been the result of some Prime Cause.
        Rhysmonics must accept the existence of such a basic rhysmoid
        structure as the starting point for this cosmology. </p>
      <p>Shown in <b>Figure 1a</b> is the primordial Universe (Stage I)
        in planar form, although it must be recognized that the actual
        rhysmoid is spherical in form. A second major premise in
        rhysmonics is that the matrix structure of the Rhysmoid is
        describable in Cartesian Coordinates and thus in conventional
        plane and spherical geometries. The rhysmoid at this time could
        be described as ‘pure’, that is, free from any density
        variations which could be described as ‘particles of matter’ in
        that structure. However, due to the nature of this matrix
        structure, a ‘focal shell’ region which is located at about the
        half-radius point in this spherical structure, will exist. This
        is due to the long-range ‘instantaneous’ vectors in the energy
        field of the rhysmoid as described in Reference 1. These vectors
        are really the source of the so-called gravitational fields.
        Thus, gravity fields are basic to the very nature of this
        Universe. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1a --- The Primordial Universe is yet a pure rhysmoid
          region and does not contain density variations which can be
          called 'particles' or mass.</b> </p>

        <p><img src="fig1a.jpg" width="602" height="585"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Shown in <b>Figure 1b</b> is Stage II in the development of
        this Rhysmonic Universe. Here, due to certain internal
        instabilities, or some ‘outside’ influence, density fluctuations
        in the rhysmoid may exist, and these may result in the formation
        of ‘stabilized’ density variations which can now be called
        particles or mass. These form primarily due to various ‘field’
        effects in the rhysmoid geometry, and collect mainly near the
        focal shell region of the rhysmoid. Further, shielding effects
        between these particles result in ‘impelling’ mechanisms between
        the particles, the so-called gravitational attractions, and thus
        a movement of the particles toward each other as well as toward
        the central regions of the rhysmoid. Unequal particle densities
        will result in a circular movement, or ‘curl’, in the particle
        concentrations. This curl is thus the very beginnings of spiral
        formations in these concentrations. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1b ---The Primordial universe develops the first
          particles near the foacl shell. Particles move toward the core
          of the universe as well as toward each other due to
          gravitational effects. Due to uneven particle densities, a
          rotational movement or 'curl' will develop in these movements.</b>

      </center>
      <p>Shown in <b>Figure 1c</b>, Stage III, is the next generalized
        stage in the formation of Our Universe. Here, the continued
        generation of particles and the resulting migration toward the
        central regions, as a function of the universal gravity field,
        causes a buildup of matter in the central regions. A ‘material’
        universe now exists and with a definite spiral structure due to
        the initial unequal density conditions. However, while matter
        now tends to concentrate in the central regions, the outer
        regions of the Universe tends to remain a pure rhysmoid region.
      </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1c --- The material Universe continues to develop and
          now shows a definite spiral structure. A heavier concentration
          of particles will develop here adn there, but much tends to

        <p><img src="fig1c.jpg" width="609" height="526"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Shown in <b>Figure 1d</b> is Stage IV in the development of
        this Universe. While the universe retains its ‘birth’ structure,
        i.e., the spiral form, it now has a very dense central core, as
        well as some lesser cores dispersed here and there. Some of
        these outer cores have also developed their own spiral
        structures, i.e., galaxies, and thus the universe is now a
        system of galactic structures superimposed upon a master
        galactic structure, with regions of space in between which are
        rather devoid of mass or other structures, and thus may be the
        so-called holes in space. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1d --- The Material Universe develops may clusters
          and galxies now, but retains its Super Galaxy form. The core
          region is now a very dense mass region but does not develop a
          spiral form.</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig1d.jpg" width="593" height="523"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Shown in <b>Figure 1e</b> is Stage V, probably the present day
        stage, where a now well-defined system of galactic structures
        exists. The central core mass has since gone ‘supernova’
        (probably several times) and now contains an extremely massive
        black hole, or holes, as well as a well-defined shock-formed
        ring of concentrated mass, both debris and galaxies. Shown here
        also (dotted) is the probable limit of the ‘visible’ universe,
        due to the nature of the propagation of electromagnetic wave
        signals (Ref. 5). While some matter could have also migrated
        into the pure rhysmoid region, that region probably remains a
        pure rhysmoid region. Thus, Our Universe should now show some
        traces of a super spiral galactic structure, the central
        extremely massive black hole structure, as well as regions
        devoid of concentrations of mass. It will be shown that
        gravitational signal astronomy, as was developed by the author,
        appears to indicate that such structures actually exist. There
        is also reason to believe that the detection of quasar-type
        events in the Universe lends credence to the fact that the pure
        rhysmoid regions also exist (Ref. 5). Other verifiable
        structures in Our Universe will also be noted here. Therefore,
        there is both theoretical and experimental evidence for the
        existence of such a postulated Universe. These will now be
        further considered. </p>

          condition. The Super Galaxy form remains, but the central mass
          has undergone a supernova type of interaction and now has

          shock-ring structure, Is this Our Universe today?</b> </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>The Active Universe</b> </p>
      <p>Our Universe today appears to be in a relatively stable
        equilibrium state, i.e., in a ‘steady-state’ condition. This
        appears to be confirmed in the many electromagnetic wave
        observations of Our Universe, out to the so-called ‘visible’
        universe limit. These are the observations being made at visible
        light frequencies, as well as ultraviolet, infrared, millimeter
        and radio frequencies. Unfortunately, due to the limitations in
        the propagation mode for EM-waves, we cannot obtain information
        on the nature of Our Universe beyond that visible limit with our
        present observational techniques. However, EM-wave techniques
        have, nevertheless, provided us with much knowledge about the
        nature of Our Universe. Due to the finite times for
        transmissions of EM-waves, these methods can provide us with a
        ‘picture’ of Our Universe as it existed back in time.
        Surprisingly, most data indicated that Our Universe, even back
        to this limit in time, has been very similar to the conditions
        seen in more recent times, implying that Our Universe has been
        in a steady-state condition for at least this period of time.
        These observations have indicated a very active and dynamic
        Universe, made up of stars, gas, dust and molecules, galaxies,
        and galactic systems, to name a few. Some of the observations
        will be noted here: </p>
      <p>Stars: Stars are the most prevalent EM-wave observable objects
        in the Universe. These are luminous hot balls of gas, in
        general. While some stars are ‘loners’, most are members of vast
        clusters or galaxy systems. Stars may be ‘born’ primarily in
        contracting gas and dust clouds, and ‘live’ long lives, but
        eventually die, like may humans, either rather peacefully, or
        also quite violently. The more violent deaths are in terms of
        nova or supernova type events. These are, at times, quite
        dramatically observed with EM-wave methods. </p>
      <p>Galaxies: Vast collections of stars, such as clusters or
        galaxies, also appear to have long lives and a very definite
        development history. Many are believed to have ‘monster energy
        sources’ in their nucleus (cores). Some of these have since come
        to be termed ‘black holes’, since their extreme mass, and thus
        very strong gravity, does not allow EM-wave radiation to leave;
        thus the name. </p>
      <p>While the history of astronomy and astrophysics is replete with
        observations of an EM-wave nature, confirming that Our Universe
        is very active, indeed, the author has also developed a
        gravitational signal method of observing our Universe, which not
        only confirms much of the EM-wave observations, but also has
        opened a ‘new window’ to the Universe. This has disclosed other
        unsuspected aspects in Our Universe which will also be
        considered here. </p>
      <p><b>Universe Observation Modes</b> </p>
      <p>EM-waves, as has already been noted, are the prevalent method
        for observing our Universe. EM waves are a propagating
        disturbance in the Rhysmoid, i.e., the vacuum, which proceeds at
        the speed of light. This disturbance is recognized as crossed
        electric and magnetic fields, with the direction of propagation
        normal to these crossed fields. Thus, it is considered to be a
        transverse wave type of propagation. </p>
      <p>Gravitational signals, however, are fundamental to the very
        fabric of the Universe; it exists because the Universe exists
        and thus it cannot be divorced from it. The signals are
        basically monopolar and proceed essentially radially (and
        longitudinally) from the source of the disturbance in
        essentially instantaneous fashion. Therefore, these signals,
        while basically due to the same rhysmonic sub-structure,
        actually are quite different in nature and have not been
        utilized previously. EM-waves, moreover, may be created or
        destroyed (dissipated). The electric and magnetic components
        interact strongly with matter, and thus their propagation can be
        quite lossy in a material medium. Gravitation, however,
        interacts with mass on a much smaller scale, and thus generally
        requires large masses (or mass effects) to become a significant
        factor in the Universe. Most normal materials are therefore
        quite transparent, in terms of gravity. Thus gravitational
        effects usually are associated with very dense or massive
        bodies, but their effects may also be noted at much less massive
        levels under the proper methods. For example, each person notes
        the effects of the earth’s g-field on his own body mass as his
        weight or ‘heaviness’. However, there is an interaction between
        gravitational and electromagnetic fields, which is at low
        levels, but can be made useful with proper techniques. Devices,
        known as gravity meters (gravimeters) can provide much
        information about Our Universe in terms of the many
        gravitational signals emitted by or introduced by massive
        gravity events in the Universe. Moreover, due to the essentially
        instantaneous response times for these signals, the observations
        in terms of gravity signals are now, i.e., in real time, and
        thus indicative of Our Universe in the present and not the
        remote past as is the case with most EM-wave observational
        methods. </p>
      <p>The author refers the reader to his many pertinent articles as
        listed in the References, and will thus describe only a few
        special experimental gravity observations here, primarily to
        indicate to the reader the power of these methods. </p>
      <p><b>Experimental Confirmations</b> </p>
      <p>Much EM-wave observational data is available on aspects of the
        ‘visible’ universe now, but most of it is as the Universe was,
        back in time, due to the relatively slow propagation time for
        electromagnetic effects. However, since the Universe is believed
        to have been in a steady-state condition in that time period,
        these observations also provide much data on the present state
        of the nature of Our Universe. While visible light observations
        have been used primarily in the past, observations today at
        other frequencies, such as the radio frequencies, e.g., radio
        astronomy, provide much additional information which my not be
        available at the light frequencies. For example, some radio
        astronomy data is very striking and supports much of the optical
        data. In a similar manner, gravitational signal data can also be
        quite striking and also supports much of the EM wave type data.
        However, due to its very nature and ‘instant’ time of response,
        the gravitational signals can disclose much new aspects which
        cannot really be determined by the EM wave observational method.
        Thus this new 'window' to Our Universe is a very valuable
        supplement to astronomy and astrophysical techniques, and it is
        unfortunate that the professionals are not presently making use
        of these techniques. The author is presently endeavoring to get
        the more open-minded experimenters and amateur scientists to
        become more involved here, especially since the techniques are
        so simple and very low in cost. The author has released much
        information on these techniques and their observations and the
        reader is again referred to the References for additional
        information. This essay will refer to but some of the
        larger-scale astronomical structures noted, primarily to
        indicate to the reader the power and scope of these techniques.
      </p>
      <p>The gravitational signal detection methods used in these
        observations are with devices which may be called gravity meters
        (gravimeters). Most of the presently available gravimeters are
        of the mechanical type and the reader is referred to Reference 4
        for some of the author’s experiences with a simplified version
        of such a device. Emphasis here, however, will be with an
        electronic-type gravimeter as developed by the author. While
        there is much more information on this device in the listed
        References, the author will briefly describe the basic operation
        of the device here. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig2.jpg" width="641" height="283"></p>
        <p><b>Figure 2 --- Basic Electronic-Type Gravimeter</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The basic electronic-type gravimeter is shown in Figure 2. It
        is based upon readily available operational amplifier integrated
        circuit devices and, as can be seen here, it is extremely simple
        in its circuitry. Active gravitational flux gradients, e.g.,
        gravity ‘winds’ developed by supernova events, or passive
        gravity events, the gravitational ‘shadows’ cast by black holes,
        for example, affect the electron-ion structure of the detecting
        capacitor elements, C, and thus create current fluctuations from
        that capacitor. These current fluctuations are highly amplified
        and converted to voltage fluctuations by op-amp, IC1. The DC
        output from IC1, with some AC fluctuations superimposed, is
        further amplified with op-amp, IC2. The output of IC2 is passed
        through a low-pass filter section, the characteristics of which
        will determine the response time for the system (and thus the
        response time to certain astronomical events). The gravity
        variations may then be followed on an output voltmeter, or
        recorded on other systems, such as a strip chart recorder or a
        computer system. That such a detector system is viable is seen
        in that while ‘transient’ astronomical events are ‘caught’ at
        arbitrary times, ‘permanent’ astronomical events are repeatedly
        seen whenever these events cross the observer’s meridian
        position on earth. </p>
      <p>The power of this system will be illustrated by observations of
        two very large structures in this Universe. One is the Milky Way
        Galaxy system, our home Galaxy, which is also observable
        visually, as well as quite strikingly in terms of EM wave
        radiations. The other observation, which was originally but a
        conjecture in Rhysmonics, has been confirmed with both the
        mechanical and electronic types of gravimeters. This is the
        apparent Super Galaxy System of Our Universe, and it appears to
        have a structure which closely parallels the structure seen
        (gravitationally) in our own Milky Way Galaxy System. </p>

        discloses the presence of these two systems rather dramatically
        as shown in Figure 3. Under such conditions the gravimeter is
        basically a g-field meter and responds mainly to long-term
        variations in the g-factor, mostly those due to astronomical
        events. The ‘modulations’ in the g-factor seen here are those
        due to our own Galaxy (due to its close proximity) and that due
        to the Super Galaxy (due to its over-riding concentration of
        mass). </p>
      <p>The response shown in Figure 3a is the overall response in the
        g-factor as seen on that date and at the times shown. Short-term
        responses in this plot were largely eliminated in the slow scan
        period used with the D’Arsonval-type strip chart recorder used
        to obtain this plot. Here, the Super Galaxy response is dominant
        except where the ‘local’ Milky Way Galaxy system also crosses
        the observer’s meridian position. If the effects of the Milky
        Way Galaxy ‘transit’ are removed from this response, as shown in
        Figure 3b, the characteristics of the Super Galaxy become that
        much more apparent. These plots appear to show that like our
        Sun’s location in an outer spiral section of our Galaxy (and
        somewhat off the plane of that galaxy), our Milky Way Galaxy
        also appears to be in an outer spiral section of the Super
        Galaxy (and also somewhat off the plane of that galaxy). The
        nucleus sections are prominent in each scan, indicating similar
        concentrated masses and ‘black hole’ cores in each galaxy
        scanned. The nucleus masses and black holes for the Super Galaxy
        are located in the Leo region of our celestial sphere, while the
        Milky Way Galaxy concentrated nucleus mass and black hole is
        located in the Sagittarius Region of our celestial sphere. It
        should also be noted that the Super Galaxy nucleus region was in
        our zenith region at the time of its scan and this resulted in a
        reduction in the g-factor, while the Milky Way nucleus region
        was underneath our Earth position and thus this resulted in an
        increase in the g-factor as shown. </p>
      <p>That massive gravitational effects in Our Universe can have
        effects on our weather systems here on earth appears to have
        been noted by a major Milky Way Galaxy Center event on abut
        December 5, 1986, ad another major Super Galaxy Center event
        noted on March 14, 1988. These events apparently introduced
        ‘gravity wind’ effects which affected our normal jet stream
        patterns. It is believed that the December 5, 1986 event
        introduced a new tangential component to gravity in the Northern
        Latitudes, and this results in the somewhat colder and stormier
        winter of 1986-87. However, it is believed that the event of
        March 4, 1988 introduced a new more vertical component to
        gravity in the Northern Latitudes and this may have been
        responsible for the long, hot summer seen in the USA in the year
        1988. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>Monitoring of the g-factor with either the mechanical or the
        electronic types of gravimeters can give not only much new
        information on the nature and development of Our Universe, but
        also can forewarn Earthlings of possible EM-wave dangers from
        the more ‘local’ gravity events. This is because gravity events
        are detected as they occur, but the EM-wave components will
        generally take a much longer time to reach the Earth, depending
        on the location of the originating gravity event. For example,
        shown in Figure 4 are some scans of our Galaxy Center region. In
        Figure 4a is shown a typical EM-wave scan of this region while
        in Figure 4b a typical gravity scan made prior to December 5,
        1986 is shown. While the EM-wave scan (by radio astronomy) is in
        terms of radio wave propagation, the plots show it coincided
        quite well with the mass concentrations as shown in the gravity
        scan made by the author. However, after December 5, 1986, the
        gravity scan of the form shown in Figure 4b disappeared and was
        replaced by a new deep black hole and ring structure as shown in
        Figure 4c. While that gravity event occurred about December 5,
        1986 (and affected the Earth in gravitational fashion then and
        ever since), the EM-wave effects will not reach us for about
        another 30,000 years. However, we may not be so lucky with a
        more ‘local’ gravity event. For example, it is also suspected
        that perhaps the star Betelgeuse in Orion may have also gone
        supernova as a result of the galaxy Center event of about
        December 5, 1986, but the EM waves from that event (if real)
        will reach us in about 300 years rather than the 30,000 years
        for the Center event. In addition to its radiation effects which
        will be much more intense, it will also be one ‘helluva’ visual
        supernova display! The author is releasing much data and
        information on these techniques for the benefit of mankind.
        However, the author regrets that but very few are heeding him at
        present. The author cannot do all these observations alone, and
        thus much data and knowledge is being lost. </p>

      <p>One final note: the data of Figure 3a is plotted over a two-day
        period in Figure 5. This plot appears to show the observed
        cosine variation noted in the measured microwave background
        radiation may be related to the highly averaged variation in the
        g-factor also. Rhysmonic cosmology predicted that such a
        variation in the MBR would be due to our off-center position in
        this Universe and that such a variation would exist even if the
        structure due to mass variations as seen in Figure 5 did not
        exist. Careful measurements and plots like those shown here
        could very well detail the actual structure of Our Universe when
        used in conjunction with data obtained by the other
        observational methods. Much can be accomplished here! </p>
