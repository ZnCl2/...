      <p><b>Remarks:</b> </p>
      <p>1. The detector capacitor is already ‘pre-polarized’ with the
        polarization a function of the capacitor geometry. For tubular
        capacitors, the earth g-fields will interact with only a small
        segment of the capacitor as depicted here. If the capacitor were
        oriented in the East-West direction, the tighter radial E-fields
        would show less interaction. </p>
      <p>2. As the capacitor ‘drift scans’ with the earth’s rotation,
        the detector will respond to a small sector of the universe as
        determined by the angle B-O-C. A larger active capacitor section
        would thus scan a proportionately larger sector of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>3. Cosmic events are continually modulating the many g-field
        vectors along the meridian line in sector B-O-C. There is no
        interaction seen in the vectors along a latitude line. </p>
      <p>4. In the simple Rustrak tests, the ‘fast’ novae and
        super-novae’ type responses are used as a ‘sweep frequency’ to
        move the Rustrak needle above and below a reference line (which
        is the zenith-nadir line A-O) shown here. During these sweeps,
        the cosmic responses are still superimposed on the Rustrak
        needle responses. As the needle swings across this sector, the
        2-second meter ‘slam’ will reflect the charge condition in the
        capacitor for the particular g-field vector which is in line
        with that needle position. For example, a very dense GW ‘shadow’
        at such a position will result in a ‘fast’ needle movement at
        that position, increasing the odds that the ‘slam’ will ‘miss’
        such a spot --- leaving a ‘bare’ spot as a sign of dense mass. </p>
      <p>5. In practice, the GW detector will respond to ‘signals’ above
        and below the earth, as well as strong signals well off the
        zenith-nadir line (on the meridian); thus further analysis of
        the responses are required. The responses are further ‘confused’
        in that the earth in its cosmic journey will ‘vector scan’ a
        slightly different sector of the universe daily. Only the very
        dense structures will tend to repeat on a daily basis. </p>
      <p>6. The use of novae for the sweep frequency will result in
        purely random sweeps --- thus the response should be free of
        artifacts. Use of circuit oscillations or injected signals as
        sweeps would probably result in artifacts here.</p>
