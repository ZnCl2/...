      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>The existence and development of supernovae and black holes,
        which are postulated in conventional astrophysical theory. Are
        examined from the viewpoint of the author’s rhysmonic cosmology.
        The actual existence of these effects are confirmed with the
        gravitational signal astronomy techniques which were developed
        by the author. The theoretical and experimental data are
        compared and some conclusions are drawn. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>Astronomy in recent years has undergone a revolution in both
        theoretical and observational methods. These are the result of
        new advances in scientific technology, which not only opened up
        new observational techniques such as observations at
        electromagnetic frequencies other than visible light, but also
        gave some evidence that our universe, in its furthest observable
        reaches, obeys the same scientific principles as is observed
        here in our own environment. These principles have been used by
        the astrophysicists to theorize on the basis for some of the
        effects noted in these astronomical observations. There are many
        effects but this short article will consider only the
        observation of supernova effects and the possibility of the
        existence of black holes. </p>
      <p>Supernovae, of course, are observed effects and thus are not
        just purely theoretical objects. The possible existence of black
        holes, however, is still theorized and has not yet been
        unequivocally conformed in either theory or in present
        observational methods. However, while the theoretical aspects
        appear to be somewhat valid, the observational attempts made by
        conventional astrophysicists to confirm these effects have been
        mainly in terms of quadrature-type gravity-wave signals, which
        are really, in essence, but a form of electromagnetic radiation.
        Such signals would be expected to have very long wavelengths and
        very low energy content, and thus would be a very elusive type
        of radiation signal to be detected with presently developed
        techniques. The author believes that perhaps some of the
        so-called micropulsations being observed with some magnetometers
        might be such signals. </p>
      <p>The main problem today in the attempts to observe any
        gravitational radiation signals has been the insistence of the
        conventional (orthodox) astrophysicist that only the
        quadrature-type signals of Einstein are permissible. Rhysmonic
        cosmology, however, has shown that longitudinal, monopolar, or
        scalar-type gravity signals exist profusely in this universe and
        are easily detectable with rather simple detection techniques
        (See Refs. 1-5). Such techniques and experimental results, as
        they apply to supernovae and black holes, will be discussed in
        the remainder of this short article. </p>
      <p><b>Rhsymonic Viewpoints</b> </p>
      <p>Rhysmonic cosmology (Ref. 1) is a very basic theory which
        applies to all of existence and scientific technology. In a way,
        it also confirms much of the theoretical speculations of present
        day astrophysicists. While rhysmonic cosmology is a very
        fundamental theory, which deals largely with the substratum of
        the universe (the aether, if you wish) it also relates very well
        to the macroscopic aspects of the universe. Therefore, he
        gravitational aspects considered in this cosmology (Ref. 6) lead
        to predictable effects in the substratum or aether of this
        universe which can also be observable in the macroscopic world
        of man or his instrumentation. Of prime importance is the
        prediction that the scalar gravitational signals can interact
        with scalar-type electric fields and scalar-type magnetic
        fields. Of particular interest is the interaction of gravity
        with scalar electric fields, since this forms the basis for many
        of the author’s gravitational signal detection systems. While
        some of these techniques may have been observed in the past by
        lone and unappreciated researchers, they had not been really
        recognized for their true value, since many of the conceptions
        required are not yet generally recognized or accepted by the
        orthodox scientific community. While a philosophy behind many of
        these concepts is given in various works by the author, no
        attempt will be made here to justify the theories other than in
        the experimentally observed results, which will be shown to
        correlate very well with the otherwise noted astronomical
        effects. </p>
      <p><b>Experimental Detectors</b> </p>
      <p>Scalar type (longitudinal or monopolar) gravitational signals
        from the universe are observable as perturbations superimposed
        on the earth’s ‘static’ g-field. The earth’s static field
        (g-field) can be measured with simple gravimeters of the
        electronic type (Refs. 1-4) or of the spring scale type (Ref.
        5). The electronic versions are more suitable for the detection
        of supernova effects and black holes and thus only those types
        will be considered here. While some actual detection systems are
        considered in more detail in the references, a very simple
        description of the basic detection process is given using the
        simplest circuitry shown in Figure 1. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1 --- Simplest GW Detection System</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig1.jpg" width="568" height="260"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The detection element is a rather large-value capacitor (order
        of 2000 uF), CD, in which the scalar fields developed by the
        electron-ion pairs in he dielectric material can be ‘modulated’
        by interaction with the monopolar or scalar gravity fields which
        ‘proceed’ instantly from the distant supernova, S.N. (Ref. 1).
        These perturbations of the earth’s g-filed can be active, as
        those which appear when there are large and rapid movements of
        mass, e.g., when a star mass collapses to a neutron star or
        black hole in the supernova event, or passive, when the black
        hole which is created in the supernova event causes a ‘shadow
        effect’ which can modulate the GW signal levels which may be in
        line with this highly concentrated mass and the observer’s
        meridian position on earth. Modulations of the electron-ion
        structure in the detector capacitance, CD, lead to some small
        current fluctuations in the external input circuitry and these
        are amplified to higher level voltage fluctuations by IC1, which
        is operated in the current-to-voltage mode. The combination of
        the detector element, CD, and the IC’s mode of operation results
        in a harmonic type oscillation where the ‘polarization’ effects
        in the capacitor, CD, are restored by the reverse electric
        fields developed from the IC. This enables a rather pure
        sine-wave mode of oscillation, with the frequency of the
        oscillation established by the amount of charge in the detection
        capacitor, i.e., the capacitance of CD, and the feedback
        voltage, which is largely a function of the feedback resistance,
        RF. Since the variation in g-field levels is also equivalent to
        a variation in scalar E-fields, the gravitational output signals
        generally have two components; a dynamic variation or an AC
        signal output, and a slowly varying offset voltage variation, or
        a DC signal output. The AC component can actually display on an
        oscilloscope the gaussian nature of the collapse of a supernova
        star to a black hole, and this process can also be heard
        aurally. Meanwhile, the DC component, when processed through a
        low-pass filter element, can also display and record on a strip
        chart recorder the variations or ‘shadow effects’ caused by the
        presence of dense masses which happen to be inline with the
        observer’s meridian position on Earth. The detection ‘window’ is
        essentially the cross-sectional area of the active portion of
        the detecting element, capacitor CD in this case, and thus has
        extreme resolution, i.e., the ‘beam size’ is in the order of but
        a square inch or so. </p>
      <p>The actual detection circuits used in the observation of
        supernovae and black holes are somewhat more complete and are
        doubly Faraday-shielded in practice to avoid any possible RFI
        problems, but in essence they operate essentially as briefly
        described above. Some experimental results are now given, using
        a well-proven GW detection circuit (Ref. 7). </p>
      <p><b>Experimental Results</b> </p>
      <p>The experimental detection systems respond to the many
        gravitational signals which are very profusely generated in this
        universe. The response and analysis here will be limited to
        novae, supernovae, and black holes only. Some typical responses
        will be shown and the data analyzed in terms of conventional
        astrophysics as well as rhysmonic theory. </p>

        <p><img src="fig2.jpg" width="593" height="277"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Novae</b> </p>
      <p>Novae in conventional astrophysical terms are stars which eject
        their outer layers of gas in a violent ‘explosion’, probably due
        to some nuclear reaction. Such events are detectable with this
        system due to the large transient movement of mass and the
        response is usually as depicted in Figure 2. There are two
        prominent features or signatures for this event; the blast
        itself and the observed ‘tailing’ of the blasted material as the
        detector ‘sweep’ pulls away from the blasted material due to the
        movement of the detector with the earth’s rotation. In some
        cases, a buildup of material due to the shockwave from the blast
        may be seen. Novae rarely leave lasting gravitational traces
        since the amount and density of material removed from the star
        is not great. Optically, ionization effects can leave traces of
        expelled material, e.g., planetary nebulae, but these are
        generally gravitationally transparent, and thus are not seen wit
        this system. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 3 ---Typical Supernova GW Response</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig3.jpg" width="570" height="292"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Supernovae</b> </p>
      <p>Supernovae in conventional astrophysical terms are believed to
        be stars which exceed a certain ‘critical mass; and thus
        collapse to a small very dense neutron star or a black hole
        structure, and in this process also expels much of its gaseous
        material. This process, which occurs only in the order of
        milliseconds (per conventional theory) also leaves certain
        prominent features or ‘signatures’ as depicted in Figure 3.
        First, there is the actual ‘collapse’ of the star to the black
        hole structure which is noted briefly with the DC component of
        this detector, but is more prominent in the AC component which
        can actually display the gaussian nature of the ‘implosion’ of
        this collapse on an oscilloscope. Also prominent is the actual
        expulsion of much of the star’s mass in the ‘explosion’ which
        again gives rise to a ‘tailing’ effect due to the detector’s
        sweeping action caused by the earth’s rotation. However,
        supernovae generally show a mass buildup due now to the
        shockwave from this blast. Also, supernovae generally show
        lasting gravitational effects which can be followed for days
        (and sometimes years), especially with regard to the black holes
        which can be developed. </p>
      <p><b>Black Holes</b> </p>
      <p>Black hole structures developed by massive supernovae usually
        appear following the event, and are quite developed 24-48 hours
        after the event. The typical depiction of the new structure is
        given in Figure 4 and this also has some typical features or
        signatures. The black hole itself appears as a rather deep
        ‘shadow’ of very narrow width (time) since it is rather small
        size, in the order of just miles in diameter, typically. Also
        prominent is the newly formed accretion ring, which may
        apparently be formed of material which remained trapped by the
        dense hole and thus did not escape as did the material which is
        now forming the expanding shockwave ring systems. The
        development of this system usually can be followed for a few
        days, where the hole ‘deepens’ and the rings expand and vary in
        structure. The close-in accretion ring may remain for some time,
        but it is suspected that over a long period of time, only the
        black hole itself will be gravitationally visible as depicted in
        Figure 5. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>Galaxy Center</b> </p>
      <p>The Galaxy Center is considered by many conventional
        astrophysicists to harbor a very dense mass or even a black
        hole. Infrared and radio astronomy observations of the Center
        (necessary since dense clouds of gas and debris there prevent
        direct visible light observations) have supported such
        conjectures Gravitational signal observations of the Center by
        the author for the past 5 years have also confirmed to some
        extent the EM wave observations. This meant that the Galaxy
        Center had been relatively stable for the past 32,000 years or
        so. This is because GW signals are essentially instantaneous and
        thus depict the conditions there now, while the EM wave signals
        which travel at the speed of light depict the conditions which
        were there about 32,000 years ago. A rough comparison of the GW
        and EM scans for the Galaxy Center are given in Figure 6. The GW
        scan would seem to indicate that the central object in the
        Center is a very massive object and could be a small black hole.

      </center>
      <p>However, on Dec. 1 and 2, 1986, some slight changes were
        noticed in the GW scans of the Galaxy Center structure. It
        appeared as if there was a movement of a nearby mass in this
        structure toward the central dense object in this structure.
        This might have been precipitated by a rather large supernova
        event noted near (?) the Galaxy Center on Dec. 1. Unfortunately,
        the Center was not scanned again until Dec. 6 and at this time
        it was observed that the original long-standing structure had
        disappeared and in its stead was a new very deep black hole
        structure with a well-defined accretion ring as shown in the
        depiction of Figure 7. The Center was followed daily for a month
        and the development of the new structure was observed. The
        Center has largely stabilized in this time period and thus
        appears to harbor a new deep black hole with the well-defined
        accretion ring structure. However, the original
        shockwave-created debris ring of about 7 minutes or arc in
        diameter had expanded to about 15 minutes of arc! The
        gravitational or ‘rhysmonic winds’ being created by this
        expanding material were recorded on l/f-type noise detectors by
        the author as very noisy and turbulent initially, but have since
        settled down to a more or less steady ‘wind’ (1-10-1987). These
        winds could possibly affect the normal weather patterns here on
        earth, especially at the latitudes between about 50 N Latitude
        and the north pole, where these gravitational winds are
        essentially parallel to the earth’s surface and thus could
        strongly affect the atmospheric conditions in this region. The
        reported anomalous weather conditions in Europe and Siberia
        during the month of January 1987 could well have been due to
        these winds. Time will tell if there is a correlation between
        the two. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>Simple gravitational signal detection systems appear to confirm
        much of the processes of novae, supernovae and black holes as
        was expounded by some astrophysicists. Much of their theories
        also appears to be in agreement with tenets of rhysmonic
        cosmology. Therefore, these gravitational detections systems
        offer a new window to the universe which has already proven its
        usefulness as discussed in this brief article but also has
        detected many, many other objects and events in this universe.
        The catastrophic event in the Galaxy Center of about December 4
        or 5, 1986, will be followed closely, especially with respect to
        the effects of the gravitational winds on the weather of earth.
        The observational systems are quite simple and the author
        invites interested open-minded researchers to join him in this
        effort. </p>
