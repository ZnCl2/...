      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Described here is a very simple electronic-type gravity meter
        (gravimeter) which can measure fluctuations in the earth’s
        gravity field (g-field). These fluctuations, in turn, may be
        related to cosmic effects of a gravitational source. The author
        has developed any such instruments over the past 15 years and
        has ‘observed’ many interesting cosmic gravitational phenomena
        which appear to also affect the earth’s gravitational field Some
        of this data has been released in the past. In recent years (and
        months) the gravimeters have notes some ‘catastrophic’ cosmic
        events which appeared to have a direct effect on the earth’s jet
        stream patterns and thus also on the weather patterns on earth.
        These same effects may have helped to initiate some of recent
        earthquake activity also. Some of these catastrophic effects are
        briefly noted here. The author hopes to increase the interest of
        the private experimenter-researcher in these studies. The
        apparatus is very low in cost and simple and does not require
        and expensive set-up. This area of investigation is yet quite
        unexplored and thus wide-open to the inquisitive and
        knowledgeable electronic experimenter and amateur scientist. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>Gravity in terms of the author’s rhysmonic cosmology theory (1)
        is a kinetic force, i.e., a Newtonian force field gradient,
        which can directly affect material bodies. This force is well
        known as the force of ‘free fall’ or the g-field of the earth,
        i.e., it accelerates any mass at about 32 ft/sec^2 and thus
        makes itself known as ‘weight’ on earth. Less well known is that
        these same ingredients can also affect certain structures in an
        electrical manner. In particular, the ‘bound’ dipole structures
        in the dielectric of an ordinary capacitor are affected by these
        gradients. These result in ‘polarization’ variations which can
        be coupled out of the capacitor as electrical current impulses
        and/or current levels. These impulses can be highly amplified to
        voltage impulses (or voltage levels in the case of a ‘steady’
        gradient force field) using very simple circuitry. </p>
      <p>While the earth’s gravity field (g-field) is a relatively
        constant gradient force field which is directed toward the
        center of the earth, the author has long surmised and actually
        verified that there would be fluctuations in these earth gravity
        gradients. These are due to certain cosmic gravitational
        effects, such as the rapid and large movement of mass, e.g., a
        supernova ‘blast’, or a very dense concentration f mass, e.g., a
        ‘black hole’ type of structure. The rapid movement of mass could
        be considered as causing a gravity ‘wind’ in the gradient, while
        a concentrated dense mass could be considered as causing a
        ‘shadow’ in the gradient. These effects actually ‘modulate’ the
        earth’s g-field by superposition when the cosmic gradients are
        directly in parallel with the earth’s g-field gradient. The
        field gradients in this case may be considered to be scalar
        fields since they have a common direction and thus the
        potentials interact in simple algebraic rules. This is
        particularly true if the cosmic gradient arrives on earth from
        the direction of the gravimeter’s meridian location, especially
        along the unit’s nadir Line, i.e., the line running from the
        zenith through the center of the earth. Thus the cosmic effects
        are most pronounced when they ‘transmit’ the observer’s meridian
        position, to use the astronomers’ terminology. While the
        interaction is maximum only along the nadir line, there is
        interaction from the cosmic gradients arriving from anywhere
        along the meridian line. Thus some very strong cosmic gradients
        off the nadir line may sometimes override weak nadir line
        gradients. This was found useful in observing strong cosmic
        signals, e.g., the Milky Way Galaxy Center, which lies well off
        the nadir line at the author’s latitude. However, it must be
        remembered that detection response weakens with departure from
        the nadir line since only the gradient component which is
        parallel to the earth’s gradient will interact and thus modulate
        the earth’s gravity field levels. However, the author has also
        developed a more complex gravity ‘telescope’ unit which improves
        the responses from various declination positions along the
        observer’s meridian line. </p>
      <p>That such gravity gradient detections are valid and useful, as
        well as meaningful, will be briefly considered here. The reader
        is referred to the references for additional data and
        information. </p>
      <p><b>A Simple Electronic Gravimeter</b> </p>
      <p>The author (over the years) has developed many types of
        gravimeters, some mechanical, but most electrical in nature. The
        units varied from the extremely simple to the more complex,
        depending on the particular components used and the end
        application. The unit shown in Figure 1 is a simple circuit
        (using generally available parts) and was designed with this
        particular article in mind. It was designed to not only measure
        the slow variations in the earth’s g-field, but also to
        demonstrate supernova ‘blasts’ in terms of an audio signal as
        well as a display on an oscilloscope. </p>
      <p>The unit was constructed in a small plastic box about 1.5" x 2"
        x 5" which had an aluminum panel. A small 50 uA meter movement
        was used to display the averaged g-field levels and the
        sensitivity and off-set controls were brought out on the panel
        as were also the output jack and on/of switch. The 9-volt
        battery supply was also self-contained within the plastic box. </p>
      <p>The detection unit is a basic GW detection circuit as developed
        by the author and uses the workhorse 741 operational amplifier
        device. Some slight variations were included to optimize the
        circuit for this particular amplification. The circuit is the
        basic quantum non-demolition (QND) type of circuit and thus will
        respond to supernova ‘burst’ frequencies and amplitudes as well
        as the general l/f noise background (which is generated by the
        multitude of GW signals present in this universe). These
        impulses are developed in the input capacitor, C<sub>1</sub>, as
        current impulses and changed into output voltage signals by the
        741 device operated as a current-to-voltage converter. The
        ‘ring’ frequency and also the output voltage gain is controlled
        by the feedback potentiometer resistance, R<sub>1</sub>. The
        circuit was placed in an AC operating mode by of-setting the
        non-inverting input (pin 3) of the op-amp device to
        approximately the midpoint of the 9-volt power supply. The
        offset positioning is provided by the resistance string of R<sub>2</sub>,
        R<sub>3</sub>, and R<sub>4</sub>. Capacitor, C<sub>2</sub>, is
        used to bypass the low frequency components from the meter
        circuit, while capacitors, C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> were
        intended to bypass possible RF components, since the plastic box
        enclosure used does not fully protect against possible RF
        interference signals. The meter, M<sub>1</sub>, is used directly
        between the output and the non-inverting input as an
        approximately 50 mV voltmeter, using only the internal
        resistance of the meter as a multiplier resistance. The
        resistance of the meter used should be 1K or better. The typical
        voltage output at this point is in the order of 30 mV, when the
        potentiometers are set at their midpoint levels. The meter will
        respond only to the averaged DC levels present at the output and
        not to any AC components, Thus, the circuit parameters can be
        adjusted to have the meter read 32 on the meter scale, his being
        equivalent to the typical g-field value of 32 ft/sec<sup>2</sup>.
        While this response is linear and can be made accurate,
        unfortunately, in this particular circuit, the g-field response
        is inverse, i.e., an increase in the g-field will read
        down-scale, while a reduction in the g-field will read up-scale.
        While this could be corrected with a following inverter
        amplifier stage, it was deemed unnecessary. The averaged daily
        variation in the g-field seen with this unit since about
        November 25, 1989, was in the order of 6%, ranging between 31
        and 33 ft/sec<sup>2</sup> !! This larger than usual variation
        will be discussed later. </p>
      <p>The component values for this gravimeter circuit are not overly
        critical and the reader may use values in the order of those
        shown, or even use quite different values. For example, the
        feedback resistance could be a 2M or even a 5M potentiometer,
        while a 100K or even a 200K potentiometer could be used for the
        off-set resistance string. Other op-amps could also be used but
        may require some adjustment in the parameters. Thus, the reader
        has much leeway in this design. </p>
      <p><b>Cosmic Gravity Signals</b> </p>
      <p>Electronic gravity detectors are capable of detecting many
        types of cosmic gravitational gradient signals, depending on the
        design and the operating mode used. Only some of the more common
        responses will be described here in order to help the researcher
        recognize the nature of these signals. The gravimeter of <b>Figure










          1</b> [below] was designed to detect only the highly averaged,
        i.e., relatively constant, but slowly varying levels in the
        earth’s g-field, and these detections will be discussed in the
        next section. Some single-step op-amp detectors can be made to
        respond to fast gravity changes, but generally two-stage gravity
        detectors can be made more sensitive and thus will respond
        better to the fast-changing earth gravity levels generated by
        the cosmic events shown in <b>Figure 2</b>. These are novae,
        supernovae, and the resulting black hole type structures in some
        cases. </p>
      <p>A typical nova response is shown in <b>Figure 2a</b>. The
        typical nova is a star which becomes unstable for some reason
        and ‘blasts’ of a good portion of its outer atmosphere, but
        still leaves a fairly large amount of star behind. In Figure 2a,
        the blast of star material can be seen at (a) and a ‘tailing’
        response is seen at (b). The tailing response is generated by
        the process of the earth’s movement, as it pulls away from the
        star, i.e., the observer’s meridian position moves off the
        meridian position at which the star was located. Novae are quite
        common and many are ‘observed’ during a ‘scan; of the universe
        by the gravimeter. They generally do not leave a lasting trace
        and thus may not show up in a scan 12 or 24 hours later. </p>
      <p>Shown in <b>Figure 2b</b> is a typical supernova response. In
        this case the star is above a certain critical mass when it
        becomes unstable, and it leads to an implosion causing the
        creation of a very dense star as is seen at (a) here. This is
        followed by an ‘explosion’ of much of the star’s mass as is seen
        at (b). his is again followed by a tailing response as the
        detector moves of the star’s meridian position with the rotation
        of the earth. With a supernova, two other general effects are
        noted: the development of the super dense star at (c) and signs
        o a shock front at (d). Some supernova show signs of more than
        one shock front. Another factor is that supernova generally show
        lasting traces. A scan 12 or 24 hours later will show the dense
        star of a neutron star or black hole nature at (c) again, but
        the shock front has now become an accretion ring on both sides
        of the object at (c) as is seen in the scan of <b>Figure 2c</b>.
        Further scans in time, generally show the accretion ring to be
        pulling away from the central dense object and this results in a
        discernable gravity ‘wind’ from these events. In other scans,
        black hole structures are seen where there is no sign o an
        accretion ring. These are believed to be ancient supernovae
        where the accretion ring has either dissipated or returned to
        the central dense object. </p>
      <p>In many instances the blasts of mass create gravity ‘winds’
        which not only can affect the gravity levels on earth, but also
        can be ‘heard’ aurally on the detectors as an increased rushing
        sound disturbance in the general l/f background noise o the
        universe. The creation of the dense object, e.g., a black hole,
        causes a ‘shadow’ to appear in the earth’s g-field response, and
        thus appears as a very sharp dip in the g-field levels, either a
        rise or fall, depending upon the object’s position at the
        observing location, i.e., above or below the earth. </p>
      <p>While these responses are very common occurrences seen with the
        very fast gravimeters, the slow highly averaged gravity changes
        in the earth’s g-field also reveal much interesting information
        about our universe as will be described next. </p>
      <p><b>Gravity Field Revelations</b> </p>
      <p>The meter of the gravimeter circuit of <b>Figure 1</b>
        displays only the highly averaged (damped) g-field levels of the
        earth. While the meter will not display the short term
        fluctuations that were shown in <b>Figure 2</b>, the long term
        fluctuations apparently show other interesting aspects of our
        universe. A typical scan of these highly averaged g-field
        variations (over a period of 24 hours) is shown in <b>Figure 3</b>.
        In ths scan some of the more rapid fluctuations have been
        smoothed out and only the broad changes in the earth’s g-field
        levels are shown. </p>
      <p>From the analysis of such scans, the author has surmised the
        following conclusions: </p>
      <p>(1) The universe as a whole may have a basic spiral structure
        quite similar to that of the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies. </p>
      <p>(2) The Milky Way Galaxy may be located in an outer spiral of
        this Super Universe Galaxy, very much like the Earth is located
        in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy. </p>
      <p>(3) There may be another very massive black hole type structure
        located in the Virgo region of our universe, and this may have
        already been recognized by many as the ‘Great Attractor’. </p>
      <p>Since these are very massive and dense structures, they
        possible could affect our earth g-fields and thus they are
        believed to be causing the structures seen in the scan of Figure
        3. It is further surmised that perhaps effects of these types
        may have altered the earth’s g-fields to the extent of affecting
        the jet stream patterns (and thus the earth’s weather) over the
        eons. It is offered as another datum to be used in analyzing the
        weather on earth and possibly all the planets. Some recent
        drastic g-field variations noted with these gravimeters are now
        presented: </p>
      <p>(1) On about December 6, 1986 it was noted that the previously
        ‘seen’ Milky Way Galaxy structure had changed from a weaker two
        massive dense structures to a more defined new single ‘black
        hole’ type structure with a new accretion ring! At the same
        time, this event appeared to have possibly triggered off a
        supernova type event relatively close to us (possibly Betelgeuse
        in Orion?) which lies in about the same meridian as the Galaxy
        Center. It is surmised that the strong gravity winds from
        Betelgeuse may have sufficiently disturbed our earth’s g-fields
        to have caused severe changes in the earth’s weather for the
        past two years (and it may have also been responsible for
        helping initiate some of the recent earthquake activity seen in
        the northern hemisphere and elsewhere). </p>
      <p>(2) Another event was noted on about March 14, 1987 which may
        have been from the Super Galaxy Center. As a result of the
        December and March events, the gravimeters which had previously
        only noted a daily variation in the earth’s g-field in the order
        of +/- 1% were now seeing variations of about +/- 2%. Also,
        strong gravity winds were being noted in the aural responses of
        the gravimeters. </p>
      <p>(3) On about November 25, 1989, a new gravity wind was noticed
        and the gravimeters were now showing a daily variation in the
        g-field of about +/- 3%! The winds appeared to be coming from
        the direction of the Great Attractor in the Virgo region. This
        apparently very massive event appears to have affected the jet
        stream patterns of the northern hemisphere mainly, and thus the
        weather patterns here. At this time (New Years Day, 1990) the
        winds appear to be abating somewhat and perhaps the weather may
        return to more normal later in the year. Based upon the apparent
        size of the jet stream disturbance, it is surmised that the very
        very dense structure in the Great Attractor region may be in the
        order of 500 to 1000 miles in diameter! This area of
        investigation should be of great interest to meteorologists and
        thus more research into these aspects should made by them. The
        effects appear to be real and thus of very great importance to
        mankind. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>The many aspects of a possible new gravitational ‘window’ to
        our universe requires more investigation that one observer with
        limited time and facilities (as well as funds) can undertake. A
        few independent experimenter-researchers have entered these
        studies at this time. The author hopes he has instilled
        sufficient interest on the part of the private researcher to
        look further into these aspects and thus help the author further
        determine the reality and validity of these observations. Good
        experimenting to all! </p>

        through a period of instability (?), The daily g-field
        variations at this time are in the order of 7%! Perhaps this is
        why the weather this spring has been so unusual? </p>

      <p><b>Remarks:</b> </p>
      <p>(1) The nucleus of the Super Galaxy may be the peak seen at A.
        the one side of the spiral mass may be at B, but the other side
        is ‘lost’ because of the apparent dense mass at C, which may be
        the Great Attractor. </p>
      <p>(2) The nucleus of the Milky Way may be the peak seen at D. The
        spiral masses may be the structures seen at E and F. </p>
      <p>(3) It is believed that after about November 3, 1989, the depth
        of the black hole at the Great Attractor region increased (and
        this also deepened the response of the Milky Way Center) and
        this may have resulted in the increase of the g-field variation
        to the order of +/- 3%. </p>
