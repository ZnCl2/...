      <p><b>A. Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>It was my original intention to include this in a revision of
        my monograph, Rhysmonic Cosmology. Then, I planned to write an
        extended Cosmology Note on this subject complete with many
        references by that was not practical, thus, this Note is written
        as a matter-of-fact essay. It is being written ‘off-the-top’ of
        my head, but it the only way I can convey my concepts to you in
        this (possible last) Cosmology Note. </p>
      <p><b>B. Background</b> </p>
      <p>Rhysmonic Cosmology got started in 1959 when Dover Publications
        issued a reprint of Max Planck’s ‘Theory of Heat Radiation’.
        That book contained a short aside in which Planck mentioned that
        Universal Constants could be used to develop a system of Natural
        Units. It was recognized that such a system could possibly
        reflect on the basic structure of our universe, especially since
        it was noted that the natural units of length over time (a
        velocity) agreed very closely with the experimentally determined
        velocity of light in a vacuum. The Planck Natural Units and
        their many derivations are thus the basis of my Rhysmonic work.
      </p>
      <p>Before continuing with the basic concepts, as it could apply to
        extraction of energy directly from the rhysmoid (the aether if
        you wish), let us look at some of the philosophy. I have
        mentioned third dimensions and fourth dimensions in the past,
        but may have been using those terms in special connotations. </p>
      <p>The Third Dimension (in my view) is the Universe that is
        revealed to us by our senses, using at times instrumentation
        which could aid our sense (such as microscopes, telescopes,
        computers, various meters, etc.). In general, this is a
        3-dimensional Cartesian-coordinate (Euclidian) universe as seen
        by our senses --- the universe we all know, a wonderful universe
        of stars, planets, earth, people, animals, vegetation, etc. The
        time element here is related to our sense of past, present, and
        future, and is governed by our various clocks. The vast majority
        of people view and live only in this third dimensional universe.
      </p>
      <p>The fourth dimensional universe is the fundamental structure,
        i.e., a substratum, which underlies the third dimensional
        universe. It is revealed to us only by our minds in conjunction
        with our senses and instruments. This fact implies that our
        minds may be non-corporeal and thus may function in a special
        version of the fourth dimension. Thus, this fourth dimension
        could be compared to the abode of spirit or soul as used in many
        religions. However, the human brain may be looked at as a most
        sophisticated computer which is corporeal, but which can be
        programmed and controlled by the mind in the performance of
        various human functions, including the study of mind and spirit;
        however, this is beyond the scope of this Note. </p>
      <p>Rhysmonic Cosmology attempts to describe the structure of the
        substratum (aether) since it is not knowable directly by our
        senses. It is fourth dimensional, while it is yet describable by
        the three dimensions of Descartes, those dimensions are also
        directly interconnected in a universal time element, thus making
        it four-dimensional in nature. It is also mechanical in nature
        and thus describable in terms of a Length (a distance), a Mass
        (particle), and a Time (duration). Therefore, L.M. and T, as
        well as their many derivatives, could be used to fully describe
        such a fourth dimensional universe. I have attempted to do so in
        Rhysmonic Cosmology and the structure as revealed there has led
        me to many predictions as well as experimental verifications of
        the theory. Although this paper is limited to the
        energy-extraction effects, some asides and connotations which
        elaborate on the theory, will be stated. </p>
      <p><b>C. Rhysmonic Cosmology Basics ~</b> </p>
      <p>The Rhysmonic Theory in all its details are available in my
        Monograph (1) and many articles and Notes. I include some
        illustrations from the Monograph and point out more explicitly
        the nature of that rhysmonic structure which will enable energy
        extraction directly from that structure. </p>
      <p><b>(1) Rhysmonic Structure ~</b> </p>
      <p>Rhysmonic structure, i.e., aether, consists of only a
        postulated extremely minute ‘particle’ which I now have termed a
        rhysmon (rather than originally a gravitational particle,
        graviton, now used by others in many other contexts). This
        particle forms a matrix structure which is the very fabric of
        our sensible universe. The matrix is fully describable in terms
        of Planck’s Natural Units for mechanics. See Table 1. </p>
      <p>Mass = M* ~ 2.177<sup>-5</sup> gm <br>
        Length = L* ~ 1.616<sup>-33</sup> cm (CGS units used) <br>
        Time = T* ~ 5.391<sup>-44</sup> sec. </p>
      <p>This matrix structure (as shown in my works) is essentially a
        ‘stationary’ structure in that the unit cell of the structure is
        self-contained and cannot be broken up and be moved as in a
        fluid. However, it can be modified or distorted and, therefore,
        it could be considered as an elastic solid medium. This medium
        contains the sole intrinsic energy of the universe! However, it
        is that directed energy flux (i.e., fields) which then become
        sensed in our third dimensional universe. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Rhysmonic Fields ~</b> </p>
      <p>The rhysmonic fields (i.e., aetheric fields) have certain
        characteristics revealed in Rhysmonic Cosmology which may be
        conducive to direct extraction of energy from these fields.
        Consider a planar section of this structure as shown in Figure
        1. This is an ‘instantaneous’ snapshot of this structure, since
        the structure is, in reality, extremely dynamic. Two factors
        should be pointed out: </p>
      <p>First, the structure has a linear aspect and also a rotary
        aspect, all developing from the short directed vectors of the
        basic cell structure. Second, the structure is also oscillatory
        with a frequency of about 1.855<sup>43</sup> Hertz (the inverse
        of T*), which is the Planck Frequency, f*. The linear aspect
        results in the phenomenon of inertia (e.g., linear momentum),
        while the rotational aspects result in the phenomenon of angular
        momentum, also an inertial effect. The linear aspects are due to
        the short cell vectors joining head-to-tail, while the angular
        aspects may be due to circumferential vectors as shown in dotted
        line form in Figure 1. It is important to note that some linear
        vectors (at a particular moment in time) are all in one
        direction and thus they are essentially scalar fields as defined
        by Whittaker. The circumferential (angular) vectors are also in
        certain directions at a particular ‘instant’ of time. The time
        considered here is Planck Time, T*, but that time can be related
        to our civil time. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig1.gif" width="533" height="366"></center>
      <p>Thus, a rhysmonic universal frequency, f*, is involved here
        which is 1/T* or approximately 1.855<sup>43</sup> Hz, the Planck
        Natural Frequency already mentioned. This dynamic structure
        results in what I have termed as the universal G-filed, and it
        is further defined by the constant, G, as determined in the
        Newtonian relation for gravitation. Therefore, this Universal
        G-field also defines the aether, but it should not be confused
        with g-fields which are due to a modification of the G-fields by
        the presence of particles (i.e., masses) in the structure, e.g.,
        the Earth. It is also not to be confused with the so-called
        zero-point energy flux (which in Rhysmonics is postulated to be
        due to perturbations on the G-field --- and thus g-fields --- by
        such influences as novae, supernovae, and many other random
        fluxes generated by disturbed masses in the universe). However,
        G-field flux might be related to the so-called torsion fields? I
        will consider some of these aspects later in the energy
        extraction process. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 2</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig2.gif" width="466" height="219"></center>
      <p>Consider now the ‘instantaneous’ unit rhysmonic cell structure
        as shown in Figure 2. here the hexagonal aether shown in the
        planar depiction of the rhysmonic structure in Figure 1 is seen
        in 3-dimentsional form. This is also very important as it shows
        that the ‘instantaneous’ scalar field in the aether might be
        simply summed by properly phasing interactions with locally
        generated scalar fields in the proper geometric form! This may
        have been done by Coler in his Magnetstromapparat? (More on this
        concept later). </p>
      <p><b>Figure 3</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig3.gif" width="507" height="200"></center>
      <p>Consider now the simple universe linear vectors as shown in
        Figure 3. This idea was originally used to explain the origin of
        g-fields, which are the normally-expressed gravitational
        effects. There I emphasized only a simple 60 degree planar
        reflection as would be seen in a cross-section of the universe
        which cuts across the physical center of the universe (Note:
        refer to the Postulates in the Introduction). Recall that our
        underlying universe structure is essentially stationary in that
        each rhysmonic cell is relatively fixed in space. Therefore, we
        can speak of in respect to the aether since this aether is in
        reality a fixed reference. Thus we have absolute space and
        absolute time as had been expounded on by Newton but which was
        denied by the Relativists! What is emphasized also is that the
        linear vectors shown in Figure 3 are essentially instantaneous
        vectors which are reflected from the edge of the universe by the
        unit vectors there acting essentially as loss-less pulleys! This
        effect is essentially instantaneous (in Planck Time) no matter
        at what angle or how many reflections are utilized! Also this
        reflection does not depend on position in the universe. This
        concept is most important and will be considered in more detail
        for the energy extraction process as well as other interesting
        asides to be given. </p>
      <p><b>D. Energy Extraction Mechanism</b> </p>
      <p>Before continuing I want to explain energy. Energy in a broad
        sense is the ability to do work. Energy is available in many
        forms since it is mechanical in nature and involves the motion
        (with respect to the fixed aether) of particles (or mass). Thus
        active energy is kinetic in nature and it stems from the
        intrinsic energy of the aether, where that energy involves the
        ever-moving motion of rhysmons in closed orbits. Active energy
        is given by = K.E. = mv<sup>2</sup> as has been long known in
        mechanics. In the use of K.E. = 1/2 mv<sup>2</sup>, the factor
        1/2 is a mathematical artifice used to simplify the more
        practical applications of kinetic energy. The intrinsic energy
        of the aether also is a scalar since it does not depend on the
        velocity of the particle (i.e., the rhysmon) but only on the
        speed. Thus, the intrinsic energy of the rhysmoid (i.e., aether)
        is given by: E* = M*C*<sup>2</sup>, or the more familiar E = MC<sup>2</sup>,
        where C is the speed of light. Also C is the speed of all other
        electromagnetic, propagated actions such as radio, X-rays,
        gamma-rays, etc., in the vacuum. Since C<sup>2</sup> in the
        undisturbed aether is a constant, the rhysmonic energy (E*) is
        directly proportional to the rhysmonic mass (M*) involved. Many
        (other) classical mechanical relations are also retained at the
        rhysmonic (aetheric) levels. </p>
      <p>In the past I had emphasized the interaction of the scalar E-
        and H-fields with the known scalar earth g-field in possible
        energy extraction processes. Theoretical and experimental
        studies have led to the development of various gravity detectors
        which then led to many applications, both terrestrial and
        astronomical. These studies will not be further considered here.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, when McClain and Wootan released material on their
        Magnetic Resonance Amplifier (MRA) in December 1995, I
        immediately sensed that such a series-resonant system, driven by
        a low-level oscillator circuit, could be interacting with the
        earth’s g-field in an energy extraction process. While I did not
        try to duplicate their actual circuit, I later got their L-C
        (inductance-capacitance) parts. I did try a quick test with
        parts and equipment I had on hand. There were low-level tests
        but fortunately the choices I made indicated that there was some
        excess power extraction noted in these tests. The use of a
        tube-type sine-wave generator, and the L-C components used,
        indicated a strong interaction at about 83.6 KHz, somewhat less
        interaction at adjacent frequencies, all of which were later
        determined to be sub-harmonics of the Universal Rhysmonic
        (Planck) frequency of about 1.855<sup>43</sup> Hz (f* = 1/T =
        1/5.391<sup>-44</sup> seconds). Many tests indicated power
        gains. Some circuits achieved a self-sustaining action where the
        power gain kept the rechargeable cells (Radio Shack rechargeable
        alkaline batteries) powering the solid-state oscillator fully
        charged over several thousand hours of continuous operation
        (Note: the power demands were such these batteries should have
        discharged!). These tests have since been suspended, but became
        very sporadic. The aim here is to eventually demonstrate a true
        stand-alone energy operating system. In due time, I hope to
        achieve that goal in one of the many proposed systems. </p>
      <p>In the course of these early Mini-MRA tests, some effort was
        made was made to orient at least the inductor to interact more
        directly with the earth’s g-field. However, as tests went on, it
        was noticed that tests were good regardless of L-C orientations!
        Some further tests indicated that all interactions were
        independent of L-C orientations but were dependent on the proper
        frequency of operation for the particular coil unit. Again, it
        was noted that best performance was always at a subharmonic of
        the Universal Rhysmonic (Planck) frequency of about 1.855<sup>43</sup>
        Hz. </p>
      <p>Some of the more recent tests have not been properly documented
        or released. However, I am now becoming more and more convinced
        that the mechanism as proposed here is at the heart of all free
        energy devices reported to have significant power gains (e.g.,
        those which used coils and/or capacitors). I am also convinced
        that with proper research and development, systems based upon
        the methodology given here will form the basis for energy
        generation directly from the Universal G-field of this universe.
      </p>
      <p>The universe as developed in Rhysmonics is a black-body, i.e.,
        a closed system. Therefore, such energy extraction and use will
        only redistribute the essentially infinite energy of the
        universe. That is, energy will be extracted, used in various
        ways, and then returned to the rhysmoid (aether). Rhysmonics
        predicts the universe will remain stable --- no heat death and
        no cold death! The universe is essentially violent and some of
        the violence (e.g., supernovae, etc.) should effect us here on
        Earth. </p>
      <p>I had predicted in December 1986 that violence in our Galaxy
        Center would affect Earth’s weather patterns for some time to
        come! The wild weather patterns in recent years may attest to
        that. However, locally there may be another cause, if mankind
        continues to abuse our environment with unwise use of fossil
        fuel energy here on earth. </p>
      <p>[The mentioned violence at the Galaxy Center was what Hodowanec
        had observed, via his techniques, as an apparent supernova event
        when the stable ancient black hole structure he had been
        observing for 5-6 years cannibalized a nearby very dense
        structure. The added mass/energy of which may have precipitated
        what was observed. Following this likely supernova, a new and
        much denser structure (likely a black hole) was observed
        complete with rapidly expanding accretion rings (debris from the
        supernova). While continuing to periodically scan this region,
        Hodowanec noticed in early June 1991 (now 10-11 years worth of
        scanning!) the new black hole was no longer there! For several
        days prior to this disappearance, he noticed increased violent
        activity which may have been other explosive type events leading
        to several new observed accretion rings. Could it be that
        Hodowanec observed what Hawking theorizes as the eventual
        evaporation of a black-hole --- complete with the antecedent
        conditions? Continued periodic scanning of this region (the last
        in January 1998) by Hodowanec continue to show much debris,
        perhaps coalescing to form another black hole? The gravity-winds
        (gravity-wave fluctuations measured by Hodowanec) continue to
        show a greatly increased level in the universe gravity-wave
        background (the G-field equivalent of the Electromagnetic
        Universe Microwave Background Radiation?)] </p>
      <p><b>E. Some Asides and Connotations</b> </p>
      <p>In this section, I will comment on some experiments and
        observations, by myself and some colleagues, as well as some
        experiments and observations by other researchers. The comments
        are from the viewpoint of Rhysmonics and will be in no
        particular order… only as it comes to mind. </p>
      <p><b>(1) Gravitational Speed vs Light Speed</b> </p>
      <p>The fundamental velocity (speed) in Rhysmonics is represented
        by C*, the Planck Velocity. This is essentially the velocity of
        a single directed vector in the basic rhysmonic cell and it is
        equal to L*/T* (L* = 1.616<sup>-33</sup> cm; T* = 5.391<sup>-44</sup>
        sec; so L*/T* = 2.997<sup>10</sup> cm/sec = C* = C) for a single
        directed vector in the finite Rhysmonic world, however, also the
        velocity C of propagation in the macro world [Coincidence or
        theoretical evidence for the origin of the constant C?]. It is
        noted that, in the Universal G-field, the velocity (or speed) of
        the gravitational flux is simply: </p>
      <p>NL* / T* </p>
      <p>Where n is the number of unit vectors in the linear summation
        of the vectors, head-to-tail, For example, the single unit
        vector in has a velocity (or speed) of 1L*/T* or C*. However,
        two (2) unit vectors (head-to-tail) would now have a velocity of
        2L*/T*, or 2C*; three vectors, 3L*/T*, or 3C*, and so on. Put
        another way, gravitational effects are propagated any distance
        the unity (the oneness) of our universe, and especially in
        gravity signal astronomy. </p>
      <p>This is also a most important aspect when deep space
        communications are needed! With respect to the velocity of light
        (for EM waves), while the velocity C* (or C) is involved, the
        situation is quite different . The propagation of gravitation is
        a linear effect or a longitudinal (straight line) wave of
        infinite length and thus more aptly termed a gravitational
        impulse. Light or electromagnetic waves are a transverse effect
        where repeated reversals of the polarity of the electric and
        magnetic components occur in the propagation process. The
        electric (E) and magnetic (H) components are actually sustained
        by the universal G-field. This involves a time component of T,
        which is independent of the frequency, wavelength or amplitudes
        involved in this process. Also, the field reversals (of E- and
        H-) can take place only in the time frame of T, since this is
        also the existence time frame for the universe. Therefore, in
        the case of EM wave propagation, the rate of propagation will be
        this constant velocity (or speed) of L*/T* or C. This holds only
        in the undisturbed aether where L* and T* are constant. However,
        in the presence of other particles or fields, these constants
        could change and thus the velocity of light (i.e., EM waves)
        would also change. There is much more to be learned here. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Position in the Universe</b> </p>
      <p>Since in Rhysmonics the universe is but a ‘fixed’ collection of
        rhysmonic cells, it will have a physical center in this
        spherical collection of cells. The physical center can be
        expected to have a very high density of structures very much as
        most galaxies appear to have. In fact, several Gravity signal
        tests made seem to show two or three extremely sense objects in
        the direction of Leo, which also appear to be moving quite
        rapidly about each other around a common center of gravity. This
        could well be black-hole type structures in the suspected
        physical center of our universe. Such a third dimension universe
        would have other connotations, some of which I have observed but
        will not relate here. </p>
      <p>Of more interest to you could be another aspect of this type of
        structure from the viewpoint of our third dimensional universe.
        Consider a man located at any point on the 60 degree angle of
        the universe-wide instantaneous vector shown in Figure 3. If
        that person had Gravitational field eyes, he would be able to
        see the back of his head instantly. This would also be true at
        any position at any position in the universe and at any angle
        whatsoever he made with respect to that center. While mankind
        does not have Gravitational eyes, mankind does have a mind which
        has so-called free will. Therefore, a person can make a physical
        movement of a mass (at will) and thus affect the universe-wide
        instantaneous vectors in any direction and, therefore, will also
        affect the inertia of the rhysmonic field in that direction. The
        rhysmoid (aether), being a perfect machine, will reflect
        geometrically from the edge of the universe in numerable
        reflections and then return instantly to the moving source mass
        making the disturbance at that point. One can look at this
        effect as being a rhysmonic clothes line with loss-less pulleys
        (See Figure 3). Thus a pull at the front of the mass will result
        in a push (at the same time) at the back of the mass. This
        process is involved in any mass movement or field movement in
        the universe. </p>
      <p>Fortunately, we now have rhysmonic (aether)movement detectors
        (i.e., gravity-wave detectors) capable of sensing changes in the
        Universe G-field, primarily as it affects the earth’s g-field.
        Use of the earth’s g-field in this detection process results in
        a sort of fine tuning where we will observe only those effects
        which are in line with the earth’s g-field. Fortunately also, we
        have been able to test this hypothesis. Since the earth is
        rotating on its axis, any new disturbance (controlled by free
        will in a definite pattern) will modulate (create an interaction
        with) the universe-wide vectors and thus be detected by these
        g-field detectors; primarily as a chopping disturbance of an
        apparent ~ 0.25 cm standing wave structure in the aether
        (believed to be due to a summation of all the other mass
        disturbances in the universe). </p>
      <p>Now, if this disturbance is coded in some fashion, say as 2 Hz
        pulses spaced 30 seconds apart, then the aether at that location
        will be disturbed at the rate of the earth’s rotation. This
        disturbance will be sustained by the Universal G-fields, but
        will eventually be destroyed or weakened by other Universe
        G-field actions. [Note: Likely not a decaying but more like
        being overridden or swamped]. That this appears to be so was
        demonstrated in many so-called pendulum tests and other tests
        reported in the past. This is the so-called mass movement test
        (movement with respect to the fixed aether). </p>
      <p>It is believed that Tesla saw this effect in Colorado
        experiments using lightning (and thunder?) as the disturbance
        source. However, his detection system (at the turn of the
        century) was rather crude [insensitive]. As some of you know, I
        used this principle in some gravity signaling tests using Morse
        code mass modulations more than ten years ago. I was able to
        record the code modulations up to 20 miles away. [At his home,
        Hodowanec connected the output of his detector to a tape
        recorder. Then he got in his car and slowly drove straight away
        sending mile markers at various distances by moving, in pendulum
        style, a several pound lead weight held in his free hand; thus
        forming the dots and dashes of numbers corresponding to
        distances.] </p>
      <p>However, Bill Ramsay was able to demonstrate a far more elegant
        test using field movements instead of mass movements. Basically,
        Bill used the oscillator made of my gravity detectors to
        generate a modulation of the universe-wide G-field vectors at
        his Earth location. The modulations were most likely provided by
        the inductors of the oscillators. [Clarification: The
        oscillators were R-C type, no inductors, but the outputs were
        connected to amplified speakers. Thus inductance was involved.]
        Bill modified the oscillators to have a desired decay time and
        tuned a number of oscillators to a musical scale. Thus, his
        signals were musical tones. Bill provided his oscillators with a
        keyboard and summed [mixed] the outputs to an audio audio
        amplifier. Thus, in effect, he had a Cosmic Organ! When Bill
        played a simple tune on his cosmic organ, the inductors [in the
        speakers] would modulate the G-fields at his location. Now since
        the earth was rotating, the ditty or tune was stored in time in
        the aether in the process discussed before. Now when Bill ceased
        his playing, the universe would keep on playing his tune! Much
        as in the other (Gravity-wave) universe modulation tests, it
        would so for hours (although Bill tape-recorded the play back
        for only 90minutes or so). Eventually, the high notes would
        distort, but the main range of about 100 Hz to 1 KHz in the
        scale would remain relatively unchanged. Of course, the universe
        contains other responses in this range which would tend to
        weaken or destroy his modulation; but Bill has recorded many
        hours of the universe’s own melodies in his particular location
        (now Grand Junction, CO). </p>
      <p>Another aspect considered is with respect to EM responses in
        the aether, especially those of visible light frequencies. It
        had bee pointed out in rhysmonics that the universe that the
        universe is a finite spherical black body with perfect radiation
        at the edge of this universe. Thus all persons on the inside of
        the universe could consider the inside edge as a perfect
        spherical mirror. It is speculated that, as such, any position
        in the universe could be considered as the center of the optical
        universe! This could have may connotations, but one which I have
        already used was using this concept in explaining quasars. </p>
      <p><b>(3) Rotational Fields in the Aether</b> </p>
      <p>In the planar depiction of the pure (undisturbed) aether shown
        in Figure 1, it is seen that linear and rotational forces are
        fundamental t the structure of the aether. However, due to the
        presence of some other forces, primarily field movements (due to
        mass movements or mass shadows) there will be introduced
        curvilinear motions or other distortions in the aether. Here I
        will mention only some rotary effects due to rotational forces
        inherent in the aether. </p>
      <p>Rotational effects are rampant in the universe but all else can
        be related to the basic elements as shown in Figure 1, 2, and 3.
        For example, the earth rotates on its axis, the moon rotates
        around the earth and the earth rotates around the sun. Spiral
        galaxies are in rotation about a common center and probably
        families of galaxies rotate about a common center also. Perhaps
        even the universe is in rotation but that would have to be
        relative to possible other universes somewhere out there? All
        this is on a large scale, but microscopically, rotation is also
        rampant. For example, rhysmonics postulates that for a particle
        (which is but a collection or arrangement of rhysmons) to move
        relative to the fixed aether, the particle must be a vortex in
        that structure. The movement is made only by transferring linear
        and rotational forces to a vortex in that structure. The
        movement is made only by transferring linear and rotational
        forces to adjacent basic cell structures, since the basic cells
        are not able to move as entities in themselves! Therefore, while
        the basic structure is quite simple, other forces and structures
        in this basic medium can be quite complicated! However, in this
        paper I will point out only a few of the many observed
        phenomenon in our third dimensional universe which can be
        explained with four dimensional rhysmonic viewpoint. </p>
      <p>All energy (E*) in the universe comes basically from the short
        unit cell vectors as shown in Figure 1. Here E* = M* C* = 2.177<sup>-5</sup>
        gm x (2.997145<sup>10</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/sec)= 1.96<sup>16</sup>
        ergs. </p>
      <p>Also: </p>
      <p>E* = A*/T* = action/time = 1/054<sup>-27</sup> erg-sec/5.391<sup>-44</sup>
        sec = 1.96<sup>16</sup> ergs, where A* = <strike>h</strike>,
        Planck’s reduced constant. </p>
      <p>In a similar manner, the momentum (P*) of a single directed
        rhysmonic vector is: </p>
      <p>P* = M* x C* = 2.177<sup>-5</sup> gm x 2.997<sup>10</sup>
        cm/sec = 6.35<sup>5</sup> gm-cm/sec, </p>
      <p>while the (F*) of this vector is: </p>
      <p>F* = E*/L* = 1.96<sup>16</sup> ergs/1.616<sup>-33</sup> cm =
        1.21<sup>49</sup> dynes! </p>
      <p>In the undisturbed aether these energies are essentially
        canceled [or are in balance?] in the aether structure and thus
        are not normally seen or available energy. Rhysmonics appears to
        show that only a small amount of external perturbation energy
        may be needed to make that energy available to us in the third
        dimensional universe! While this energy is being extracted in
        innumerable ways in both technology as well as in lifeforms
        (e.g., bionics), I will mention only a few of rotational force
        effects from technology here. </p>
      <p><b>a. Angular Momentum Effects</b> </p>
      <p>Angular momentum in our third dimensional universe is best
        noted in the so-called flywheel effect. This is well studied in
        conventional mechanics in terms of the practical flywheel, the
        gyroscope and many other rotary devices. Here, I will try to
        simply explain the mechanism in terms of rhysmonics. While in
        our third dimensional universe we see an actual rotation of a
        physical mass within the reference frame of a room, this
        rotation is actually in relation to the fixed aether! Moreover,
        the fixed aether is not in actual rotation, only an energy
        effect is being added to the circumferential vectors for these
        rotational effects. Should we move our reference frame such as
        to a car, a plane, or a ship, the energy storage in the flywheel
        (or gyro) will also move through the fixed aether but the same
        energy transfer process still exists. Therefore, rotational
        forces can store large amounts of energy in the directed vectors
        of the aether. However, this stored energy is but a tiny
        fraction of the energy available in the basic rhysmonic directed
        vector. </p>
      <p>Another interesting aspect here is if the flywheel (which could
        be the rotor of a motor) is kept in a fixed position in fixed
        reference frame (e.g., a room) the aether storage effect will
        persist for some extent in time even if the flywheel is slowed
        down or stopped. When start-up is performed reasonably soon
        after stoppage, it should be able to restart the rotation at
        much lower energy levels! Is this the Aspden Effect? [Apparently
        the Aspden Effect is stronger if the rotor uses magnets.] It
        should be remembered that such persistence of motion (i.e.,
        inertia) is typical of our rhysmonic universe and it is
        sustained by the universal G-fields. </p>
      <p>That such rotational effects are with respect to the overall
        universe fixed aether is verified in many third-dimensional
        tests; e.g., gyro compasses, the Foucault Pendulum, as well as
        numerous flywheel-type tests. The miniature flywheels in
        permanent magnets and various bionic functions seem to affirm
        these postulates. It would be interesting to investigate the
        homopolar generator from this viewpoint. Rhysmonics does appear
        to confirm such linear and rotational energy effects in many
        experiments, reported and unreported. There is room for much
        research here! I have released information on these aspects in
        the past. </p>
      <p><b>4. Miscellaneous Other Asides</b> </p>
      <p>Now I will remark on certain items which reflect on the
        rhysmonic approach to the nature of our universe. I will include
        not only items of mine but also a few developed b other
        researchers in the literature. </p>
      <p><b>(a) Relativity in Rhysmonics</b> </p>
      <p>Theories of relative motion have been around for hundreds of
        years but the Einstein version developed around the turn of the
        20th is the most published (and thus known). In rhysmonics,
        relative motion is quite simple, it is motion with respect to
        the fixed (i.e., stationary) aether! I have already considered
        some aspects on this concept but will elaborate a bit more here.
        We can determine this relative motion by comparing the motion in
        a frame of reference which moves as a unit through the aether.
        Such a frame ius expressed in a location which has no apparent
        motion, such as a room or laboratory area. Here, the area is
        really in motion with respect to the aether. However, that
        motion would be apparent only to another observer, say one on
        the sun where the motion of Earth in its journey through space,
        including its rotation, would be readily noted. But locally it
        is a fixed frame of reference (i.e., Galilean) to an observer in
        that lab or room! However, any other additional movement in that
        area will be, in fact, a recognizable motion through the fixed
        aether. </p>
      <p>This has been verified in many of my rhysmonic experiments.
        Simple experiments which were observed many times in the past
        also demonstrated this concept. For example, an
        electrically-charged item at rest in this lab or room will have
        only an observed so-called static charge. However, if we move
        this charge in relation to this reference frame and charge
        sensing device, the charge will also be moved with respect to
        the fixed aether! Now, a least two responses will be observed:
        (1) the moving charge will develop a linear flux field movement
        which, while more difficult to observe, is also observed with
        more specialized test methods. </p>
      <p>Another experiment is n the traditional magnet and coil test.
        Here it does not matter if the magnet is moved or the coil is
        moved --- induction currents in the coil are developed! This is
        due to the fact that a relative flux movement is involved in
        either case, and it is that flux which causes electron flow in
        the coil. Therefore, in rhysmonics, any real movement within the
        Stationary Aether will result in effects which can be observed
        with the proper instrumentation. Understanding this concept is
        fundamental in rhysmonic theory. </p>
      <p><b>(b)&nbsp; Casimir Force in Rhysmonics</b> </p>
      <p>There is much in the literature on this effect which appears
        mainly as a closing or attractive force between two closely
        spaced metal or other high-density plates. While current
        emphasis is on EM forces or zero-point energy forces, rhysmonics
        postulates this to be just a gravitational effect, due to the
        geometry of the test elements. The source of the force here is
        the Universal G-fields! Due to the geometry, these Universal
        G-fields are shielded largely in the direction at right angles
        to the plane of these plates, and very little shielding is
        present in the same plane as the plates. This is the normal
        G-field effect, similar to that similar to that between the
        Earth and a body near its surface. However, again due to the
        geometry, the so-called Casimir Force is quite detectable in the
        form that most of these tests were made. However, as seen here,
        this force is gravitational and not any new force in nature! </p>
      <p><b>(c) Charge Clusters in Rhysmonics</b> </p>
      <p>I do not have much background in so-called charge clusters (as
        mentioned by Shoulders and others) but I do have some doubts
        that clusters of electrons are involved. From the Rhysmonic
        point of view, such massive charge clusters may exist, but they
        are super particles, being much the same as electrons and
        protons are (in rhysmonics) as densely or loosely packed
        rhysmonic clusters! Perhaps these clusters are vortices in
        nature and thus stable to some extent and may even carry an
        excess charge. To be negative in charge, the charge cluster
        would be essentially a large hole, so to speak, in the aether.
        Again, all this is only conjecture on my part as, at this time,
        I have not really looked at the reported charge clusters and
        their effects. </p>
      <p><b>(d) G-Fields and Weather Patterns</b> </p>
      <p>I had predicted that our Earth was due for an extended period
        of unusual weather patterns since (in December 1986) dramatic
        changes were noted at our Galaxy Center (GC). Since then other
        changes were noted at the GC and also other areas of our
        universe using gravity signal astronomy techniques. These
        changes are believed to be due to gravity winds, i.e.,
        rotational (motional!) aetheric fields! Recently, January 6 to
        9, 1999, it was noticed that in using an ordinary electronic
        weight scale as a gravimeter, that there was a relatively good
        correlation between my weight variances and positions of the
        northern jet stream. For example, my weight is nominally 163
        pounds. Yet, in that time period, where weather patterns were
        crazy, my scale weight varied between 150 and 170 pounds! It
        should be emphasized here that the scales must be of the Hooke’s
        Law type, i.e., springs [or load cells but not balance types]
        are used. In general, my weight was 150 pounds when the northern
        jet stream plunged down as far as Alabama and Florida and 170
        pounds then this jet stream was far north in Canada. [That is a
        12-13% change! Can this be accounted for, by any combination of
        the usual mundane factors?] </p>
      <p>Apparently, some effects in space were causing gravity winds
        which affected our G-fields here on Earth and thus the jet
        stream (and our weather patterns)! I had reported ion this many
        times in the past, but this is the first time I noted such good
        correlations. This is an easy test for you to make. Many of you
        may have such electronic scales and jet stream patterns are
        given daily in most TV news programs and in some newspapers. It
        appears tp be real here (New jersey), but verification by others
        would be nice! </p>
      <p><b>F. Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>I wish to restate that the purpose of this Note was to convey
        to you some additional thoughts of mine and also to clarify some
        earlier thoughts. I again apologize for the literary roughness
        of this presentation. However, I hope it was of some interest to
        you. As always, mu reports to you are not intended to be dogma
        but only as an effort to try to hold your interest in this
        cosmology, which I strongly believe has merit for more
        investigation by others. Good theorizing and experimenting to
        all! </p>
      <p><b>Epilogue</b> </p>
      <p>As you know all my efforts and writings are placed into the
        Public Domain and thus are available to all to use as they see
        fit. Now in this so-called information age, with the Internet,
        there may also be some mis-information and dis-information
        circulating. In particular, I am Greg Hodowanec Sr., and now in
        my 78 th year of life. There is also a Greg Jr, but he should
        not be confused in any way with this effort; it is mine alone.
        The problem with the computer is that it cannot think; it only
        knows what is programmed into it. Thus, all that is programmed
        is not necessarily true to the real facts or even identified
        properly. Take care please! </p>
