        <p><b>Separation of a compressed gas into a hot stream and a
            cold stream</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The vortex tube, also known as the Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube,
        is a mechanical device that separates a compressed gas into hot
        and cold streams. It has no moving parts. </p>
      <p>Pressurized gas is injected tangentially into a swirl chamber
        and accelerates to a high rate of rotation. Due to the conical
        nozzle at the end of the tube, only the outer shell of the
        compressed gas is allowed to escape at that end. The remainder
        of the gas is forced to return in an inner vortex of reduced
        diameter within the outer vortex. </p>
      <p>There are different explanations for the effect and there is
        debate on which explanation is best or correct. </p>
      <p>What is usually agreed upon is that the air in the tube
        experiences mostly "solid body rotation", which simply means the
        rotation rate (angular velocity) of the inner gas is the same as
        that of the outer gas. This is different from what most consider
        standard vortex behaviour--where inner fluid spins at a higher
        rate than outer fluid. The (mostly) solid body rotation is
        probably due to the long time which each parcel of air remains
        in the vortex--allowing friction between the inner parcels and
        outer parcels to have a notable effect. </p>
      <p>It is also usually agreed upon that there is a slight effect of
        hot air wanting to "rise" toward the center, but this effect is
        negligible--especially if turbulence is kept to a minimum. </p>
      <p>One simple explanation is that the outer air is under higher
        pressure than the inner air (because of centrifugal force).
        Therefore the temperature of the outer air is higher than that
        of the inner air. </p>
      <p>Another explanation is that as both vortices rotate at the same
        angular velocity and direction, the inner vortex has lost
        angular momentum. The decrease of angular momentum is
        transferred as kinetic energy to the outer vortex, resulting in
        separated flows of hot and cold gas.[1] </p>
      <p>This is somewhat analogous to a Peltier effect device, which
        uses electrical pressure (voltage) to move heat to one side of a
        dissimilar metal junction, causing the other side to grow cold.
      </p>
      <p>When used to refrigerate, heat-sinking the whole vortex tube is
        helpful. Vortex tubes can also be cascaded. The cold (or hot)
        output of one can be used to pre-cool (or pre-heat) the air
        supply to another vortex tube. Cascaded tubes can be used, for
        example, to produce cryogenic temperatures. </p>
      <p><b>History</b> </p>
      <p>The vortex tube was invented in 1933 by French physicist
        Georges J. Ranque. German physicist Rudolf Hilsch improved the
        design and published a widely read paper in 1947 on the device,
        which he called a Wirbelrohr (literally, whirl pipe).[2] Vortex
        tubes also seem to work with liquids to some extent.[3] </p>
      <p><b>Efficiency</b> </p>
      <p>Vortex tubes have lower efficiency than traditional air
        conditioning equipment. They are commonly used for inexpensive
        spot cooling, when compressed air is available. Commercial
        models are designed for industrial applications to produce a
        temperature drop of about 45 °C (80 °F). </p>
      <p><b>Proposed applications</b> </p>
      <p>* Dave Williams, of dissigno, has proposed using vortex tubes
        to make ice in third-world countries. Although the technique is
        inefficient, Williams expressed hope that vortex tubes could
        yield helpful results in areas where using electricity to create
        ice is not an option. </p>
      <p>* There are industrial applications that result in unused
        pressurized gases. Using vortex tube energy separation may be a
        method to recover waste pressure energy from high and low
        pressure sources.[4] </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Vortex Tubes - Sub-Zero Spot Cooling from
              Compressed Air</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Vortex Tubes are an effective, low cost solution to a wide
        variety of industrial spot cooling and process cooling needs.
        With no moving parts, a vortex tube spins compressed air to
        separate the air into cold and hot air streams. While French
        physicist Georges Ranque is credited with inventing the vortex
        tube in 1930, Vortec was the first company to develop and apply
        this phenomenon into practical and effective spot cooling
        solutions for industrial use. </p>
      <p><b>Vortex Tube Applications:</b> </p>
      <p>Vortex Tubes have a very wide range of application for
        industrial spot cooling on machines, assembly lines and
        processes. </p>
      <p># Cool Machining Operations <br>
        # Set solders and adhesives <br>
        # Cool plastic injection molds <br>
        # Dry ink on labels and bottles <br>
        # Dehumidify gas operations <br>
        # Cool heat seal operations <br>
        # Thermal test sensors and choke units <br>
        # Cool cutter blades <br>
        # Temperature cycle parts </p>
      <p><b>How a Vortex Tube Works</b> </p>
      <p>Fluid (air) that rotates around an axis (like a tornado) is
        called a vortex. A Vortex Tube creates cold air and hot air by
        forcing compressed air through a generation chamber which spins
        the air centrifugally along the inner walls of the Tube at a
        high rate of speed (1,000,000 RPM) toward the control valve. A
        percentage of the hot, high-speed air is permitted to exit at
        the control valve. The remainder of the (now slower) air stream
        is forced to counterflow up through the center of the high-speed
        air stream, giving up heat, through the center of the generation
        chamber finally exiting through the opposite end as extremely
        cold air. Vortex tubes generate temperatures down to 100°F below
        inlet air temperature. A control valve located in the hot
        exhaust end can be used to adjust the temperature drop and rise
        for all Vortex Tubes. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;Vortex Tubes Features &amp; Benefits</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp; • Vortex Tubes use only compressed air for spot cooling-
        no electricity or refrigerants are required </p>
      <p>• Vortex Tubes are maintenance free - Since Vortex Tubes have
        no moving parts there is no maintence required </p>
      <p>Vortex Tubes are Exceptionally reliable </p>
      <p>Vortex Tubes are Compact and lightweight </p>
      <p>Vortex Tube technologoy is Cycle repeatablity with ± 1 ° </p>
      <p>Vortex Tubes from Vortec drops inlet temperature by up to 100°F
        providing exceptional spot cooling </p>

      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>Based on the models of Scheper, Lewins, and
        Bejan, a new model has been established to study the influence
        of the cold mass flow fraction on the temperature separation
        effect in a vortex tube. The model is based on making an analogy
        between the vortex tube and a counterflow heat exchanger. The
        results show the model can accurately explain the correlation of
        cold mass flow fraction to the temperature separation effect. </p>

      <p>The following may be relevant to the Potapov device. </p>

        &amp; subtle questions in physics," by Mark P. Silverman,

        roar". </p>
      <p>[BILL B. NOTE: also see Scientific American, November 1958 for
        a Hilsch-tube construction article in Stong's THE AMATEUR
        SCIENTIST] </p>
      <p>"It was a Wirbelrohr, he explained; you blew into the stem, and
        out one end of the cross-tube flowed hot air, while cold air
        flowed out the other. I laughed; I was certain he was teasing
        me. Although I had never heard of a Wirbelrohr, I recognised a
        Maxwell demon when it was described." </p>
      <p>"...he machined in his basement workshop a working model which
        I received from him shortly afterwards. The exterior was more or
        less just as he had described it: two identical long thin-walled
        tubes (the cross-bar of the T), were connected by cylindrical
        collars screwed into each end of a short section of pipe that
        formed the central chamber; a gas inlet nozzle (the stem of the
        T), shorter than the other two tubes but otherwise of identical
        construction, joined the midsection tangentially (Fig. 6.1).
        Externally, except for a throttling valve at the far end of one
        output tube to control air flow, the entire device manifested
        bilateral symmetry with respect to a plane through the nozzle
        perpendicular to the cross-tubes. </p>
      <p>"Only someone with the lung capacity of Hercules could actually
        blow into the stem. Instead, the nozzle was meant to be attached
        to a source of compressed air. Taking the Wirbelrohr into my
        laboratory, I looked sceptically for a moment at its symmetrical
        shape before opening the valve by my work table that started the
        flow of room-temperature compressed air. Then, with frost
        forming on the outside surface of one tube, I yelped with pain
        and astonishment when, touching the other tube, I burned my
        fingers!" </p>
      <p>"...With the few parts of the Wirbelrohr laid out on my table,
        I understood better the significance of the German name,
        Wirbelrohr, or vortex tube. The heart of the device is the
        central chamber with a spiral cavity and offset nozzle.
        Compressed gas entering this chamber streams around the walls of
        the cavity in a high-speed vortex. But what gives rise to
        spatially separated air currents at different temperatures?
        ...the placement in one cross-tube (the cold one) of a
        small-aperture diaphragm effectively blocked the efflux of gas
        along the walls of the tube, thereby forcing this part of the
        air flow to exit through the other arm whose cross-section was
        unconstrained. <br>

      <p>Room-temperature compressed air enters the inlet tube, spirals
        around the central chamber, and exits through the 'hot' pipe
        with unconstrained cross-section or through the 'cold' pipe
        whose aperture is restricted&nbsp; by a diaphragm. </p>
      <p>[BILLB: the 'hot' tube should be partially blocked, with either
        a valve, or even better, a narrow ring-slot that lets air near
        the inner surface escape.] </p>
      <p>"The glimmer of a potential mechanism dawned on me. Had the in-
        coming air conserved angular momentum, the rotational frequency
        of air molecules nearest the axis of the central chamber would
        be higher - as would also be the corresponding rotational
        kinetic energy - than peripheral layers of air. However,
        internal friction between gas layers comprising the vortex would
        tend to establish a constant angular velocity throughout the
        cross-section of the chamber. In other words, each layer of gas
        within the vortex would exert a tangential force upon the next
        outer layer, thereby doing work upon it at the expense of its
        internal energy (while at the same time receiving kinetic energy
        from the preceding inner layer). Energy would consequently flow
        from the center radially outward to the walls generating a
        system with a low-pressure, cooled axial region and a
        high-pressure, heated circumferential region. Because of the
        diaphragm, the cooler axial air had to exit one tube (the cold
        side), whereas a mixture of axial and peripheral air exited the
        other (the hot side). </p>
      <p>"The presence of the throttling valve on the hot side now made
        sense. If the low pressure of the air nearest the axis of the
        tube fell below atmospheric pressure, the cold air would not
        exit at all...By throttling the flow, pressure within the
        central chamber was increased sufficiently so that air could
        exit both tubes. </p>
      <p>"...with some simplifying assumptions I was able to calculate
        the entropy change... Under what is termed adiabatic conditions
        - i.e. with no heat exchange with the environment - the 2nd Law
        requires that the entropy change of the gas, alone, be &gt;=
        zero. The resulting mathematical expression, augmented by the
        equation of state of an ideal diatomic gas and the conservation
        of energy (1st Law) yields an inequality: </p>
      <p>(x^f)[(1-fx)/(1-f)]^(1-f) &gt;= (Pf/Pi)^(2/7) </p>
      <p>where x= Tc/Ti <br>
        Tc is temperature of cold air <br>
        Ti is initial temperature <br>
        Pf is the final pressure <br>
        Pi is the initial pressure <br>
        f is the fraction of gas directed thru the cold side </p>
      <p>"By setting the expression for the entropy change equal to
        zero, I could calculate the lowest temperature that the cold
        tube should be able to reach if the gas flow were an ideal
        reversible process. The result was astonishing. With an input
        pressure of 10 atmospheres and the throttling set for a fraction
        f= 0.3, compressed air at room temperature (20 C) could in
        principle be cooled to about -258 C, a mere 15 degrees above
        absolute zero! (The corresponding temperature of the hot side
        would have been 80 C.) </p>
      <p>"...The first experimental demonstation of a vortex tube seems
        to have been reported in 1933 by a French engineer, Georges
        Ranque [1]. by German physicist Rudolph Hilsch came to the
        attention of American chemist R.M. Milton... In Hilsch's hands,
        proper selection of the air fraction f (~ .33) and an input
        pressure of a few atmospheres gave rise to an amazing output of
        200 C at the hot end and -50 C at the cold end[2]. Hilsch, who
        was the one to coin the term Wirbelrohr, used the tube in place
        of an ammonia pre-cooling apparatus in a machine to liquify air.
      </p>
      <p>"...Milton was not satisfied with the interpretation of Hilsch
        and Ranque that frictional loss of kinetic energy produced the
        radial temperature distribution...." </p>
      <p>M Kurosaka, et al [3,4], in 1982, proposed a far different
        mechanism, supported by experiment. </p>
      <p>"With a loud roar air rushes turbulently thru the Wirbelrohr,
        just as it does thru a jet engine or a vacuum cleaner. Buried
        within that roar, however, is a pure tone, a "vortex whistle" as
        it has been called...the vortex whistle can be produced by
        tangential introduction and swirling of gas in a stationary
        tube. It is this pure tone that is purportedly responsible for
        the spectacular separation of temperature in a vortex tube. </p>
      <p>"The Ranque-Hilsch effect is a steady-state phenomenon - i.e.
        an effect that survives averaging over time. How can a
        high-pitch whistle - a sound that, depending on air velocity and
        cavity geometry, can be on the order of a few kilohertz -
        influence the steady component of flow? The answer...was by
        'acoustic streaming'. As a result of a small nonlinear
        convection term in the fluid equation of motion, an acoustic
        wave can act back upon the steady flow and modify its properties
        substantially. In the absence of unsteady disturbances, the air
        flows in a 'free' vortex around the axis of the tube; the speed
        of the air is close to zero at the center (like a hurricane),
        increases to a maximum at mid-radius, and drops to a small value
        near the walls. Acoustic streaming, however, deforms the free
        vortex into a 'forced' vortex where the air speed increases
        linearly from the center to the periphery. Acoustic streaming
        and the production of a forece vortex, rather than mere static
        centrifugation, engender the Ranque-Hilsch effect. </p>
      <p>"The experimental test could not be more direct. Remove the
        whistle, and only the whistle, and see whether the radial
        temperature distribution remains. To do this [Kurosaka]
        monitored the entireroar with a microphone and ...decomposed it
        into frequencies of which the discrete component of the lowest
        frequency and largestamplitude was identified as the vortex
        whistle. Next, he enclosed the Wirbelrohr inside a tunable
        acoustic suppressor: a cylindrical section of Teflon with
        radially drilled holes serving as acoustic cavities distributed
        uniformly around the circumference. Inside each hole was a small
        tuning rod that could be inserted until it touched the outer
        shell of the Wirbelrohr to close off the cavity, or withdrawn
        incrementally to make the cavity resonant at the specified
        frequency to be suppressed. </p>
      <p>"To simplify the experimental test, he sealed off one output of
        the vortex tube and monitored with thermocouples the temperature
        difference between the center and periphery. In the absence of
        the suppressor, an increase in pressure produced, as I had
        noticed when experimenting with my own vortex tube, a louder
        roar and greater temperature difference. When, however, the
        acoustic cavity was adjusted to suppress only the frequency of
        the vortex whistle (leaving unaffected the rest of the turbulent
        noise), the temperature difference plunged precipitously at the
        instant the corresponding input air pressure was reached. In one
        such trial, the centerline temperature jumped 33 C, from -50 C
        to -17 C. With further increase in pressure, the frequency of
        the whistle rose, and as it exceeded the narrow band of the
        acoustic suppressor, the temperature difference increased again.
      </p>
      <p>"Additional evidence came from a striking transformation in the
        nature of the flow...Before the vortex whistle was suppressed,
        the exhaust air swirled rapidly near and outside the tube
        periphery in the manner expected for a forced vortex. Upon
        supprssion, however, the forced vortex was also abruptly
        suppressed; now quiescent at the periphery, the air rushed out
        close to the centerline." </p>
      <p>"For all I know, the case of the mysterious Wirbelrohr is
        largely closed although, science being what it is, future
        version of that device may yet hold some suprises in store. I
        have sometimes wondered, for example, what would result from
        supplying a vortex tube, not with room-temperature air, but with
        a quantum fluid, like liquid helium, free of viscosity and
        friction. </p>
      <p>The exorcism of the demon in the Wirbelrohr will not, I
        suspect, dampen one bit the ardour of those whose passion it is
        to challenge the 2nd Law. Despite the time and effort that has
        been frittered away in the past, others will undoubtedly try
        again. On the whole such schemes are bound to fail, but every so
        often, as in the case of Maxwell's own whimsical creation, this
        failure has its positive side: when, from the clash between
        human ingenuity and the laws of nature, there emerge sounder
        knowledge and deeper understanding." </p>

        With nothing more than a few pieces of plumbing and a source of
        compressed air, you can build a remarkably simple device for
        attaining moderately low temperatures. It separates high-energy
        molecules from those of low energy. George O. Smith, an engineer
        of Rumson, N. I., discusses its theory and construction
        <p>The 19th century British physicist James Clerk Maxwell made
          many deep contributions to physics, and among the most
          significant was his law of random distribution. Considering.
          the case of a closed box containing a gas, Maxwell started off
          by saying that the temperature of the gas was due to the
          motion of the individual gas molecules within the box. But
          since the box was standing still, it stood to reason that the
          summation of the velocity and direction of the individual gas
          molecules must come to zero. </p>
        <p>In essence Maxwell's law of random distribution says that for
          every gas molecule headed east at 20 miles per hour, there
          must be another headed west at the same speed. Furthermore, if
          the heat of the gas indicates that the average velocity of the
          molecules is 20 miles per hour, the number of molecules moving
          slower than this speed must be equaled by the number of
          molecules moving faster. </p>
        <p>After a serious analysis of the consequences of his law,
          Maxwell permitted himself a touch of humor. He suggested that
          there was a statistical probability that; at some time in the
          future, all the molecules in a box of gas or a glass of hot
          water might be moving in the same direction. This would cause
          the water to rise out of the glass. Next Maxwell suggested
          that a system of drawing both hot and cold water out of a
          single pipe might be devised if we could capture a small demon
          and train him to open and close a tiny valve. The demon would
          open the valve only when a fast molecule approached it, and
          close the valve against slow molecules. The water coming out
          of the valve would thus be hot. To produce a stream of cold
          water the demon would open the valve only for slow molecules.
        </p>
        <p>Maxwell's demon would circumvent the law of thermodynamics
          which says in essence: "You can't get something for nothing."
          That is to say, one cannot separate cold water from hot
          without doing work. Thus when physicists heard that the
          Germans had developed a device which could achieve low
          temperatures by utilizing Maxwell's demon, they were
          intrigued, though obviously skeptical. One physicist
          investigated the matter at first hand for the U. S. Navy. He
          discovered that the device was most ingenious, though not
          quite as miraculous as had been rumored. </p>

        <b>234</b>
        <p>It consists of a T-shaped assembly of pipe joined by a novel
          fitting, as depicted in Figure 234. when compressed air is
          admitted to the "leg" of the T, hot air comes out of one arm
          of the T and cold air out of the other arm! Obviously,
          however, work must be done to compress the air. </p>
        <p>The origin of the device is obscure. The principle is said to
          have been discovered by a Frenchman who left some early
          experimental models in the path of the German Army when France
          was occupied. These were turned over to a German physicist
          named Rudolf Hilsch, who was working on low temperature
          refrigerating devices for the German war effort. Hilsch made
          some improvements on the Frenchman's design, but found that it
          was no more efficient than conventional methods of
          refrigeration in achieving fairly low temperatures.
          Subsequently the device became known as the Hilsch tube. </p>

        </center>
        <b>235</b>
        <p>The Hilsch tube may be constructed from a pair of modified
          nuts and associated parts as shown in Figure 235. The
          horizontal arm of the T-shaped fitting contains a specially
          machined piece, the outside of which fits inside the arm. The
          inside of the piece, however, has a cross section which is
          spiral with respect to the outside. In the "step" of the
          spiral is a small opening which is connected to the leg of the
          T Thus air admitted to the leg comes out of the opening and
          spins around the one-turn spiral. The "hot" pipe is about 14
          inches long and has an inside diameter of half an inch. The
          far end of this pipe is fitted with a stopcock which can be
          used to control the pressure in the system [see Fig. 236]. </p>

        <p>The "cold" pipe is about four inches long and also has an
          inside diameter of half an inch. The end of the pipe which
          butts up against the spiral piece is fitted with a washer, the
          central hole of which is about a quarter of an inch in
          diameter. Washers with larger or smaller holes can also be
          inserted to adjust the system. </p>
        <p>Three factors determine the performance of the Hilsch tube;
          the setting of the stopcock, the pressure at which air is
          admitted to the nozzle, and the size of the hole in the
          washer. For each value of air pressure and washer opening
          there is a setting of the stopcock which results in a maximum
          difference in the temperature of the hot and cold pipes [see
          Fig. 237]. </p>

        <p>When the device is properly adjusted, the hot pipe will
          deliver air at about 100 degrees Fahrenheit and the cold pipe
          air at about -70 degrees (a temperature substantially below
          the freezing point of mercury and approaching that of "dry
          ice"). When the tube is adjusted for maximum temperature on
          the hot side, air is delivered at about 350 degrees F. It must
          be mentioned, however, that few amateurs have succeeded in
          achieving these performance extremes. Most report minimums on
          the order of -10 degrees and maximums of about + 140 on the
          first try. Despite its impressive performance, the efficiency
          of the Hilsch tube leaves much to be desired. Indeed, there is
          still disagreement as to how it works. According to one
          explanation, the compressed air shoots around the spiral and
          forms a high-velocity vortex of air. Molecules of air at the
          outside of the vortex are slowed by friction with the wall of
          the spiral. Because these slow-moving molecules are subject to
          the rules of centrifugal force, they tend to fall toward the
          center of the vortex. The fast-moving molecules just inside
          the outer layer of the vortex transfer some of their energy to
          this layer by bombarding some of its slow-moving molecules and
          speeding them up. The net result of this process is the
          accumulation of slow-moving, low-energy molecules in the
          center of the whirling mass, and of high-energy, fast-moving
          molecules around the outside. In the thermodynamics of gases
          the terms "high energy" and "high velocity" mean "high
          temperature." So the vortex consists of a core of cold air
          surrounded by a rim of hot air. </p>
        <p>The difference between the temperature of the core and that
          of the rim is increased by a secondary effect which takes
          advantage of the fact that the temperature of a given quantity
          of gas at a given level of thermal energy is higher when the
          gas is confined in a small space than in a large one;
          accordingly when gas is allowed to expand, its temperature
          drops. In the case of the Hilsch tube the action of
          centrifugal force compresses the hot rim of gas into a compact
          mass which can escape only by flowing along the inner wall of
          the "hot" pipe in a compressed state, because its flow into
          the cold tube is blocked by the rim of the washer. </p>
        <p>The amount of the compression is determined by the adjustment
          of the stopcock at the end of the hot pipe. In contrast, the
          relatively cold inner core of the vortex, which is also
          considerably above atmospheric pressure, flows through the
          hole in the washer and drops to still lower temperature as it
          expands to atmospheric pressure obtaining inside the cold
          pipe. </p>
        <p>Apparently the inefficiency of the Hilsch tube as a
          refrigerating device has barred its commercial application.
          Nonetheless amateurs who would like to have a means of
          attaining relatively low temperatures, and who do not have
          access to a supply of dry ice, may find the tube useful. when
          properly made it will deliver a blast of air 20 times colder
          than air which has been chilled by permitting it simply to
          expand through a Venturi tube from a high-pressure source.
          Thus the Hilsch tube could be used to quick- freeze tissues
          for microscopy, or to chill photomultiplier tubes. But quite
          apart from the tube's potential application, what could be
          more fun than to trap Maxwell's demon and make him explain in
          detail how he manages to blow hot and cold at the same time? </p>
        <p>Incidentally, this is not a project for the person who goes
          in for commercially made apparatus. So far as I can discover
          Hilsch tubes are not to be found on the market. You must make
          your own. Nor is it a project for the experimenter who makes a
          speciality of building apparatus from detailed specifications
          and drawings. The dimensions shown in the accompanying figures
          are only approximate. Certainly they are not optimum values.
          But if you enjoy exploration, the device poses many questions.
          What would be the effect, for example, of substituting a
          divergent nozzle for the straight one used by Hilsch? Why not
          create the vortex by impeller vanes, such as those employed in
          the stator of turbines? Would a spiral chamber in the shape of
          a torus improve the efficiency? What ratio should the diameter
          of the pipes bear to the vortex chamber and to each other? Why
          not make the spiral of plastic, or even plastic wood? One can
          also imagine a spiral bent of a strip of brass and soldered
          into a conventional pipe coupling. Doubtless other and far
          more clever alternatives will occur to the dyed-in-the-wool
          tinkerer.<br>
