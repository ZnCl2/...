      <p><b>Joseph Davidovits</b> (born 1935) is a French materials
        scientist who has posited that the blocks of the Great Pyramid
        are not carved stone, but mostly a form of limestone concrete.
        He holds the Ordre National du Mérite, is the author and
        co-author of more than 130 scientifical papers and conferences
        reports, and holds more than fifty patents. </p>
      <p><i>Theory</i> </p>
      <p>Davidovits was not convinced that the ancient Egyptians
        possessed the tools or technology to carve and haul the huge
        (2.5 to 15 ton) limestone blocks that made up the Great Pyarmid.
        Davidovits suggested that the blocks were molded in place by
        using a form of limestone concrete. According to his theory, a
        soft limestone with a high kaolinite content was quarried in the
        wadi on the south of the Giza plateau. It was then dissolved in
        large, Nile-fed pools until it became a watery slurry. Lime
        (found in the ash of ancient cooking fires) and natron (also
        used by the Egyptians in mummification) was mixed in. The pools
        were then left to evaporate, leaving behind a moist, clay-like
        mixture. This wet "concrete" would be carried to the
        construction site where it would be packed into reusable wooden
        molds. In the next few days the mixture would undergo a chemical
        hydration reaction similar to the setting of cement. </p>
      <p>Using Davidovits theory, no large gangs would be needed to haul
        blocks and no huge and unwieldy ramps would be needed to
        transport the blocks up the side of the pyramid. No chiseling or
        carving with soft bronze tools would be required to dress their
        surfaces and new blocks could be cast in place, on top of and
        pressed against the old blocks. This would account for the
        unerring precision of the joints of the casing stones (the
        blocks of the core show tools marks and were cut with much lower
        tolerances). Proof-of-concept experiments using similar
        compounds were carried out at Davidovit's geopolymer institute
        in northern France. It was found that a crew of ten, working
        with simple hand tools, could build a structure of fourteen, 1.3
        to 4.5 ton blocks in a couple of days. According to Davidovits
        the architects possessed at least two concrete formulas: one for
        the large structural blocks and another for the white casing
        stones. He argues earlier pyramids, brick structures, and stone
        vases were built using similar techniques. </p>
      <p>His ideas are not accepted by mainstream Egyptologists. </p>
      <p><i>Summary of evidence</i> </p>
      <p>Davidovits cites primarily evidence related to his profession
        as a materials scientist, re-interpreting the observations of
        conventional Egyptology within this light. Briefly, his points
        include: </p>
      <p>The thin layer of 'mortar' found at the top of casing blocks is
        actually the the result of settling and water percolating to the
        top of the block while drying; the layer found would be too weak
        to bind the massive blocks together </p>
      <p>The humidity inside the pyramids is much higher than would be
        expected in a desert environment; this is caused by the moisture
        released into the halls and galleries while the blocks cure </p>
      <p>The arrangement of fossils within the blocks is jumbled, rather
        than stratified, pointing to the blocks being crushed, then
        poured while casting rather deposited in layers as would
        conventional sedimentary rock </p>
      <p>Certain blocks have elongated air pockets, caused by the cement
        hardening while air bubbles were in the process of rising to the
        top <br>
        Ancient descriptions of the pyramids being built featured the
        use of short blocks of wood, conventionally seen as levers or
        cranes; Davidovits suggests their use as frames to mold the
        blocks </p>

      </center>
      <p>The remarkable achievements made through geosynthesis and
        geopolymerisation include mineral polymers (geopolymers),
        flexible ceramics which transform like plastics at low
        temperatures, ceramic composite made at room temperature or
        thermoset in a simple autoclave, concrete which after 4 hours
        has higher strength and durability than the best currently-used
        concrete. Resulting from this are industrial applications which,
        while using ceramics as the basic material, no longer need heavy
        equipment and high temperatures. Geopolymers enable product
        designers to envisage the use of ceramic type materials with the
        same facility as some plastics and organic polymers. </p>
      <p>The Geopolymer Institute not only coordinates the fundamental
        research in mineral polymer chemistry, but also promotes applied
        research made with industrial companies ( see the Proceedings of
        Géoplymère 2005 ). Because the range of applications is too
        vast, we only show the most interesting and innovative products.
        This insight will reveal how geopolymers can improve and change
        our daily life. </p>
      <p>Joseph Davidovits , the inventor and developer of
        geopolymerization, coined the term “geopolymer” in 1978 to
        classify the newly discovered geosynthesis that produces
        inorganic polymeric materials now used for a number of
        industrial applications. If you want more information go to the
        Geopolymer Library and download the papers #12 J. Thermal
        Analysis and #3 NASTS award for scientific information, and #10
        From ancient concretes to Geopolymers for general information. </p>
      <p>You can also buy online samples of geopolymers to test these
        products in your laboratory. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Pyramids (3) The formula, the invention of
              stone</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Why do geologists see nothing? </p>
      <p>This is due to the geological glue, which, though artificial,
        is seen by the geologists either as an impurity, and therefore
        useless to study, or as a natural binder. At best, the analysis
        tools and the working methods of geologists consider the glue as
        a perfectly natural “micritic binder”. A geologist not informed
        of geopolymer chemistry will assert with good faith that the
        stones are natural. <br>
        The chemical formula: </p>
      <p>People think that because we use chemicals, it is very easy to
        find these ingredients in the final product. This is wrong.
        Thanks to the geopolymer chemistry, the chemical reaction
        generates natural elements, minerals that can be analysed as
        natural if scientists are not aware of their artificial nature.
      </p>
      <p>During geosynthesis kaolinite clay (naturally included in the
        Giza limestone) first reacts with caustic soda (see chemical
        formula 2). To manufacture this caustic soda, one uses Egyptian
        natron (sodium carbonate) and lime (coming from plant ashes)
        (see chemical formula 1). The so obtained soda will react with
        clay. </p>
      <p>The most interesting point is that this chemical reaction
        creates also pure limestone (calcite) as well as hydrosodalite
        (a mineral of the feldspathoids or zeolites family). </p>
      <p>But, the mixture is still quite caustic. In order to neutralize
        it, one adds a special salt called carnallite (magnesium
        chloride) easily found in evaporites, in saline deposits like
        natron but not at the same place (see chemical formula 3 and 4).
      </p>
      <p>The re-agglomerated stone binder is the result of this
        geosynthesis (a geopolymer) that creates several natural
        minerals: limestone (calcite), hydrated feldspars (feldspathoid,
        mica-chlorite), magnesite and halite. We understand why
        geologists can easily be misled. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Pyramids were built with concrete rather
              than rocks, scientists claim</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>Charles Bremner</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>How the Egyptians really built a Pyramid</i> </p>
      <p>The Ancient Egyptians built their great Pyramids by pouring
        concrete into blocks high on the site rather than hauling up
        giant stones, according to a new Franco-American study. </p>
      <p>The research, by materials scientists from national
        institutions, adds fuel to a theory that the pharaohs’ craftsmen
        had enough skill and materials at hand to cast the two-tonne
        limestone blocks that dress the Cheops and other Pyramids. </p>
      <p>Despite mounting support from scientists, Egyptologists have
        rejected the concrete claim, first made in the late 1970s by
        Joseph Davidovits, a French chemist. </p>
      <p>The stones, say the historians and archeologists, were all
        carved from nearby quarries, heaved up huge ramps and set in
        place by armies of workers. Some dissenters say that levers or
        pulleys were used, even though the wheel had not been invented
        at that time. </p>
      <p>Until recently it was hard for geologists to distinguish
        between natural limestone and the kind that would have been made
        by reconstituting liquefied lime. </p>
      <p>But according to Professor Gilles Hug, of the French National
        Aerospace Research Agency (Onera), and Professor Michel Barsoum,
        of Drexel University in Philadelphia, the covering of the great
        Pyramids at Giza consists of two types of stone: one from the
        quarries and one man-made. </p>
      <p>“There’s no way around it. The chemistry is well and truly
        different,” Professor Hug told Science et Vie magazine. Their
        study is being published this month in the Journal of the
        American Ceramic Society. </p>
      <p>The pair used X-rays, a plasma torch and electron microscopes
        to compare small fragments from pyramids with stone from the
        Toura and Maadi quarries. </p>
      <p>They found “traces of a rapid chemical reaction which did not
        allow natural crystalisation . . . The reaction would be
        inexplicable if the stones were quarried, but perfectly
        comprehensible if one accepts that they were cast like
        concrete.” </p>
      <p>The pair believe that the concrete method was used only for the
        stones on the higher levels of the Pyramids. There are some 2.5
        million stone blocks on the Cheops Pyramid. The 10-tonne granite
        blocks at their heart were also natural, they say. The
        professors agree with the “Davidovits theory” that soft
        limestone was quarried on the damp south side of the Giza
        Plateau. This was then dissolved in large, Nile-fed pools until
        it became a watery slurry. </p>
      <p>Lime from fireplace ash and salt were mixed in with it. The
        water evaporated, leaving a moist, clay-like mixture. This wet
        “concrete” would have been carried to the site and packed into
        wooden moulds where it would set hard in a few days. Mr
        Davidovits and his team at the Geopolymer Institute at
        Saint-Quentin tested the method recently, producing a large
        block of concrete limestone in ten days. </p>
      <p>New support for their case came from Guy Demortier, a materials
        scientist at Namur University in Belgium. Originally a sceptic,
        he told the French magazine that a decade of study had made him
        a convert: “The three majestic Pyramids of Cheops, Khephren and
        Mykerinos are well and truly made from concrete stones.” </p>
      <p>The concrete theorists also point out differences in density of
        the pyramid stones, which have a higher mass near the bottom and
        bubbles near the top, like old-style cement blocks. </p>
      <p>Opponents of the theory dispute the scientific evidence. They
        also say that the diverse shapes of the stones show that moulds
        were not used. They add that a huge amount of limestone chalk
        and burnt wood would have been needed to make the concrete,
        while the Egyptians had the manpower to hoist all the natural
        stone they wanted. </p>
      <p>The concrete theorists say that they will be unable to prove
        their theory conclusively until the Egyptian authorities give
        them access to substantial samples. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a mineral polyconcondensation process
        for making cast or molded products at temperatures generally up
        to about 120.degree. C. This process is related to processes for
        making zeolites or molecular sieves. The products of this
        process, however, have characteristic three-dimensional
        frameworks which are successions of tetrahedrons TO.sub.4 where
        T is silicon, aluminum, gallium, phosphorous or the like. These
        products form channels or voids of regular dimensions when cast
        or molded. The voids are molecular in size. Accordingly, the
        polymers can be used to separate organic molecules of different
        molecular sizes. These structures also exhibit ion exchange
        properties. Moreover, the products catalyze several different
        organic polymerization systems. </p>
      <p>Numerous patents and other references describe methods for
        making these synthetic minerals, zeolites and molecular sieves.
        D. W. Breck's book entitled "Zeolite Molecular Sieves,"
        published by Interscience in 1974, is a good reference.
        Generally, these methods are hydrothermal synthesis of
        silico-aluminate gels in strong, highly concentrated aqueous
        alkali. The reactant mixture, containing a large excess of
        water, is sealed in a container at constant pressure and
        temperature. Preferably, the pressure is atmospheric, and the
        temperature is in the range of about 25.degree. C., to about
        120.degree. C. The reaction continues until crystallization of
        the product occurs. The chemical formula for the resulting
        synthetic zeolites and molecular sieves may be written as
        follows: </p>
      <p>wherein M is a cation with the valence "n." Many crystalline
        products have been made in such hydrothermal syntheses. However,
        these products are very porous, and have poor mechanical
        properties, even when agglomerated with a binder. </p>
      <p>An object of this invention is to provide synthetic mineral
        products with such properties as hard surfaces (4-6 on the Mohs
        scale), thermal stability, and high surface smoothness and
        precision. Such products are useful for tooling, and for molding
        art objects, ceramics and the like. </p>
      <p>Another object is to provide novel three-dimensional mineral
        polymers. </p>
      <p>Another object is to provide a method of making such new
        three-dimensional polymers. </p>
      <p>Other objects such as use of these polymers as binders are
        apparent from this specification and claims. </p>
      <p>The names for these novel three-dimensional polymers are set
        forth in the following publications: IUPAC International
        Symposium on Macromolecules, Stockholm in 1976, Topic III; and
        PACTEC IV, 1979, Society of Plastic Engineers, U.S.A., preprint
        page 151. These mineral polymers are called polysialates, and
        have this empiracal formula: </p>
      <p>wherein z is 1, 2 or 3; M is a monovalent cation such as
        potassium or sodium, and n is the degree of polycondensation.
        Where z is 2, the polysialate has the formula: ##STR1## and is
        called polysialatesiloxo or PSS for short. </p>
      <p>Our new polymers are of the PSS type where M is sodium or a
        mixture of sodium and potassium. In the latter case, the polymer
        is called (sodium, potassium) polysialatesiloxo or NaKPSS. The
        chemical formula of NaKPSS may be written as: ##STR2## </p>
      <p>A suitable method for distinguishing our new polymers from
        known polymers is through their x-ray powder diffraction
        patterns. NaKPSS has the characteristic x-ray powder diffraction
        pattern given in Table A below. To obtain this data, we used the
        Debye-Scherrer method. The radiation used was the K-alpha
        doublet of copper. </p>

        2.30 Middle Strong 2.11 Weak 1.92 Very strong 1.81 Middle strong
        ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>The x-ray pattern of (Na,K)PSS is related to, but distinctly
        different from that of natural Gmellinite. Gmellinite is a
        zeolite with this chemical formula: </p>
      <p>Gmellinite is called zeolite "S" in U.S. Pat. No. 3,054,657.
        The x-ray pattern of zeolite S shows middle strong lines at the
        interplanar spacings 7.16, 5.03, 4.50, and 4.12 Angstroms.
        Zeolite S plainly differs greatly from NaKPSS. </p>
      <p>As Table B shows, the oxide-mole ratios of the reactant
        mixtures for these two polymers are completely different: </p>

      <p>The method for making NaKPSS comprises preparing a sodium
        silico-aluminate/potassium silico-aluminate water mixture where
        the composition of the reactant mixture, in terms of oxide-mole
        ratios, falls within the ranges shown in table C below. </p>

        ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>The usual method for preparing this mixture comprises
        dissolving in water an alumino-silicate oxide, alkali, and a
        colloidal silica sol or alkali polysilicate. The
        alumino-silicate oxide (Si.sub.2 O.sub.5,Al.sub.2 O.sub.2).sub.n
        may be prepared from a polyhydroxy-alumino-silicate having the
        formula (Si.sub.2 O.sub.5,Al.sub.2 (OH).sub.4).sub.n, where the
        aluminum cation is in the octahedral state and is in six-fold
        coordination. The polyhydroxy-alumino-silicate is calcined and
        dehydroxylated at, say, 550.degree. C. The resulting
        alumino-silicate oxide has the aluminum cation in four-fold
        coordination and in a tetrahedral position. </p>
      <p>Various polyhydroxy-alumino-silicates may be used as the
        starting material for the preparation of alumino-silicate oxide,
        including minerals having basal spacings of about seven
        Angstroms and having at least one aluminum cation located in the
        octahedral layers. Examples are alushite, carnat, china clay,
        lithomarge, neokaolin, parakaolinite, pholenite, endellite,
        glossecolite, halloysite, milanite, berthierine, fraignotite,
        grovenite, amesite, and chamoisite. </p>
      <p>The quantities of the reactants, namely colloidal silica sol
        and/or polysilicate, and strong alkalis such as sodium hydroxide
        and potassium hydroxide, fall in the ranges shown in Table C.
        Preferably, the ratio (Na.sub.2 O,K.sub.2 O)/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 is
        about 1.0 and the ratio SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 is about
        4.0. Higher ratios induce a free alkalinity in the solidified
        polymer and cause alkali silicate migration which can disturb
        the physical and mechanical properties of the resulting mineral
        products. However, if the ratio of sodium oxide and potassium
        oxide combined to aluminum trioxide is lower than 0.8, and the
        ratio of silicon oxide to aluminum trioxide is lower than 3.5,
        the alumino-silicate oxide in excess may not polycondense and
        will remain as a white powder within the hardened NaKPSS
        product. Preferably, the oxide-mole ratios should be close to
        stoichiometric values. The NaKPSS will have a composition
        expressed in terms of oxides as follows: </p>
      <p>where, in the fully hydrated form, w is in the range of about 5
        to about 7, x is a value in the range of about 3.5 to about 4.5,
        y and z have values up to 1, and the sum of y and z is 1. </p>
      <p>By contrast, stoichoimetric conditions are not used to make
        synthetic crystalline zeolites and molecular sieves. The
        oxide-mole ratios of reactant mixtures for such products are
        always much higher than stoichoimetric values, as Table B shows.
      </p>
      <p>In the reactant mixture, the quantity of water present equals
        the sum of solvent water plus the bound water in the reactants.
        The reactant mixture is viscous, but is not a gel. Rather, the
        mixture becomes a mineral resin with unique rheological
        properties after reacting for at least about one hour at ambient
        temperature, say 25.degree. C. </p>
      <p>After aging, the mineral resin may be used alone, or may be
        mixed with inorganic or organic additives or fillers. The resin
        may be used as a binder or a mineral cement for organic or
        mineral particles or fibers. The resin is cast, poured or
        squeezed into a mold and heated to a temperature up to about
        120.degree. C., but preferably to a temperature in the range of
        about 60.degree. C., to about 95.degree. C. When
        polycondensation is complete, the solids are separated from the
        mold and dried at a temperature in the range of about 60.degree.
        C., to about 100.degree. C. </p>
      <p>Polycondensation and heating times are a function of the
        temperature and the heating process used. At an ambient
        temperature such as 25.degree. C., polycondensation requires
        more than 15 hours. At 50.degree. C., polycondensation requires
        about four hours; at 85.degree. C., about 1.5 hours, and at
        95.degree. C., about 0.5 hours. These times may differ and are
        often shorter when other heating techniques are used. Such other
        techniques include high frequency, microwave, Joule effect, or
        electrical wires within the reactant mixture itself. Because the
        reactant mixtures are polyelectrolytes, these heating techniques
        effect polycondensation and drying very rapidly. For example,
        using a microwave heater, the polycondensation described in
        Example 1 is complete in only 30 seconds, instead of the 1.5
        hours required there. </p>
      <p>The shelf life of the mineral resin can be as long as two to
        four hours at ambient temperature depending on the sequence of
        mixing the reactants. Longer pot life is attained if the strong
        alkali is not mixed directly with the reactive alumino-silicate
        oxide. In fact, if the alkalis are added directly to the
        alumino-silicate oxide solution, the resulting product differs
        from the polymers of this invention. Direct addition gives a
        strongly exothermic reaction, and produces a product similar to
        zeolite A or hydroxysodalite. </p>
      <p>Our method of preparing our new polymers comprises making
        either the alumino-silicate oxide or the sodium and potassium
        hydroxides. Making of the sodium and potassium hydroxides can be
        effected by mixing the alkalis in water with polysilicate, and
        then adding this solution to the alumino-silicate oxide.
        Preferably, we mix the alumino-silicate oxide with aqueous
        polysilicate, to the exclusion of alkali, and add this solution
        to a strong aqueous solution. These two reactant mixtures are
        stable and retain their reactivity even after long storage
        periods. Moreover, these mixtures are easy to handle and store.
      </p>
      <p>Polycondensation is best effected in a closed mold under
        hydrothermal conditions and in the presence of water.
        Evaporation of water from the mixture during polycondensation is
        undesirable. To prevent water evaporation at the surface of a
        reactant mixture placed in an open mold, the surface can be
        covered with a thin plastic film or thin layer of a hydrophobic
        liquid. After heating the mixture in the mold, the polycondensed
        solid is separated from the mold and dried. The molded object
        has good physical and mechanical properties, including a surface
        hardness in the range of 3 to 6 Mohs, depending on the nature of
        the mineral fillers added to the resin. The precision of the
        molded product's surface compares favorably with the quality
        obtained with such organic resins as epoxies and polyurethanes.
      </p>
      <p>The following examples illustrate the methods of making the new
        polymers, and some of the properties of these polymers as well.
      </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE I </p>
      <p>We prepared 317 grams of a reactant mixture containing 8.1
        moles water, 0.47 moles sodium oxide, 1.65 moles of silicon
        dioxide, and 0.41 moles of aluminum trioxide. The source of
        aluminum trioxide is the alumino-silicate oxide prepared by
        dehydroxylating a natural polyhydoxy-alumino-silicate (Si.sub.2
        O.sub.5,Al.sub.2 (OH).sub.4).sub.n. The source of silicon
        dioxide is this alumino-silicate oxide and an alkali silicate.
        The source of sodium oxide is sodium hydroxide. The oxide molar
        ratios in the reactant mixture are shown in Table D. </p>

        ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>The reactant mixture, which had the viscosity of a resin, was
        aged for a period of one hour at ambient temperature, then
        placed under vacuum to eliminate air and gas bubbles. The
        outgassed resin was poured into a urethane mold to reproduce the
        relief of a medal. </p>
      <p>The surface of the resin in contact with the atmosphere was
        covered with a thin polyethylene film to prevent water
        evaporation during curing, which was effected at 85.degree. C.,
        in an oven over a period of 1.5 hours. </p>
      <p>The hardened mineral product was separated from the mold and
        dried at 85.degree. C. It reproduced the mold surface with all
        original details of the mold surface intact. The density of the
        product was 1.4 grams per milliliter, and its hardness was 3-4
        (Mohs scale). The product was white and porous, and its external
        dimensions indicated that the polycondensation took place
        without any shrinkage or dilation of the material. Chemical
        analysis of the mineral product gave this molar composition: </p>
      <p>which corresponds to the formula of (Na)PSS ##STR3## which has
        an x-ray diffraction pattern essentially that shown in Table A.
      </p>
      <p>Materials from which the mold may be made include iron, paper,
        wood and plastics, indeed all materials except aluminum and
        copper. Even aluminum and copper molds can be used if they are
        covered with a thin layer of organic resin. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE II </p>
      <p>Following the steps described in Example I, we prepared 296
        grams of reactant mixture containing 7.5 moles of water, 0.33
        moles of sodium oxide, 0.08 moles of potassium oxide, 1.65 moles
        silicon dioxide, and 0.41 moles of aluminum trioxide. The source
        of potassium oxide was anhydrous KOH. The oxide-mole ratios of
        the reactant mixture are set forth in Table E. </p>

      <p>The reactant mixture, which had the viscosity of a resin, was
        aged for one hour at ambient temperature (25.degree. C.). To
        this aged mineral resin we added 280 grams of fine white mullite
        with a size range between 100 and 150 microns. We poured this
        mixture into the same mold used in Example I. </p>
      <p>After polycondensation in the mold at 85.degree. C., for 1.5
        hours, and following the drying conditions described in Example
        I, the cured mineral medal had a density of 1.8 grams per
        milliliter. The diameter of the product was 85.8 millimeters.
        (The mold's diameter at 25.degree. C. was just 85.4 millimeters.
        However, the mold had diameter of 85.08 millimeters at the
        85.degree. C., molding temperature.) Apparently, the cured
        mineral polymer had the same diameter as the heated mold. </p>
      <p>The molded product had a surface hardness of five on the Mohs
        scale, and the reproduction of the medal surface from the mold
        was very exact. </p>
      <p>Chemical analysis of the mineral product gave a mixture of
        mullite and (Na,K)PSS with a molar composition as follows: </p>
      <p>The x-ray powder diffraction pattern is a mixture of the lines
        characteristic of crystalline mullite and of NaKPSS as set forth
        in Table A. </p>
      <p>Thermogravimetric analysis of NaKPSS gave two endothermic
        peaks, the first between 150.degree. C., and 200.degree. C., the
        second between 320.degree. C., and 370.degree. C. The first peak
        corresponds to the loss of "zeolitic water," amounting to about
        9% by weight of the fully hydrated polymer. The second peak
        corresponds to the loss of hydroxyl groups constituting about
        12% by weight of the fully hydrated polymer. </p>
      <p>The pH of the fully hydrated NaKPSS is about 10 to 10.5, which
        means that the polymer was free from excess alkali. However, as
        with other zeolitic materials, the sodium and potassium cations
        may migrate in the presence of water. This effect vanishes if
        the NaKPSS is heated to a temperature higher than the second
        endothermic peak of the thermogravimetric analysis, or higher
        than 370.degree. C. After this postcuring at a temperature above
        370.degree. C., the sodium and potassium cations do not migrate
        in the presence of water. </p>
      <p>Full dehydration and dehydroxylation of NaKPSS transforms a
        mineral polymer into a product having properties like ceramic
        materials. Its formula ##STR4## corresponds to the molar
        composition </p>
      <p>where x has a value in the range of about 3.5 to about 4.5, and
        y and z have values up to 1 such that the sum of y and z is 1. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE III </p>
      <p>We mixed one kilogram of foundry sand with 50 grams containing
        5% by weight of the mineral resin prepared according to Example
        II. The resulting sand/resin mixture was pressed into two molds.
        One mold was thermoset at 85.degree. C., for a period of 1.5
        hours; the second mold was cured at ambient temperature for 15
        hours. We obtained two cores suitable for foundry use in which
        the sand was bound with the mineral polymer having the following
        molar composition: </p>
      <p>This molar composition corresponds to the molar composition of
        NaKPSS. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a mineral polycondensation process
        for making cast or molded products at temperatures generally up
        to about 120.degree. C. This process is related to processes for
        making zeolites or molecular sieves. </p>
      <p>The products of such processes, however, have characteristic
        three-dimensional frameworks which are successions of
        tetrahedrons TO.sub.4, where T is silicon, aluminum, gallium,
        phosphorous or the like. Those products form channels or voids
        of regular dimensions. The voids are molecular in size.
        Accordingly, the mineral frameworks can be used to separate
        organic molecules of different molecular sizes. Those structures
        also exhibit ion exchange properties. Moreover, those products
        catalyze several different organic polymerization systems. </p>
      <p>Numerous patents and other references describe methods for
        making those synthetic minerals, zeolitics and molecular sieves.
        D. W. Breck's book entitled, "Zeolite Molecular Sieves,"
        published by Interscience in 1974, is a good reference.
        Generally, those methods are hydrothermal syntheses of
        silico-aluminate gels in strong, highly concentrated aqueous
        alkali. The reactant mixture, containing a large excess of
        water, is sealed in a container at constant pressure and
        temperature. Preferably, the pressure is atmospheric, and the
        temperature is in the range of about 25 C. to about 125.degree.
        C. The reaction continues over more than ten hours until
        crystallization of the products occurs. The chemical formula for
        the resulting synthetic zeolites and molecular sieves may be
        written as follows: </p>
      <p>wherein M is a cation with a valence "n." Many crystalline
        products have been made in such hydrothermal syntheses. However,
        these products are very porous and have poor mechanical
        properties, even when agglomerated with a binder. I have
        discovered that when reaction conditions do not favor
        crystallization or crystal formation, I obtain novel products. </p>
      <p>An object of this invention is to provide synthetic mineral
        products with such properties as hard surfaces (5-7 on the Mohs
        scale), thermal stability and high surface smoothness and
        precision. Such products are useful for tooling, and for molding
        art objects, ceramics and the like, and building materials. </p>
      <p>The main object is to provide a novel mineral polymer, more
        precisely a novel mineral polymer compound, and to provide a
        method of making a new mineral polymer compound. </p>
      <p>Other objects such as use of this mineral polymer compound as a
        binder are apparent from this specification and claims. </p>
      <p>The names for these novel three-dimensional polymers are set
        forth in the following publications: "IUPAC International
        Symposium on Macromolecules," Stockholm, 1976, Topic III; and
        "PACTEC IV,", Society of Plastic Engineers, U.S.A., preprint
        page 151. These mineral polymers are called polysialates and
        have this empirical formula: </p>
      <p>wherein "z" is 1, 2 or 3; M is a monovalent cation such as
        potassium or sodium, and "n" is the degree of polycondensation.
        Where "z" is 1, the mineral polymer has this formula: ##STR2##
        and is called polysialate or PS for short. </p>
      <p>Our new polymer is of the K--PS polymer compound type where "M"
        is potassium. </p>
      <p>A suitable method for distinguishing our new polymers from
        known polymers is through their X-ray powder diffraction
        pattern. K--PS polymer compound has the characteristic x-ray
        powder diffraction pattern given in Table A below. To obtain
        this data, we used the Debye-Scherrer method. The radiation used
        was the K-Alpha doublet of copper. </p>
      <p>The X-ray pattern of K--PS is related to that of natural
        kaliophilite (KAlSiO.sub.4), which corresponds to the general
        formula of polysialate. This natural mineral is not a zeolite,
        but an anhydrous feldspathoid with the formula: ##STR3## where
        "w" is a value in the range of 0 to 1. </p>
      <p>This distinction is very important. Mineral polymers containing
        zeolitic water must be dehydroxylated at a temperature up to
        about 400.degree. C. if they are to be used without damage at
        higher temperature. On the contrary, mineral polymers of the
        kaliophilite type will resist thermal shock. Thermal shock
        resistance is a fast test for distinguishing a zeolitic
        framework from a feldspathoidic one. </p>
      <p>Mineral polymer polysialates K--PS have this chemical formula:
      </p>
      <p>The method of making K--PS comprises preparing a reactant
        mixture in which the oxide-mole ratios are higher than
        stoichiometric values. For example, the ratio SiO.sub.2
        /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 is in the range of 3.3 to 4.5, instead of 2.
        These conditions differ from those used in a process of making
        synthetic (Na, K) Poly(Sialate-Siloxo) or (Na, K)--PSS mineral
        polymers which are described in French patent application No.
        79.22041, and have this empirical formula: ##STR4## </p>

      <p>However, if the reactant mixture is exclusively composed of a
        potassium polysilicate, potassium hydroxide (KOH) and
        alumino-silicate oxide (Si.sub.2 O.sub.5, Al.sub.2
        O.sub.2).sub.n, then the mineral polymer produced is not (Na,
        K)--PSS. The X-ray powder diffraction pattern and the
        thermogravimetric analysis are different. The X-ray patterns of
        (Na, K)--PSS are related to those of natural analcime,
        gismondine, gmelinite and phillipsite, whereas the polymer
        obtained here is amorphous. Thermogravimetric analysis of this
        polymer gave a loss of water amounting to 5% by weight up to
        325.degree. C., the weight remaining constant for higher
        temperature. By contrast, thermogravimetric analysis of (Na,
        K)--PSS gave a loss of water in the range of 21% to 29% by
        weight between 100.degree. C. and 500.degree. C. This polymer
        does not exhibit zeolitic properties. It is brittle, but hard: 5
        on the Mohs scale. </p>
      <p>A synthetic kaliophilite KAlSiO.sub.4.0.1H.sub.2 O has been
        prepared by H. Besson, S. Caillere and S. Henin (Comptes Rendue
        Academie des Sciences de Paris, Vol. 272, Series D, pp.
        2749-2752 (1971)), using silico-aluminate gels and potassium
        carbonate (K.sub.2 CO.sub.3). The X-ray pattern of this
        anhydrous synthetic kaliophilite is given in Table A. Its
        pattern is related to that of K--PS, but shows a strong line at
        3.10 Angstroms, accompanying the broad line at 2.79 to 3.23
        Angstroms. Table A also gives X-ray patterns of synthetic
        zeolites related to the polymer K--PS, such as zeolite Z (or
        zeolite KF), zeolite G (or zeolite K--G), and zeolite W (or
        zeolite K--M, K--H). These patterns are given in D. W. Breck's

      <p>The usual method for preparing this mixture comprises
        dissolving in water an alumino-silicate oxide, KOH, and a
        potassium polysilicate. The alumino-silicate oxide (Si.sub.2
        O.sub.5, Al.sub.2 O.sub.2).sub.n may be prepared from a
        polyhydroxy-alumino-silicate having the formula (Si.sub.2
        O.sub.5, Al.sub.2 (OH).sub.4).sub.n, where the aluminum cation
        is in the octahedral state and is in six-fold coordination. The
        polyhydroxy-alumino-silicate is calcined and dehydroxylated at,
        say, between 550.degree. C. and 800.degree. C. The resulting
        alumino-silicate oxide has the aluminum cation in four-fold
        coordination and in a tetrahedral position. </p>
      <p>Various polyhydroxy-alumino-silicates may be used as the
        starting material for the preparation of alumino-silicate oxide,
        including minerals having basal spacings of about seven
        Angstroms and having at least one aluminum cation located in the
        octahedral layers. Examples are alushite, carnat, china clay,
        lithomarge, neokaolin, parakaolinite, pholenite, endellite,
        glossecolite, halloysite, milanite, berthierine, fraignotite,
        grovenite, amesite and chamoisite. </p>
      <p>The silico-aluminate mineral polymer compound obtained by
        polycondensation of a reactant mixture as given in Table C, will
        have a composition expressed in terms of oxides as follows: </p>
      <p>where, in the fully hydrated form, "w" is a value at the most
        equal to 4, "x" is a value in the range of about 3.3 to about
        4.5, and "y" is a value in the range of about 0.9 to 1.6. </p>
      <p>The mineral polymer compound is a solid solution which
        comprises 35 to 90 parts by weight of a potassium polysilicate
        (y-1)K.sub.2 O:(x-2)SiO.sub.2 :(w-1)H.sub.2 O and 10 to 65 parts
        by weight of the mineral polymer K--PS, which has the formula:
        ##STR6## and an X-ray pattern related to that of the natural
        mineral kaliophilite as shown in Table A. </p>
      <p>The quantities of the reactants, namely potassium polysilicate,
        alumino-silicate oxide and potassium hydroxide, fall in the
        ranges shown in Table C. Preferably, the ratio (K.sub.2
        O)/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 is in the range of about 1.3 to 1.52, and
        the ratio SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 is in the range of about
        4.0 to 4.2. Higher ratios induce a free potassium silicate phase
        in the solidified polymer compound, and cause potassium silicate
        migration which can disturb the physical and mechanical
        properties of the resulting mineral products. If the ratio of
        potassium oxide to aluminum trioxide is lower than 1.1, and the
        ratio of silicon dioxide to aluminum trioxide is lower than 3.7,
        the solidified polymer compound will have numerous cracks, and
        cannot be used in the fabrication of molded objects. </p>
      <p>By contrast, the oxide-mole ratios of reactant mixtures for
        synthetic crystalline zeolites Z, G and W are always much higher
        than the values for the K--PS polymer compound, as Table B
        shows. In particular, water is employed in large excess, and the
        K.sub.2 O quantities are much higher. </p>
      <p>In the reactant mixture, according to Table C, the quantity of
        water present equals the sum of solvent water plus the bound
        water in the reactants. The reactant mixture is viscous, but is
        not a gel. Rather, the mixture becomes a mineral resin with
        unique rheological properties after reacting for at least about
        one hour at ambient temperature, say 25.degree. C. </p>
      <p>After aging, the mineral resin may be used alone, or may be
        mixed with organic or inorganic additives or fillers. The resin
        may be used as a binder or a mineral cement for organic or
        mineral particles or fibers. The resin is cast, poured, squeezed
        or vibrated into a mold and heated to a temperature up to about
        120.degree. C., but preferably to a temperature in the range of
        about 60.degree. C. to about 95.degree. C. When polycondensation
        is complete, the solids are separated from the mold and dried at
        a temperature up to about 100.degree. C. </p>
      <p>Polycondensation and heating times are a function of the
        temperature and the heating process used. At an ambient
        temperature, such as 25.degree. C., polycondensation requires
        more than 15 hours. At 50.degree. C., polycondensation requires
        about four hours; at 85.degree. C., about 1.5 hours; and at
        95.degree. C., about 0.5 hours. These times may differ, and are
        often shorter when other heating techniques are used. Such other
        techniques include high frequency, microwave, Joule effect or
        electrical wires within the reactant mixture itself. Because the
        reactant mixtures are polyelectrolytes, these heating techniques
        effect rapid polycondensation and drying. </p>
      <p>The pot life of the mineral resin can be as long as two to four
        hours at ambient temperature depending on the sequence of mixing
        the reactants. Longer pot life is attained if the potassium
        hydroxide is not mixed directly with the reactive
        alumino-silicate oxide solution. In fact, if the alkali is added
        directly to the alumino-silicate oxide solution, the resulting
        product differs from the polymers of this invention. </p>
      <p>The method of preparing our new mineral polymer compound
        comprises masking either the alumino-silicate oxide or the
        potassium hydroxide. Masking of the potassium hydroxide can be
        effected by mixing the alkali in water with polysilicate, and
        then adding this solution to the alumino-silicate oxide.
        Preferably, we mix the alumino-silicate oxide with aqueous
        polysilicate, to the exclusion of alkali, and add this solution
        to a strong aqueous potassium hydroxide solution. These two
        reactant mixtures are stable and retain their reactivity even
        after long storage periods. Moreover, these mixtures are easy to
        handle and store. </p>
      <p>Polycondensation is best effected in a closed mold under
        hydrothermal conditions and in the presence of water.
        Evaporation of water from the mixture during polycondensation is
        undesirable. To prevent water evaporation at the surface of a
        reactant mixture placed in an open mold, the surface can be
        covered with a thin plastic film or thin layer of a hydrophobic
        liquid. After heating the mixture in the mold, the polycondensed
        solid is separated from the mold and dried. The molded object
        has good physical and mechanical properties, including a surface
        hardness in the range of 5 to 7 Mohs, depending on the nature of
        the mineral fillers added to the resin. The precision of the
        molded product's surface compares favorably with the quality
        obtained with such organic resins as epoxies and polyurethanes.
      </p>
      <p>The following examples illustrate the methods of making the new
        K--PS polymer compound and some of its properties. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 1 </p>
      <p>We prepared 860 grams of a reactant mixture containing 11.33
        moles water, 1.630 moles potassium oxide, 4.46 moles of silicon
        dioxide and 1.081 moles of aluminum trioxide. The source of
        aluminum trioxide is the alumino-silicate oxide prepared by
        dehydroxylating a natural polyhydroxy-alumino-silicate (Si.sub.2
        O.sub.5, Al.sub.2 (OH).sub.4).sub.n. The source of silicon
        dioxide is this alumino-silicate oxide and a potassium silicate.
        The source of potassium oxide is this potassium silicate and
        potassium hydroxide. The oxide-mole ratios in the reactant
        mixture are shown in Table D. </p>
      <p>TABLE D ______________________________________ K.sub.2
        O/SiO.sub.2 0.36 SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 4.12 H.sub.2
        O/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 16.03 K.sub.2 O/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 1.51
        ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>The reactant mixture, which had the viscosity of a resin, was
        aged for a period of one hour at ambient temperature (25.degree.
        C.), then placed under vacuum to eliminate air and gas bubbles.
        The outgassed resin was poured into a mold. </p>
      <p>The surface of the resin in contact with the atmosphere was
        covered with a thin polyethylene film to prevent water
        evaporation during curing, which was effected at 85.degree. C.
        in an oven over a period of 1.5 hours. </p>
      <p>The hardened mineral product was separated from the mold and
        dried at 85.degree. C. </p>
      <p>The density of the product was 1.7 grams per milliliter, and
        its hardness was 4.5 on the Mohs scale. The product was white
        and low in porosity. Physico-chemical analysis of the mineral
        product gave this molar composition: </p>
      <p>which corresponds to the formula of a polymer compound. This
        polymer compound contains, in a solid solution, one phase of a
        potassium polysilicate which corresponds to the formula: </p>
      <p>and one K--PS which corresponds to the formula: ##STR7## The
        X-ray powder diffraction pattern is essentially that shown for
        K--PS in Table A. To obtain this data, we used the
        Debye-Scherrer method, K-Alpha of doublet copper, in a 57.3 mm
        chamber. </p>
      <p>The product obtained had many cracks in it. If at least one
        mineral filler is added to the reactant mixture after, during or
        even before aging, these cracks disappear. The mechanical and
        physical properties of the molded objects obtained following
        this process are excellent. Tensile strength is about 180
        kg/cm.sup.2, hardness may reach 7 on the Mohs scale, and linear
        dilatation coefficient, as a function of temperature, is in the
        range of 2 to 5.times.10.sup.-6 m/m/.degree.C. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 2 </p>
      <p>Following the steps described in Example 1, we prepared 960
        grams of a reactant mixture containing 22.88 moles of water, the
        other components being unchanged. The oxide-mole ratios of the
        reactant mixture are set forth in Table D, except H.sub.2
        O/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 which was 21. </p>
      <p>The fluid reactant mixture was aged for one hour at ambient
        temperature. Then we added 640 grams of synthetic cordierite
        (with mullite), with a size range lower than 120 microns. The
        viscous mixture was poured into a mold and hardened at
        85.degree. C. The product had a density of 2.3 grams per
        milliliter and a surface hardness of 5 on the Mohs scale. Its
        external dimensions indicated that polycondensation took place
        without any shrinkage. </p>
      <p>X-ray diffraction was determined by a different technique,
        plotting the theta/2 curve under cobalt emission at 1.79
        Angstroms. The pattern showed the very strong lines of
        cordierite and the middle strong lines of mullite, weak lines at
        4.49/4.28/3.53/2.59/2.28/2.16 Angstroms and a broad line between
        3.38 and 2.80 Angstroms, which is covered with the strong lines
        of cordierite. This X-ray diffraction pattern is identical to
        that of K--PS shown in Table A. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 3 </p>
      <p>Following the steps described in Example 1, we prepared 792
        grams of a reactant mixture containing 13.5 moles of water, the
        other components being unchanged. The oxide-mole ratios of the
        reactant mixture are set forth in Table D, except H.sub.2
        O/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 which was 12.5. </p>
      <p>The fluid reactant mixture was aged for one hour at ambient
        temperature. Then we added 540 grams of synthetic cordierite
        (with mullite), with a size range lower than 120 microns, and we
        followed the steps described in Example 2. </p>
      <p>We determined the X-ray diffraction pattern by the same
        technique as in Example 2 and obtained the same lines for K--PS,
        plus weak lines at 3.24/2.95/2.88/2.82 Angstroms. These are in
        the broad amorphous band for K--PS, namely between 2.79 and
        3.23, cited in Table A. </p>
      <p>The ratios H.sub.2 O/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 may vary from 10 to 25.
        Preferably, the ratio is in the range of 14 to 20. Higher ratios
        increase the porosity of the solidified product. Lower ratios
        induce a free alkalinity and cause migrations which can disturb
        the potassium silicate phase in the solid solution of the
        polymer compound. Preferably, the oxide-mole ratios of the
        reactant mixture fall within the range in Table E below. </p>

      <p>EXAMPLE 4 </p>
      <p>Following the steps described in Example 1, we prepared 860
        grams of a reactant mixture and added 220 grams of muscovite
        with a size range lower than 120 microns and 90 grams of calcium
        fluoride (CaF.sub.2) in fine powder form. We obtained a viscous
        resin which we mixed with 1,150 grams of zircon sand. The
        resulting zircon sand/resin mixture was cast and vibrated in a
        mold, then heated at 85.degree. C. for a period of 1.5 hours.
        The dried product had a density of 3.0 grams per milliliter. It
        was shiny and had a surface hardness of 6 on the Mohs scale. </p>
      <p>Interpretation of the X-ray diffraction pattern is not easy.
        The strong lines of zircon and calcium fluoride and the numerous
        lines of muscovite cover practically all the lines of K--PS. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 5 </p>
      <p>Following the steps described in Example 1, we prepared a
        reactant mixture. After aging, the resin was painted on a mold
        which was the negative of a sculpture. During the same period,
        we mixed five kilograms of flint with a size range from 0.5 to 5
        mm, with 0.5 kilograms, or 10% by weight of the resin. This
        mixture was cast and vibrated in the painted mold. The mold was
        covered with a polyethylene film and cured at ambient
        temperature (25.degree. C.). Next day, we obtained a sculpture
        which was separated from the mold and had a very fine, hard and
        shiny surface. </p>
      <p>We have used the potassium silico-aluminate reactant mixtures
        described above in order to make molded objects obtained by the
        agglomeration of 5 to 95 parts by weight of mineral and/or
        organic fillers, with 5 to 95 parts by weight of a binder which
        is a mineral polymer compound. This mineral polymer compound has
        a formula with a molar composition as follows: </p>
      <p>where, in the fully hydrated form, "w" is a value at the most
        equal to 4, "x" is a value in the range of about 3.3 to about
        4.5, and "y" is a value in the range of about 0.9 to about 1.6.
      </p>
      <p>This mineral polymer compound is a solid solution which
        comprises 35 to 90 parts by weight of a potassium polysilicate
        with the formula: </p>
      <p>and 10 to 65 parts by weight of a potassium polysialate with
        the formula: ##STR8## and having an X-ray powder diffraction
        pattern related to the natural mineral kaliophilite, as shown in
        Table A for K--PS. </p>
      <p>Molded objects with high thermal shock resistance were obtained
        by addition of fillers such as muscovite, synthetic or natural
        alumino-silicate, zircon, chamotte and other ceramics or
        refractory products. </p>
      <p>The molded objects resist the direct action of a flame and may
        be used at temperatures in the range of 300.degree. C. to
        1,200.degree. C. Preferably, they are first dried and dehydrated
        at a temperature below 350.degree. C. Dehydration and
        dehydroxylation of the mineral polymer compound transforms the
        molded object into a product having excellent thermal stability
        properties equivalent to or better than ceramic materials. Its
        composition expressed in terms of oxides is as follows: </p>
      <p>where "x" has a value in the range of about 3.3 to about 4.5,
        and "y" has a value in the range of about 0.9 to about 1.6.
        These polymer compounds are solid solutions comprising one phase
        of a potassium polysilicate with the formula: </p>
      <p>and one phase of a K--PS polysialate with the formula: ##STR9##
      </p>
      <p>The potassium silico-aluminate reactant mixture described above
        becomes a mineral resin which can be mixed with at least one
        mineral and/or organic filler, and used as a binder or cement.
        These mixtures may also include such additives and fillers as
        dyestuffs, pigments, reinforcement fibers and water-repelling
        agents. Polycondensation and setting occur in the range of room
        temperature up to 120.degree. C. </p>
      <p>Molded objects of this invention have many uses, depending on
        the physical, mechanical or chemical properties required. They
        can be used in industries such as the building industry and may
        also be used as decoration, taking the form of objects, molds,
        tools, blocks and panels. </p>
      <p>These molded objects may support several physicochemical,
        physical or mechanical post-treatments, as well as finishing or
        coating operations. If necessary, the molded objects can be
        heated to a temperature of at least 325.degree. C. One obtains
        ceramic-like products having excellent thermal and dimensional
        stability. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --- An early high-strength mineral polymer
        composition is formed of a polysialatesiloxo material obtained

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention is directed to a mineral polymer
        composition which is employed for the making of cast or molded
        products at room temperatures, or temperatures generally up to
        248.degree. F., where the composition has attained sufficient
        strength to be demolded within 90 minutes of casting or molding.
        These high early-strength compositions are obtained by the
        blending of a mineral geopolymer, referred to as a polysialate,
        blast furnace slag, obtained from the making of iron in a blast
        furnace and possibly, an inert filler. </p>
      <p>The mineral geopolymers are called polysialates, and have the
        following empirical formula: </p>
      <p>wherein "z" is 1, 2 or 3; "M" is a monovalent cation such as
        potassium or sodium, and "n" is the degree of polycondensation.
        Where "z" is 1, the mineral geopolymer has the formula: ##STR1##
        and is called polysialate or PS for short, and is of the K-PS
        polymer compound type when "M" is potassium. Where "z" is 2, the
        mineral geopolymer has the formula: ##STR2## and is called
        polysialatesiloxo or PSS for short. When "M" is sodium or a
        mixture of sodium and potassium, the geopolymer is called
        (sodium, potassium)polysialatesiloxo or NaKPSS. The chemical
        formula of NaKPSS may be written as: ##STR3## </p>
      <p>The method for making NaKPSS or KPS is described in U.S. Pat.
        No. 4,349,386 and U.S. application Ser. No. 377,204. It
        comprises preparing a sodium silico-aluminate/potassium
        silico-aluminate water mixture where the composition of the
        reactant mixture, in terms of oxide-mole ratios, falls within
        the ranges shown in Table A below. </p>

      <p>where M.sub.2 O represents either Na.sub.2 O, or K.sub.2 O or
        the mixture (Na.sub.2 O,K.sub.2 O). </p>
      <p>The usual method for preparing this mixture comprises
        dissolving in water an alumino-silicate oxide, alkali, and a
        colloidal silica sol or alkali polysilicate. The
        alumino-silicate oxide (Si.sub.2 O.sub.5,Al.sub.2 O.sub.2).sub.n
        may be prepared from a polyhydroxy-alumino-silicate having the
        formula (Si.sub.2 O.sub.5,Al.sub.2 (OH).sub.4).sub.n, where the
        aluminum cation is in the octahedral state and is in six-fold
        coordination. The polyhydroxy-alumino-silicate is calcined and
        dehydroxylated at, say 1112.degree. F. to 1472.degree. F. The
        resulting alumino-silicate oxide has the aluminum cation in
        four-fold coordination and in a tetrahedral position. </p>
      <p>Various polyhydroxy-alumino-silicates may be used as the
        starting material for the preparation of alumino-silicate oxide,
        including minerals having basal spacings of about seven
        Angstroms and having at least one aluminum cation located in the
        octahedral layers. Examples are alushite, carnat, china clay,
        lithomarge, neokaolin, parakaolinite, pholenite, endellite,
        glossecolite, halloysite, milanite, berthiernine, fraignotite,
        grovenite, amesite, and chamoisite. </p>
      <p>The quantities of the reactants, namely colloidal silica sol
        and/or polysilicate, and strong alkalis such as sodium hydroxide
        and potassium hydroxide, fall in the ranges shown in Table A. </p>
      <p>After aging, the mineral mixture may be used alone, or may be
        mixed with inorganic or organic additives or fillers. The
        mixture may be used as a binder or a mineral cement for organic
        or mineral particles or fibers. The mixture is cast, poured or
        squeezed into a mold and heated to a temperature up to about
        467.degree. F. but preferably to a temperature in the range of
        about 140.degree. F. to about 203.degree. F. When
        polycondensation is complete, the solids are separated from the
        mold and dried at a temperature in the range of about
        140.degree. F. to about 212.degree. F. </p>
      <p>Polycondensation and heating times are a function of the
        temperature and the heating process used. At an ambient
        temperature such as 77.degree. F., polycondensation requires
        more than 15 hours. At 122.degree. F., polycondensation requires
        about four hours; at 185.degree. F., about 1.5 hours; and at
        203.degree. F., about 0.5 hours. These times may differ and are
        often shorter when other heating techniques are used. Such other
        techniques include high frequency, microwave, Joule effect, or
        electrical wires within the reactant mixture itself. Because the
        reactant mixtures are polyelectrolytes, these heating techniques
        effect polycondensation and drying very rapidly. </p>
      <p>There is a need for a cement which has the high setting and
        very low volume change characteristics normal for polysialate
        geopolymers, but which has very early high compressive
        strengths. This need is particularly acute in the prestress and
        precast concrete industry. Considerable savings result from the
        required strength being obtained at early ages so that
        construction can continue and there is a more rapid reuse of
        molds. There is also a need for such a very early high-strength
        cement having the high setting characteristics of polysialate
        geopolymers in patching or resurfacing highways and airport
        runways or in any operation where early form removal is desired.
      </p>
      <p>While there have been proposals in the past for a cement having
        early high compressive strength, none of them have had the early
        compressive strengths required; that is, cement having a
        compressive strength better than 1,000 psi by 1 hour at
        150.degree. F. and 6,000 psi by 4 hours at 150.degree. F. when
        tested in a standard 1 to 2.75 by weight cement-sand mortar, and
        having the high setting and very low volume change
        characteristics that are normal for, and are typical of,
        polysialate geopolymers. </p>
      <p>The best early high-strength Portland Cement described in U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,160,674 is made from a Portland Cement having
        substantially all of its particles of about 20 microns and
        smaller. This fine and expensive cement type "Incor" had a
        compressive strength of 3,000 psi in 4 hours at a temperature of
        150.degree. F. </p>
      <p>The second required component of the high early-strength
        composition of the present invention is a ground blast furnace
        slag. Part of the steel-making process is in the reduction of
        iron ore to pig iron in a blast furnace. A by-product of the
        iron-making operation is blast furnace slag, the material
        resulting from the purification of iron ore into pig iron. Blast
        furnace slags contain, in addition to the lime and magnesia
        added to the blast furnace as fluxing material, the impurities
        previously contained in the iron ore, usually silica, alumina,
        and minor amounts of other compounds. </p>
      <p>The ground blast furnace slag employed is a latent hydraulic
        product which can be activated by suitable activators. Without
        an activation, the development of the strength of the slag is
        extremely slow. It is also known that the development of the
        slag necessitates a pH higher than or equal to 12. The best
        activators are then Portland Cement, clinker, Ca(OH).sub.2,
        NaOH, KOH, and waterglass. The 7 day compressive strengths of
        activated slags with different alkali activators are given in
        the paper presented by J. Metso and E. Kapans, "Activation of
        Blast Furnace Slag by Some Inorganic Materials", at the
        CANMET/ACI First International Conference on the Use of Fly Ash,
        Silica Fume, Slag and Other Mineral By-products in Concrete",
        July 31-August, 1983, Montebello, Quebec, Canada. An addition of
        4% by weight of NaOH gave a compressive 7 day strength of 12 to
        20 MPa (1740 to 2900 psi), and a compressive 28 day strength of
        22 MPa (3190) psi. </p>
      <p>The addition of ground blast furnace slag to the polysialate
        geopolymers accelerates the setting time, and improves
        compressive strength. </p>
      <p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention is directed to a high early-strength
        mineral polymer composition, useful as a cement, which has very
        early high compressive strength; that is, compressive strength
        better than 1,000 psi by 1 hour at 150.degree. F. and 6,000 psi
        by 4 hours at 150.degree. F. when tested in a standard 1 to 2.75
        by weight cement-sand mortar, and which has the high setting and
        very low volume change characteristics that are normal and
        typical of polysialate geopolymers. </p>
      <p>This early high-strength cement composition is obtained by
        adding to a reactant mixture consisting of alumino-silicate
        oxide (Si.sub.2 O.sub.5,Al.sub.2 O.sub.2) with the aluminum
        cation in four-fold coordination, strong alkalis such as sodium
        hydroxide and/or potassium hydroxide, water and a
        sodium/potassium polisilicate solution, a certain amount of
        ground blast furnace slag. To 100 g of a reactant mixture having
        the following oxide-mole ratio: </p>
      <p>M.sub.2 O/SiO.sub.2 : 0.21 to 0.36 </p>
      <p>SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 : 3.0 to 4.12 </p>
      <p>H.sub.2 O/M.sub.2 O: 12 to 20 </p>
      <p>M.sub.2 O/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 : 0.6 to 1.36 </p>
      <p>where M.sub.2 O represents either Na.sub.2 O, or K.sub.2 O, or
        the mixture (Na.sub.2 O, K.sub.2 O), one adds 15 g to 26 g of a
        fine ground blast furnace slag. </p>
      <p>Additional details of both the mineral geopolymers and its use
        as a cement for making cast or molded products are set forth in
        the description of the preferred embodiments. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to
        provide a mineral binder of the polysialate type used as a
        cement, having a very early high compressive strength and having
        very low volume change characteristics that are normal for, and
        typical of, polysialate geopolymers. A further object of the
        present invention is the provision of such a very early high
        compressive strength with the use of fine ground blast furnace
        slag. A further object of the present invention is the provision
        of a mineral binder of the polysialate type M.sub.n
        [(Si--O.sub.2).sub.z --AlO.sub.2 ].sub.n,wH.sub.2 O, wherein "z"
        is 1 or 2, where M.sub.2 O represents either Na.sub.2 O, or
        K.sub.2 O or the mixture (Na.sub.2 O,K.sub.2 O). </p>
      <p>Employing the compositions of the present invention, cast or
        molded bodies achieve sufficient strength to be demolded in
        approximately 1 hour. </p>
      <p>Other and further objects, features and advantages of these
        mineral geopolymers, such as their uses as binders are apparent
        from this specification and claims. </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </p>
      <p>The method for making NaKPSS or KPS geopolymers is described in
        U.S. Pat. No. 4,249,386 and U.S. application Ser. No. 377,204,
        filed Apr. 29, 1982. It comprises preparing a sodium
        silico-aluminate/potassium silico-aluminate water mixture where
        the composition of the reactant mixture, in terms of oxide-mole
        ratios, falls within the ranges shown in Table A below. </p>

      <p>where M.sub.2 O represents either Na.sub.2 O, or K.sub.2 O or
        the mixture (Na.sub.2 O,K.sub.2 O). The mixture may be used as a
        binder or a mineral cement for organic particles or fibers. The
        mixture is cast, poured or squeezed into a mold and heated to a
        temperature up to about 467.degree. F., but preferably to a
        temperature in the range of about 140.degree. F. to about
        203.degree. F. When polycondensation is complete, the solids are
        separated from the mold and dried at a temperature in the range
        of about 140.degree. F. to about 212.degree. F. </p>
      <p>Polycondensation and heating times are a function of the
        temperature and the heating process used. At an ambient
        temperature such as 77.degree. F., polycondensation requires
        more than 15 hours. At 122.degree. F., polycondensation requires
        about 4 hours; at 185.degree. F., about 1.5 hours; and at
        204.degree. F., about 0.5 hours. </p>
      <p>The following examples illustrate the methods of making the new
        early high-strength polysialate geopolymers of the NaKPSS or KPS
        types, and some of the properties of these cements as well. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE I (CONTROL) </p>
      <p>We prepared 840 g of a reactant mixture containing 17.3 moles
        of water, 1.438 moles potassium oxide, 4.45 moles of silicon
        dioxide and 1.08 moles of aluminum trioxide. The source of
        aluminum trioxide is the alumino-silicate oxide (Si.sub.2
        O.sub.5,Al.sub.2 O.sub.2).sub.n with Al in four-fold
        coordination prepared by dehydroxylating a natural
        polyhydroxy-alumino-silicate (Si.sub.2 O.sub.5,Al.sub.2
        (OH).sub.4).sub.n with Al in six-fold coordination. The source
        of silicon dioxide is this alumino-silicate oxide and a
        potassium silicate. The source of potassium oxide is this
        potassium silicate and potassium hydroxide. The oxide mole
        ratios in the reactant mixture are shown in Table B. </p>
      <p>TABLE B ______________________________________ K.sub.2
        O/SiO.sub.2 0.32 SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 4.12 H.sub.2
        O/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 17.0 K.sub.2 O/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 1.33 H.sub.2
        O/K.sub.2 O 12.03 ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>We call this reactant mixture standard mixture. To the 840 g of
        this standard mixture was added 20 g of fine mica, 110 g of fine
        calcium flouride and 220 g of fine clay kiln dust. This slurry,
        weighing 1190 g, was added to 2210 g of graded Ottawa sand, and
        the obtained mixture was cast into standard 2" cube molds, cured
        4 hours at 150.degree. F. The compressive strength after 4 hours
        at 150.degree. F. is 6730 psi; other data are given in Table I.
        Table II gives all volume changes in water and in air. The low
        volume change in air of the standard mixture (+0.009) compared
        with current cement (Type I, Lone Star New Orleans) (-0.074),
        illustrates the great advantage of a geopolymer. However, the
        standard mixture begins to harden at 150.degree. F. only after 2
        hours, and may only be demolded after 4 hours. At ambient
        temperature (say 73.degree. F.), hardening begins after 15 hours
        and demolding may occur only after 24 hours or better at 48
        hours. At 185.degree. F. hardening begins after 40 minutes and
        demolding occurs after 1 hour and 30 minutes. These hardening
        times are too long for numerous applications, especially when no
        heat may be applied, or when the molds and tooling costs are so
        high that an increase in productivity becomes a necessity. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE II </p>
      <p>To the 840 g of the standard mixture of Example I, are added 20
        g of fine mica, 110 g of calcium flouride and 220 g of Lone Star
        Miami ground sidmar slag which has the following
        characteristics: </p>

      <p>This slurry of Example II, weighing 1190 g, was added to 2200 g
        of graded Ottawa sand, and the obtained mixture cast into
        standard 2" cube molds. This mixture begins to harden after 21
        minutes at 73.degree. F. The compressive strength after 24 hours
        at 73.degree. F. is 5575 psi. Cured 4 hours at 150.degree. F.,
        the compressive strength is 7140 psi (see Table I), and reaches
        8220 psi after 1 day at 73.degree. F., the shrinkage in air
        (Table II) remains low--0.021. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE III </p>
      <p>To the 840 g of the standard mixture of Example I, are added
        220 g of a fine ground, light weight expanded clay aggregate
        (used as an inert filler), and 130 g of the Miami ground sidmar
        slag as in Example II. This slurry of Example III, weighing 1190
        g, is added to 220 g of graded Ottawa sand. The mixture begins
        to harden after 45 minutes at 73.degree. F. Compressive strength
        on 2" cubes cured 4 hours at 150.degree. F. (Table I), is 8350
        psi and reaches 8770 psi after 1 day at 73.degree. F. The
        shrinkage in air (Table II), remains low at 0.015 compared with
        0.074 for regular Portland Cement. It is also of interest to
        note that with this geopolymer mixture of Example III, the
        compressive strength on 2" cubes, cured 24 hours at 150.degree.
        F. reaches 10,000 psi. </p>
      <p>Table I gives the compressive strength comparison on 2" cubes
        for the geopolymer standard mixture of Example I, the geopolymer
        mixture of Example III, cements of Lone Star Industries Type I,
        Type III, Super Incor and Reg. Set II Cement, cured 4 hours at
        150.degree. F. or at room temperature. </p>
      <p>Table II gives the volume change in water or in air after 2
        months. Geopolymer mixture shows higher expansion in water than
        Portland Cement, but the very low shrinkage in air is a very
        important property. </p>

        dioxide and 1.08 moles of aluminum trioxide. The source of the

      <p>To the 800 g of this reactant mixture, one adds 220 g of a fine
        ground, light weight, expanded clay aggregate (used as an inert
        filler), and 130 g of the Miami ground sidmar slag. This slurry
        of Example IV, weighing 1150 g, is added to 2200 g of graded
        Ottawa sand. Compressive strength on 2" cubes cured 4 hours at
        150.degree. F. is 7250 psi, and after storage 7 days at
        73.degree. F., 8470 psi. Compressive strength of 2" cubes cured
        2 days at room temperature (73.degree. F.) is 6500 psi. The
        composition of this example began to harden, and could be
        demolded, after 60 minutes, at 73.degree. F. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE V </p>
      <p>We prepared 732 g of a reactant mixture containing 15.6 moles
        of water, 1.043 moles of potassium oxide, 3.88 moles of silicon
        dioxide and 1.08 moles of aluminum trioxide. The sources of the

        of Example V, weighing 1082 g, is added to 2200 g of graded
        Ottawa sand. Compressive strength on 2" cubes, cured 4 hours at
        150.degree. F. is 7935 psi, and after storage for 7 days at
        73.degree. F., 8220 psi. Compressive strength of 2" cubes cured
        2 days at room temperature (73.degree. F.), is 6650 psi. This
        composition began to harden, and could be demolded after about
        45 minutes, at 73.degree. F. </p>
      <p>In the above Examples III, IV, and V, 130 g of the Miami ground
        sidmar slag was added to different geopolymer reactant mixtures.
        The reduction of the ratios SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 and
        K.sub.2 O/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 has a slight influence on the
        compressive strength, as shown in Table III. </p>

      <p>In Example II, 26% per weight of Miami slag was added to the

        in Example IV, 16.2%; and in Example V, 17.7% by weight was
        added to the geopolymer reactant mixture. </p>
      <p>In fact, another ratio seems to influence the compressive
        strength. In all above Examples III, IV, V, the H.sub.2
        O/K.sub.2 O increases, whereas the compressive strength is
        decreasing. </p>

      <p>In order to study the influence of water on the compressive
        strength, we prepared 686 g of a geopolymer reactant containing
        13.0 moles of water, 1.043 moles of potassium oxide, 3.88 moles
        of silicon dioxide and 1.08 moles of aluminum trioxide. The
        sources of the reactants are the same as in Example I. To the
        686 g of this geopolymer reactant mixture are added 220 g of a
        fine ground, light weight expanded clay aggregate (used as an
        inert filler), and 130 g of the Miami ground sidmar slag. To
        this slurry of Example VI are added increasing amounts of water,
        and the obtained mixture is added to 2200 g of graded Ottawa
        sand. In Table IV is given the relationship between the ratio
        H.sub.2 O/K.sub.2 O and the compressive strength for the
        reaction mixture according to this Example VI, which has the
        following oxide mole ratio: </p>
      <p>K.sub.2 O/SiO.sub.2 : 0.268 </p>
      <p>SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 : 3.592 </p>
      <p>K.sub.2 O/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 : 0.96 </p>

      <p>The compositions of this example began to harden, and could be
        demolded at times varying from about 30 to about 70 minutes, at
        73.degree. F. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE VII </p>
      <p>In order to demonstrate the major influence of this ratio
        H.sub.2 O/K.sub.2 O (that is to say, the starting pH of the
        reactant mixture), we prepared 500 g of a geopolymer reactant
        mixture containing 8.69 moles of water, 0.719 moles of potassium
        oxide, 3.308 moles of silicon dioxide, and 1.08 moles of
        aluminum trioxide. The sources of the reactants are the same as
        in Example I. To the 500 g of this geopolymer reactant mixture
        are added 220 g of a fine ground, light weight, expanded clay
        aggregate (used as an inert filler), 130 g of the Miami ground
        sidmar slag, and 113 g of water. To this slurry of Example VII
        is added 2200 g of graded Ottawa sand. The oxide mole ratios of
        the geopolymer reactant mixture, with water, are shown in Table
        E: </p>

        F. is 3600 psi and when placed 7 days at room temperature
        (73.degree. F.), 4000 psi. One obtains the same value with
        H.sub.2 O/K.sub.2 O equal to 20.80, as in Table III; but in this
        Example VII, the ratio K.sub.2 O/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 is 0.665,
        instead of 0.96 as in Example VI. The most important element is
        then obviously the H.sub.2 O/K.sub.2 O ratio, which determines
        the pH value of the reacting geopolymer mixture. A low ratio, in
        the range between 12 and 16 yields to high early compressive
        strength, whereas a big H.sub.2 O/K.sub.2 O ratio, higher than
        16, reduced substantially the mechanical properties of the
        geopolymer reactant mixture. Hardening of the composition of
        this example began in about 70 minutes, at 73.degree. F. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE VIII </p>
      <p>We prepared 870 g of a reactant mixture containing 20.0 moles
        of water, 0.724 moles of potassium oxide, 0.75 moles of sodium
        oxide, 4.45 moles of silicon dioxide and 1.08 moles of aluminum
        trioxide. The source of sodium oxide is sodium hydroxide. The
        sources of the other reactants are the same as in Example I. The
        oxide mole ratios in the reactant mixture are shown in Table F.

        ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>To the 870 g of this reactant mixture are added 220 g of a fine
        ground, light weight expanded clay aggregate (used as an inert
        filler), and 130 g of the Miami ground sidmar slag. This slurry
        of Example VII, weighing 1220 g, is added to 2200 g of graded
        Ottawa sand. Compressive strength on 2" cubes cured 4 hours at
        150.degree. F. is 6670 psi, and after storage for 7 days at
        73.degree. F., 7870 psi. Curing of the composition of this
        example began in about 70 minutes, at 73.degree. F. </p>
      <p>Compared with the results obtained in Example III, there is a
        slight reduction in strength from 8350 to 6670 psi (curing 4
        hours at 150.degree. F.), due to the replacement of 50% of the
        K.sub.2 O by Na.sub.2 O. Sodium hydroxide is relatively cheaper
        than potassium hydroxide, and results in compressive strengths
        which are lower, but still interesting for various applications.
      </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE IX </p>
      <p>We prepared 781 g of a reactant mixture containing 18.2 moles
        of water, 1.043 moles of potassium oxide, 3.88 moles of silicon
        dioxide and 1.08 moles of aluminum trioxide. The sources of the
        reactants are the same as in Example I. The oxide mole ratios in
        the reactant mixture are shown in Table G. </p>

      <p>To the 781 g of this reactant mixture are added 220 g of fine
        ground, light weight expanded clay aggregate (used as an inert
        filler), and 130 g of the Miami ground sidmar slag. This slurry
        of Example IV, weighing 1131 g, is added to 2200 g of graded
        Ottawa sand. The compressive strengths of 2" cubes cured at
        different temperatures and during different times are given in
        Table V. </p>

      <p>Because of the relatively high H.sub.2 O/K.sub.2 O ratio, the
        compressive strengths are lower than 6000 psi (cured 4 hours at
        150.degree. F.), but the 1 hour curing at 150.degree. F. gives a
        compressive strength higher than 1000 psi, which is high enough
        for demolding. Hardening of this composition began in about 60
        minutes, at 73.degree. F. </p>
      <p>The amount of slag added to the geopolymer reactant mixture
        varied in Examples III to VIII from 15.4% to 21% by weight. At
        the same time, the amount of water increases. Surprisingly, the
        increasing of water results in a reduction of the compressive
        strength, whereas, theoretically it is the opposite which might
        be expected. Indeed, increasing the water amount improves the
        dissolution of the slag. Table VI gives the variation of the
        compressive strength with the slag/water weight ratio of the
        reactant mixtures of Example VI. </p>

        ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>From the above described Examples, the present invention
        consists in the production of an early high-strength concrete
        composition, which is obtained by adding to a reactant mixture
        consisting of alumino-silicate oxide (Si.sub.2 O.sub.5,Al.sub.2
        O.sub.2).sub.n with the aluminum cation in four-fold
        coordination, strong alkalis such as sodium hydroxide and/or
        potassium hydroxide, water and a sodium/potassium polisilicate
        solution, a certain amount of ground blast furnace slag. To 100
        g of a reactant mixture following oxide-mole ratio </p>
      <p>M.sub.2 O/SiO.sub.2 : 0.21 to 0.36 </p>
      <p>SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 : 3.0 to 4.12 </p>
      <p>H.sub.2 O/M.sub.2 O: 12.0 to 20 </p>
      <p>M.sub.2 O/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 : 0.6 to 1.36 </p>
      <p>where M.sub.2 O represents either Na.sub.2 O, or K.sub.2 O, or
        the mixture (Na.sub.2 O,K.sub.2 O), one adds 15 g to 26 g of a
        fine ground blast furnace slag. If more than 26 g of ground
        blast furnace slag is employed, the composition tends to "flash
        set". While it is more difficult to use, it can still be
        employed with higher amounts of slag. The 15 g to 26 g amounts
        of slag are based upon the reactive polysialate siloxo mixture,
        including water. </p>
      <p>Tested in standard 1 to 2.75 by weight cement-sand mortar, the
        polysialate geopolymer/slag mixture used as a cement, yields to
        early high compressive strength; that is, compressive strength
        better than 1000 psi by 1 hour at 150.degree. F. and 6000 psi by
        4 hours at 150.degree. F. Depending on the slag/water weight
        ratio, the setting time at room temperature varies from 12
        minutes to 60 minutes with a slag/water weight ratio in the
        range of 0.70 to 0.42. </p>
      <p>As plotted in Table II, the polysialate geopolymer/slag mixture
        yields to very low volume change characteristics that are normal
        and typical of polysialate geopolymers, such as a shrinkage in
        air after 2 months, as low as 0.015 compared with the value for
        regular Portland Cement (0.074). </p>
      <p>The foregoing embodiments have been given for the purpose of
        disclosure and changes can be made therein which are within the
        spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended
        claim. </p>
