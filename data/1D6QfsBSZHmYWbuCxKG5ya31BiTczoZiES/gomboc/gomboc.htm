      <p>The Gomboc is a roundish piece of clear synthetic material with
        gently peaked, organic curves. It looks like a piece of modern
        art. But if you tip it over, something unusual happens: it
        rights itself. </p>
      <p>The Gomboc is the physical realization of a mathematical
        theorem: that a "mono-monostatic" object -- one that has a
        single stable point of equilibrium, or balance -- must exist.
        And so it does. No matter how you orient it, the Gomboc always
        rights itself. </p>
      <p>It leans off to one side, rocks to and fro as if gathering
        strength and then, presto, tips itself back into a “standing”
        position as if by magic. It doesn’t have a hidden counterweight
        inside that helps it perform this trick, like an inflatable
        punching-bag doll that uses ballast to bob upright after you
        whack it. No, the Gomboc is something new: the world’s first
        self-righting object. </p>
      <p>The Gomboc is a result of a long mathematical quest. In 1995,
        the Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold mused that it would be
        possible to create a “mono-monostatic” object — a
        three-dimensional thingy that purely by dint of its geometry had
        only one possible way to balance upright. </p>
      <p>The challenge intrigued two scientists — Gabor Domokos and
        Peter Varkonyi, both of the Budapest University of Technology
        and Economics. They spent a few years doing the math, and it
        seemed as if a mono-monostatic object could, in fact, exist.
        They began looking to see if they could find a naturally
        occurring example; at one point, Domokos was so obsessed that he
        spent hours testing 2,000 pebbles on a beach to see if they
        could right themselves. (None could.) </p>
      <p>After several more years of scratching their heads, they
        finally hit upon a shape that looked promising. They designed it
        on a computer, and when it came back from the manufacturer, they
        nervously tipped it over, wondering if all their work would be
        for naught. Nope: the Gomboc performed perfectly. “It’s a very
        nice mathematical problem because you can hold the proof in your
        hands — and it’s quite beautiful,” Varkonyi says. </p>
      <p>Yet the scientists now say that Mother Nature may have beaten
        them in the race after all. They have noticed that the Gomboc
        closely resembles the shell of a tortoise or a beetle, creatures
        whose round-shelled backs help them right themselves when
        flipped over. “We discovered it with mathematics,” Domokos
        notes, “but evolution got there first.” </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>Gömböc (pronounced as 'goemboets')?</b> </p>
      <p>The 'Gömböc' is the first known homogenous object with one
        stable and one unstable equilibrium point, thus two equilibria
        altogether on a horizontal surface. It can be proven that no
        object with less than two equilibria exists. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="equilibrium.jpg" height="173" width="300"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>The stable equilibrium (S)</b> </p>
      <p>If placed on a horizontal surface in an arbitrary position the
        Gömböc returns to the stable equilibrium point, similar to
        'weeble' toys. While the weebles rely on a weight in the bottom,
        the Gömböc consists of homogenous material, thus the shape
        itself accounts for self-righting. </p>
      <p><b>The unstable equilibrium (I)</b> </p>
      <p>The single unstable equilibrium point of the Gömböc is on the
        opposite side. It is possible to balance the body in this
        position, however the slightest disturbance makes it fall,
        similar to a pencil balanced on its tip. </p>
      <p>The question whether Gömböc-type objects exist or not was posed
        by the great Russian mathematician V. I. Arnold at a conference
        in 1995, in a conversation with Gabor Domokos. <br>

      </center>
      <p>Convexity and homogeneity are crucial properties of Gömböc.
        Weebles are straightforward examples of inhomogenous objects
        with Gömböc-type behaviour. Similarly, it is easy to create
        homogenous but concave Gömböc-like forms due to the fact that
        concave bodies cannot roll on all points of their circumference.
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="math01.jpg" height="173" width="300"></p>
        <p><b>Concave Gömböc-type planar shapes.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Shapes with a unique stable equilibrium are called monostatic;
        those with only one additional unstable point are referred to as
        mono-monostatic. Thus the Gömböc is the first convex,
        homogenous, mono-monostatic object. </p>
      <p><b>Planar Gömböc</b> </p>
      <p>All planar, convex shapes can be defined by a function R(a) in
        a polar coordinate system with origin at the center of gravity
        of the object (G). On horizontal surfaces, all objects start
        rolling in a way that sends G lower, i.e. such that R decreases
        at the point of contact with the underlying surface. Equilibria
        occur if dR/da = 0 at this point. A balance point is stable at
        minima of R (d2R/da2 &gt; 0) and unstable at maxima (d2R/da2
        &lt; 0). Minima of R are followed by maxima and vice versa, thus
        the numbers of stable and unstable equilibria are equal. In
        addition, the following interesting statement can be proven: </p>
      <p><b>Theorem 1.:</b> <br>
        <i>All planar, convex, homogenous shapes have at least 2 stable
          and 2 unstable equilibria.</i> </p>
      <p>If an object had only one equilibrium point of each type, the
        diagram of the corresponding function R(a) would have just one
        maximum and one minimum. In this case one could cut it by a
        horizontal line R = R0 such that the two parts R &gt; R0 and R
        &lt; R0 of the function have equal (length p) horizontal
        projection. This would correspond cutting the original object to
        a thin (R &lt; R0) and a thick (R &gt; R0) part by a line
        crossing the center of gravity G. Imagine supporting the planar
        object along this line. In order to maintain moment balance, G
        should be off the line, on the thick side, which is contradicts
        our previous statement that G is on the line. Thus we arrived at
        a contradiction and therefore Theorem 1 is true. </p>

        <p><b>The diagram R(a) diagram (left panel) and the
            corresponding body (right panel).</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>As we have just proven, there is no planar, Gömböc-type object.
        This surprisingly simple fact is the physical analogue of a
        classical mathematical theorem: </p>
      <p><b>Four vertex theorem:</b> <br>
        <i>The curvature of a simple closed planar curve has at least
          four local extrema.</i> </p>
      <p>There are numerous generalizations of the Four vertex theorem
        as well as many related theorems in geometry, which are
        sometimes called Four vertex theorems together. If there were no
        Gömböc in 3D, this fact would be an additional member of the
        Four vertex theorem family. </p>
      <p><b>Basic idea of the Gömböc</b> </p>
      <p>Similar to planar objects, 3D shapes can be defined by a
        function R(j,q) in a spherical coordinate system around their
        centers of gravity. </p>
      <center>

      </center>
      <p><b>Definition of a 3D shape in spherical coordinate system.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Local minima and maxima of R again correspond to stable and
        unstable equilibria, but the object has additional balance
        points at saddles of R. According to the Poincaré-Hopf theorem
        the number of equilibria (s, u, t, respectively) of the three
        types satisfies s + u - t = 2 for all objects isomorphic to
        spheres. One could imagine three analogues of Theorem 1 (stating
        s&gt;1 and u&gt;1 for planar objects): </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * a) s &gt; 1, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * b) u &gt; 1, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * c) s + u&gt; 2, </p>
      <p>however a) and b) are easy to confute: </p>
      <p>s &gt; 1 is not true as shown by this counterexample, for which
        s = t = 1, u = 2: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="math04.jpg" height="105" width="237"></p>
      </center>
      <p>There are simple counterexamples for i &gt; 1, too. In this
        case, u = t = 1, s = 2: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="math05.jpg" height="127" border="0" width="231"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The third possibility is the question of the Gömböc itself: are
        there 3D convex, homogenous bodies with s = u = 1 (thus t = 0)?
        We can try to extend the planar proof to show the nonexistence
        of such bodies. If there was such a shape, the corresponding
        function R(j,q) would have only one minimum and one maximum. The
        surface of the body could be cut by a level set R = R0 to a thin
        and a thick part of equal size (ie. the spatial angles
        determined by the two parts from G are of equal sizes). If this
        level set is a planar curve (i.e. a circle), we get to
        contradiction, similar to the 2D case. However, it can also be
        spatial curve, as, for example, the curve on tennis balls. In
        this case, the separation of the body to an upper thick and a
        lower thin part does not mean that G has to be in the upper
        part. Thus, the planar proof does not apply in 3D. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="math06.jpg" height="153" width="381"></p>
        <p><b>The line separating the thick (yellow) and thin (green)
            parts of a hypothetical mono-monostatic body can be, but is
            not necessarily planar.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The ‘failure' of the proof yields some idea for the shape of a
        spatial Gömböc. This idea was used to construct a two-parameter
        closed formula, for which it was analytically proven that
        appropriate parameter values result in an object with s = u = 1.
        Unfortunately due to the additional constraint of convexity, the
        constructed form was almost identical to a simple sphere. Thus,
        this construction verified the existence of the Gömböc
        theoretically, but the existence of characteristic (visually
        obvious) mono-monostatic forms was still a question. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="math07.jpg" height="135" width="560"></p>
        <p><b>Some members of the two-parameter family of bodies used in
            the analytical proof.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>The ‘real‘ Gömböc</b> </p>
      <p>The ‘theoretical' proof raised the question: why did we fail to
        get a characteristic shape? Either the formula constructed for
        the proof was not good enough or some deeper reason was hiding
        behind the failure. The fact that Gömböc-type shapes proved to
        bear similar features to spheres and the lack of such shapes in
        a sample of 2000 pebbles at the island of Rhodes both suggested,
        that forms “far away" from the sphere can not have s = i = 1.
        Nevertheless, using a different approach the real Gömböc could
        be constructed. The form presented below is based on the idea of
        the tennis-ball. It consists of segments of simple surfaces
        (cylinder, ellipsoid, cone) and planes. The new shape is
        obviously convex. Numerical integration reveals that its center
        of gravity is slightly below the origin; this fact makes it easy
        to show that it is mono-monostatic. </p>
      <p>Of course, infinite number of shapes have these properties, the
        figures show one of these. The fabricated Gömböc models are also
        slightly different: they consist of more segments, which makes
        the stability properties of the equilibria more robust and the
        dynamical behavior of the rolling objects more intuitive. </p>

      <p>A Gömböc ( pronounced [Gœmbœts] ) is a convex three-dimensional
        homogeneous body which, when resting on a flat surface, has just
        one stable and one unstable point of equilibrium. To avoid
        having two stable equilibria, the body must have minimal
        "flatness", and at the same time, to avoid having two unstable
        equilibria, it must also have minimal "thinness". This shape
        represents a class (i.e., it is not unique); the shape has very
        fine tolerances, outside which it is no longer mono-monostatic.
      </p>
      <p>It is conjectured that there also exist convex polyhedra with
        just one stable face and one unstable point of equilibrium. The
        minimum number of faces could be large. </p>
      <p>The Gömböc mimics the "self-righting" abilities of shelled
        animals such as turtles[1] and beetles. Such a shape was
        conjectured by Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold as a
        mono-monostatic body. </p>
      <p>The shape was developed by Gábor Domokos (head of Mechanics,
        Materials and Structures at Budapest University of Technology
        and Economics in Hungary) and a former student of his, Péter
        Várkonyi (at Princeton University). The Gömböc made the front
        page of mathematical journal The Mathematical Intelligencer.[2]
      </p>
      <p>Domokos and his wife Réka developed a classification system for
        shapes based on their points of equilibrium by collecting
        pebbles from a beach and noting their equilibrium points. The
        Gömböc was developed in conjunction with that system as a
        supposed "perfect" self-righting mechanism.[3] </p>
      <p>Gömb in Hungarian means "sphere", and gömböc refers to a
        sphere-like object. (It is mostly known in the folk culture as
        kis gömböc, a round creature in the loft that remained from a
        killed pig, which swallows everyone one after the other who goes
        to see what happened to the previous ones.[4]) The mathematical
        Gömböc has indeed sphere-like properties. In particular its
        flatness and thinness are minimal, and this is the only type of
        nondegenerate object with this property. The sphere has also
        minimal flatness and thinness, however, it is degenerate.(cf.
        Várkonyi &amp; Domokos, 2006.) </p>
      <p>On 13 February 2009 Domokos appeared on the British television
        programme QI where he explained how the gömböc works. </p>
