        <p><b>Hermann Plauson </b>was an Estonian engineer and
          inventor. Plauson investigated the production of energy and
          power via atmospheric electricity. </p>
        <p>Plauson was the director of the Fischer-Tropsch "Otto Traun
          Research Laboratories" in Hamburg, Germany during the Weimar
          Republic of the 1920s. He built on Nikola Tesla's idea for
          connecting machinery to the "wheelwork of nature". Plauson's
          US Patent # 1,540,998 describes methods to convert alternating
          radiant static electricity into rectified continuous current
          pulses. He developed the Plauson's converter, an electrostatic
          generator. In 1920, Plauson published a book titled "<i>Production







            and Utilization of the Atmospheric Electricity</i>" (<i>Gr.,
            Gewinnung und Verwertung der Atmospharischen Elektrizitat</i>).






          A copy of this book is in the British Library. </p>
        <p>It is believed that he was related to Gertrud Plauson (the
          exact relationship is unknown; she may be his wife). </p>

        </center>
        During the war there was developed in Germany a new art --- or
        science --- that bids fair to revolutionize our present means of
        obtaining power.
        <p>This art, which is as new now as wireless was 25 years ago,
          will attain proportions during the next 25 years that may
          appear fantastic today. The inventor of the new science, an
          engineer of note, Herr Hermann Plauson, has devoted years of
          labor to his researches and he has now actually in use small
          power plants, that generate electricity direct from the air,
          day and night, without interruption at practically no cost,
          once the plant is constructed. <br>
          We had occasion, in one of our former issues, to describe the
          system, roughly, from cabled dispatches, but complete
          information is available now. The amount of electrical power
          that resides in our atmosphere is astounding. Herr Plauson
          found in his experiments that a single balloon sent aloft to a
          height of 300 yards gave a constant current at 400 volts of
          1.8 amperes, or in 24 hours over 17-1/4 kilowatts! By using
          two balloons in connection with a special condenser battery,
          the power obtained was 81-1/2 kilowatts in 24 hours. The
          actual current delivered was 6.8 amperes at 500 volts. </p>
        <p>The best balloons used by the inventor are made of thin
          aluminum leaf. No fabric was used. A simple internal system of
          ribs, stays and wires, gives the balloon rigidity as well as a
          certain amount of elasticity. The balloon, when made airtight,
          is filled with hydrogen or better, with helium. It will then
          stay aloft for weeks at a time. The outer surface is dotted
          with extremely sharp pins, made sharp electrolytically.
          Ordinary pins did not prove good current collectors, as they
          lacked extreme sharpness. The pins themselves were made from
          amalgamated zinc, containing a radium preparation, in order to
          ionize the air. It was also found that by dotting the outer
          surface of the balloon with zinc-amalgam more current could be
          collected. Even better results were obtained with polonium
          amalgam. Plauson states that the function of these amalgams is
          purely photoelectric. </p>
        <p>One hundred of such captive balloons, separated one hundred
          yards from each other, will give a steady yield of 200
          horsepower. This is the minimum, because in the winter this
          figure increases up to 400 horsepower, due to the higher
          electrification of the atmosphere. </p>
        <p>We need not go into the technic of how the current is finally
          made useable for industrial purposes, suffice it to say that
          the problem has been entirely solved by Herr Plauson. By using
          batteries of condensers, high tension transformers, etc., the
          current can be transformed to any form desires. Such as for
          lighting lamps, running motors, charging storage batteries,
          etc. </p>
        <p>Plauson also invented a sort of electrostatic rotary
          transformer which gives alternating current without the use of
          condensers and transformers. Indeed, its output is very great,
          as it actually ‘sucks’ the current down rapidly from the
          collector balloons. There is no doubt that this invention will
          soon come into universal use all over the world. We will see
          the land dotted with captive balloons, particularly in the
          country and wherever water power does not abound. Indeed, the
          time is not distant when nearly all of our power will be
          derived from the atmosphere. So far it seems to be the
          cheapest form of power known, it being much cheaper even than
          water power --- the cheapest form of power known today. Not
          only that, but as the inventor points out, no devastating
          thunder storms occur near such aerial power plants, because
          the balloons act not only as lightning arresters, but they
          quickly discharge the biggest thunder cloud, safely and
          noiselessly through their grounded spark gaps. </p>

        <p>[ For many years electrical engineers have endeavored to
          devise some means whereby it would become possible to utilize
          the free electrical energy ever present in the atmosphere, but
          they were not successful, as every now and then an extra heavy
          surge of static current would rush down the elevated conductor
          and endanger the lives of the experimenters, or else destroy
          the apparatus connected with it. A German engineer has,
          however, devised the somewhat elaborate scheme here shown in
          brief, and he has succeeded, at least so his report states, in
          safely extracting several kilowatts of electrical power from
          the atmosphere with metallic surfaced balloons, elevated to a
          height of only 1000 feet. ] </p>

        <p>We have previously treated of the extraction of electrical
          energy from the atmosphere. The difference of electric
          potential in different parts of the atmosphere, and the
          difference between the upper air and earth make it a tempting
          proposition to obtain power from atmospheric electricity. The
          power would take the form of high potential difference with a
          discharge almost of a static nature. It has long appeared
          rather doubtful to conservative engineers, if such a source of
          power should really be available. Yet when we see the
          lightning flash, it certainly suggests very high power, even
          though the total of its energy may be small, on account of the
          small duration of the discharge It is not to the thunder storm
          that we look for getting power from the atmosphere, as the
          subject is now being seriously investigated. A German
          scientist, Hermann Plauson, has published a very elaborate
          work on this subject, and has investigated the use of kites,
          balloons and towers, for the utilization of the high
          potentials existing in the air at different altitudes, and has
          studied out the construction of motors to be operated by the
          peculiar type of discharge which will be obtained, if the
          projects are successfully carried out. </p>
        <p>We will first speak of the methods used for collecting
          electricity from the upper air. The author cites several
          German patents. One of them shows the use of a kite balloon.
          The balloon is shown floating in the air, kite fashion, and
          from it hangs a great net or aerial for the collection of
          electricity. The conductor from the aerial leads to the ground
          station; quite an elaborate description is given of the
          net-work which the patentee proposes to have covered with
          needle points. A windlass takes in or pays out cable for the
          balloon, and the patentee claims that by sending the apparatus
          to a height of about one mile he will have 225,000 volts to
          draw upon. He then speaks o a battery of 20,000 cells in
          series, which will use up to 40,000 to 50,000 volts in the
          charging. This certainly provides for a reasonable large fall
          of potential. </p>
        <p>But our author discards this idea and first suggests
          something more permanent. He proposes the erection of towers
          to be in the neighborhood of 1,000 feet high, or about the
          height of the Eiffel Tower. At the summit he has his
          collecting aerial. The appliance consists of a number of
          copper tubes; within each one he proposes to burn gas lamps,
          whose products of combustion will reach the aerial, a
          collecting net-work covering the tops of the tubes. One of his
          apprehensions is that if rain should wet his connections
          trouble might ensue, so he proposes a protection at the top in
          the shape of a great bell-like shield, resembling in his terms
          “a Siamese pagoda”. He also compares the form of the
          protection to that of a great petticoat insulator. Another of
          his difficulties is that he must have his tower insulated from
          the earth. He, therefore describes a complicated foundation
          for his structure. He proposes first to pour in at the bottom
          of the excavation a foundation of simple concrete. On this he
          places a layer of asphalt, and then a layer of cast glass,
          three to ten feet thick, and then comes a reinforced concrete
          foundation, to which the metallic foot of the tower is to be
          anchored. This foundation must rise at least seven feet above
          the ground level, and is to be boarded in on all sides to
          protect it from moisture. The author’s idea s to erect a
          number of these towers connected by a horizontal cable, to
          which the aerials for collection of potentials are secured. </p>
        <p>The author strongly advocates balloons as collectors of the
          electric power of the air. These he depicts covered with
          spots. These spots indicate areas to be variously coated and
          prepared to collect potential from the atmosphere. </p>
        <p>In the first place he describes the balloon as made of thin
          metallic leaf supported by internal ribs. Steel wires
          silver-plated, copper-plated, or aluminum-coated, run from the
          balloon to the pendant or junction ring. To this ring the
          tether cable is attached and runs to an insulated windlass on
          the surface of the earth. The balloon is to rise to an
          altitude varying from 300 feet to three miles. </p>
        <p>The coating of the spots is to be of the thinnest amalgam, of
          mercury and gold, or zinc, or even polonium, perhaps only
          1/2500 inch thick. All over the upper face of the balloon are
          numberless metal points. To prepare the needle-like wires,
          they are collected into bundles and are treated
          electrolytically in a bath, so as to be dissolved in part.
          This gives a sharp point and roughened surface, all adapted
          for collecting the electric energy. The points may be of
          copper, steel, or some hard metallic alloy. After this
          corrosion. As it may be termed, the wires are plated with gold
          or other of the so-called noble metals. It is advised that
          polonium or radium salts be added to the plating bath. </p>
        <p>Dr Plauson devotes many pages of his book to describing his
          motor. This is a rotary motor including a stator and rotor and
          its peculiarity is that it contains no coils, develops no
          electromagnetic field properly speaking, but works by static
          excitation. One typical arrangement is shown in our
          illustration. The stator plates and rotor plates are
          concentric with each other, representing segments of
          cylinders. The alternation of negative and positive charged
          plates produces the rotation. In the connections there is
          included a safety spark gap to take care of dangerous
          potentials. Inductances and capacities are also used and
          indicated. It was found that the plates heated, owing to the
          Foucalt currents, and to overcome this, several methods of
          subdividing the stator and rotor plates, are described by the
          author. </p>
        <p>The whole subject is quite captivating, and it really seems
          as if the utilization of the electricity of the air may be
          almost in sight. It would seem possible to carry out
          experiments in this direction by means of the Eiffel Tower,
          but of course, the trouble here is that the tower is grounded,
          and perfect insulation of the collecting surface is absolutely
          essential. </p>
        <p>And now our author gives us some practical details. He says
          that on the Finland plains he carried out experiments with a
          balloon made of aluminum leaf with collecting needles of
          amalgamated zinc with a radium preparation as an ionizer. The
          surface of the balloon was sprinkled over with zinc amalgam.
          It was sent up to a height of 300 meters, early 1,000 feet,
          and was held by a copper-plated steel wire. A constant current
          of 1.8 amperes at an average of 400 volts potential difference
          was obtained. This gave nearly three-quarters of a kilowatt,
          or close to one horsepower. The collector of the balloon
          insulated from the earth showed a tension of 42,000 volts. By
          sending up a second balloon with an antenna to the same height
          at a distance of 100 meters from the first balloon, a current
          of over 3 amperes was obtained. Then by putting into the
          circuit a large condenser, whose capacity was equal to the
          surface capacity of both balloons, and of the antenna
          connections, the current rose to 6.8 amperes with about 500
          volts mean tension. By the use of these two balloons, he
          eventually ran up the power to 3.4 kilowatts.<br>

        <p>In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a large
          number of researchers investigated ways to extract electrical
          power from the Earth's ambient electric field. </p>
        <p>The leader in this field was Dr Hermann Plauson who in the
          1920s succeeded in generating significant quantities of
          electrical power comparable with modern solar photovoltaic
          systems of a similar scale... </p>
        <p>The leader in this field before the Second World War appears
          to have been Dr Hermann Plauson. Dr Plauson was an Estonian
          citizen who lived in Hamburg and Switzerland. He carried out
          experiments in Finland with aerostats manufactured from
          magnesium-aluminium alloy, covered with electrolytically
          deposited needles. The needles were further doped with a
          radium compound to increase local ionisation of the air. (This
          was the era in which the hands of watches were hand painted
          with radium to make them luminous in the dark).&nbsp; Zinc
          amalgam patches were also painted onto the aerostats.&nbsp;
          Plauson obtained a power output of between 0.72kW and 3.4kW
          from one and two aerostats 300m above ground level. Dr Plauson
          filed patents in the USA, Great Britain and Germany in the
          1920s. His book "Gewinnung und Verwertung der Atmosphärischen
          Elektrizität" is the most detailed known account of the
          technology. </p>
        <p>Other atmospheric electricity researchers contemporary to Dr
          Plauson included Walter Pennock and MW Dewey in the USA, Andor
          Palencsar in Hungary and Dr Heinrich Rudolph in Germany.&nbsp;
          Hippolyte Charles Vion in Paris predated them all, putting
          forward proposals in the 1850s and 1860s. </p>
        <p>Heinrich Rudolph made an interesting contribution to the
          design of the aerostat collectors.&nbsp; In 1898 he designed
          an elliptical aerostat made up of faceted surfaces to minimise
          the effect of wind.&nbsp; The design bears a strong
          resemblance to Northrop's 2003 UCARS unamnned helicopter UAV
          project.&nbsp; The design uses the Coanda Effect to help keep
          the aerostat on station and minimise wind effects. </p>
        <p>In recent times, the only person who seems to have been
          active in this field is Dr Oleg Jefimenko. Dr Jefimenko
          carried out experiments on driving electrostatic motors from
          the Earth's electric field in the 1970s and has recently
          called for research into the neglected field of electrostatic
          motors to be renewed. </p>
        <p><b>MIR's Research Programme</b> </p>
        <p>Since 1997 we have been carrying out theoretical research
          into conversion of atmospheric electricity into useable
          electrical power. </p>
        <p>From a low level (5m high) simple zinc antenna we are able to
          obtain sufficient charge to light a number of white power
          LEDs. Further experimental investigations with metallic
          aerostat collectors and cavity resonant slow wave antennae
          concepts are ongoing... </p>
        <p><b>Advantages of Atmospheric Electricity</b> </p>

        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Be it known that I, Hermann Plauson, Estonian subject, residing
        in Hamburg, Germany, have invented certain new and useful
        improvements in the Conversion of Atmospheric Electric Energy,
        of which the following is a specification. </p>
      <p>Methods of obtaining atmospheric electricity by means of
        metallic nettings set with spikes which are held by means of
        ordinary or anchored kite balloons made of fabric and filled
        with hydrogen, are in theory already known. Atmospheric
        electricity obtained in this way has been suggested to be used
        in the form of direct current for the charging of accumulators.
        This knowledge however is at present only theoretical as the
        conversion in practice has hitherto been a failure. No means are
        known of protecting the apparatus from destruction by lightning.
        The balloons used for collecting the charge must also me be made
        of very large size in order to be able to support the weight of
        the metallic netting and the heavy cable connections. </p>
      <p>Instead of using heavy metallic netting as collectors attached
        to single air ballons of non-conducting materials which are
        liable to be torn and are permeable to the gas, it is proposed
        to use metallic balloon collectors which have the following
        important advantages --- </p>
      <p>(a) The metallic cases are impenetrable to helium and hydrogen;
        they also represent large metallic weather-proof collecting
        surfaces. </p>
      <p>(b) Radio active means the like may be easily applied
        internally or externally; whereby the ionization is considerable
        increased and therewith also the quantity of atmospheric
        electricity capable of being collected. </p>
      <p>(c) Such balloon collectors of light metal do not require to be
        of large size as they have to carry only their own moderate
        weight, and that of the conducting cable or wire. </p>
      <p>(d) The entire system therefore offers little surface for the
        action of storm and wind and is resistant and stable. </p>
      <p>(e) Each balloon can be easily raised and lowered by means of a
        winch so that all repairs, recharging and the like can be
        carried out without danger during the operation. </p>
      <p>It is further proposed to use a collecting aerial network of
        several separate collectors spread out in the air above the
        earth, which collectors are interconnected by electrical
        conductors. </p>
      <p>According to this invention charges of atmospheric electricity
        are not directly converted into mechanical energy, and this
        forms the main difference from previous inventions, but the
        static electricity which runs to earth through aerial conductors
        in the form of direct current of very high voltage and low
        current strength is converted into electro-dynamic energy in the
        form of high frequency vibrations. Many advantages are thereby
        obtained and all disadvantages avoided. </p>
      <p>The very high voltage of static electricity of a low current
        strength can be converted by this invention to voltages more
        suitable for technical purposes and of greater strength. By the
        use of closed oscillatory circuits it is possible to obtain
        electromagnetic waves of various amplitude and thereby to
        increase the degree of resonance of such current. Such resonance
        allows various values of inductance to be chosen whereby again
        the governing of the starting and stopping of machines driven
        thereby by simply tuning the resonance between coils of the
        machine and the transformer circuit forming the resonance can
        easily be obtained. Further, such currents have the property of
        being directly available for various uses, even without
        employing them for driving motors, of which there may be
        particularly mentioned, lighting, production of heat and use in
        electro-chemistry. </p>
      <p>Further, with such currents a series of apparatus may be fed
        without direct current supply through conductors and also the
        electro-magnetic high frequency currents may be converted by
        means of special motors adapted for electro-magnetic
        oscillations into mechanical energy, or finally converted by
        special machines into alternating current of low frequency or
        even into direct current of high potential. </p>

      <p>Figure 1 illustrates a simple diagram for converting static
        electricity into dynamic power of a high number of oscillations.
        For the sake of clearness in the drawings an influence machine
        is assumed to be employed and not an aerial antenna. 13 and 14
        are combs for collecting the static electricity of the influence
        machine. 7 and 8 are spark discharging electrodes. 5 and 6 are
        condensers, 9 an inductive primary coil, 10 secondary coil, 11
        and 12 ends of conductors of the secondary coil 10. When the
        disc of the static influence machine is rotated by mechanical
        means, the combs collect the electric charges one the positive
        and the other the negative, and charge the condensers 5 and 6
        until such a high potential is formed across the spark gap 7-8,
        that the spark gap is jumped. As the spark gap 7-8 forms a
        closed circuit with condensers 5 and 6, and inductive resistance
        9, as is well known, waves of high frequency electromagnetic
        oscillations will pass in this circuit. </p>
      <p>The high frequency of the oscillations produced in the primary
        circuit induces waves of the same periodicity in the secondary
        circuit. Thus in the primary circuit electromagnetic
        oscillations are formed by the passage of the spark over the
        spark gap and these waves are maintained by fresh charges of
        static electricity. </p>
      <p>By suitably selecting the ratio between the number of the coils
        in the primary and secondary circuits with regard to a correct
        application of the co-efficients of resonance (especially,
        inductance and resistance) the high voltage of the primary
        circuit may be suitably converted into low voltage and high
        current strength. </p>
      <p>When the oscillatory discharges in the primary circuit becomes
        weaker or entirely cease, the condensers are charged again by
        the static electricity until the accumulated charge again breaks
        down the spark gap. All this is repeated as long as electricity
        is produced by the static machine employing mechanical energy. </p>
      <p>An elementary form of the invention is shown in Figure 2 in
        which two spark gaps in parallel are used one of which may be
        termed the working gap 7 in Figure 2, whilst the second serves
        as a safety device for excess voltage and consists of a larger
        number of spark gaps than the working section, which gaps are
        arranged in series and are bridged by very small capacities as
        is illustrated in a, b, c, Figure 2 which allow of uniform
        sparking in the safety section. </p>
      <p>In Figure 2 A is the aerial antenna for collecting charges of
        atmospheric electricity. 13 is the earth connection of the
        second part of the spark gap, 5 and 6 are condensers, 9 a
        primary coil. Now when through the aerial A the positive
        atmospheric electricity seeks to combine with the negative
        charge to earth, this is prevented by (the air gap between) the
        spark gaps. The resistance of the spark gap 7 is, as shown in
        the drawings, lower than that of the other safety section which
        consists of three spark gaps connected in series, and
        consequently a three times greater air resistance is offered by
        the latter. </p>
      <p>So long, therefore, as the resistance of the spark gap 7 is not
        overloaded, so that the other spark gaps have an equal
        resistance with it the discharges take place only over spark gap
        7. Should however the voltage be increased by and influences so
        that it might be dangerous for charging the condensers 5 and 6
        or for the coil insulation 9 and 10 in consequence of break
        down, by a correct regulation of this spark gap the second spark
        gap can discharge free from inductive effects direct to earth
        without endangering the machine. </p>
      <p>Without this second spark gap, arranged in parallel having a
        higher resistance than the working spark gap it is impossible to
        collect and render available large quantities of electrical
        energy. </p>
      <p>The actions of this closed oscillation circuit consisting of
        spark gap 7, two condensers 5 and 6, primary coil 9, and also
        secondary coil 10 is exactly the same as the one described in
        Figure 1 with the arrangement of the static induction machine
        with the only difference that here the second spark gap is
        provided. The electromagnetic high frequency alternating current
        obtained can be tapped off from the conductors 11 and 12 for
        lighting and heating purposes. Special kinds of motors adapted
        for working with these peculiar electrical charges may be
        connected at 14 and 15 which can work with static electricity
        charges or with high frequency oscillations. </p>
      <p>In addition to the use of spark gaps in parallel a second
        measure of security is also necessary for taking off the
        current. This precaution consists according to this invention,
        in the introduction of and method of connecting certain
        protective electromagnets or choking coils in the aerial circuit
        as shown by S in Figure 3. </p>
      <p>A single electromagnet only having a core of the thinnest
        possible separate laminations is connected with the aerial. </p>
      <p>In the case of high voltages in the aerial network or at places
        where there are frequent thunder storms, several such magnets
        may however be connected in series. </p>
      <p>In the case of large units or plants several electromagnets can
        be employed in parallel or in series parallel. </p>
      <p>The windings of these electromagnets may be simply connected in
        series with the aerials. In this case the winding preferably
        consists of several thin parallel wires, which make up together,
        the necessary section. </p>
      <p>The winding may be made of primary and secondary windings in
        the form of a transformer. The primary windings will be then
        connected in series with the aerial network, and the secondary
        winding more or less short-circuited over a regulating
        resistance or an induction coil. In the latter case it is
        possible to regulate to a certain extent the effect of the
        choking coils. In the further description of the connecting and
        constructional diagrams the aerial electromagnet choke coil is
        indicated by a simple ring S. </p>

      <p>Figure 3 shows the simplest way of converting atmospheric
        electricity into electromagnetic wave energy by the use of
        special motors adapted for high oscillatory currents or static
        charges of electrical energy. Recent improvements in motors for
        working with static charges and motors working by resonance,
        that is to say, having groups of tuned electromagnetic
        cooperating circuits render this possible but such do not form
        part of the present invention. </p>
      <p>A motor adapted to operate with static charges will for the
        sake of simplicity be diagrammatically indicated by the two
        semicircles 1 and 2 and the rotor of the motor by a ring M
        (Figure 3). A is a vertical aerial or aerial network. S the
        safety choke or electromagnet with coil O as may be seen is
        connected with the aerial A. Adjacent the electromagnet S the
        aerial conductor is divided into three circuits, the circuit 8
        giving the safety spark gap, the circuit 7 with the working
        spark gap, and then a circuit including the stator terminal 1,
        the rotor and stator terminal 2 at which a connection is made to
        the earth wire. The two spark gaps are also connected
        metallically with the earth wire. The method of working these
        diagrams is as follows: </p>
      <p>The positive atmospheric electric charge collected tends to
        combine with the negative electricity (or earth electricity)
        connected with the earth wire. It travels along the aerial A
        through the electromagnet S without begin checked as it flows in
        the same direction as the direct current. Further, its progress
        is arrested by two sparks gaps placed in the way and the stator
        condenser surfaces. The stator condenser surfaces are charged
        until the charge is greater than the resistance of the spark gap
        7, whereupon a spark springs over the spark gap 7 and an
        oscillatory charge is obtained as by means of the motor M,
        stator surfaces 1 and 2, and spark gap 7, a closed oscillation
        circuit is obtained for producing the electromagnetic
        oscillations. The motor here forms the capacity and the
        necessary inductance and resistance, which, as is well known,
        are necessary for converting static electricity into
        electromagnetic wave energy. </p>
      <p>The discharge formed are converted into mechanical energy in
        special motors and cannot reach the aerial network by reason of
        the electromagnet or choke. If, however, when a spark springs
        over the spark gap 7 a greater quantity of atmospheric
        electricity tends to flow to earth, a counter voltage is induced
        in the electromagnet, which is greater the more rapidly and
        strongly the flow of current direct to the earth is. By the
        formation of this opposing voltage a sufficiently high
        resistance is offered to the flow of atmospheric electricity
        direct to earth to prevent a short circuit with the earth. </p>
      <p>The circuit containing spark gap 8 having a different wave
        length which is not in resonance with the natural frequency of
        the motor, does not endanger the motor and serves as security
        against excess voltage, which, as practical experiments have
        shown, may still arise in certain cases, but can be conducted
        direct to earth through this spark gap. </p>
      <p>In the diagram illustrated in Figure 4 the spark gap 7 is
        shunted across condensers 5 and 6 from the motor M. This
        construction affords mainly a better insulation of the motor
        against excess voltage and a uniform excitation through the
        spark gap 7. </p>
      <p>In Figure 5 a diagram is illustrated for transforming large
        current strengths which may be employed direct without motors,
        for example, for lighting or heating purposes. The main
        difference is that here the spark gap consists of as star shaped
        disk 7 which can rotate on its own axis and is rotated by a
        motor opposite similarly fitted electrodes 7a. When separate
        points of stars face one another, discharges take place, thus
        forming an oscillation circuit over condensers 5 and 6, and
        inductance 9 for oscillatory discharges. It is evident that a
        motor may also be directly connected to the ends of the spiral
        9. </p>
      <p>The construction of the diagram shown in Figure 6 permits of
        the oscillation circuit of the motor being connected with an
        induction coil/ Here a regulating inductive resistance is
        introduced for counter-acting excess voltages in the motor. By
        cutting the separate coils 9 (coupled inductively to the aerial)
        in or out the inductive action on the motor may be more or less
        increased or variable aerial action may be exerted on the
        oscillation circuit. </p>

        <p><img src="1540-7-13.jpg" height="694" width="541"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In Figure 7 the oscillation circuit is closed through the earth
        (E and E1). The spark gap 7 may be prolonged or shortened by
        more or fewer spark gaps being successively connected by means
        of a contact arm 7b. </p>
      <p>Diagram 8 shows a unipolar connection of the motor with the
        aerial network. Here two oscillation circuits are closed through
        the same motor. The first oscillation circuit passes from aerial
        A through electromagnet S, point <i>x</i>, inductance 9a to the
        earth condenser 6 and further, over spark gap 7 to the aerial
        condenser 5 and back to <i>x</i>. The second oscillation
        circuit starts from the aerial condenser 5 at the point x<sup>1</sup>
        over the inductance 9 to the earth condenser 6 at the point x<sup>3</sup>
        and through the condenser 6 over the spark gap 7 back to x<sup>1</sup>.
        The motor itself is inserted between the two points of the spark
        gap 7. From this arrangement slightly damped oscillation wave
        currents are produced. </p>
      <p>In the diagram illustrated in Figure 9 a loosely coupled system
        of connections is illustrated which is assumed to be for small
        motors for measuring purposes. A indicates the aerial conductor,
        S the electromagnet in the aerial conductor, 9 the inductance, 7
        the spark gap, 5 and 6 condensers, E the earth, M the motor, and
        1 and 2 stator connections of the motor. The motor is directly
        metallically connected with the oscillation circuit. </p>
      <p>In Figure 10 a purely inductive coupling is employed for the
        motor circuit. The motor is connected with the secondary wire 10
        as may be seen in Figure 11 in a somewhat modified diagram
        connection. The same applies to the diagram of Figure 12. </p>
      <p>The diagrams hitherto described preferably allow of motors of
        small and medium strength to be operated. For large aggregates,
        however, they are too inconvenient as the construction of two or
        more oscillation circuits for large amounts of energy is
        difficult; the governing is still more difficult and the danger
        in switching on or off is greater. </p>
      <p>A means of overcoming such difficulties is shown in Figure 13.
        The oscillation circuit here runs starting from the point x over
        condenser 5, variable inductance 9, spark gap 7, and the two
        segments (3a and 4a) forming arms of a Wheatstone bridge, back
        to x, If the motor is connected by brushes 3 and 4 transversely
        to the two arms of the bridge as shown in the drawings,
        electromagnetic oscillations of equal sign are induced in the
        stator surfaces 1 and 2 and the motor does not revolve. If
        however the brushes 3 and 4 are moved in common with the
        conducting wires 1 and 2 which connect the brushes with the
        stator poles a certain alteration or displacement of the
        polarity is obtained and the motor commences to revolve. </p>
      <p>The maximum action will result if one brush 3 comes on the
        central sparking contact 7 and the other brush 4 on the part <i>x</i>.
        They are however, usually in practice not brought on the central
        contact 7 but only held in the path of the bridge segments 4a
        and 3a in order not to connect the spark gaps with the motor
        oscillation circuit. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1540-14-20.jpg" height="794" width="445"></p>
      </center>
      <p>As however, the entire oscillation energy can thereby not act
        on the motor it is better to carry out the same system according
        to the diagram 14. The diagram 14 differs from the foregoing
        only by the motor not being directly metallically connected with
        the segments of the commutator, but only a primary coil 9 which
        induces in a secondary coil 10, current which feeds the motor M
        and takes the place of the rotor. By this arrangement a good
        transforming action is obtained, a loose coupling and also an
        oscillation circuit without a spark gap. </p>
      <p>In Figure 15 the motor is not purely inductive as in 14, but
        directly metallically branched off from the primary coil (at <i>x</i>
        and <i>x</i><sup>1</sup>) after the principle of the
        auto-transformer. </p>
      <p>In Figure 16 instead of an inductance a condenser 6 is in
        similar manner, and for the same object inserted between the
        segments 3a and 4a. This has the advantage that the segments 3a
        and 4a need not be made of solid metal but may consist of spiral
        coils whereby a more exact regulation is possible and further
        motors of high inductance may be employed. </p>
      <p>The arrangements of Figures 17, 18 and 19 may be employed for
        use with resonance and particularly with induction condenser
        motors; between the large stator induction condenser surfaces,
        small reversing pole condenser surfaces, mall reversing pole
        condensers are connected, which, as may be seen from Figures 17,
        18 and 19 are led together to earth. Such reversing poles have
        the advantage that with large quantities of electrical energy
        the spark formation between the separate oscillation circuits
        ceases. </p>
      <p>Figure 19 shows a further method which prevents electromagnetic
        oscillations of high number of alternations formed in the
        oscillation circuit striking back to the aerial conductor. It is
        based on the well known principle that a mercury lamp, one
        electrode of which is formed of mercury, the other of solid
        metal such as steel allows an electric charge to pass in only
        one direction from the mercury to the steel and not vice versa.
        The mercury electrode of the vacuum tube N is therefore
        connected with the aerial conductor and the steel electrode with
        the oscillation circuit. From this it results that charges can
        pass only from the aerial through the vacuum tube to the
        oscillation circuit, but not vice versa. Oscillations which are
        formed on being transformed in the oscillation circuit cannot
        pass to the aerial conductor. </p>
      <p>In practice these vacuum tubes must be connected behind an
        electromagnet as the latter alone affords no protection against
        the danger of lightning. </p>
      <p>As regards the use of spark gaps, all arrangements as used for
        wireless telegraphy may be used. Of course the spark gaps in
        large machines must have a sufficiently large surface. In very
        large stations they are cooled in liquid carbonic acid or better
        still in liquid nitrogen or hydrogen; in most cases the cooling
        may also take place by means of liquefied low homologues of the
        metal series or by means of hydrocarbons the freezing point of
        which lies at between –90° C and –40° C. The spark gap casing
        must also be insulated and be of sufficient strength to be able
        to resist any pressure which may arise. Any undesirable excess
        super-pressure which may be formed must be automatically let
        off. I have employed wit very good results mercury electrodes
        which were frozen in liquid carbonic acid, the cooling being
        maintained during the operation from the outside through the
        walls. </p>
      <p>Figure 20 is one of the simplest forms of construction of an
        aerial network in combination with collectors, transformers and
        the like illustrated diagrammatically. E is here the earth wire,
        8 the safety spark gap, 7 the working spark gap, 1 and 2 the
        stator surfaces of the motor, 5 a condenser battery, S the
        protective magnet which is connected with the coil in aerial
        conductor, A<sup>1</sup> to A<sup>10</sup> aerial antennae with
        collecting balloons, N horizontal collecting or connecting wire
        from which, to the center a number of connections run. </p>
      <p>The actual collectors consist of metal sheaths preferably made
        of an aluminum magnesium alloy, and are filled with hydrogen or
        helium and are attached t copper plated steel wires. The size of
        the balloon is selected so that the actual weight of the balloon
        and the weight of the conducting wire is supported thereby. On
        top of the balloon aluminum spikes, made and gilded in a special
        manner hereinafter described, are arranged in order to produce a
        conductor action. Small quantities of radium preparations, more
        particularly polonium-ionium or meso-thorium preparations
        considerably increase the ionization, and therewith the action
        of these collectors. </p>
      <p>In addition to metal balloons, fabric balloons which are
        superficially metal coated according to Schoop’s metal spraying
        process, may also be employed. A metallic surface may also me
        produced by lacquering with metallic bronzes, preferably
        according to Schoop’s spraying process or lacquering with
        metallic bronze powders in two electrical series of widely
        different metals, because thereby the collecting effect is
        considerably increased. </p>
      <p>Instead of the ordinary round balloons, elongated cigar shaped
        ones may be employed. In order also to utilize the frictional
        energy of the wind, patches or strips of non-conducting
        substances which produce electricity by friction, may be
        attached to the metalized balloon surfaces. The wind will impart
        a portion of its energy in the form of frictional electricity,
        to the balloon casing, and thereby the collecting effect is
        substantially increased. </p>
      <p>In practice however, very high towers (up to 300 meters is
        fully admissible) may be employed as antennae. In these towers
        copper tubes rise freely further above the top of the tower. A
        gas lamp secured against the wind is then lit at the point of
        the copper tube and a netting is secured to the copper tube over
        the flame of this lamp to form a collector. The gas is conveyed
        through the interior of the tube up to the summit. The copper
        tube must be absolutely protected from moisture at the place at
        which it enters the tower and also rain must be prevented
        running down the walls of the tower which might lead to a bad
        catastrophe. This is done by bell shaped enlargements which
        expand downwards, being arranged in the tower in the form of
        high voltage insulators of Siamese pagodas. </p>
      <p>Special attention must be devoted to the foundations of such
        towers. They must be well insulated from the ground, which may
        be obtained by first embedding a layer of concrete in a box form
        to a sufficient depth in the ground and inserting in this an
        asphalt lining and then glass bricks cast about 1 or 2 meters in
        thickness. Over this in turn there is a ferro-concrete layer in
        which alone the metal foot of the tube is secured. This concrete
        block must be at least 2 meters from the ground and be fully
        protected at the sides by a wooden covering, from moisture. In
        the lower part of the tower a wood or glass house for the large
        condenser batteries or for the motors may be constructed. In
        order to lead the earth connection to the ground water, a well
        insulated pit constructed of vitreous brick, must be provided.
        Several such towers are erected at equal distances apart and
        connected with a horizontal conductor. The horizontal connecting
        wires may either run directly from tower to tower or be carried
        on bell shaped insulators similar to those in use for high
        voltage conductors. The width of the network may be of any
        suitable size and the connection of the motors can take place at
        any suitable places. </p>

        <p><img src="1540-21-23.jpg" height="478" width="743"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In order to collect large quantities of electricity with few
        aerials it is well to provide the aerial conductor with
        batteries of condensers as shown in Figures 21 and 22. In Figure
        21 the batteries of condensers 5 are connected on the one hand
        with the aerial electricity collectors Z by the aerial conductor
        A, and on the other hand interconnected in series with an
        annular conductor from which horizontal conductors run to the
        connecting points C to which the earth wire is connected. </p>
      <p>Figure 22 shows a similar arrangement, Should two such series
        of antennae rings be shown by a voltmeter to have a large
        difference of potential (for example, one in the mountains and
        one in the plain) or even of different polarity these
        differences may be compensated for by connecting sufficiently
        large condenser batteries (5, 5a, 5b) by means of Maji star
        conductors D and D<sup>1</sup>. In Figure 23 a connection of
        three such rings of collectors to form a triangle with a central
        condenser battery is illustrated. </p>
      <p>The condenser batteries of such large installations must be
        embedded in liquid gases or in liquids freezing at very low
        temperatures. In such cases a portion of the atmospheric energy
        must be employed for liquefying these gases. It is also
        preferable to employ pressure. By this means the condenser
        surfaces may be diminished, and still allow for large quantities
        of energy to be stored, secure against breakdown. For smaller
        installation the immersing of the condensers in well-insulated
        oil or the like, suffices. Solid substances on the other hand
        cannot be employed as insulators. </p>
      <p>The arrangement in the diagrams hitherto described was always
        such that the condenser batteries were connected with both poles
        directly to the aerial condensers. An improved diagram of the
        connections for obtaining atmospheric electricity for the
        condenser batteries has however, been found to be very
        advantageous. This arrangement consists in that they are
        connected only by one pole (unipolar) to the collecting network.
        Such a method of arrangement is very important, as by means of
        it a constant current and an increase of the normal working
        pressure or voltage is obtained. If for example a collecting
        balloon aerial which is allowed to rise to a height of 300
        meters, shows 40,000 volts above earth voltage, in practice it
        has been found that the working voltage (with a withdrawal of
        the power according to the method hereinbefore described by
        means of oscillating spark gaps and the like) is only about 400
        volts. If however, the capacity of the condenser surfaces be
        increased, which capacity in the above mentioned case was equal
        to that of the collecting surface of the balloon aerials, to
        double the amount, by connecting the condenser batteries with
        only one pole, the voltage rises under an equal withdrawal of
        current up to and beyond 500 volts. This can only be ascribed to
        the favorable action of the connecting method. </p>
      <p>In addition to this substantial improvement it has also been
        found preferable to insert double inductances with
        electromagnets and to place the capacities preferably between
        two such electromagnets. It has also been found that the useful
        action of such condensers can be further increased if an
        induction coil be connected as inductive resistance to the
        unconnected pole of the condenser, or still better if the
        condenser itself be made as an induction condenser. Such a
        condenser may be compared with a spring which when compressed
        carries in itself accumulated force, which it again gives off
        when released. In charging, a charge with reversed sign is
        formed at the other free condenser pole, and if through the
        spark gap a short circuit results, the accumulated energy is
        again given back since now new quantities of energy are induced
        at the condenser pole connected with the conductor network,
        which in fact charges with opposite signs to that at the free
        condenser pole. The new induced charges have of course the same
        sign as the collector network. The whole voltage energy in the
        aerial is thereby however increased. In the same space of time
        larger quantities of energy are accumulated than is the case
        without such inserted condenser batteries. </p>

      <p>In Figures 24 and 25 two different diagrams of connections are
        more exactly illustrated, Figure 24 shows a collecting balloon
        and the diagram of the connections to earth. Figure 25 shows
        four collecting balloons and the parallel connection of the
        condenser batteries belonging thereto. </p>
      <p>A is the collecting balloon made of an aluminum magnesium alloy
        (electron metal, magnalium) of a specific gravity of 1.8 and a
        thickness of plate 0.1 to 0.2 mm. Insider there are eight strong
        vertical ribs of T-shaped section about 10 to 20 mm in height
        and about 3 mm in thickness with the projecting part directed
        inwards (indicated by a, b, c, d and so forth); they are riveted
        together to form a firm skeleton and are stiffened in a
        horizontal direction by two cross ribs. The ribs are further
        connected with one another internally and transversely by means
        of thin steel wires, whereby the balloon obtains great power of
        resistance and elasticity. Rolled plates of 0.1 to 0.2 mm in
        thickness made of magnalium alloy are then either soldered or
        riveted on this skeleton so that a fully metallic casing with
        smooth external surface is obtained Well silvered or coppered
        aluminum plated steel wires run from each rib to the fastening
        ring 2. Further, the coppered steel hawser L preferably twisted
        out of separate thin wires (shown in dotted lines in Figure 24)
        and which must be long enough to allow the balloon to rise in
        the desired height, leads to a metal roller or pulley 3 and from
        thence to a winch W, well insulated from the earth. By means of
        this winch, the balloon, which is filled with hydrogen, or
        helium, can be allowed to rise to a suitable height (300 to 5000
        meters) and brought to the ground for recharging or repairs. </p>
      <p>The actual current is taken directly through a friction contact
        from the metal roller 3 or from the wire, or even from the winch
        or simultaneously from all three by means of brushes (3, 3a and
        3b). Beyond the brushes the conductor is divided, the paths
        being: --- firstly over 12 to the safety spark gap 8, from
        thence to the earth conductor E<sup>1</sup>, and secondly over
        electromagnet S<sup>1</sup>, point 13, to a second loose
        electromagnet having an adjustable coil S<sup>2</sup>, then to
        the spark gap 7 and to the second earth conductor E<sup>2</sup>.
        The actual working circuit is formed through the spark gap 7,
        condensers 5 and 6, and through the primary coil 9; here the
        static electricity formed by oscillatory discharges is
        accumulated and converted into high frequency electromagnetic
        oscillations. Between the electromagnets S<sup>1</sup> and S<sup>2</sup>
        at the crossing point 13, four condenser batteries are
        introduced which are only indicated diagrammatically in the
        drawings each by one condenser. Two of these batteries (16 and
        18) are made as plate condensers and prolonged by regulating
        induction coils or spirals 17 and 19 while the two others (21
        and 23) are induction condensers. As may be seen from the
        drawings each of the four condenser batteries 16, 18, 21 and 23
        is connected by only one pole to the aerial or to the collector
        conductor. The second poles 17, 19, 22 and 24 are open. In the
        case of plate condensers having no inductive resistance an
        induction coil is inserted. The object of such a spiral or coil
        is the displacement of phase by the induction current by 1/4
        periods, whilst that of the charging current of the condenser
        poles which lie free in the air, works back to the collector
        aerial. The consequence of this is that in discharges in the
        collector aerial the back inductive action of the free poles
        allows a higher voltage to be maintained in the aerial
        collecting conductor than would otherwise be the case. It has
        also been found that such a back action has an extremely
        favorable effect on the wear of the contacts. Of course the
        inductive effect may be regulated at will within the limits of
        the size of the induction coil, the length of the coil in action
        being adjustable by means of wire connection without induction
        (see Figure 24, No. 20). </p>
      <p>S<sup>1</sup> and S<sup>2</sup> may also be provided with such
        regulating devices in the case of S<sup>2</sup> (illustrated by
        11). If excess voltage be formed it is conducted to earth
        through the wire 12 and spark gap 8 or through any other
        suitable apparatus, since this formation would be dangerous for
        the other apparatus. </p>
      <p>The small circles on the collector balloon indicate places at
        which zinc amalgam or gold amalgam or other photoelectric acting
        metals in the form of small patches in extremely thin layers
        (0.01 to 0.05 mm in thickness) are applied to the entire balloon
        as well as in greater thickness to the conducting network. The
        capacity of the collector is thereby considerably strengthened
        at the surface. The greatest possible effect in collecting may
        be obtained by polonium amalgams and the like. On the surface of
        the collector balloon metal points or spikes are also fixed
        along the ribs, which spikes serve particularly for collecting
        the collector charge. Since it is well known that the resistance
        of the spikes is less the sharper the spike is, for this purpose
        it is therefore extremely important to employ as sharp spikes as
        possible. Experiments made as regards these have shown that the
        formation of the body of the spike or point also plays a large
        part, for example, spikes made of bars or rollers with smooth
        surface, have a many times greater point resistance as collector
        accumulator spikes than those with rough surfaces. Various kinds
        of spike bodies have been experimented with for the collector
        balloons hereinbefore mentions. The best results were given by
        spikes which were made in the following way. Fine points made of
        steel, copper, nickel, or copper and nickel alloys, were
        fastened together in bundles and then placed as anode with the
        points in a suitable electrolyte (preferably in hydrochloric
        acid or muriate of iron solutions) and so treated with weak
        current at 2 to 3 volts pressure. After 2 to 3 hours according
        to the thickness of the spikes or pins the points become
        extremely sharp and the bodies of the spikes have a rough
        surface. The bundle can then be removed and the acid washed off
        with water. The spikes are then placed as cathode in a batch
        consisting of solution of gold, platinum, iridium, palladium or
        wolfram salts or their compounds and coated a the cathode
        galvanically with a thin layer of precious metal, which must
        however be sufficiently firm to protect them from atmospheric
        oxidation. </p>
      <p>Such spikes act at a 20-fold lower voltage almost as well as
        the best and finest points made by mechanical means. Still
        better results are obtained if polonium or radium salts are
        added to the galvanic bat when forming he protective layer or
        coating. Such pins have a low resistance at their points and
        even at one volt and still lower pressures have an excellent
        collector action. </p>
      <p>In Figure 24 the three unconnected poles are not connected with
        one another in parallel. That is quite possible in practice
        without altering the principle of the free pole. It is also
        preferable to interconnect in parallel to a common collector
        network, a series of collecting aerials. </p>
      <p>Figure 25 shows a diagram for such an installation. A<sup>1</sup>,
        A<sup>2</sup>, A<sup>3</sup>, A<sup>4</sup> are four metal
        collector balloons with gold or platinum coated spikes which are
        electrolytically made in the presence of polonium emanations or
        radium salts, which spikes or needles are connected over four
        electromagnets S<sup>1</sup>, S<sup>2</sup>, S<sup>3</sup>, S<sup>4</sup>,
        through an annular conductor R. From this annular conductor four
        wires run over four further electromagnets Sa, Sb, Sc, Sd, to
        the connecting point 13. There the conductor is divided, one
        branch passing over 12 and the safety spark gap 8 to the earth
        at E<sup>1</sup>, the other over inductive resistance J and
        working spark gap 7 to the earth at E<sup>2</sup>. The working
        circuit, consisting of the condenser 5 and 6 and a resonance
        motor M, such as hereinbefore described, is connected in
        proximity round the sparking gap section 7. </p>
      <p>Instead of directly connecting the condenser motor of course
        the primary circuit for high frequency oscillatory current may
        also be inserted. </p>
      <p>The condenser batteries are connected by one pole to the
        annular conductor R and can be either inductionless (16 and 18)
        or made as induction condensers as shown by 21 and 23. The free
        poles of the inductionless condensers are indicated by 17 and
        19, those of the induction condensers by 22 and 24. As may be
        seen from the drawings all these poles 17, 22, 19, 24 may be
        interconnected in parallel through a second annular conductor
        without any fear that thereby the principle of the free pole
        connection will be injured. In addition to the advantages
        already set forth the parallel connection also allows of an
        equalization of the working pressure in the entire collector
        network. Suitable constructed and calculated induction coils 25
        and 26 may also be inserted in the annular conductor of the free
        poles, by means of which a circuit may be formed in the
        secondary coils 27 and 28 which allows current produced in this
        annular conductor by fluctuations of the charges of the like
        appearances to be measured or otherwise utilized. </p>
      <p>According to what has been hereinbefore stated separate
        collector balloons may be connected at equidistant stations
        distributed over the entire country, either connected directly
        with one another metallically or by means of intermediate
        suitably connected condenser batteries through high voltage
        conductors insulated from earth. The static electricity is
        converted through a spark gap into dynamic energy of a high
        number of oscillations and may in such form be coupled as a
        source of energy b y means of a suitable method f connecting,
        various precautions being observed and with special regulations.
        The wires leading from the collector balloons have hitherto been
        connected through an annular conductor without this endless
        connection, which can be regarded as an endless induction coil,
        being able to exert any action on the whole conductor system. </p>
      <p>It has now been found that if the network conductor connecting
        the aerial collector balloons with one another is not made as a
        simple annular conductor, but preferably short circuited in the
        form of coils over a condenser battery or spark gap or through
        thermionic tubes or valves or audions, then the total collecting
        network exhibits quite new properties. The collection of
        atmospheric electricity is thereby not only increased but an
        alternating field may be easily produced in the collector
        network. Further, the atmospheric electrical forces showing
        themselves in the higher regions may also be directly obtained
        by induction. In Figures 26 and 28 a form of construction is
        shown on the basis of which the further foundations of the
        method will be more particularly explained. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1540-26.jpg" height="455" width="376"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In Figure 26, 1, 2, 3, 4 are metal collector balloons, 5, 6, 7,
        8 their metallic aerial conductors and I the actual collector
        network. This consists of five coils and is mounted on high
        voltage insulators in the air, in high voltage masts (or with a
        suitable construction of cable embedded in the earth). One coil
        has a diameter of 1 or 100 km or more. S and S<sup>1</sup> are
        two protective electromagnets, F the second safety section
        against excess voltage, E its earth conductor and E1 the earth
        conductor of the working section. When an absorption of static
        atmospheric electricity is effected through the four balloon
        collectors, the current in order to reach the earth connection
        E1 must flow spirally through the collector network over the
        electromagnet S, primary induction coil 9, conductor 14, anode A
        of the audion tube, incandescent cathode K, as the way over the
        electromagnet and safety spark gap F offers considerably greater
        resistance. Owing to the fact that the accumulated current flows
        in one direction, an electromagnetic alternating field is
        produced in the interior of the collector network coil, whereby
        the whole free electrons are directed more or less into the
        interior of the coil. An increased ionization of the atmosphere
        is thereby produced. In consequence of this the points mounted
        on the collector balloon show a considerably reduced resistance
        and therefore increased static charges between the points on the
        balloon and the surrounding atmosphere are produced. The result
        of this is a considerably increased collector effect. </p>
      <p>A second effect which could not be obtained otherwise is
        obtained by the electromagnetic alternating field which running
        parallel to the earth surface, acts more or less with a
        diminishing or increasing effect on the earth magnetic field,
        whereby in the case of fluctuations in the current a return
        induction current of reversed sign is always produced in the
        collector coil by earth magnetism. Now if, however, a constantly
        pulsating continuous alternating field is produced as stated in
        the above collector network I, an alternating current of the
        same periodicity is produced also in the collecting network
        coil. As the same alternating field is further transmitted to
        the aerial balloon, the resistance to its points is thereby
        considerably reduced, whilst the collector action is
        considerably increased. A further advantage is that positive
        electrons which collect on the metal surfaces during the
        conversion into dynamic current produce a so-called drop of
        potential of the collector area. As an alternating field is
        present, the negative ions surrounding the collectors surfaces,
        when discharge of the collector surfaces takes place produce by
        the law of induction, an induction of reversed sign on the
        collector surface and so forth (that is to say again a positive
        charge). In addition to the advantages hereinbefore set forth,
        the construction of connecting conductors in coil form when of
        sufficiently large diameter, allows of a utilization of energy
        arising in higher regions also in the simplest way. As is well
        known electric discharges frequently take place at very great
        elevations which may be observed as St Elmo’s fire or northern
        lights. These energy quantities have no been available to be
        utilized up to now. By this invention all these kinds of energy,
        as they are of an electromagnetic nature and the direction of
        axis of the collector coils stands at right angles to the
        earth’s surface, can be more or less absorbed in the same way as
        a receiver in wireless telegraphy absorbs waves coming from a
        far distance. With a large diameter of the spiral it is possible
        to connect large surfaces and thereby to take up also large
        quantities of energy. </p>
      <p>It is well known that large wireless stations in the summer
        months, and also in the tropics are very frequently unable to
        receive the signals in consequence of interruptions which are
        caused by atmospheric electricity, and this takes place with
        vertical coils of only 40 to 100 meters diameter. If on the
        contrary horizontal coils of 1 to 100 km diameter be employed
        very strong currents may be obtained through discharges which
        are constantly taking place in the atmosphere. Particularly in
        the tropics or still better in the polar regions where the
        northern lights are constantly present, large quantities of
        energy may probably be obtained in this way. A coil with several
        windings should act the best. In similar manner any alteration
        of the earth magnetism should act inductively on such a coil. </p>
      <p>It is not at all unlikely that earthquakes and spots on the sun
        will also produce an induction in such collector coils of
        sufficient size. In similar manner this collector conductor will
        react on earth current more particularly when they are near the
        surface of the earth or even embedded in the earth. By combining
        the previous kind of current collectors so far as they are
        adapted for the improved system with the improved possibilities
        of obtaining current the quantities of free natural electricity
        which are to be obtained in the form of electricity are
        considerably increased. </p>
      <p>In order to produce in the improved collector coil uniform
        current oscillations of an undamped nature so-called audion high
        vacuum or thermionic tubes of suitable connection are employed
        instead of the previously known spark gaps (Figure 26, Nos.
        9-18). The main aerial current flows through electromagnet S
        (which in the case of a high number of alternations is not
        connected here but in the earth conductor E<sup>1</sup>) and may
        be conveyed over the primary coils in the induction winding
        through wire 14 to the anode A of the high vacuum grid tube.
        Parallel with the induction resistance 9 a regulating capacity
        of suitable size, such as condenser 11 is inserted. In the lower
        part of the vacuum grid tube is arranged the incandescent
        filament or the cathode K which is fed through a battery B. From
        the battery B two branches run, one to the earth conductor E<sup>1</sup>
        and the other through battery B<sup>1</sup> and secondary coil
        10 to the grid above <i>g</i> in the vacuum tube. By the method
        of connections shown in dotted lines, a desired voltage at the
        grid electrode <i>g</i> may also be produced through the wire
        17 which is branched off from the main current conductor through
        switches 16 and some small condensers (<i>a, b, c, d</i>)
        connected in series, and conductor 18, without the battery B<sup>1</sup>
        being required. </p>
      <p>The action of the entire system is somewhat as follows: -- </p>
      <p>On the connecting conductor of the aerial collector network
        being short circuited to earth, the condenser pole 11 is charged
        and slightly damped oscillations are formed in the short
        circuited existing oscillation circuit formed of the condenser
        11 and self inductance 9. In consequence of the coupling through
        coil 10, fluctuations of voltage take place in the grid circuit
        15 with the same frequency, which, fluctuations in turn
        influence the strength of the electrode current passing through
        the high vacuum amplifying tube and thus produce current
        fluctuations of the same frequency in the anode circuit. A
        permanent supply of energy to the oscillation circuits 9 and 10
        consequently takes place, until a condition of balance is set
        up, in which the consumed oscillation energy is equal to that
        absorbed. Thereby constant undamped oscillations are now
        produced in the oscillation circuits 9-11. </p>
      <p>For regular working of such oscillation producers high vacuum
        strengthening tubes are necessary and it is also necessary that
        the grid and anode voltages shall have a phase difference of
        180° so that if the grid is negatively charged, then the anode
        is positively charged and vice versa. This necessary difference
        of phase may be obtained by most varied connections, for
        example, by placing the oscillation circuit in the grid circuit
        or by separating the oscillation circuit and inductive coupling
        from the anodes and the grid circuit and so forth. </p>
      <p>A second important factor in this way of converting static
        atmospheric electricity into undamped oscillations is that care
        must be taken hat the grid and anode voltages have a certain
        relation to one another; the latter may be obtained by altering
        the coupling and a suitable selection of the self-induction in
        the grid circuit, or as shown by dotted lines 16, 17, 18 by
        means of a larger or smaller number of condensers of suitable
        size connected in series; in this case the battery B<sup>1</sup>
        may be omitted. With a suitable selection of the grid potential
        a glow discharge takes place between the grid <i>g</i> and the
        anode A, and accordingly at the grid there is a cathode drop and
        a dark space is formed. The size of this cathode drop is
        influenced by the ions which are emitted in the lower space in
        consequence of shock ionization of the incandescent cathodes K
        and pass through the grid in the upper space. On the other hand
        the number of ions passing through the grid is dependent on the
        voltage between the grid and the cathode. Thus is the grid
        voltage undergoes periodic fluctuations (as in the present case)
        the amount of the cathode drop at the grid fluctuates and
        consequently the internal resistance of the tube correspondingly
        fluctuates, so that when a back coupling of the feed circuit
        with the grid circuit takes place, the necessary means are
        afforded for producing undamped oscillations and of taking
        current, according to requirements from the collecting
        conductor. </p>
      <p>The frequency of the undamped oscillations produced is with a
        suitably loose coupling equal to the self-frequency of the
        oscillation circuits 9 and 10. By a suitable selection of the
        self induction of the coil 9 and capacity 11 it is possible to
        extend from frequencies which produce electromagnetic
        oscillation of only a few meters wavelength down to the lowest
        practical alternating current frequency. For large installations
        a suitable number of frequency-producing tubes of the well-known
        high vacuum transmission tubes of 0.5 to 2 kw in size may be
        connected in parallel so that in this respect no difficulty
        exists. </p>
      <p>The use of such tubes for producing undamped oscillations, and
        also the construction and method of inserting such transmission
        tubes in an accumulator or dynamo circuit is known and also that
        such oscillation producing tubes only work well at voltages of
        1000 up to 4000 volts, so that on the contrary their use at
        lower voltages is considerably more difficult. By the use of
        high voltage static electricity this method of producing
        undamped oscillations as compared with that through spark gaps
        must be regarded as an ideal solution particularly for small
        installations of outputs of from 1 to 100 kw. </p>
      <p>By the application of safety spark gaps, with interpolation of
        electromagnets, not only is short-circuiting avoided but also
        the taking up of current is regulated. Oscillation producers
        inserted in the above way form a constantly acting
        electromagnetic alternating field in the collector coil, whereby
        as already stated, a considerable accumulating effect takes
        place. The withdrawal wire or working wire is connected at 12
        and 13, but current may be taken by means of a secondary coil
        which is firmly or movable mounted in any suitable way inside
        the large collector coil, i.e., in its electromagnetic
        alternating field, so long as the direction of its axis runs
        parallel with that of the main current collecting coil. </p>
      <p>In producing undamped oscillations of a high frequency (50,000
        per second or more) in the oscillation circuits 9 and 11,
        electromagnets S and S<sup>1</sup> must be inserted if the high
        frequency oscillations are not to penetrate the collector oil,
        between the oscillation producers and the collector coil. In all
        other cases they are connected shortly before the earthing (as
        in Figures 27 and 28). </p>

      <p>In Figure 27 a second method of construction of the connecting
        conductor of the balloon aerials is illustrated in the form of a
        coil. The main difference consists in that in addition to the
        connecting conductor I another annular conductor II is inserted
        parallel to the former on the high voltage masts in the air (or
        embedded as a cable in the earth) but both in te form of a coil.
        The connecting wire of the balloon aerials is indicated as a
        primary conductor and also as a current producing network; the
        other is the consumption network and is not in unipolar
        connection with the current producing network. </p>
      <p>In Figure 27 the current producing network I is shown with
        three balloon collectors 1, 2, 3 and aerial conductors 4, 5, 6;
        it is short-circuited through condenser 19 and inductance 9. The
        oscillation forming circuit consists in this diagram of spark
        gap f, inductance 10, and condenser 11; the earth wire E, is
        connected to earth over electromagnet S<sup>1</sup>. F s the
        safety spark gap which is also connected to earth through a
        second electromagnet S at E. On connecting up the condenser
        circuit 11 this is charged over the spark gap f whereby an
        oscillatory discharge is formed. This discharging current acts
        through inductance 10 on the inductively coupled secondary 9,
        whereby in the producing network a modification of the potential
        of the condenser 19 is produced. The consequence of this is that
        oscillations arise in the coil shaped producer network. These
        oscillations induce a current in the secondary circuit II, which
        has a smaller number of windings and a less resistance, the
        voltage of which, according to the proportion of the number of
        windings and of the ohmic resistance, is considerably lower
        whilst the current strength is greater. </p>
      <p>In order to convert the current thus obtained into current of
        an undamped character, and to tune its wavelengths, a
        sufficiently large regulatable capacity 20 in inserted between
        the ends 12 and 13 of the secondary conductor II. Here also
        current may be taken without an earthy conductor, but it is
        advisable to insert a safety spark gap E1 and to connect this
        with the earth over an electromagnet S2. </p>
      <p>The producer network may be connected with the working network
        II over an inductionless condenser 21 or over an induction
        condenser 22, 23. In this case the secondary conductor is
        unipolarly connected with the energy conductor. </p>

      <p>In Figure 28 the connecting conductor between the separate
        accumulator balloons is carried out according to the
        autotransformer principle. The collecting coil connects four
        aerial balloons 1, 2, 3, 4, the windings of which are not made
        side by side but one above the other. In Figure 28 the collector
        coil I is shown with a thin line, the metallically connected
        prolongation coils II with a thick line. Between the ends I<sup>1</sup>
        and II<sup>1</sup> of the energy network I a regulating capacity
        19 is inserted. The wire I<sup>1</sup> is connected with the
        output wire and with the spark gap F. </p>
      <p>As transformer of the atmospheric electricity an arrangement is
        employed which consists in using rotary pairs of condensers in
        which the one stator surface B is connected with the main
        current, whilst the other A is connected with the earth pole.
        Between these pairs of short-circuited condensers are caused to
        rotate from which the converted current can be taken by means of
        two collector rings and brushes, in the form of an alternating
        current, the frequency of which is dependent on the number of
        balloons and the revolutions of the rotor. As the alternating
        current formed in the rotor can act, in this improved method of
        connection described in this invention, through coils 1 on the
        inductance 9, an increase or diminution of the feed current in I
        can be obtained according to the direction of the current by
        back induction. Current oscillations of uniform rhythm thereby
        result in the coil shaped windings of the produce network. </p>
      <p>As the ends of this conductor are short-circuited through the
        regulatable condenser 19 these rhythms produce short-circuited
        undamped oscillations in the energy conductor, the periodicity
        and wave lengths of which oscillations can be adjusted according
        to desire by altering the capacity 19 to a given wavelength and
        therewith also to a given frequency. These currents may also be
        employed in this form directly as working current through the
        conductors II<sup>1</sup> and III. By inserting the condenser 20
        a connection between these conductors may also be made, whereby
        harmonic oscillations of desired wavelengths are formed. By this
        means quite new effects as regards current distribution are
        obtained. The withdrawal of current can even take place without
        direct wire connection if, at a suitable point in the interior
        of the producing network (quite immaterially whether this has a
        diameter of 1 or 100 km) a coil tuned to these wavelengths and
        of the desired capacity is firmly or movably mounted in the
        aerial conductor in such a way that is axial direction is in
        parallel with that of the collector coil. In this case a current
        is induced in the producing network, the size of which is
        dependent on the total capacity and resistance and also on the
        periodicity employed. A possibility is thereby afforded in
        future, of taking energy from the producer network by wireless
        means. As thereby in addition to atmospheric electricity also
        magnetic earth currents and energy from the higher atmosphere
        (at leas partially may be simultaneously obtained, this last
        system for collecting the atmospheric energy is of particular
        importance for the future. </p>
      <p>Of course everywhere instead of spark gaps grid vacuum tubes
        may be employed as producers for undamped oscillations. The
        separate coils of the producer network with large diameters may
        be connected with one another through separate conductors all in
        parallel or all in series or in groups in series. By regulating
        the number of oscillations and also the extent of the voltage
        more or less large collector coils of this kind may be employed.
        The coils may also be divided spirally over the entire section.
        The coils may be carried out in angular form or also in
        triangular, quadrangular, hexagonal or octagonal form. </p>
      <p>Of course wires may be carried from a suitable place to the
        center or also laterally which serve the current waves as
        guides. This is necessary when the currents have to be conducted
        over mountains and valley and so forth. In all these cases the
        current must be converted into a current of suitable
        periodicity. </p>
      <p>As already hereinbefore mentioned separate collecting balloons
        may be directly metallically interconnected at equidistant
        stations distributed over the entire country or may be connected
        by interpolation of suitable condenser batteries by means of
        high voltage conductors. The static electricity is converted
        through a spark gap into dynamic energy of a high number of
        oscillations, and could then in such forms, wit a suitable
        arrangement of the connections, observing various measures of
        protection, be employed as source of energy after separate or
        special regulation. </p>
      <p>According to this invention in order to increase the collecting
        effect of the balloon in the aerial collector conductor or in
        the earth wire, radiating collectors are employed. These consist
        either of incandescent metal or oxide electrodes in the form of
        vacuum grid tubes, or electric arcs (mercury and the like
        electrodes), Nernst lamps, or finally flames of various kinds
        may be simply connected with the respective conductor. </p>
      <p>It is well known that energy can be drawn of from a cathode
        consisting of an incandescent body opposite an anode charged
        with positive electricity (vacuum grid tube). Hitherto however,
        a cathode was always first directly placed opposite an anode,
        and secondly the system always consisted of a closed circuit. </p>
      <p>Now if we dispense with the ordinary ideas in forming light or
        flame arcs in which a cathode must always stand directly
        opposite an anode, charged to a high potential or another body
        freely floating in the air, or regard the incandescent cathode
        only as a source of unipolar discharge (which represent group
        and point discharges in electrostatic machines similar to
        unipolar discharges), it may be ascertained that incandescent
        cathodes and less perfectly all incandescent radiators, flames
        and the like admit of relatively large current densities and
        allow large quantities of electric energy to radiate into the
        open space in the form of electron streams as transmitters. </p>
      <p>The object of this invention is as described below, if such
        incandescent oxide electrodes or other incandescent radiators or
        flames are not freely suspended in space but connected
        metallically with the earth so that they can be charged with
        negative terrestrial electricity, these radiators possess the
        property of absorbing the free positive electrical charges
        contained in the air space surrounding them (that is to say of
        collecting them and conducting them to earth). They can
        therefore serve as collectors and have, in comparison to the
        action of the spikes, or points, a very large radius of action
        R; the effective capacity of these collectors is much greater
        than the geometrical capacity (R<sub>o-</sub>) calculated in an
        electrostatic sense. </p>
      <p>Now as our earth is surrounded as is well known with an
        electrostatic field and the difference of potential </p>
      <p><img src="1540form1.jpg" height="38" width="29"></p>
      <p>of the earth field according to the latest investigations, is
        in summer about 60 to 100 volts and in winter 300 to 500 volts
        per meter of difference in height (&nbsp;<img
          src="1540symbol.jpg" height="15" width="10">h ), a simple
        calculation gives the result that when such a radiation
        collector or flame collector is arranged for example on the
        ground, and a second one is mounted vertically over it at a
        distance of 2000 meters and both are connected by a conducting
        cable, there is a difference in potential in summer of about
        2,000,000 volts and in winter even of 6,000,000 volts and more.
      </p>
      <p>According to Stefan Boltzmann’s law of radiation, the quantity
        of energy which an incandescent surface (temperature T) of 1 sq
        cm radiates in a unit of time into the open air (temperature T<sub>o</sub>
        ) is expressed by the following formula: </p>
      <p>S =&nbsp;<img src="1540symbol.jpg" height="15" width="10"> (T<sup>4</sup>
        – T<sup>4</sup><sub>o</sub> ) watt./sq cm. </p>
      <p>And the universal radiation constant&nbsp;<img
          src="1540symbol.jpg" height="15" width="10"> is according to
        the latest researches of Ferry (<i>Annales de Chimie et de
          Physique</i>, 17: 267 [1909]) equal to 6.30 x 10<sup>-12</sup>
        watt/sq cm. </p>
      <p>Now if an in incandescent surface of 1 sq cm shows, as compared
        with the surrounding space a periodic fall of potential&nbsp;<img
          src="1540symbol.jpg" height="15" width="10">V it radiates
        (independent of the current direction, that is to say of the
        sign) in accordance with the above formula, for example at a
        temperature of 3725° C an energy of 1.6 kw/sq cm/second. As for
        the radiation the same value can be calculated for the
        collection of energy, but reversed. Now, as carbon electrodes at
        the temperature of the electric arc support on the current basis
        a current density up to from 60 to 65 amperes per sq cm no
        difficulties will result in this direction in employing
        radiating collectors as accumulators. </p>
      <p>If the earth be regarded as a cosmically insulated condenser in
        the sense of geometrical electrostatics <i>x</i> there results
        from the geometric (compare Edwald Rasch: <i>Das Elektrische
          Bogenlicht</i> [The Electric Arc Light], page 169) capacity of
        the earth according to Chwolson: </p>
      <p>For negative charging 1.3 x 10<sup>6</sup> Coulomb </p>
      <p>For negative potential V = 10 x 10<sup>8</sup> volts. </p>
      <p>From this there results however, EJT = 24.7 x 10<sup>24</sup>
        watt/sec. Now if it is desired to make a theoretic short circuit
        through an earthed flame collector this would represent an
        electric total work of about 79,500 x 10<sup>10</sup> kilowatt
        years. As the earth must be regarded as a rotating mechanism
        which thermodynamically, electromagnetically and also
        kinematically coupled with the sun and star system by cosmic
        radiations and gravitation a diminution of the electric energy
        of the earth field is not to be feared. The energies which the
        incandescent collectors would withdraw from the earth field can
        only case by the withdrawal of motor work a lowering of the
        earth temperature ( temperature T<sub>E</sub> = 300 ) and reduce
        this to that of the world space ( T = O ) by using the entire
        energy. This is however not the case as the earth does not
        represent a cosmically entirely insulated system. On the
        contrary there is conveyed to the same according to the recent
        value corrected by Perry for the solar constants through the
        radiation from the sun an energy of 18,500 x 10<sup>10</sup> kw.
        Accordingly, any lowering of the earth temperature (T<sub>E</sub>)
        without a simultaneous lowering of the sun’s temperature (T<sub>s</sub>)
        would contradict Stefan Boltzmann’s law of radiation. </p>
      <p>S =&nbsp;<img src="1540symbol.jpg" height="15" width="10"> (s<sup>4</sup>
        – T<sup>4</sup> ). </p>
      <p>From this it must be concluded that if the earth temperature (
        T<sub>E</sub> ) sinks the total radiation S absorbed by the
        earth increases, and further also that the secular speed of
        cooling of the earth is directly dependent on that of the sun
        and the other radiators cosmically coupled with the sun and is
        connected most closely with these. </p>
      <p>The incandescent radiation collectors may, according to this
        invention, be employed for collecting atmospheric electricity if
        they (1) are charged with the negative earth electricity (that
        is to say when they are directly connected by means of a
        metallic conductor with the earth) and (2) if large capacities
        (metal surfaces) charged with electricity are mounted opposite
        them as positive poles in the air. This is regarded as the main
        feature of the present invention as without these inventive
        ideas it would not be possible to collect with an incandescent
        collector, sufficiently large quantities of the electrical
        charges contained in the atmosphere as the technology requires;
        the radius of action of the flame collectors would also be too
        small, especially if it be considered that the very small
        surface density (energy density) (&nbsp;<img
          src="1540symbol.jpg" height="15" width="10"> about = 2 x 7 .
        10<sup>9</sup> St. E. per sq cm ) does not allow of large
        quantities of charge being absorbed from the atmosphere. </p>
      <p><i>x</i>) Calculated according to Poisson’s calculation: </p>
      <p><img src="1540form5.jpg" height="20" width="90">&nbsp; ; as
        here the alteration of the potential or potential gradients only
        takes place in the direction o the normal, this calculation
        assumes the simple form </p>
      <p><img src="1540form6.jpg" height="53" width="100"><br>
        It has indeed already been proposed to employ flame collectors
        for collecting atmospheric electricity and it is known that
        their collecting effect is substantially greater opposite the
        points. It is however, not known that the quantities of current
        which could hitherto be obtained are too small for technical
        purposes. According to my experiments the reason for this is to
        be found in the too small capacities of the collector conductor
        poles. If such flame or radiating collectors have no or only
        small positive surfaces, their radius of action for large
        technical purposes is too small. If the incandescent collectors
        be constantly kept in movement in the air they may collect more
        according to the speed of the movement, but this again is not
        capable of being carried out in practice. </p>
      <p>By this invention the collector effect is considerably
        increased by a body charged with a positive potential and of the
        best possible capacity being also held floating (without direct
        earth connection) opposite such an incandescent collector which
        is held floating in the air at a desired height. If for example,
        a collecting balloon of sheet metal or of metalized balloon
        fabric be caused to mount to 300 up to 3000 meters in the air
        and as positive pole it is brought opposite such a radiating
        collector connected by a conductor to the earth, quite different
        results are obtained. </p>
      <p>The metallic balloon shell (with a large surface) is charged to
        a high potential by the atmospheric electricity. This potential
        is greater the higher the collecting balloon is above the
        incandescent collector. The positive electricity acts
        concentratedly on the anode floating in the air as it is
        attracted through the radiation shock ionization, proceeding
        from the incandescent cathode. The consequence of this is that
        the radius of action of the incandescent cathode collector is
        considerably increased and thereby also the collection effect of
        the collecting balloon surface. Further the large capacity of
        the anode floating in the air plays therefore an important part
        because it allows of the taking o large charges, and thereby a
        more uniform current is obtained even when there is a large
        consumption: this cannot be the case with small surfaces. </p>
      <p>In the present case the metallic collecting balloon is a
        positive anode floating in the air and the end of the earth
        conductor of this balloon serves as positive pole surface
        opposite the surface of the radiating incandescent cathode,
        which in turn is charged with negative earth electricity being
        conductively connected to earth. </p>
      <p>The process may be carried out by two such contacts (negative
        incandescent cathode and anode end of a capacity floating in the
        air) a condenser and an inductive resistance being switched on
        in parallel, whereby simultaneously undamped oscillations may be
        formed. </p>
      <p>In very large installations it is advisable to connect two such
        radiating collectors in series. Thus an arc light incandescent
        cathode may be placed below on the open ground and an
        incandescent cathode which is heated by special electromagnetic
        currents be located high in the air. Of course for this the
        special vacuum Liebig tubes wit or without grids may also be
        employed. An ordinary arc lamp with oxide electrodes may be
        introduced on the ground and the positive pole is not directly
        connected with the collecting balloon, but through the upper
        incandescent cathode or over a condenser. The method of
        connecting the incandescent cathode floating in the air may be
        seen in Figures 29-33. </p>
      <p>B is the air balloon, K a Cardan ring (connection with the
        hawser), C the balloon, L a good connecting cable, P a positive
        pole, N negative incandescent cathode, and E earth conductor. </p>
      <center><img src="1540-29-30.jpg" height="573" width="355"></center>
      <p>Figure 29 represents the simplest form of construction. If
        electric oscillations are produced below on the ground by means
        of a carbon arc lamp or in other suitable way a considerably
        greater electric resistance is opposed to that in the direct way
        by inserting an electrical inductive resistance 9. Consequently
        between P and N, a voltage is formed, and as, over N and P only
        an inductionless ohmic resistance is present, a spark will
        spring over so long as the separate induction co-efficients and
        the like are correctly calculated. The consequence of this is
        that the oxide electrode (carbon or the like) is rendered
        incandescent and then shows as incandescent cathode an increased
        collecting effect. The positive poles must be substantially
        larger than the negative in order that they may not also become
        incandescent. As they are further connected with the large
        balloon area which has a large capacity and is charged at high
        voltage, an incandescent body which is held floating in the air
        and a positive pole which can collect large capacities is
        thereby obtained in the simplest way. The incandescent cathode
        is first caused to become incandescent by means of separate
        energy produced on the earth, and then maintained by the energy
        collected from the atmosphere. </p>
      <p>Figure 30 only shows the difference that instead of a round
        balloon a cigar-shaped one (of metal or metalized fabric) may be
        employed and also a condenser 5 is inserted between the
        incandescent cathode and the earth conductor so that a short
        circuited oscillation circuit over P.N. 5 and 9 is obtained.
        This has the advantage that quite small quantities of
        electricity cause the cathode to become incandescent and much
        larger cathode bodies may be rendered incandescent. </p>

        <p><img src="1540-31-33.jpg" height="595" width="369"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In this form of construction both the incandescent cathode and
        also the positive electrode may be enclosed in a vacuum chamber
        as may be seen in Figure 32. A cable L is carried well insulated
        through the cover of a vessel and ends in a condenser disc 5.
        The cover is arched in order to keep off the rain. The vessel is
        entirely or partially made of magnetic metal and well-insulated
        inside and outside. Opposite the disc 5 another disc 6 and on
        this again a positive pile of the vacuum tube g with the
        incandescent cathode (oxide electrode) N is arranged. The
        negative electrode is on the one hand connected with the earth
        conductor E, and on the other hand with the inductive resistance
        9 which is also connected with the cable L with the positive
        pole and wound round the vessel in coils. The action is exactly
        the same as that in Figure 29 only instead of an open
        incandescent cathode one enclosed in vacuo is employed. As in
        such collectors only small bodies can be brought to
        incandescence in large installations a plurality of such vacuum
        tubes must be inserted in proximity to one another. According to
        the previous constructions Figures 31 and 33 are quite self
        evident without further explanations. </p>

        <p><img src="1540-34-37.jpg" height="499" width="338"></p>

      <p>Figures 34-37 represent further diagrams of connections over
        radiating and flame collectors, and in fact, how they are to be
        arranged on the ground. </p>
      <p>Figure 34 shows an arc light collector with oxide electrodes
        for direct current and its connection; Figure 35 a similar one
        for alternating current, Figure 36 an incandescent collector
        with a Nernst lamp and Figure 37 a similar one with a gas flame.
      </p>
      <p>The positive pole 1 of the radiating collectors is always
        directly connected to the aerial collecting conductor A. In
        Figure 34 this is further connected over the condenser battery 5
        with a second positive electrode 3. The direct current dynamo <i>b</i>
        produces current which flows over between the electrodes 3 and 2
        as an arc light. On the formation of an arc the negative
        incandescent electrode 2 absorbs electricity from the positive
        poles standing opposite it and highly charged with atmospheric
        electricity and conveys the same to the working circuit. The
        spark gap 7, inductive resistance 9 and induction coil 10 are
        like the ones previously described. The protective electromagnet
        S guards the installation against earth circuiting, the safety
        spark gap 8 from excess voltage or overcharging. </p>
      <p>In Figure 35 the connection is so far altered that the
        alternating current dynamo feeds the exciting coil 11 of the
        induction condenser. 12 is its negative and 13 its positive
        pole; if the coil 3 on the magnet core of the dynamo is
        correctly calculated and the periodicity of the alternating
        current is sufficiently high an arc light can be formed between
        the two poles 1 and 2. As the cathode 2 is connected with the
        negatively charged earth, and therefore always acts as a
        negative pole, a form of rectification of the alternating
        current produced by the dynamo 3 is obtained, the second half of
        the period is always suppressed. The working circuit may be
        carried out in the same way as in Figure 34; the working gap 7
        may however be dispensed with, and instead thereof between the
        points m and n a condenser 5 and an induction resistance 9 may
        be inserted from which the current is taken inductively. </p>
      <p>Figure 36 represents a form of construction similar to Figure
        34 only that here instead of an arc lamp a Nernst incandescent
        body is employed. The Nernst lamp is fed through the battery 3.
        The working section is connected with the negative pole, the
        safety spark gap with the + poles. The working spark gap 7 may
        also be dispensed with and the current for it taken at 12 over
        the oscillation circuit 5, 11 (shown in dotted lines). </p>
      <p>Flame collectors (Figure 37) may also be employed according to
        this invention. The wire network 1 is connected with the aerial
        collector conductor A and the burner with the earth. At the
        upper end of the latter, long points are provided which project
        into the flame. The positive electrode is connected with the
        negative over a condenser 5 and the induction coil 9 with the
        earth. </p>
      <p>The novelty in this invention is firstly, the use of
        incandescent cathodes opposite positive poles which are
        connected with large metallic capacities as automatic collecting
        surfaces, (2) the connection of the incandescent cathodes with
        the earth whereby, in addition to the electricity conveyed to
        them from the battery or machine which causes the incandescing,
        also the negative charge of the earth potential is conveyed, and
        (3) the connection of the positive and negative poles of the
        radiating collectors over a condenser circuit alone or with the
        introduction of a suitable inductive resistance, whereby
        simultaneously an oscillatory oscillation circuit may be
        obtained. The collecting effect is by these methods quite
        considerably increased. </p>

      <p>This invention relates to that type of motor in which rotation
        is produced by means of the attraction and repulsion of surfaces
        carrying charges of electricity. </p>
      <p>According to this invention a stator and rotor are formed of
        condensor surfaces and charges of electricity thereon imposed in
        the form of alternating currents of high frequency. </p>
      <p>The invention is more particularly described with reference to
        the accompanying drawing in which: --- </p>

      <p>The inner plates of the condenser 5 and 6 are charged from a
        spark gap 7, 8 connected to a source of energy of sufficiently
        high pressure (alternating or direct current), until the
        potential has risen so far that a spark springs over. </p>
      <p>The spark gap 7, 8 forms with the condenser 5 and
        self-inductance 9 and condenser 6 a closed oscillatory circuit
        and alternating currents of high frequency will be produced in
        this circuit. The high frequency current produced in the primary
        circuit 9 excite by induction in the secondary circuit 10
        currents of the same periodicity. </p>
      <p>The improved type of motor is fed by the discharges produced by
        the induction in the secondary circuit. </p>
      <p>Hitherto only Tesla’s motor system (shown diagrammatically in
        Figure 1, 16 and 17) was known for this purpose. The
        above-mentioned diagram is only shown for illustrating the
        fundamental principle. It has however no practical interest for
        carrying out large machines by reason of the impossibility of
        the regulation and the low efficiency. </p>
      <p>Now according to this process, all these defects are overcome
        by the construction of a machine which is applicable for high
        frequency currents and of a more or less undamped nature. The
        difference between the principle of construction of these motors
        as compared with those hitherto customary consists in that the
        motor is not based on the principle of magnetic induction only
        (as have been all motors hitherto and also Tesla’s motors). </p>
      <p>It has been fund that the machine constructed according to
        Figure 1 cannot only be fed directly with static electricity but
        if it is connected to a source of high frequency current it will
        operate. </p>
      <p>The applicants call this new type of motors ‘condenser motors’
        to differentiate them from hitherto existing types. </p>
      <p>The simplest form of construction of such condenser motors is
        shown in Figure 1, and this motor may be fed with high frequency
        alternating currents. </p>
      <p>At a given moment positive electricity is charged by means of
        the lead 14 to the stator surface 1 and to the brush 3x (Figure
        1). The brush 3x is connected with the rotor condenser surface
        3, so that both the stator surface 1 and also the rotor surface
        3 is charged with positive electricity. The stator surface 1 and
        the rotor surface 3 being both charged with positive electricity
        and the second rotor surfaces 4 and 4a by brushes 4x with
        negative electricity, such motors can then be started by
        providing intermediate stator surfaces 11, 12, the earth
        connection 13 of one of which is broken by a switch (not shown)
        according to the direction of rotation desires, or alternatively
        the motor may be started by a separate source of alternating
        current in a manner similar to the starting of synchronous
        motors of known construction. After a half revolution of the
        rotor the brush 3x comes in contact with the second collector
        surface 4 so that now this surface is connected by the brush 3x
        with the stator surface 1 and the brush 4x with the collector
        surface 3. Consequently with a reverse direction of current
        through the second half of the oscillation period all the
        hereinbefore mentioned effects take place in the reverse
        direction which, however, produces no alteration in the
        direction of rotation because the dead points between two
        directions of oscillation are overcome by inertia. </p>
      <p>Although this motor is easy to start it can only be employed
        for small experimental and measuring purposes because the stator
        and rotor surfaces are made of solid metal and are heated by
        Foucalt (eddy) currents. In spite of its simplicity and its
        unsuitability for use in practice it must however be regarded as
        a basic type for technical calculations. </p>
      <p>The condenser motor shown in Figure 2 differs from Figure 1 by
        the rotor surfaces consisting of six condenser surfaces
        connected one behind the other in series and they are connected
        with three collector surfaces, so that at any one moment only
        two adjacent collector surfaces come under the two brushes (3
        and 4). In its other actions it corresponds to Figure 1. The
        leads 14 and 15 may be connected either to the ends of the
        secondary coil 10 or directly with the source of energy. The
        outer thicker line indicates the stator surfaces 1 and 2 (that
        is to say the unmoving part of the motor), 11 and 12 shown by
        thick dotted lines means earthed additional poles of the stator,
        8, 9, and 10 are the outer parts of the rotor condenser surfaces
        which in turn are connected with the collector surfaces 8, 9,
        and 10. 5, 6, and 7 are the inner parts of the condenser
        surfaces of the rotor and 3 and 4 are brushes. </p>
      <p>Hitherto stator and rotor surfaces of compact metal have been
        spoken of. These however become highly heated with eddy currents
        and hardly yield 10-15% of useful effect. In examining into such
        small useful effects it was found that certain forms of metal
        sections in the stator and condenser surfaces highly increase
        these. It was then further found that if slots or notches be cut
        in the metal surfaces of the stator and rotor in the form of a
        spiral, not only was a higher useful effect possible, but also
        an easier starting and even a regulation could be obtained. </p>
      <p>Experiments have shown that by such a form of construction it
        is possible to build a very useful motor for high frequency
        alternating currents more particularly those of an undamped
        nature. </p>
      <p>If for example the system of construction of a stator shown in
        Figure 1, but four polar, be taken and the system of rotor
        construction shown diagrammatically in Figure 5, but with the
        form of construction of the condensers of the stator as well as
        of the rotor according to Figure 3, a condenser motor is
        obtained which works well in either direction for high frequency
        alternating current. It was also observed that the motors in
        such forms of construction were found to be more sensitive to
        resonance effects. Such a motor then works the best if stator
        and rotor surfaces have equal capacity and self-inductance so
        that the windings both in the stator and also in the rotor are
        in resonance. </p>
      <p>A motor constructed according to the foregoing kind is already
        fully technically applicable. But even these motors have a
        series of faults, more particularly in their building
        construction. For example, the attachment of the spiral
        condenser surfaces both of the stator and of the rotor sown in
        Figure 3 are in practice difficult to carry out. Therefore in
        practice the condenser and stator surfaces are simply wound of
        wire or bands in the form shown in Figure 4. Such stator and
        rotor surfaces may, without further difficulty, be regarded as
        electromagnetic poles, although they are not made of iron as is
        the case in electromagnets. Such machines may be spoken of
        directly as motors for high frequency alternating currents in
        which the separate pole surfaces consists of wound induction
        condenser surfaces of which one is sound on the stator and the
        other on the rotor. </p>
      <p>If the coil as shown in Figure 4 be made of well insulated
        wires the coil can be embedded in insulating material either for
        the stator or motor surfaces as has already been done in the
        case of ordinary single and multiphase motors. At the same time
        the possibility is afforded by increasing the number of turns to
        produce a greater or smaller alteration of the self induction
        co-efficients. </p>
      <p>In Figure 5 is shown a modified construction of a rotor for a
        four pole motor consisting of four condenser surfaces 1, 2, 3,
        4, of which 1 and 2 are connected though an iductance 9 coupled
        with the coil 10. Four inner surfaces 5, 6, 7, 8 are provided of
        which 5 and 6 are directly connected also 7 and 8 similarly
        connected. </p>
      <p>The pairs of like poles are connected by wires 14 and 15 to the
        source of energy. By a suitable selection of the values of the
        reactance and capacity in these circuits resonance circuits may
        be formed. </p>
      <p>Having now particularly described and ascertain the nature of
        our said invention and in what manner the same is to be
        performed, we declare that what we claim is: --- [Claims not

      <p>Static aerial electricity in the form of direct current can be
        converted by using spark gaps and with the assistance of
        oscillatory circuits into dynamic electrical wave energy of a
        high number of alternations of a more or less undamped nature
        and in such form --- either direct or by means of a special kind
        of resonance or 'condenser motors' --- ready to be utilized for
        technical purposes as mechanical energy. </p>
      <p>For small installations this system may be very well employed;
        about 100 horsepower may be stated as practical limit. In
        constructions of larger aggregate difficulties as regards the
        spark gaps however increase considerably. Further it is
        desirable to convert the accumulated currents of from 100 to
        1000 periods which may then be used for the ordinary types of
        alternating current machines instead of into electromagnetic
        waves of a high number of alternations. </p>
      <p>In experimenting with condenser motors the construction of
        which forms the object of British Patent # 157,262 it was
        observed that the rotor, if one pole of the stator surface be
        connected with the aerials collecting aerial electricity and the
        other pole with the earth, not only could act as a motor, but if
        vice versa the rotor connection with the stator be interrupted
        and the rotor caused to rotate by means of another motor, that
        when the brushes supply an alternating current the periodicity
        of which is dependent on the number of poles and the revolutions
        of the rotor. Such an apparatus may therefore be regarded as a
        transformer of static into dynamic electrical energy. </p>
      <p>The invention is more particularly described with reference to
        the accompanying diagrams in which: --- </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="gb2-1-6.jpg" height="487" width="472"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In Figure 1A is a strong accumulator battery, 1 and 2 are the
        outer poles of the transformer, consisting of simple metallic
        plates or are as shown in Figures 8-11, made of wire coils
        without an electromagnet being present. Between these poles an
        armature is revolubly mounted on a shaft, which armature also
        consists of two similar cylindrically curved plates 3 and 4.
        These are metallically connected with two collector rings 5 and
        6 on which two brushes 7 and 8 freely run which again are
        short-circuited with one another over a primary coil 9. 10 is
        the secondary coil with the free ends 11 and 12. If through the
        accumulator battery the stator plate 1 is charged with positive
        electricity, it induces a charge of reverse sign on the rotor
        surface 3 which is connected by the brushes 7 and 8 over the
        primary coil 9 with the second rotor surface 4. This latter is
        therefore charged with positive electricity, which in turn
        induces negative electricity on the stator surface 2/ Up to this
        moment everything takes place in the same way as if two
        condensers were connected one behind the other in the current
        circuit A. If however, by means of mechanical power, this rotor
        be caused to rotate, the surface conditions are altered. After a
        quarter revolution the rotor plates are between the stator
        plates and therefore no condenser surface faces another. By this
        means however, the capacity of the entire system is reduced to a
        minimum and a change of current will also result in the main 9.
        Now if the rotor be turned further through 90 degrees by
        mechanical energy the rotor plate 3 comes opposite the stator
        plate 2 and the rotor plate 4 opposite the stator plate 1, so
        that then the rotor pates are in a field of reverse sign. A
        fresh charge of current in the reverse direction now runs
        through the primary coil 9. After a further half revolution the
        same action is repeated so that after a full revolution the
        initial condition is again produced. The result of such a
        revolution is an alternating current the periodicity of which is
        equal to the number of revolution. In practice of course not two
        poles but as many poles as possible would be employed because
        thereby the number of alternations would e considerably
        increased. The primary alternating current thus obtained induces
        in the secondary circuit an alternating current the potential of
        which is dependent on the winding of the coil. Figure 7 shows a
        multipolar machine. </p>
      <p>If the stator surface 1, instead of being connected with the
        battery be connected with a collecting aerial network and the
        other stator surface 2 be directly earthed, but the rotor wich
        is otherwise constructed as hereinbefore, be rotated by a
        separate motor a much stronger alternating current results which
        is to be ascribed to the circumstance that a much higher
        potential can be charged on the pole surfaces of the stator by
        reason of the higher pressure of the static electricity than
        where accumulators are employed. By this means the transformer
        has of course much larger quantities of energy supplied to it. </p>
      <p>Figure 2 shows a mode of connections. The stator surface 1 is
        connected with the aerial antennae which is connected through
        the safety spark gap F to earth at E1. The stator surface 2 is
        directly earthed at E2. The inner revoluble rotor surfaces 3 and
        4 are interconnected by means of an induction coil which is
        constructed directly in the motor. The current is taken as in
        Figure 1 up to collector rings by means of brushes, which are
        not shown for the sake of clearness, and further conveyed
        through the conductors 11 and 12. Between these a condenser 5
        may be inserted. There is thereby formed a short oscillatory
        oscillation circuit free from spark gaps, which circuit consists
        of the induction coil 9 and condenser 5 and is fed by the
        periodic charging current impulse. By this means the possibility
        is afforded of obtaining a kind of current which is
        characterized by longer periods and is undamped and oscillatory.
        Of course a simple alternating current may be obtained by
        cutting out the condenser. </p>
      <p>Instead of the induction coil the condenser may also b
        constructed in the rotor. His can be carried out in such a way
        that its ends serve directly as collector rings for taking
        current through the brushes. In Figure 3 such a motor is
        sketched in perspective, 3 and 4 are the rotor surfaces, 5 and 6
        are the condenser surfaces constructed to form part of the rotor
        consisting of two co-axial cylinders fitting one in the other in
        such a way that free room is left for the brushes 7 on one end
        of the condenser cylinder 6. </p>
      <p>The condenser may be made in the form of a cylindrically wound
        spiral forming the capacity and reactance as shown in Figure 4.
        A further type of transformer is shown in Figure 5. The
        difference consists in the stator and rotor surfaces not only
        each assuming a quarter of the circuit but almost the half. By
        this means the space and the effective condenser surface is
        better utilized. Charge is produced only when the rotor surfaces
        face the full scope of the stator surfaces. </p>
      <p>In addition a condition is obtained in which the stator
        surfaces are inductively connected by the rotor surfaces. The
        consequence of this is that an alternating current
        simultaneously results which is produced without sparking
        otherwise the connection is as before. </p>
      <p>Figure 6 shows the alternation of the rotor surfaces; the rotor
        here consists of two cylindrical condenser plates arranged
        concentrically, each divided into two halves and connected so
        that half the inner cylinder is connected to half the outer.
        Such a machine shows the more complete transformer action. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="gb2-7.jpg" height="342" width="389"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Figure 7 shows a four polar transformer. It consists of a metal
        casing, the lower half of which is fastened with the foundation
        plates 17 to the support or foundation. The upper half, the
        cover, is connected by bolts 15 and 16 firmly with the under
        part. This upper sleeve or casing is insulated from the under
        part. Two rings 1 and 2 are cylindrically constructed in the
        casing. The ring 1 is metallically connected with the collector
        aerial and the ring 2 with the earth. On both rings an equal
        number of stator surfaces are mounted side by side but well
        insulated from one another and thus form an electrostatic field
        similar to the electromagnetic in many alternating current
        machines. The rotor consists in similar manner of two rings 5
        and 6 on which an equal number of rotor surfaces are fixed so
        that each stator surface faces a rotor surface. By the brushes 7
        and 8 the alternating current formed is removed from the
        collector. The charge is conveyed by the conductor 14 to and by
        13 away. If this rotor be then rotated by means of a motor the
        positive and negative fields precisely as in the case of
        magnetizing will alter and thereby an alternating current is
        formed in the rotor, the periods of which are dependent on the
        number of the poles and the revolutions per second. </p>
      <p>At the commencement it was thought that this apparatus could
        only be regarded as alternating current converters, but it was
        soon found that much more energy was necessary to rotate the
        rotor than might be necessary to overcome the friction. It was
        then found that the considerable expenditure of energy for
        rotating the rotor was caused by a conductor being moved through
        strongly electrostatic fields since the electrostatic lines of
        force must be cut at right angles and that further in the
        conductors a stronger current arose than was otherwise to be
        expected. This apparatus must therefore not only be regarded as
        a transformer, but also as an energy producer, with the
        difference that the excitation here is obtained instead of by
        means of electromagnets, by static fields of high pressure. The
        entire system may, to some extent, be compared with a dynamo in
        which the excitation takes place by means of a fixed constant
        magnet. It was further ascertained that this way of using the
        atmospheric electricity produced a sort of suction on the
        collector network, and that thus suitable greater quantities of
        current could be obtained. </p>
      <p>The effects which in this apparatus became evident are
        extremely interesting and open a prospect of being able to
        obtain here a great deal more. Merely that these transformer
        made it possible to transform suitable quantities of atmospheric
        electricity into alternating current of high or lower frequency
        (without the use of spark gaps) shows already the extreme
        utility of these apparatus. Should in future, the construction
        of larger aggregates be necessary the transformer installation
        may be constructed in such a way that motors which are fed by a
        current obtained from an installation with spark gaps produce a
        certain quantity of energy which may then be employed for
        producing current according to the last described system. </p>
      <p>The results of the examinations made for this may be construed
        as follows. </p>
      <p>(1) If solid electrodes (condenser surfaces, rotor and stator
        surfaces) are employed they become hot. This effect may be
        considerably reduced by cutting the electrodes in ribbed form
        Figure 8, but not entirely removed. This form allows the surface
        of the condenser plate to be enlarged or increased; the
        electrodes may be fastened in a simple manner on the under frame
        by perforation 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="gb2-8-9.jpg" height="370" width="191"></p>
      </center>
      <p>(2) If nicks or notches in spiral form as shown in Figure 9
        seen from the side end in Figure 10 in section are employed, not
        only is the transformer effect greater but the poles yields also
        more current, but require greater quantities of energy for their
        movement than a simple commutator action would require. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="gb2-10-11.jpg" height="354" width="180"></p>
      </center>
      <p>(3) The greatest effect is obtained if the rotor and stator
        surfaces are wound in flat spiral form of suitably thick wire,
        and in such a way that the inductive effect combining with the
        capacity is calculated in suitable proportion and this result is
        adapted to a suitable periodicity. In practice this is
        preferably done by the wire bent in spiral form being inserted
        in a separate vulcanite or hard rubber mass (see Figure 11) so
        that a smooth pole surface is formed similar to that in phase
        motors. </p>

      <p>Regular undamped oscillations of a high frequency may however
        be produced if the converter be carried out in the manner shown
        in Figure 13. The aerial wire L is metallically connected with
        the ring 20. To this two pole surfaces 1 and 2 are connected.
        The inductive earth pole is also connected with a second ring 10
        from which again two, poles 1a and 2a are branched off. Of
        course in similar manner any suitable number of poles may be
        branched of. In similar manner there are in the rotor two poles
        fastened to one another (3 and 4 and 3a and 4a) connected with
        separate collector rings. From these two rings the current is
        collected by means of two brushes. The induced alternating
        current is however directly metallically connected with an
        inductive earth stator conductor over an induction coil 9.
        Further a combined inductance and capacity 5 is inserted between
        the two wires 11 and 12 in parallel with the converter. By this
        means a sparkless oscillatory circuit is obtained which can act
        on the exciting current in the stator. This produces however, a
        periodic alteration of the charging quantities according to the
        oscillation curves of the rotor currents in consequence of which
        the stator charge also commences with resonance oscillations and
        if the stator and rotor surfaces are calculated to one another
        in such a way that they are adapted to form oscillations of
        waves of similar length the entire converter is caused to
        oscillate and furnishes undamped oscillations of a high number
        of alternations, but of periodically changed amplitude, the form
        of which is dependent on the amplitude of the main alternating
        current and is caused by the number of the poles and revolutions
        per second. Thus an alternating current of, for example, 100
        periods is formed, the separate periods of which are formed by
        undamped oscillations of a higher number of alternations. In
        Figures 14-16 four other diagrams of converters are illustrated,
        the object of which is not to produce usual alternating current,
        but oscillations of high frequency. </p>

      <p>The main difference of these systems from those previously
        described is that from the connection of the collecting aerials
        is made between the stator pole 1 (Figure 14) and one pole 16 of
        the condenser 17 and the earth connection between a second
        stator pole 2 and the pole 18 of the condenser 19. The other
        poles of these condensers 17 and 19 are short circuited through
        a ring over two inductive primary coils 9 and 9a with one
        another. The secondary coils form the rotor conductors 10 and
        10a. The rotor itself is constructed in the manner shown in
        Figure 6 of two short-circuited plate condensers which may be
        wound as shown in Figure 11. In similar manner of course the
        stator surfaces may also be formed. The collector rings of the
        rotor with the two brushes for collecting current are here not
        shown in order to simplify the drawings. By the connection of
        the two condensers in the exiting circuit of the converter and
        also by the action of the alternating current produced in the
        rotor on the stator circuit, with a correct calculation of the
        capacity and the self-induction co-efficients a maximum action
        may be obtained.&nbsp; The kind of current produced will be
        similar to that described for Figure 12. </p>

      <p>The novelty of the converter illustrated in Figure 15 consists
        mainly in that the current resulting in the rotor is not
        directly employed, but only serves a exciter of the primary
        coils 9a and 9b. The working current is produced in the
        secondary coils 10 and 10a and further conducted through the
        conductors 11 and 12. The stator current may be brought by the
        regulatable inductive resistance 9 to the same resonance as the
        rotor current. </p>

      <p>In Figure 16 a very similar system is shown to Figure 14. The
        condenser 5 is however connected in parallel with the converter;
        and by the inductive resistance constructed in the rotor a short
        circuited oscillatory circuit is formed which gives
        extraordinarily good results and is simple in construction. </p>
      <p>The inductive resistance 9 may also instead of being
        constructed in the rotor be constructed as primary coil employed
        outside the rotor and short circuit the oscillatory circuit over
        the stator surfaces (see Figure 17). </p>

      <p>The last six types serve only for producing oscillations of a
        high number of alternations. If it be desired to obtain ordinary
        alternating current there complicated constructional
        arrangements are not required as the types illustrated in
        Figures 1 to 11 suffice. It is self-evident that these
        arrangements may be altered in various ways by means of
        different condenser surfaces in practice. <br>
