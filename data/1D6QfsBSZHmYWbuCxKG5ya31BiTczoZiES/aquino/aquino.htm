      It is demonstrated that gravitational and inertial masses are
      correlated by an electromagnetic factor. From the practical point
      of view this is very important because it means the possibility of
      electromagnetic control of the gravity. Some theoretical
      consequences of the correlation are: <br>
      <br>
      incorporation of Mach's principle into Gravitation Theory; <br>
      new relativistic expression for the mass ; <br>
      the generalization of Newton's second law for the motion; <br>
      the deduction of the differential equation for entropy directly
      from the Gravitation Theory. <br>
      <br>
      Another fundamental consequence of the mentioned correlation is
      that, in specific ultra-high energy conditions, the&nbsp;
      gravitational and electromagnetic fields can be described by the
      same Hamiltonian, i.e., in these circumstances, they are unified !
      Such conditions can have occurred inclusive in the Initial
      Universe, before the first spontaneous breaking of symmetry.<br>

      It is known that photons have null inertial mass (mi = 0 ) and
      that they do not absorb others photons (U = 0 ). So , if we put mi
      = 0 and U = 0 in Eq.(1.04), the result is mg = 0. Therefore
      photons have null gravitational mass. Let us consider a point
      source of radiation with power P , frequency f and radiation
      density at distance r given by D = P /4p r2<br>
      <br>
      Due to the null gravitational mass of the photons, it must be
      possible to build a shield of photons around the source, which
      will impede the exchange of gravitons between the particles inside
      the shield and the rest of the Universe. The shield begins at
      distance rs from the source where the radiation density is such
      that there will be a photon in opposition to each incident
      graviton . This critical situation occurs when D = hf 2 / Sg ,
      where Sg is the geometric cross section of the graviton. Thus rs
      is given by the relation, rs = (rg / f )( P/h)1/2<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="equ104.gif" alt=""></div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      We then see that the ELF radiation are the most appropriate to
      produce the shield. It can be easily shown that, if f &lt;&lt;
      1mHz , the radiation will traverse any particle . It is not
      difficult to see that in this case, there will be "clouds" of
      photons around the particles inside the shield. Due to the null
      gravitational mass of the photons , these "clouds" will impede the
      exchange of gravitons between the particle inside the "cloud" and
      the rest of the Universe. Thus, we can say that the gravitational
      mass of the particle will be null with respect to the Universe,
      and that the space-time inside the shield (out of the particles)
      becomes flat or euclidean . It is clear that the space-time which
      the particles occupies remains non-euclidean.<br>
      <br>
      In an euclidean space-time the maximum speed of propagation of the
      interactions is infinite<br>
      <br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="cinf.gif" alt=""><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      because , as we know, the metrics becomes from Galilei.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the interactions are instantaneous . Thus , in this
      space-time the speed of photons must be infinite, simply because
      they are the quanta of the electromagnetic interaction. So, the
      speed of photons will be infinite inside the shield.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand , the new relativistic expression for mass,
      Eq.(2.06),<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="equ206.gif" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      shows that a particle with null gravitational mass isn’t submitted
      to the increase of relativistic mass, because under these
      circumstances its gravitational mass doesn't increase with
      increasing velocity .i.e., it remains null independently of the
      particle's velocity. In addition , the gravitational potential<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="phigm.gif" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      or the particle will be null and, consequently , the component<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="goophi.gif" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      of the metric tensor will be equal to -1.<br>
      <br>
      Thus , we will have<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="ds2goo.gif" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      where t' is the time in a clock moving with the particle , and ds2
      = c2 dt2 where t is the time indicated by a clock at rest ( dx =
      dy = dz = 0 ).<br>
      <br>
      From the combination of these two equations we conclude that t' =
      t .This means that the particle will be not more submitted to the
      relativistic effects predicted in Einstein's theory. So, it can
      reach and even surpass the speed of light . We can imagine a
      spacecraft with positive gravitational mass qual to (m) kg , and
      negative gravitational mass ( see System-G in appendix A) equal to
      - (m - 0.001) kg . It has a shield of photons , as above
      mentioned. If the photons, which produce the shield , radiate from
      the surface of the spacecraft , then the space-time that it
      occupies remains non-euclidean ,and consequently , for an observer
      in this space-time , the total gravitational mass of the
      spacecraft, will be<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="mg001.gif" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      . Therefore , if its propulsion system produces F=10N (only) the
      spacecraft acquires acceleration<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><img
          src="aequalf.gif" alt=""><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>
      <br>
      ( see Eq.(2.05)).<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="equ205.gif" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      Furthermore, due to the "cloud" of photons around the spacecraft
      its gravitational interaction with the Universe will be null , and
      therefore, we can say that its gravitational mass will be null
      with respect to the Universe. Consequently, the inertial forces
      upon the spacecraft will also be null, in agreement with Eq.2.05 (
      Mach’s principle ).This means that the spacecraft will lose its
      inertial properties . In addition, the spacecraft will can reach
      and even surpass the speed of light because , as we have seen , a
      particle with null gravitational mass will be not submitted to the
      relativistic effects.<br>

      <br>
      The System-G experiment has been performed successfuly by Fran De
      Aquino on January 27th, 2000 at the Physics Department of Maranhao
      State University in Brazil.<br>
      <br>
      In the System-G torus, the ELF energy generated by the dipole
      antenna must be fully absorbed the atoms of the annealed iron
      lamina. The ELF energy is done by this equation below :<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-weight:
          bold;"></span><img src="sysg104.gif" alt=""><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>
      <br>
      The curve below, shows that a System-G weight ( 35 Kg ) can be
      nullified at 60Hz with a current of 400 Ampere.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        <br>
      </span>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><img
          src="sysgcur.gif" alt=""><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>
      <br>
      The use of the power grid for the basic System-G experiment has
      been conducted easily by using the power grid frequency ( 60 Hz,
      in Brazil ), this was energy consumming ( about 11 KW ). But for
      improving the efficiency of the whole apparatus, Power Input Vs
      weight lifted, its seems much adapted to use a lower frequency
      than previously for the ELF signal as shown on the table below :<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="sysgpwr2.gif" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      You notice that, to levitate a 100 Kg weight apparatus,<br>
      at 60 Hz we need 61 KW and for the same results, only 632 W is
      required at 1 Hz.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><img

      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="sysg5ghz.gif" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      You may notice on the diagram above that only 1460 Watts are
      required to levitate 50 Kg at a frequency of 5 Hz...<span

            <div style="text-align: left;">Gravity is related to
              gravitational mass of the bodies. According to the weak
              form of Einstein’s General Relativity equivalence
              principle, the gravitational and inertial masses are
              equivalent. However recent calculations (gr-qc/9910036)
              have revealed that they are correlated by an adimensional
              factor, which depends on the incident radiation upon the
              particle. It was shown that there is a direct correlation
              between the radiation absorbed by the particle and its
              gravitational mass, independently of the inertial mass.
              This finding has fundamental consequences to Unified Field
              Theory and Quantum Cosmology. It was also shown that only
              in the absence of electromagnetic radiation this factor
              becomes equal to one and that, in specific electromagnetic
              conditions, it can be reduced, nullified or made negative.
              This means that there is the possibility of control of the
              gravitational mass by means of the incident radiation.
              This unexpected theoretical result was recently confirmed
              by an experiment (gr-qc/0005107). Consequently there is a
              strong evidence that the gravitational forces can be
              reduced, nullified and inverted by means of
              electromagnetic radiation. This means that , in practice
              we can produce gravitational binaries, and in this way to
              extract energy from a gravitational field. Here we
              describe a process by which energy can be extracted
              directly from any site of a gravitational field.<br>

      For several years, physicist Fran De Aquino worked as
      Senior-Researcher at the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais
      - INPE (National Institute for Space Research - INPE , Brazil)
      (INPE Registration Number 02844 CRN, SIAPE Registration Number
      0024730). He was also Director of the INPE's Space Observatory in
      the city of São Luís, since the installation of this observatory
      until 1997.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, physicist Fran De Aquino is a professor at the
      Universidade Estadual do Maranhão- UEMA (State University of
      Maranhao, Brazil), (UEMA Registration Number 5155). He also works
      as Consultant in Science &amp; Technology for international
      companies. Fran De Aquino's publications list includes several
      scientific articles and books.<br>
      <br>
      His research involves many relevant aspects of Gravitation and
      Cosmology. After thirty years of research, professor De Aquino
      discovered that the gravity can be quantized, starting from the
      generalization of the known action function. In discovering the
      quantization of gravity, Fran De Aquino made true an old dream of
      the Quantum Physicists - to obtain a Quantum Theory for Gravity. <br>
      <br>
      This Quantum Theory of Gravity unifies Einstein's Theory of
      General Relativity with the Quantum Theory and, furthermore, it
      leads to an equation of correlation between gravitational mass and
      the inertial mass, which opens doors for gravity control
      technologies and the G ENERGY , the energy of the future that
      possibly it will change the paradigms of energy generation,
      transportation and telecommunications.<br>
      <br>
      The theory shows that there is a revalidation of the strong
      equivalence principle, and consequently Einstein's equations are
      preserved. Thus, De Aquino's Quantum Theory of Gravity does not
      invalidate Einstein's Theory, on the contrary, it just complements
      this theory, in such a way as Einstein's theory has complemented
      Newton's theory.<br>
      <br>
      The Einstein's equations are deduced directly from De Aquino's
      theory. Moreover, a generalized equation for inertial forces is
      obtained , which incorporates the Mach's principle into
      Gravitation, explainning therefore the origin of inertia, and
      yielding a new expression for gravitational forces which includes
      the Newton's attraction law, and shows that the graviton must have
      spin 1 and not 2. The theory also allows the deduction of the
      Entropy's differential equation; the Hamiltonian for a particle in
      an electromagnetic field and the reciprocal fine structure
      constant. It is also possible to explain the Inflation Period and
      the Hidden Matter, without assuming the existence of vacuum
      fluctuations. Similarly, it is possible to obtain the Casimir
      force, whithout assuming the existence of zero-point field.
      Another fundamental consequence of De Aquino's theory is the
      possibility of control of the gravitational mass. In addition, De
      Aquino's Quantum Theory of Gravity shows that, in specific
      ultra-high energy conditions, the gravitational and
      electromagnetic fields can be described by the same Hamiltonian,
      i.e., in these circumstances, they are unified. Such conditions
      might have occurred inclusively in the Initial Universe, before
      the first spontaneous breaking of Symmetry. Therefore, this
      Kinetic approach to Quantum Gravity will allow us to understand
      some crucial matters in Quantum Cosmology, including the early
      stages of the Big Bang. For some physicists, this theory might be
      it the Holy Graal of Modern Physics because it can complete the
      unification of all fundamental laws of Physics.<br>
      <br>
      Now, it is possible for the first time to write down a single
      equation (Eq.1 of Mathematical Foundations of the Relativistic
      Theory of Quantum Gravity. See T-shirt below) that can explain all
      the laws of physics( including the Einstein's equations), all the
      forces of nature - the proverbial "theory of everything". This
      grand unified theory comprhends Philosophy, God (including
      feminine aspects), and the Soul. It is not restricted only to the
      material world it includes not only force particles and matter
      particles, not only general relativity and Quantum Gravity, but
      also a theory of consciousness.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</span> Starting from
      the action function, we have derived a theoretical background that
      leads to the quantization of gravity and the deduction of a
      correlation between the gravitational and inertial masses, which
      depends on the kinetic momentum of the particle. We show that
      there is a reaffirmation of the strong equivalence principle and,
      consequently, Einstein's equations are preserved. In fact, such
      equations are deduced here directly from this approach to Gravity.
      Moreover, we have obtained a generalized equation for inertial
      forces, which incorporates the Mach's principle into Gravitation.
      Also, we have deduced the equation of Entropy; the Hamiltonian for
      a particle in an electromagnetic field and the reciprocal fine
      structure constant. It is possible to deduce the expression of the
      Casimir force and also to explain the Inflation Period and the
      Missing Matter, without assuming the existence of vacuum
      fluctuations. This new approach to Gravity will allow us to
      understand some crucial matters in Cosmology. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract :</span> It is shown
      that the gravity acceleration just above a chamber filled with gas
      or plasma at ultra-low pressure can be strongly reduced by
      applying an Extra Low-Frequency (ELF) electromagnetic field across
      the gas or the plasma. This Gravitational Shielding Effect is
      related to recent discovery of quantum correlation between
      gravitational mass and inertial mass. According to the theory
      samples hung above the gas or the plasma should exhibit a weight
      decrease when the frequency of the electromagnetic field is
      decreased or when the intensity of the electromagnetic field is
      increased. This Gravitational Shielding Effect is unprecedented in
      the literature and can not be understood in the framework of the
      General Relativity. From the technical point of view, there are
      several applications for this discovery; possibly it will change
      the paradigms of energy generation, transportation and
      telecommunications.<br>

      A device called, the Gravity Control Cell, which has the property
      of reducing, to annul, to invert and to intensify the intensity of
      the local gravity, has been developed starting from the discovery
      of the quantum correlation between the gravitational mass and
      inertial mass published in the article " Mathematical Foundations
      of the Relativistic Theory of Quantum Gravity ", Copyright ©
      2002-2008 by Fran De Aquino, available at: arXiv -
      physics/0212033. In this article, it was shown that any body
      submitted to the action of an electromagnetic field has its
      gravitational mass reduced and that the gravity acceleration in
      any traverse direction to the body is reduced at the same
      proportion in which the gravitational mass of the body it was
      reduced. According to this principle, here called of General
      Principle of Gravity Control, the change in the gravitational mass
      of the body, and in the gravity acceleration in any transverse
      direction to the body, is directly proportional to the product of
      the refraction index by the density of electromagnetic energy
      applied upon the body, and inversely proportional to the mass
      density of the body (q.v. "Mathematical Foundations of the
      Relativistic Theory of Quantum Gravity"). The use of gas or plasma
      at ultra-low pressure in the Gravity Control Cells elapses from
      the fact that the gases or plasmas have low mass density and, as
      smaller the smaller pressure also the mass density of the gas or
      plasma. The Gravity Control Cell is a device absolutely
      unprecedented in the literature. From the technological viewpoint,
      there are several applications for this invention; possibly it
      will change the paradigms of the energy generation ( G ENERGY ),
      transportation and telecommunications. As shown in the article
      "Gravity Control by means of Electromagnetic Field through Gas or
      Plasma at Ultra-Low Pressure", Copyright © 2007 by Fran De Aquino,
      available at: arXiv - physics/0701091, the Gravity Control Cells
      can be used to convert gravitational(G) energy into rotational
      mechanical energy. Thus, starting from this Gravitational Motor it
      is possible to get electric energy by means of a conventional
      electric generator coupled to the Gravitational Motor. The Gravity
      Control Cells can also be used to yield thrust. In this case the
      thruster system, called of Gravitational Thruster can produce
      several Kilonewtons. These Gravitational Thrusters can be used as
      basic elements of propulsion in the most of transport systems, and
      certainly they will have applications in the most several
      industrial processes; this technology probably will find several
      applications in other areas of the human activity. They can still
      be used in the construction of a Gravitational Press of Ultra-high
      Pressure, as detailed in the article "Gravity Control by means of
      Electromagnetic Field through Gas or Plasma at Ultra-Low Pressure
      ". In aerospace spacecrafts (Gravitational Spacecrafts) they will
      have a lot of applications, for example, to produce artificial
      gravity inside the spacecraft. As a consequence of General
      Principle of Gravity Control, and of the advent of the "Gravity
      Control Cells" arises then a new concept of spacecraft and
      aerospace flight, it also appears a new benefit for the area of
      the telecommunications with the possibility of building
      transmitters and receivers whose operation are based on the method
      of gravity control here described. These systems can be also
      projected for wireless electric power transmission. (q.v. "Gravity
      Control by means of Electromagnetic Field through Gas or Plasma at
      Ultra-Low Pressure")...<br>

      UNCERTAINTY RULES!<br>
      <br>
      Recently I have analyzed the torus test done by Fran De Aquino
      that showed a significant weight loss according to his published
      results. My recent analysis of his test involves the&nbsp; quantum
      aspect of uncertainty rather than the extreme low frequency
      electromagnetic absorption of energy by iron atoms as proposed in
      his paper, "Gravitation and Electromagnetism; Correlation and
      Grand Unification," gr-qc/9910036.<br>
      <br>
      It is an established&nbsp; fact that macroscopic systems cannot be
      expected to exhibit quantum effects since the uncertainty
      associated with a large mass is very small as is shown by the
      following equation:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;












      h<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; m = ---------------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Assume the
      mass to be several kilograms.)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2*pi *dv*dr<br>
      <br>
      h = Planks constant, dv is the uncertainty in the velocity and dr
      is the uncertainty in radius all in S. I. units.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it is very unlikely that your car will 'leak' out of
      the garage due to a quantum action unexpectedly! However, on the
      quantum scale of a single atom, uncertainty really does rule since
      absorption and emission occur via quantum 'bits' of energy. Albert
      Einstein established this fact (circa 1905) when he described this
      action to explain the photoelectric effect: it was not the amount
      of radiation that caused electron emission from a metal but the
      frequency. The higher the frequency, the more energy the electron
      absorbed and the faster it was ejected from the metal. Thus was
      established the famous equation E = hf where E is the energy
      related to the absorption or emission while (f) is the related
      frequency and (h) is Plank's constant.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">My Analysis:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      I propose that what is occurring in Fran's torus test is a large
      increase in the spin&nbsp; and magnetic moment uncertainty of the
      iron atoms. Thus, a phase change occurs related directly to the
      spin uncertainty of the electrons in the iron atoms. This phase
      change works to reduce the electrogravitational action force... <br>
