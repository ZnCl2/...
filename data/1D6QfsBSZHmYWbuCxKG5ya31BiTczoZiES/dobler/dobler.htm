          <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
          <b><i> Journal of Borderland Science</i> (March-April 1989),
            page 5:</b>
          <p align="left">Dr. Paul E. Dobler of Heilbronn, Germany
            discovered that turbulent water emits powerful bursts of
            energy in the millimeter electronic wave band. Turbulent
            motion of water generates millions of vortexes which act as
            energy transmitters. </p>
          <p align="left">This energy waveband was once called the
            X-band by physicists as it included the range from the
            infrared light band to the edge of the microwave radio band.
            It was called the X-band because no one could differentiate
            specific frequencies in this band. These energies have very
            interesting properties. </p>
          <p align="left">Dr. Dobler discovered that energies in this
            waveband could cause certain metallic crystals to emit
            photons of light which will expose certain tpes of chromatic
            film. Dr. Dobler made interferometers, resonators, and other
            devices that could accurately measure the wavelengths
            emitted by water. </p>
          <p align="left">He was also able to measure millimeter
            wavelengths that are emitted by crystals and magnets. The
            exact techniques used by Dobler are described in his two
            books: <i>Biophysikalische Untersuchungen uber Stralung der
              Materie, Wunchelrute, Elecktrische Wellen</i> (<i>Biophysical



              Experiments on the Radiation of matter, Divining Rods,
              Electric Waves</i>, 1939) and <i>Physickalischer und
              Photographischer machweis de Erdstrahlen Losung des
              Problems der Wunschelrute</i> (<i>Physical and
              Photographic Proof of Radiation from the Earth</i>, 1934).
            Unfortunately this great scientist's work was lost for many
            years due to the destruction of scientific libraries in
            Germany during WWII. </p>
          <p align="left">These waves were also photographed in 1898 by
            Dr Gustav LeBon in France. His experiments are described in
            his masterpiece, <i>The Evolution of Matter</i> (1909). Dr.
            LeBon used energized zinc sulfide plates to make these
            photographs. When zinc sulfide is exposed to bright light it
            glows in the dark. When it is exposed to infrared and
            millimeter waves, these waves extinguish the photon emission
            of the zinc plate. By focusing these waves by means of
            special devices, photographs can be taken through walls.
            Both LeBon and Dobler were able to demonstrate the power of
            these waves to penetrate all physical matter such as wood,
            earth and stones. These waves are, however, powerfully
            absorbed by water...</p>

    <blockquote><a name="1"></a><b>(1) Photographic Proof of the
        Radiation of Underground Watercourses</b></blockquote>
    <p> </p>
    <blockquote>In order to prove the origin of the sensitive bands, the
      radiation of underground watercourse photographically, I performed
      the following test:</blockquote>
    <blockquote>On the drilled Rohrbach source that was already
      mentioned, I placed photographic plates 18 m deep in the earth,
      but could not determine any sort of general density after their
      development. Only at once place of the developed plates for all
      the exposures could some small dark points be seen. For a long
      time I could not explain the appearance of these points. It could
      not have been a defect in the plates because the points could be
      seen in different forms on the plates. Finally I found a solution
      to the puzzle. I had used a double cassette for the exposures,
      whose dividing wall consisted of an enameled aluminum plate.
      There, where the noticeable points were found, the lacquered
      electroplating of the aluminum was damaged through the insertion
      of the plates. The bare aluminum had affected the photographic
      plates when they were placed over the underground watercourse.
      Further test showed that the density did not occur when the same
      cassette was stored with the photographic plate in the darkroom;
      here the radiation of the underground watercourse was not
      suspended. In order to show the density of the photographic plate
      through the radiation of underground watercourses under
      transmission of bare aluminum, I did the following:</blockquote>
    <blockquote><i>Test 1</i>: I scratched the inscription “Underground
      Watercourse” on the enameled layer of the double cassette, as I
      have shown in the above diagram, then I laid a photographic plate
      in the cassette and set it out by the radiation of the underground
      watercourse. <b><a href="#dob2">Diagram (2)</a></b> shows the
      result.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>In 1905 I had investigated the Beta rays of radium with
      Prof. Paschen, later president of the Physical-Technical
      institute. Between thin bands of platinum emulsion, which were
      photographed, a stronger density could be observed, as on the
      uncovered plates. With reference to these methods, I performed the
      following:</blockquote>
    <blockquote><i>Test 2</i>: I cut up small bands of brass, zinc and
      aluminum sheets, laid them on a photographic plate, and set them
      out by the radiation of an underground watercourse, in a
      lightproof manner. <b><a href="#dob3">Diagram (3)</a></b> shows
      the result. No density occurred under the brass strip, while the
      zinc and aluminum generated great density. Zinc proved itself to
      be useless for proof of radiation because it also generated great
      density while aluminum only blackened the photographic plate when
      radiation had the effect.</blockquote>
    <p> </p>
    <blockquote>Through the tests described above, the long sought for
      objective of proof was found, the indicator for radiation above
      and below the ground of matter. With the help of this indicator, I
      was successful in proving radiation objectively and in being able
      to determine its nature and measure its wavelengths.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In order to make comparisons between radiation and unradiating
        plates, I altered Test 2 in the following manner: </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote><i>Test 3</i>: I cut two equal strips from a 1.5 mm
      thick aluminum sheet and scraped them bare on the edges. Then I
      took two photographic plates from a case and placed one of the
      strips on each plate. I pressed the prepared plates onto black
      paper so as to make them lightproof. Plate 1 (See <b><a
          href="#dob4">Diagram 4</a></b>, below) I placed over the
      previously mentioned one, in the 18 m drilled Rohrbach source,
      Plate 2 I stored in the darkroom. After the radiation, I subjected
      both pates to the exact same handling: I developed them at the
      same time, and for the same length of time in the same solution
      and also did it in this way for their fixing and washing. The
      prints were exposed to light equally and were treated in the same
      manner in their development, fixing, and washing. <b><a
          href="#dob4">Diagram 4</a></b> shows the result.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The aluminum strip of the radiating Plate 1 made the
      negative much darker than that of the unradiated Plate 2. A large
      bright spot can be seen on the positive.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>I got the same result after many tries, just as in the
      test that I did for a patent registration for the patent office,
      and that I did on commission for the Wurttemberg government in the
      Institute for the Instruction of Physics in Stuttgart.</blockquote>
    <p> </p>
    <blockquote>In order to exclude every difference in test conditions,
      I changed Test 3 in the following manner:</blockquote>
    <p> </p>
    <blockquote><i>Test 4</i>: At the edges of a photographic plate, I
      placed a bare aluminum strip. I twisted the photographic plate in
      a lightproof manner in paper and set it by the same underground
      watercourse, as was used in Test 3, for 24 hours (<b><a
          href="#dob5">Diagram 5</a></b>, lower half). Then, using the
      same plate a second time, I set the aluminum strip on another
      piece of the same plate (<b><a href="#dob5">Diagram 5</a></b>,
      upper half). I twisted it again in the same paper and set it in a
      metal container, again for 24 hours at the same place by the
      radiation of the underground watercourse. <b><a href="#dob5">Diagram








          5</a></b> shows the result. The emission, that was enveloped
      in the paper (<b><a href="#dob5">Diagram 5</a></b>, above) by the
      photographic plate, produced a much stronger density than did the
      emission by which the photographic plate found itself in the metal
      container (<b><a href="#dob5">Diagram 5</a></b>, below). This test
      shows that the emitted radiation of an underground watercourse is
      not forced through a thin metal strip, and neither does it belong
      to another wave group. More details on this will be discussed
      later.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Test 5 shows that the radiation of the underground
      watercourse determined in test 3 and 4 is caused by moving water.
      Test 5, which was performed by me in the Wurttemberg Institute for
      Instruction of Physics in Stuttgart, is the one in which the most
      important of my tests on behalf of the Wurttemberg government were
      submitted for verification.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><i>Test 5</i>: I let tap water flow over a lightproof
      and watertight Plate 1, furnished with an aluminum strip (<b><a
          href="#dob6">Diagram 6</a></b>, below). A photographic plate
      taken from the same container (<b><a href="#dob6">Diagram 6</a></b>,
      above), which was furnished with one strip cut from the same
      aluminum sheet, was stored in the darkroom, packed in the same
      way. After similar treatment for the development of both plates, I
      saved the exposures, which <b><a href="#dob6">Diagram 6</a></b>
      shows. The negative of plate 1 that had water falling on it (<b><a
          href="#dob6">Diagram 6</a></b>, below), shows a much stronger
      density that does the negative of Plate 2 (<b><a href="#dob6">Diagram









          6</a></b>, above). This is proof that moving water sends out
      an emission. The test that was just described was performed with
      water flowing above the ground. I also tested the radiation of an
      artificial underground watercourse.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>In Spiegelberg by Heilbronn, a small canal 50 cm wide
        branches off from the Lauter brook. It conducts about 200 liters
        of water a second, and often flows in the area of the
        bifurcation. Later, it is so covered with pieces of stone and
        earth that the stone chips touch the water flowing under them. I
        performed the following test:</blockquote>
      <blockquote><i>Test 6</i>: I took a photographic Plate 1, put a
        bare aluminum strip around the edges, and stored it in the
        darkroom. Then I took a photographic Plate 2 from the same
        container, furnished it with aluminum bands from the same sheet,
        and fastened it 1 m over the water flowing in the canal at a
        rate of a meter every 3 seconds. A third plate I laid in a
        cavity over the canal filled with stone and earth. After 12
        hours I developed the 3 plates for the same length of time in
        the same solution and continued to treat them equally. <b><a
            href="#dob7">Diagram 7</a></b> shows the result.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>The negative of Plate 1 which was stored in the
        darkroom shows a small density on the edges of the aluminum
        strip (<b><a href="#dob7">Diagram 7</a></b>, above), Plate 2
        over the flowing water is denser, and plate 3 which was over the
        artificial watercourse was densest (<b><a href="#dob7">Diagram 7</a></b>,
        below).</blockquote>
      <blockquote>This sixth test shows that moving water emits
        radiation where the underground water touches the stones, and
        that the emitted rays are only slightly absorbed through stones
        and earth. These are characteristics of electromagnetic waves
        between ultrared and the shortest Hertzian waves.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>The radiation of moving water presumably arises from
        stream currents of differing speeds flowing next to one another.
        Natural underground watercourse, that are known as sources
        today, are closed as in a canal and the stream currents of
        different speeds are spread over the whole cross-section.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>The radiation of the upper side penetrates the earth’s
        crust and its existence has been proven through the above tests.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>With water flowing above the ground, as for example
        with brooks, the radiation is dependent on the cross-section, as
        can easily be seen. The free expanse of water emits very little
        radiation. On the lower level, in contrast, a strong emission
        arises, but this is absorbed by the water layer that exists
        above. For this reason, water flowing above the ground exhibits
        only a weak radiation. With bigger grades, as for example with
        small rapids, a strong radiation, in contrast, can be observed.
        If, however, friction takes place on the upper side of the water
        at a fixed point, for example, if a river is covered with ice,
        so that the water flowing underneath is touched, then strong
        radiation comes about.</blockquote>
      <blockquote><i>Test 7</i>: On the ice layer of the frozen Kopfer
        brook at Heilbronn, I set a photographic plate furnished with a
        bare aluminum strip on the edges, packed in paper in a
        lightproof manner, for 24 hours. <b><a href="#dob8">Diagram 8</a></b>
        shows the result. Strong density is present on the negative and
        an accordingly large area of brightness is present on the
        positive in <b><a href="#dob8">Diagram 8</a></b>. A comparison
        with the unremitting plates of Tests 3-6 shows that the
        radiation of the ice-covered Kopfer brook is exceedingly
        powerful.</blockquote>

        <p><a name="4"></a><b>(4) Origin &amp; Form of "Sensitive Bands"</b></p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Up to this point, an explanation was lacking for the
        fact that the "sensitive bands" are narrow and sharply
        delineated over underground watercourses. One would want to
        erroneously conclude from this condition that the radiation
        caused would be of a short wavelength and would belong to the
        gamma rays (2). From the statement that will later be founded,
        that underground watercourses send out unsmooth electromagnetic
        waves between ultrared and the shortest Hertzian waves, it
        necessarily follows that the sensitive bands must be narrow and
        sharply delineated as a result of total reflection on the
        earth’s surface. The electric waves are refracted and reflected
        in the same way as light rays, just as Hertz found. If light
        rays come from thick matter (for example, water) into thin
        matter (for example, air), then total reflection on the
        bordering layer will take place at a certain angle of
        inclination. The same holds true for rays emitted from an
        underground watercourse if they infiltrate the air from the
        earth. At an angle of inclination of about 26.5° against the
        perpendicular, the ray is totally reflected. The rays bordering
        left and right together for an angle of approximately 53°; the
        width of the sensitive band is accordingly the same as the depth
        of the watercourse (<b><a href="#dob9">Diagram 9</a></b>). This
        practical rule of thumb has been in use for quite some time in
        the search for water by means of divining rods.</blockquote>

        only over underground watercourse, but also over mineral
        sources, salt and petroleum deposits, in the vicinity of
        magnets, from matter emitted from organic and inorganic sources,
        in sunlight, and in the light of quartz quicksilver lamps, in
        the light of electrical glowing lamps and many other sources.
        These emissions have the same nature as the radiation given off
        by underground substances and can be proven objectively with the
        help of the photographic plate. My experimental arrangement was
        the following:</blockquote>

        tested for radiation, for example by a steel magnet (<b><a

      <blockquote>The illustrated tests furnished the objective proof
        that radiation is emitted from many different materials, which
        make the photographic plates dense through the transmission of
        bare aluminum or magnesium. It is important now to determine the
        nature of this radiation.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>According to the absorption measurements of W. Mobius
        (3), the individual oscillations of water are of a 22 mm
        wavelength, and other wavelengths of 11 mm., 7.3 mm., 5.5 mm.,
        4.4 mm., 3.7 mm., etc., also appear. According to the
        determinations of R. Gans and R. Loyarte (4) and A.
        Glagolewa-Arkadiewa (5), the individual oscillations of
        elementary magnets have wavelengths of 2.27 to 5 mm. In spite of
        all efforts, these unsmooth electromagnetic waves still have not
        been physically proven with success. No measuring apparatus
        reacts to them.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>The tests of W. Mobius and the theoretical
        determinations of the researchers mentioned above make it
        probable that the radiation proved objectively above belongs to
        the unresearched area between ultrared and the shortest Hertzian
        waves, that is a matter of electromagnetic radiation.</blockquote>
