          Invention</b><br>
        <b>by John Vibes</b><br>

      <br>
      In recent years, the world has finally begun to take notice of the
      drastically declining bee populations, and people are starting to
      understand the impact that this could have on the ecosystem. <br>
      <br>
      Slowly, people who care are working to correct this problem with
      some inventive solutions.<br>
      <br>
      The father-son duo behind the "Flow Hive" took notice of this
      problem over ten years ago, and worked tirelessly to make their
      honey business more friendly to the bees.<br>
      <br>
      After roughly a decade of research, Stuart and Cedar Anderson
      released an Indiegogo-funded invention called "Flow Hive."<br>
      <br>
      The idea behind their invention was to replicate a real beehive
      and harvest honey without causing any harm or posing any risk to
      the bees or their home.<br>
      <br>
      Cedar Anderson is a third-generation beekeeper from Nimbin,
      Australia, and has been tinkering with beehives and the associated
      technology since he was a young child.<br>
      <br>
      Cedar was inspired to create a harm free beehive after his brother
      was stung during the honey extraction process.<br>
      <br>
      Eventually, once Cedar had a working prototype, he put a video
      online showing the prototype and explaining his idea, hoping to
      raise $70,000 for a tool that was needed for the factory.<br>
      <br>
      However, much to the family's surprise, the IndieGoGo campaign
      raised over $2 million dollars in one day, and would go on to be
      the most successful campaign in the website's history, raising
      over $12 million in total.<br>
      <br>
      In just a single day, the Anderson's lives were changed forever,
      and they were left with the monumental task of shipping out 24,000
      orders to over 130 countries.<br>
      <br>
      However, instead of just retiring and enjoying their riches, the
      Andersons have donated their profits towards a network of
      pollination projects that are working to protect wild habitats.<br>
      <br>
      "We're proud to have donated 100% of profits from the sale of our
      Flow Pollinator House to nine local grassroots pollinator projects
      in Australia and the United States that are at work protecting
      wild habitats all around the world.<br>
      <br>
      Pollinators need large areas of habitat to flourish - the more we
      can do to protect and conserve native habitats, the more
      opportunities these tiny environmental champions will have to do
      their important work," Cedar said.<br>
      <br>
      As the video below shows, the Flow beehive is a game-changer in
      beekeeping:<br>

      Earlier this year, Truth Theory reported that actor Morgan Freeman
      turned his 124-acre ranch in Mississippi into a sanctuary for
      bees. Freeman said that the bees seem to appreciate his help.<br>
      <br>
      He has never been stung while working with the bees, and he
      doesn't even wear any protective gear.<br>

      An artificial honeycomb for use in a beehive and which enables
      honey to be removed froth the honey-comb without removing the
      honeycomb from the hive; the honeycomb comprising cells and being
      formed of at least two parts which are moveable relative to each
      other between a cell formed position where the cells comprise side
      walls and an end wall to enable bees to fill the cell with honey,
      and a cell open position where at least some of the said walls
      have moved apart, whereby honey in the cells can be removed from
      the honeycomb by movement of the at least two parts to the cell
      open position<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention is directed to improvements in the
      collection of honey from a hive and is particularly directed to
      improvements where honey can be collected without needing to
      remove honeycombs from the hive.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] A modern beehive comprises various components which fit
      together to form the hive. Generally, these components will
      include:<br>
      <br>
      A Hive Stand. The upper hive components rest on this providing a
      landing board for the bees and helping to protect the Bottom Board
      from rot and cold transfer,<br>
      <br>
      A Bottom Board. This has an entrance for the bees to get into the
      hive. This can be screened for ventilation and mite control,<br>
      <br>
      A Brood Box. This is the most bottom box of the hive and is where
      the queen bee lays her eggs,<br>
      <br>
      A Honey Super. These are the uppermost box(s) where honey is
      stored.<br>
      <br>
      Frames &amp; Foundation. These are wooden or plastic frames with
      wax or plastic sheets with honeycomb impression where bees build
      wax honey combs, or pre formed plastic honeycombs.<br>
      <br>
      Outer Cover. This is the outermost housing to provide weather
      protection for the hive.<br>
      Inner Cover. This provides separation from an overly hot or cold
      Outer Cover and can be used as a shelf for feeding or other
      purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The honeycomb is a densely packed matrix of hexagonal
      cells. Bees use the cells to store food (honey and pollen). When a
      cell is filled, the bees place a wax cap over the end of the cell.
      The honeycomb is held in a frame which is usually rectangular.
      Several frames are placed next to each other in the upper part of
      the hive (the honey super). It is known to provide a plastic
      (usually polypropylene—but aluminium has also been used) honeycomb
      formed with the matrix of hexagonal cells. This relieves the bees
      of the effort required to build wax cells and gives the bees more
      time to collect honey. It is known to vary the shape and size of
      the cells in an artificial honeycomb.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Collection of honey can be very laborious and time
      consuming. As an example, a common way to collect honey requires
      the following steps to be carried out: A bee-proof suit needs to
      be donned; the lid of the hive is opened to expose the honey
      containing frames. The hive is smoked to calm the bees. A blower
      is sometimes used to remove bees from the frames. The frames are
      removed from the hive and transported to a processing center. The
      cells in the frame need to be uncapped by removing the wax cap.
      This can be done using an uncapping fork or an uncapping knife.
      The frames then need to be spun to remove the honey from the cells
      by centrifugal action. After the honey is removed, the frames are
      taken back to the hive and replaced (or new frames are inserted).
      It is estimated that the above time-consuming steps constitute
      approximately 90% of the beekeepers time required to collect honey
      from the hive.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Another disadvantage with conventional collecting
      techniques is the expense required in the provision of a honey
      shed, an extracting machine, and sometimes an automatic decapping
      machine.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Another disadvantage is that the hive can be quite damaged
      during the honey collecting process (also called the robbing
      process). For instance, bees use 7 kg of honey to make 1 kg of
      wax.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Another disadvantage is that the existing process greatly
      disturbs the bees and many bees may die during honey collection.
      Also, there is always the annoyance (and sometimes potential
      danger) in bee stings during the robbing process of the hive.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Another disadvantage with the existing process is that the
      hive can only be robbed at certain times such as daylight, no
      rain, no high winds, etc and therefore there are often
      restrictions and limitations on the times when the hive can be
      opened to collect the honeycombs.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Another disadvantage is that traditional hives leave spaces
      for pests and diseases.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Honey in the cells is held in place by the wax cover (cap)
      placed over the cell mouth by bees and also by the viscosity of
      the honey. Thus even if a way was found to remove the wax cap in a
      simpler manner, the honey would still not easily drain from the
      cells. This is why the frames need to be transported to a factory
      which has a centrifuge to spin the honey out of the cells once the
      cap has been removed.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] It is known to build a hive of special design and to suck
      honey out of the hive using a suction pump. The mechanism is quite
      complex as each frame has a dislodgeable plate on which the bees
      make their wax cells. When the honeycomb is full, the plate is
      moved to break part of the wax cell wall. However, due to the
      “sticky” nature of the honey, the honey does not drain from the
      cells and into a honey trough. Thus a suction pump is required to
      suck the honey out. The cells of the honeycomb are not artificial
      and instead are made by the bees. Also the wax is quite fragile
      and the above method is unlikely to work without breaking the wax
      combs.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] A more recent variation has a honeycomb formed with a
      backing plate closing off one end of the cells. Bees will fill the
      cell with honey and close off the other end with wax. The backing
      plate can be dislodged in the hive and in theory honey should flow
      from the cells by gravity and into collecting trays and pipes to
      flow from the hive. In practice, the honey does not readily drain
      due to the viscosity of the honey in the cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] It is known to provide heating in an attempt to decrease
      the viscosity of the honey and therefore to improve the honey flow
      characteristics. However, these known techniques can also heat the
      bees in the hive which is undesirable.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] It is known to transport beehives from one location to
      another location. With the general demise of bee numbers in
      agricultural areas, it is becoming more common for farmers to
      request beehives to be placed on their farms to improve
      pollination. A required number of beehives are lifted into a
      trailer (or similar) and then transported (typically by road
      transport) to a desired position. The hives are then unloaded from
      the trailer and placed on the ground (or on a stand) for the
      desired time which can be several weeks or several months. There
      would be an advantage if it were possible to provide a less
      physically demanding and time-consuming method to conduct this.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] It is an object of the present invention to provide an
      apparatus and method to remove honey from a hive which would
      overcome at least some of the abovementioned disadvantages or
      provide a useful or commercial choice. A preferred object is to
      enable honey to be removed from a honeycomb without needing to
      remove the honeycomb from the hive...<br>
