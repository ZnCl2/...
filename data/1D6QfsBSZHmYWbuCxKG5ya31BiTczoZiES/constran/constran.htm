              Roman,Times">Ingenious Automatic Power Control Does Away
              with Nuisance of Shifting</font></i> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A
            marvelous new type of automobile is now running through the
            streets of Paris. In appearance it resembles the thousands
            of small cars that throng the French capital. And yet this
            car is capable of performing such remarkable feats that it
            has aroused the intense interest of automotive engineers in
            all parts of the world.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            car has no transmission of the conventional type. There are
            no gears and no gear shift lever. Automatically and without
            attention on the part of the driver, it adjusts itself to
            the load, so that in any kind of a test or demonstration the
            driver has nothing to do except steer and press on the
            throttle with his foot until the desired results are
            obtained, whether he is towing a 5-ton truck up a steep hill
            or traveling at high speeds on an open country road. George
            Constantinesco, well-known automobile engineer, has
            perfected in this new gearless car a transmission along
            radically new lines.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If



            you ever have tried to push a stalled automobile along a
            road or to shove a heavy motor boat away from a dock you
            know how hard it is to get a heavy object into motion and
            how relatively easy it is to keep it going once you have it
            started. You have also found that it takes a lot more energy
            to get it started quickly than if you take your rime with
            the job.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            ease with which an object can be set in motion if you do the
            job at slow speed, and the extra effort required when you
            try to speed up the operation, is taken advantage of in the
            new gearless automobile. How this is accomplished is shown
            in the simplified drawing of the most important parts. It
            shows what happens when the crank is rotated by the engine.</font>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When



            the motor is started and un slowly and the automobile is
            stationary, the weight of the car keeps the drive shaft on
            which the ratchet wheel is mounted from turning, and the
            motion of the rotating crank is transmitted to the inertia
            wheel, which consequently oscillates back and forth. When
            the driver steps on the throttle the motor starts to speed
            up, and if the inertia wheel weighed practically nothing it
            would oscillate back and forth at increased speed. But the
            inertia wheel is made heavy and consequently it offers
            resistance to being oscillated back and forth with any great
            amount of speed.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This



            resistance tends to hold the differential lever attached to
            it from making the full motion imparted through the
            connecting rod by the crank and forces the other end of the
            lever to move back and forth slightly when the increase in
            speed first starts, and more rapidly as the engine develops
            more power. Note that the ratchets are so arranged that the
            ratchet wheel is turned in the same direction both on the
            forward and and backward motion of the link operating
            through the drive rods. At high speed the inertia wheel
            remains practically stationary and all of the motion is
            transmitted directly to the rear wheels.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            drawing, of course, does not show the parts as they actually
            are arranged in the automobile. For the sake of clearness
            the parts have been spread out and simplified. The ratchet
            wheel, for instance, really consists of a pair of
            over-running clutches that accomplish the same result
            without lost motion. Of course this mechanism can drive the
            car only in the forward direction, and consequently a
            reverse gear is fitted to facilitate backing the car around
            in the garage and to make turns on the road.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            control of the new car is much more simple than any of the
            standard automobiles. There being no clutch or gear shift
            lever, the driver does not have to worry about changing
            speeds. When he wants to stop he takes his foot off the
            throttle and puts on the brake. The motor slows down and the
            small amount of energy still being generated is used to rock
            the inertia wheel back and forth.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When



            he wants to start he throws off the brake and steps on the
            throttle and the car starts up without a jerk, automatically
            increasing speed until a balance is obtained between the
            speed of the car and the amount of power developed by the
            motor.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hills



            present no difficulties. The car simply slows down in
            proportion to the steepness of the hill. Consequently it
            will climb any hill as long as the rear wheels can obtain
            traction. Weird results can be accomplished by the
            remarkable infinite ratio transmission. If the back wheels
            are block with heavy logs when the car is standing and the
            driver steps on the throttle, the wheels rise up over the
            obstacle with a slow and gradual movement that suggests the
            running and jumping figures seen by a slow motion camera. It
            also enables a light demonstrator car fitted with a
            low-powered motor to tow a loaded 5-ton truck up a steep
            hill without laboring.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This



            simplified diagram shows how the gearless transmission
            passes the power from the motor to the drive shaft in
            proportion to the motor speed and the load. As the crank
            runs faster, the weight of the inertia wheel resists this
            speeding up process, and the other end of the differential
            lever starts to move back and forward, rotating the drive
            shaft by means of the ratchet wheel.</font> <br>

          <br>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">George Constantinesco was born in
          Romania and arrived in London in November 1910. By 1913 he had
          already applied for eighteen British Patents related to
          improvements in internal combustion engines and their
          ancillaries such as carburettors, fuels and transmission
          elements as well as early patents on methods of transmitting
          power by pulsating waves of energy through liquids. He
          formulated the Theory of Sonics --- the science dealing with
          the transmission of power by periodic forces and motions
          through liquids, solids and gases. He discovered that these
          phenomena had their analogies not only with the properties of
          sound waves and the laws of harmony, but also with AC
          electrical circuits.&nbsp; Prototypes of rock drills working
          on the percussion system and polyphase rotary systems were
          already being demonstrated by 1913. The most important
          application of his theory of sonics was a "synchroniser gear"
          which allowed to fire a machine gun through the aircraft
          propeller. This gear was employed on all allied aircraft
          during WWI and on some aicraft during WWII. After WWI
          Constantinesco had an idea for a low cost "peoples' car''
          which would travel 100 km miles on 2.5 litres of petrol at the
          most commonly used road speeds of 50 to 70 km per hour. He
          considered that this performance and low cost could be
          achieved by using a cheap 500 cc single cylinder two stroke
          air cooled engine together with his unique Torque Converter
          transmission which would eliminate the conventional gear box
          and clutch. Experience in this field could then be applied to
          the transmission of much higher powers in heavy vehicles such
          as railway locomotives. The car was displayed at London and
          Paris Motor shows in 1925 and attracted more than one hundred
          articles in world press. General Motors acquired a licence to
          build the car in 1926. Unfortunately development of the
          transmission stopped as there was no need for infinitely
          variable transmission while car engines were large (4-5
          litres) and had plenty of torque. His torque converter was
          however used in self propelling railcars. Constantinesco died
          in 1965 at the age of 94, and only few years before his death
          he presented a paper on Power Transmission at the Institutiom
          of Mechanical Engineering. Constantinesco had 133 British
          patents to his credit in the fields of automobile engineering,
          fluid power, mechanical transmissions and others. The
          following pages describe his career and his various
          inventions.&nbsp; We hope that you will enjoy reading this

        <p style="text-align: left;">With the war over and the Sonic
          Works at West Drayton disbanded, George was no longer
          compelled to apply his Sonic principles to engines of
          destruction. He had for many years shown an interest in motor
          cars and other vehicles for road and rail transportation. The
          first practical indications of this interest appeared in his
          patent for a monorail system in 1910, followed by others
          relating to components of internal combustion engines and
          transmission elements. Among these there was a paraffin
          vaporizer patented in 1911 which was tested in a car fuelled
          by crude paraffin oil on a journey from London to Brighton and
          back - at a cost of one shilling for the fuel for the round
          trip! During the war years George had already made an in-depth
          mathematical analysis of infinitely variable transmissions and
          had arrived at a concept for a mechanical Torque Converter. He
          claimed that such a device could be universally applied in
          industry, motor vehicles, railway locomotives, ships, military
          tanks and agricultural tractors. The exigencies of the war had
          interfered with further development, but now there was an
          opportunity to return to the theme. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Of the various possibilities which
          came to mind George concluded that the most fruitful and
          marketable line of approach to start with should be
          improvement in the efficiency and ease of operation of the
          transmission train of motor cars. He was concerned at the
          wasteful use of fuel inherent in existing engines and their
          transmission systems, the inconvenience of manual gear
          changing, and clutch operation, with consequent shocks to the
          engines and transmissions. Also there was the high price of
          motor cars, which only a minority of people could afford to
          buy. His idea was to produce a low cost one hundred guinea
          "peoples' car'' which would travel 100 miles on one gallon of
          petrol at the most commonly used road speeds of 30 to 40 miles
          per hour. George arrived at this figure after conducting a
          comprehensive survey of average car road speeds and designed
          his car to benefit the most people, rather than a car of
          higher speed which would only benefit a minority. He
          considered that this performance and low cost could be
          achieved by using a cheap 500 cc single cylinder two stroke
          air cooled engine together with his Torque Converter
          transmission which would eliminate the conventional gear box
          and clutch. Experience in this field could then be applied to
          the transmission of much higher powers in heavy vehicles such
          as railway locomotives. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">George admitted that the mechanics
          of his automatic variable transmission, or Torque Converter
          were not easy to explain because the theory of conventional
          mechanisms did not apply to this invention. It will be
          recalled from previous chapters that George used a hydrosonic
          system to operate the aircraft machine guns and the injector
          system for Diesel engines. His Torque Converter was a
          sonomechanical application of his theory on the transmission
          of power by vibrations where the impulses are transmitted
          through solids instead of liquids. Power is transmitted from
          the engine to the output shaft through a system of oscillating
          levers and inertias1 arranged in such a way as to split the
          alternating motion derived from a primary crank rotating with
          uniform angular speed and torque into two components. The
          first component oscillates a mass or any form of inertia. The
          second component oscillates a set of mechanical valves. The
          valves are arranged in pairs out of phase at 180°, so that
          positive and negative impulses are rectified into a
          unidirectional torque on the secondary. The angular speed and
          torque on the secondary varies automatically within wide
          limits according to the resistance to be overcome and the
          revolutions of the engine. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Torque Converter was typical of
          the way in which George Constantinesco worked, the first model
          emerged from a purely mathematical analysis of the problem to
          be solved, followed by a mathematical solution translated into
          a working drawing. The model made from the working drawing
          performed as predicted without "trial and error'' or
          modification. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A great deal of interest in the
          invention was aroused in the popular and technical press, but
          many of the statements made were inaccurate or misleading. In
          an attempt to clarify the situation, the Editor of the
          Automobile Engineer invited George to discuss the whole
          concept of variable transmissions for motorcars in a series of
          five articles in that publication from November 1923 to July
          1924. These articles, together with the correspondence which
          arose, were reprinted at George's request, in a volume
          entitled "Variable Transmissions for Automobiles'' [9], and
          issued in quantity from his offices at 7 Grosvenor Gardens in
          London. This was an indication of George's confidence in the
          accuracy of his analysis of the problem and his solution
          provided by his invention, in spite of the criticism and
          sometimes heated arguments generated in the correspondence.
          Further criticism and disbelief was silenced when George
          published a letter in the July 1924 issue of the Automobile
          Engineer offering a prize of £100 ''to the first individual
          who will prove that my mathematics are wrong or the
          interpretation of my formulae are not in strict accordance
          with logic". </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">To illustrate the basic principle
          of the Constantinesco Torque Converter, consider figs 16a and
          16b. The impulses are produced by a crank connected to a point
          distant from the apex of a pendulum, or lever with a weight on
          the end. This apex is connected by a short link to a fixed
          point; the apex of the pendulum is connected with links to
          unidirectional ''mechanical valves" on the secondary shaft,
          which operate like ratchets, but much more smoothly. When the
          primary crank rotates slowly, figure 16a, the pendulum swings
          to and fro about the apex, or fulcrum of the lever, as in a
          clock and no energy is imparted to the secondary shaft. This
          corresponds to the ''neutral" position in a conventional gear
          box with the prime mover ticking over. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <center>
            <p><img src="fig27.gif" height="290" width="763"></p>
            <p><b>Fig. 16&nbsp; Principle of operation of the Torque
                Converter</b></p>
          </center>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">When the revolutions of the prime
          mover are increased considerably, the frequency of the crank
          oscillations increases and thus tries to increase the
          frequency of the pendulum oscillations. At this point a new
          set of circumstances arises. Due to its inertia the pendulum
          weight tends to remain stationary fig. 16b. Under these
          conditions and when the load on the secondary is moderate, the
          fulcrum of the pendulum, which was at the apex, has been
          transferred to the position of the pendulum weight. The result
          is that the apex of the pendulum oscillates instead, to the
          maximum to and fro motion, permitted by the design. This
          causes the links to oscillate the valves, which in turn rotate
          the output shaft to the maximum angular speed permitted by the
          design. Under these conditions the system is operating in
          ''top gear" with a 1 to 1 ratio. (The remarkable similarity to
          the operation of the hydrosonic system for the aircraft firing
          gear is apparent. As soon as the aircraft engine reached a
          predetermined number of revolutions, the inertia of the liquid
          column diverted the high frequency pulses down the pipes
          connected to the trigger motors.) </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">At intermediate angular speeds of
          the input crank the effective fulcrum will take up
          intermediate positions on the pendulum rod. Consequently there
          will be more or less swing (or amplitude) of the pendulum
          weight and more or less travel (or amplitude) of the valve
          links according to the speed of the input crank and the torque
          on the secondary shaft, fig. 16c. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In other words, the operation of
          the mechanism is dependent on the frequency and amplitude of
          the input impulses to the mechanical valves which
          automatically increase or decrease according to the load to be
          overcome on the secondary shaft. The mechanical valves rectify
          the alternating nature of the impulses into unidirectional
          impulses which act on the output shaft in a cumulative way.
          One valve rotates the output shaft on the forward stroke and
          the other valve rotates the shaft in the same direction on the
          reverse stroke. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The first model ever made to
          illustrate the principle of the Torque Converter is shown in
          fig.17. It will be observed that the mechanism is upside down
          in relation to the previous description with the ''weight" of
          the ''pendulum" at the top instead of at the bottom. The
          construction of this model follows the arrangement shown in
          fig. 18, where the primary shaft is connected by a rod to the
          centre of a floating lever. This introduces more elasticity in
          the system, but in all other respects the model demonstrates
          the basic principle of the Torque Converter as described. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Other models to demonstrate the
          principle of the Torque Converter were made in Meccano by
          schoolboys and other enthusiasts during the 1920s, an example
          of which is shown in figs 19 and 20 applied to a model car
          chassis. This example follows the same arrangement as in fig.
          18, but ratchets had to be used as it was not possible to
          construct mechanical valves with Meccano parts. This mechanism
          occupied the space of the former conventional gearbox in the
          standard Meccano model of a motor car chassis. The Torque
          Converter mechanism was driven by a Meccano electric motor
          connected to the input eccentric by a chain. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">George first successfully tested a
          Torque Converter in a car in May l 923, using an experimental
          model that had been built only for bench tests. He obtained an
          old Sheffield Simplex chassis and replaced the big 45 hp
          engine with a 10 hp "light car'' Singer engine, and built a
          platform on the chassis. This car was driven around the
          outskirts of London loaded with 10 people, including the
          inventor at the wheel, fig.&nbsp; 21, and later towed a lorry
          up a steep hill. As a further demonstration of the
          capabilities of the car, six inch wooden blocks were placed in
          front of the wheels. When the accelerator was depressed the
          car climbed over the blocks smoothly and without hesitation,
          to the astonishment of the bystanders. This test was merely to
          demonstrate the possibilities of the Torque Converter, because
          even a 10 hp engine was much larger than necessary for the
          production car envisaged. </p>

        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The next development was to apply
          the idea of a low cost 500 cc single cylinder two stroke
          aircooled engine coupled to a Torque Converter installed in a
          light car chassis. This was exhibited in the Palace of
          Engineering during the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in
          1924, fig. 22. </p>

        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The chassis performed as predicted
          under test but the disadvantages of the aircooled engine and
          balancing problems associated with the one cylinder were
          recognized and subsequently overcome in a completely new
          design concept for a production car. This comprised an
          integral balanced power unit of about 500 cc capacity (bore 67
          mm, stroke 70 mm) with the Torque Converter mounted between
          two water cooled cylinders and an improved carburettor, also
          one of George's patents. The RAC rating was 5.58 hp and the
          tax was £6. A cross section of the power unit through the
          converter mechanism is shown in fig 23, where the arrangement
          of oscillating inertias, links, and valves can be seen. The
          diagram in fig. 24 shows the position of the inertias in the
          extreme working condition equivalent to fig. 16b. </p>

          cars were exhibited at the Paris Motor Show in 1926, fig. 26.

        <p style="text-align: left;">A demonstration model of the power
          unit and a similar chassis is housed in the Science Museum in
          London. A two seater model of the car, with the inventor at
          the wheel, is illustrated in fig. 27. The performance of the
          car was exactly as George had predicted, 100 miles per gallon
          of petrol at 38 miles per hour. Only the originally estimated
          sale price of 100 guineas was found to be too optimistic for a
          car fitted with the improved two cylinder power unit and had
          to be revised to £215, and £315 for the saloon version. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">In addition to the economic virtues
          of the car, the other outstanding feature was the ease of
          control, which George often demonstrated in a convincing
          manner. Here was a car which even a child could drive after a
          little practice at steering, as proved by his small son Ian,
          who was taught to drive and demonstrate it at the tender age
          of eight. Then there was M. Antoine Bourdelle, the famous
          sculptor, who drove the car around the streets of Paris after
          only a few minutes tuition, although he had never handled a
          car before. Another of George's demonstrations was to have
          somebody leading the car with a thin string attached to the
          throttle lever on the carburettor. In fig. 28 his wife Sandra
          is performing the demonstration and George is following on
          behind. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;">

        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In order to appreciate how easy it
          was to drive this car a description of the method of operation
          is appropriate. With the car at rest and the handbrake on, the
          engine would be started and allowed to tick over. To move off,
          the handbrake would be released in the usual way and the right
          foot would depress the accelerator pedal. At about 1200 rpm.
          the car would start to move away smoothly and progressively
          gather speed, but at the same time the engine revolutions
          would gradually decrease until maximum speed was attained in
          the equivalent of "top gear''. Speed control thereafter would
          be entirely through the accelerator pedal. On reaching a hill
          it would be noticed that the car would tend to slow down, but
          the engine revolutions would not decrease as in the case of a
          conventional gearbox. By depressing the accelerator pedal
          fully the car would regain speed and continue to climb the
          hill. On a very steep slope, say 1 in 3, the car would slow
          down but continue to climb, without loss of engine
          revolutions. In other words the Torque Converter would
          automatically select the correct "gear ratio'' under all road
          conditions encountered. Starting on a steep hill was also very
          easy, because when the brake was released the car was
          automatically spragged by the mechanism and could not run
          backwards. No matter what the conditions were, the engine
          would never stall due to overload. For example, it was
          possible to place the front of the car against a wall and
          fully depress the accelerator, but the engine could continue
          running at maximum revolutions and exert maximum torque on the
          driving wheel. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In order to slow down and stop the
          car, the accelerator pedal would be released and the left foot
          would depress the brake pedal. The car would soon stop if
          required, as it had brakes on all four wheels, and then the
          handbrake would be applied. The only other control in the car
          was a lever, which actuated a reverse gear in the back axle. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Another novel feature was that the
          back axle had no differential. It was unnecessary because
          there was only one driving wheel and the other was free. Since
          the propeller shaft rotated anticlockwise looking from the
          rear, the torque on the propeller shaft gave a considerable
          increase of loading on the driven wheel. Furthermore, as the
          propeller shaft torque was about five times that commonly
          encountered in the orthodox chassis, the single fixed wheel
          had a road adhesion comparable with that provided by a
          conventional differential axle driving two wheels. A further
          important feature was that as the direction of rotation of the
          propeller shaft was the same for both forward and reverse, the
          road adhesion was the same for both directions. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In addition to motorcars, the
          railway locomotive offered fertile ground for the application
          of the Torque Converter transmission. The steam locomotive was
          still the best practical solution available for long distance
          heavy haulage, but was admittedly uneconomical. The internal
          combustion engine could provide greater economy but it had not
          been possible to employ it at reasonable cost. Although
          electrification seemed to provide the ultimate long term
          solution, the conversion from steam to electricity would
          entail enormous capital outlay and it was thought that many
          years would pass before the full benefits could be made
          available. Even then, it would only be applicable to a small
          percentage of the world's railways. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The use of George Constantinesco's
          Torque Converter transmission in a locomotive appeared to
          offer an immediate and economical solution to the problem
          because of its ability to cope with heavy starting and
          acceleration torques without overloading or stalling the
          engine, while the wide and automatically variable gear ratios
          would enable light weight high speed internal combustion
          engines to be used. Although George's main effort in the early
          1920s was directed to development of the Torque Converter car
          the prospects for a Torque Converter locomotive appeared to be
          equally compelling. Consequently, he fitted a locomotive
          chassis with a six cylinder 250 hp petrol engine and Torque
          Converter and demonstrated it on his stand at the Wembley
          Exhibition in 1924, fig. 29. The chassis of this locomotive
          was a former Great Western Railway ''Armstrong Goods'' 0-6-0
          No. 395, which George converted to a 2-4-0, using the leading
          jack shaft for transmission of power to the other four coupled
          wheels from the Torque Converter. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">The first experimental trials of
          this locomotive hauling a load of goods wagons took place on
          the Southern Railway in its Longhedge Yard, Battersea, on 30th
          June 1925, coinciding with the celebrations of the Centenary
          of Railways. At the same time, it was inspected by members of
          the International Railway Congress. This considerable
          publicity and expense did not result in this Torque Converter
          system being adopted on British railways, but it was adopted
          by the Romanian State Railways for railcars on their branch
          lines a few years later. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Apart from cars and locomotives,
          the possibility of the universal application of the
          Constantinesco Torque Converter in all cases where automatic
          adjustment of speed and load would be useful was given due
          weight in George's advertising material and demonstration
          models. Some of the more important applications considered
          included ship propulsion, auxiliary machinery on board ships,
          winches, cranes, haulage gear, machine tools and heavy duty
          starters for powerful engines. </p>

          applications were demonstrated on George's stands at Wembley
          in 1924, Paris in 1926 and at a special conference on George
          Constantinesco's work at the French Society of Civil Engineers
          in Paris on 16th December 1926. Fig. 30 shows a model of a
          marine application to replace clutches, reduction gears and
          reverse gears. In this model a very high speed petrol engine
          is driving a slow running propeller through the gearless
          transmission. The only control is the lever at the top of the
          converter, which enables forward, neutral and reverse to be
          obtained without changing the speed of the engine. Fig. 31
          shows an example of the use of a constant speed cheap A.C.
          electric motor to drive machines of any kind, with the same
          single lever on the converter to obtain the desired variation
          of speed and load control. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">At the Paris Motor Show in 1926,
          George had another convincing demonstration of the
          capabilities of the Torque Converter in the shape of a starter
          for heavy engines operated by a small electric motor. The
          output of the starter was connected to a lever with a tractor
          seat on the end. Members of the public, the heavier the
          better, were invited to sit on the seat and to their
          astonishment were lifted effortlessly aloft by the small
          electric motor, without gears! </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Constantinesco Torque Converter
          aroused intense interest in the popular and technical press in
          many parts of the world. The stand at the 1924 Wembley
          Exhibition alone generated over 300 enquiries from firms and
          individuals and over 200 articles in magazines and newspapers.
          Frequent requests came in to 7 Grosvenor Gardens from
          individuals and firms wanting to be appointed as Agents for
          the hundred guinea car from such diverse locations as North
          and South America, Europe, India and Australia, as well as
          from the British Isles. Unfortunately all these enquiries were
          premature in that it had not been possible to develop the car
          to the production stage due to lack of resources. Thus, the
          enquirers had to be informed that the car was still in the
          experimental stage, but they were placed on a priority list
          for eventual delivery on a first come, first served, basis. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">As in the past, with wave
          transmission and the aircraft firing gear, George had the
          greatest difficulty in obtaining adequate financial backing
          for the development of the Torque Converter, and the reaction
          of the motor manufacturers varied from lukewarm interest to
          active opposition. A case in point was the refusal of the
          Wembley Exhibition authorities to allow Constantinesco to
          exhibit the chassis among the cars, due to objections from The
          Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders on the grounds that
          he was not a member of the Society and manufacturing the
          chassis in quantity. George sued the authorities and lost the
          case with costs, but was eventually allowed to exhibit in the
          Palace of Engineering. In the absence of support from the
          motor industry and following the demise of the Romanian based
          Company, Industria Sonica, a series of small British
          Syndicates and Companies were formed to finance research and
          development of the Torque Converter, the costs of the exhibits
          at Wembley and Paris and ancillaries such as carburettors,
          speed indicators and liquid level indicators. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">One of the more long standing of
          these Companies, formed in 1922, was Constantinesco Torque
          Converters Ltd, with offices in 40 Grosvenor Gardens and works
          in 130 Wilton Road, London. This Company, with a share capital
          of £75,000 acquired world rights in the invention. Under the
          agreement George Constantinesco was appointed the Consulting
          Engineer at a fixed salary, out of which he was to bear the
          cost of obtaining British Patents, continue research on behalf
          of the Company, provide drawings and designs, act in a
          consultative capacity and supervise development and
          experimental work. By today's standards and costs for research
          and development, the funds available were modest and fell far
          short of requirements. Another Company, Engine Power Ltd was
          formed to boost finances by disposing of a large stock of 250
          hp Ricardo engines stored in the Slough premises, but sales
          were disappointing. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A breakthrough appeared to be in
          sight when in February 1925 the General Motors Corporation of
          Detroit took an option on a licence to manufacture the Torque
          Converter for use in cars under an agreement with
          Constantinesco Torque Converters Ltd and George
          Constantinesco. About $100,000 were advanced against future
          royalties to cover further research and development costs to
          meet specifications and $3,000 per month were paid in
          consideration of the option. The option was to be exercised
          within three years upon payment of $3 million, or $4 million
          within four years and a royalty of $2 was to be paid for each
          converter sold in the U.S.A. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Encouraged by this arrangement and
          in anticipation of early marketing of the Converter George
          committed all available funds to research and development, not
          only for the car but also for new applications. The
          maintenance of his life style and generosity to family and
          friends was commensurate with the expected rewards for a hard
          working and successful businessman, but in the event the
          potential returns never materialized and the period was marked
          by a series of domestic and financial difficulties which
          undermined his health. His first marriage had broken down
          during this difficult period and ended in divorce. At the same
          time he was being hounded by the inland Revenue for tax
          assessed on royalties received during the war before his
          inventions were taken over by the Government, including the
          Government award for the synchronizing gear, which he had
          expected to be free of tax. To add to his frustrations it
          appeared that General Motors were reluctant to exercise their
          option within the specified dates but willing to service the
          fees. This did not suit George, because it meant in effect
          that the use of his Converter in cars was blocked. He was
          impatient to see the invention used and personal financial
          rewards were a secondary consideration, or so it seemed, as
          the agreement with General Motors lapsed and he tried to make
          alternative arrangements for the manufacture and marketing of
          the car. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Finally, this approach failed and
          towards the end of the decade George again found himself to be
          in a precarious financial position and without funds to
          proceed further with the motorcar project. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the meantime George had met with
          Eva Litton who was to become his second wife and constant
          companion for the rest of his life. Eva, with two sons,
          Richard and Michael by a previous marriage, was of independent
          means through a legacy from her father, a Lancashire textile
          mill owner. As well as being highly intellectual and a
          proficient pianist like George, she had inherited her family's
          business sense and thrift and soon advised George how to
          extricate himself from his difficulties in London and
          Weybridge. He wound up his affairs in London, including the
          sale of his patent rights in the torque converter car, sold
          his expensive house 'Carmen Sylva' in Weybridge and with his
          young son Ian joined forces with Eva at Oxen House, on the
          shores of Lake Coniston in the English Lake District. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Romanians had shown interest in
          the Torque Converter for use in railcars and here surely there
          was new hope for the further development of the invention.
          There was a need for inexpensive and cheap to run railcars on
          branch lines and the use of relatively small internal
          combustion engines coupled to the Constantinesco Torque
          Converter appeared to meet requirements. The development work
          would need George's presence in Romania for some time, so he
          soon converted the outbuildings at Oxen House into offices and
          a laboratory and completed plans for the locomotive Torque
          Converter. Eva accompanied George on his trips to Romania on
          the development of the railway project. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Testing, development and
          manufacture was carried out at the former Malaxa Ironworks of
          Bucharest during the 1930s. Initially, successful tests were
          carried out with a 10 hp engine and converter mounted in a 10
          tonne railcar. These results were very encouraging considering
          that similar cars in other countries were using 100 to 140 hp
          engines. The next stage was the establishment of production
          lines and special machine tools for the building of 30 tonne
          passenger railcars with 60 seats. These were propelled by two
          engines of 20 hp each mounted under the chassis. These
          railcars ran without trouble at about 40 mph, a performance
          which appeared to be quite suitable for conditions in Romania
          at the time. Looking to the future more power and faster
          speeds would be required on main lines as well as branch lines
          to meet the needs of rapidly growing industry and
          infrastructure in all countries. Bearing this in mind, George
          made a survey of requirements and solutions proposed in
          several other countries, including Germany, Britain and the
          United States. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In spite of the rapid progress in
          electrification and the development of Diesel electric power
          units, George maintained his confidence in his Torque
          Converter system as a simple and economic power unit but
          conceded that further development work was needed to cope with
          higher powers and speeds. The problem was not so much with
          design parameters as with lack of suitable materials and
          methods of manufacture. This work was in progress at the
          Malaxa Works in the testing laboratory together with the
          production work, when a change in railway policy led to
          withdrawal of funds. Thus George had to abandon the project in
          Romania and return to England, where lack of funds and advent
          of the second world war prevented any further development of
          an invention meant for peacetime conditions. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">George Constantinesco was not the
          first inventor to have failed to bring an outstanding
          invention to commercial fruition. The Torque Converter was
          quite unique and introduced a new concept in mechanics, but
          perhaps it was too far ahead of its time. The inertia and
          scepticism of manufacturers committed to conventional
          transmissions was understandable, particularly during periods
          of depression between the wars, while economy in fuel
          consumption was not regarded as of consequence as fuels were
          plentiful and cheap. Looking to the future, there is an ever
          increasing need for economy in the consumption of fossil
          fuels, and for moderate speeds, safety and driver comfort on
          congested roads. This inevitable situation is resulting in
          research workers, inventors and manufacturers taking renewed
          interest in variable gearless transmissions coupled to high
          efficiency engines for motor cars. Better materials are now
          available, as well as improved design and manufacturing
          facilities with computer assistance. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">1 -- The inertias are weights used
          by the Torque Converter and its action depends on their
          resistance to a change in movement --- their inertia. A
          pendulum bob acts as an inertia for a clock. <br>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            present invention relates to an improved method and
            apparatus for transmitting power from internal combustion
            engines or other prime movers adapted to develop limited
            torque to driven shafts and is particularly applicable to
            locomotives or other vehicles, or to machinery driven by
            internal combustion engines, steam turbines, electromotors
            and the like.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            invention is of general application where the prime mover is
            an internal combustion engine or other engine adapted to
            develop limited torque and the torque to be overcome at the
            driven shaft is variable within wide limits.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            object of the invention is to transmit power from the engine
            to the driven shaft in such a manner that increased
            resistant torque at the driven shaft may result in an
            increase of engine speed, so that the power developed by the
            engine does not unduly decrease with increased resistance.</font>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            invention further consists in a method and means, of
            utilizing the inertia of a suitably arranged oscillating or
            reciprocating mass for transmitting power from a prime mover
            to a driven shaft in such a manner that the power developed
            by the engine does not unduly decrease with increased
            resisting torque.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            invention further consists in a transmission mechanism for
            the purpose described comprising an oscillating or
            reciprocating member or floating link connected at two
            different points to a driving shaft and a unidirectional
            driving mechanism, the floating link carrying or being
            connected to a mass capable of oscillation or reciprocation.</font>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            invention also consists in a power unit comprising in
            combination a prime mover adapted to develop a limited
            torque whose shaft is connected to one point of a floating
            link, which at another point carries or is connected to a
            heavy mass, such floating link being connected to a device
            converting the oscillating motion to rotary motion.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            invention also consists in a variable resistance power unit
            comprising an internal combustion engine whose driving shaft
            transmits motion through a connecting rod to an oscillating
            link, the link being pivoted to a mass capable of
            oscillation, and also connected by two connecting rods with
            two opposed oscillating ratchet devices driving a rotor,
            such rotor being connected to the driven shaft.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            invention further consists in the improved method and means
            for transmitting power from prime movers hereinafter
            described.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In



            a simple illustration of the principle of the invention
            there may be provided a floating link one end of which is
            caused to move by an eccentric mounted on a rotating driving
            shaft and which carries at its other end a mass. An
            intermediate point of the lever is connected to two
            connecting rods actuating a driven shaft through two ratchet
            devices by which the oscillating movement of the floating
            link is converted to a rotary movement, the ratchet devices
            operating at each half revolution of the driving shaft.</font>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With



            such an arrangement it will be seen that if the resistance
            to rotation of the driven shaft is small, the mass on the
            lever will not move far on each side of its mean position at
            each oscillation, and the length of travel of the ratchets
            will be a maximum when the resistance to rotation of the
            driven shaft is zero.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As



            the resistance to rotation of the driven shaft increases,
            the travel of the mass increases, and that of the ratchet
            decreases; consequently at each revolution of the driving
            shaft, owing to the smaller angular movement of the ratchets
            when the resistance is high, it can be shown that the torque
            required from the prime mover does not unduly increase.
            Consequently with such an arrangement, if the prime mover is
            an internal combustion engine, for example, a constant or
            increased speed of revolution of the engine can be
            maintained, although the torque on he driven shaft is
            increased. In fact it can be shown mathematically that
            taking into account the inertia opposed by the oscillating
            mass the torque on the driven shaft is proportional to the
            square of the speed of the prime mover.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Many



            modifications of the arrangement are evidently possible; but
            in order to effect the object of the invention, it is
            essential that the driving shaft and the unidirectional
            driving connection should be connected to an oscillating or
            reciprocating member such as a floating link, at two
            different points, the link carrying or being connected to a
            mass capable of oscillation or reciprocation about a mean
            position.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In



            order to obtain stability without special means for
            maintaining a mean position of the various parts of the gear
            the forces acting on the oscillating mass should act in a
            direction away from and not towards its pivot or point of
            suspension.</font> </p>

            will be seen that in all the diagrammatic arrangements above
            described, neglecting the inertia of the oscillating mass,
            the motion of the driving parts is indeterminate; it is
            accordingly necessary to consider the stability of the
            system when in motion, as with incorrect positions of the
            fixed axis and moving pivots the amplitude of the
            oscillations of the flywheel or pivoted mass may tend to
            increase indefinitely the whole system becoming unstable,
            with the result that jamming and consequent breakage of the
            linkage will occur.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To



            illustrate this, the forces acting in the various parts of
            the apparatus in one example of the invention, are shown in
            the diagram Figure 6. Considering the equilibrium of the
            oscillating flywheel 15 it can be shown that the average
            resultant of the tension forces which are transmitted
            through the connecting rod 8 will always be between the
            dotted lines indicated by the arrows a2, a3. It should be
            noted that the reverse stresses in the connecting rods 8, 9
            are due to inertia of reciprocating parts in the
            unidirectional drive and are very small in comparison with
            the driving forces referred to. Consequently in the
            arrangement shown in this figure the resultant forces acting
            on the oscillating flywheel 15 will always be alternately to
            left and right and always in the direction away from the
            axis about which the flywheel oscillated, so that the
            stability of the system is maintained.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In



            the diagram Figure 7, if we consider the speed v of driven
            shaft as abscissae, the torque at driven shaft will be
            approximately represented by the ordinates of the curve z
            and the speed of the prime mover by the ordinates of the
            curve u, the torque of the driving shaft being kept
            constant.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From



            these curves it can be seen that as the speed of the driven
            shaft gets beyond a certain speed, the torque at the driven
            shaft tends towards a constant value, and the speed of the
            prime mover varies in linear proportion with that of the
            driven shaft very much as in ordinary gear of constant
            ratio. On the other hand when the speed of the driven shaft
            diminishes below a certain value, the torque at the driven
            shaft increases very rapidly and similarly the speed of the
            prime mover also increases.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In



            carrying out the invention into effect as illustrated in
            Figures 8, 9, 10, 11, the prime mover drives the shaft a
            which carries a flywheel b and is connected by the
            connecting rod c to the center of a floating link d. The
            upper end of this link is pivoted a t e to a swinging lever
            f pivoted at x which carries at its lower end a mass g. The
            lower end of the floating link is connected by two pairs of
            connecting rods hk to two double arms lm oscillating about
            the axis of the motor. On the oscillating arms at p1, q1
            respectively are pivoted double circular frames pq carrying
            pivoted friction pads rs, Figure 10, bearing on the rotor on
            the side of its circumference remote from the pivots of the
            frames. The pads rs are adapted to bear on the circumference
            t of the rotor and grip the rotor in turn so as to drive it
            always in the direction in which the pads tend to approach
            the rotor owing to the fact that the pivot of each pad on
            its frame and the pivot of each frame on its driving arm are
            situated on a line which does not pass through the center of
            the rotor. Further the angle between the diameters on which
            these pivots are situated is less than the angle of friction
            at starting with the particular materials used to form the
            surfaces of the pad and rotor. The lower connecting rods k
            are under tension and the upper rods h under compression.
            The pads are of substantial length occupying nearly a
            quarter of the circumference of the rotor. The springs u
            serve merely to keep the friction pads in light contact with
            the rotor on the idle stroke.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Accurately



            placed pins might, however, be employed with or without
            springs for the same purpose, especially where a yielding
            material such as rubber is used in the pads.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It



            is desirable in some cases to provide an elastic drive
            between the rotor and the shaft to be driven as in the two
            phase form illustrated to torque is intermittent. If
            considerable inertia on the driven shaft has to be overcome
            an elastic shaft of some type is of importance.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It



            will be seen that with the apparatus above described,
            rotation of the driving shaft causes oscillation of the
            floating link d and this oscillation can be transmitted
            either to the mass g through the lever f or through the
            connecting rods hk to the unidirectional device on the
            rotor. As the speed of the driving shaft is increased
            without much load on the driven shaft, the amplitude of the
            oscillation of the mass g decreases and the stroke of the
            oscillating members driven by the rods h and k increases,
            thus increasing the speed of the rotor relative to the speed
            of the prime mover. If the apparatus is started with a heavy
            resisting torque acting on the driven shaft the swinging
            mass immediately starts oscillating at its maximum amplitude
            producing high alternating forces in the connecting rods hk,
            the forces being proportional to the square of the speed of
            the prime mover; so that if the speed of the prime mover is
            sufficiently increased, the torque on the driven shaft is
            overcome by the unidirectional mechanism and the driven
            shaft commences to rotate. Until rotation has started no
            energy is taken up except the amount absorbed by internal
            frictions. The driven shaft then rotates with corresponding
            diminuation of the movement of the swinging lever, the
            torque to overcome the resistance at the driven shaft being
            proportional to the square of the speed of the prime mover
            and directly produced by the forces set up in the connecting
            rods hk and proportional to the speed of the prime mover.
            The relative values of speeds and torque produced by the
            mechanism are shown approximately in the diagram, Figure 7,
            in which it will be seen that many forms of the invention
            other than that above described are possible and many other
            forms of mechanism may be adopted in place of the
            unidirectional drive mechanism illustrated; for example,
            three mechanisms as described differing in phase by 120
            degrees may be provided acting on the same shaft and in this
            case almost continuous rotation instead of intermittent
            rotation would be obtained. The unidirectional drive
            mechanism employed may be of any suitable type. Further,
            instead of a swinging lever an oscillating flywheel or mass
            of any shape may be employed.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It



            will be seen that with a mechanism constructed as above
            described, vertical movement of either of the centers, that
            is either of the axis of the rotor, axis of the mass, or
            axis of the prime mover, will produce very little effect on
            the motion. Further, slight horizontal movement of these
            centers is also permissible. Alternating movement of the
            rotor center in the horizontal direction will merely serve
            to slightly increase the speed of the rotor. It is possible,
            therefore, with such mechanism to allow small variations of
            the distances between any two of the supporting centers of
            driving shaft, mass, and driven shaft. This is of extreme
            convenience in motor vehicles, as parts of the apparatus may
            be mounted on springs and parts directly on the road wheels
            if desired.</font> </p>

            18, suitable for use in the transmission, the driving of the
            rotor is effected through face clutches. The connecting rods
            61, 62 from the floating link are pivoted to the oscillating
            members 63, 64 by pins 65, 66 and drive the rotor 67, 68
            through friction plates 69, 70, which are mounted on the
            spherical members 71, 72. The locking of the device for
            driving the rotor in one direction is effected by pressure
            exerted through the slightly inclined rods 73, 74 which
            press through ball ends against the clutch members 69, 70
            and he parts 67, 68 of the rotor which are keyed to the
            driven shaft by stout pins 75. Springs 76, 77 are provided
            adapted to keep the members 69, 70 in light contact with the
            oscillating members 63, 64 during the idle stroke. The
            actual friction surface may be provided by annular leather,
            rubber or like pads giving a considerable gripping surface.</font>

            the form of the invention shown in Figures 19, 20 and 21,
            the shaft 81 of the prime mover carries a flywheel 82 and is
            connected by the connecting rod 83 with the floating link
            84. This link 84 is connected at the other end to the almost
            vertically moving connecting rods 85, 86 which actuate the
            oscillating members 87, 88 which are adapted to drive the
            rotor disks 89, 90 through inclined rods 91, 92, as
            described above with reference to Figure 18. The lever 84 is
            pivoted at 93 to a crank 94 keyed rigidly to the vertical
            levers 95 pivoted at 96 in the fixed standards 97 and
            carrying at their lower ends masses 98. A certain freedom is
            permitted for angular movement at the various pivots at the
            ends of the connecting rods by making the bearings of curved
            form as illustrated in order to allow angular play.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It



            will be seen that in this modification the system is in
            indifferent dynamic equilibrium so that quite a small force
            is able to keep the oscillating mass in the mean position.
            As illustrated gravity effects this, and suitable buffers
            may be provided to prevent excess shifting of the mean
            position of the oscillating mass to one side or the other.</font>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Also

            invention described above is suitable for traction purposes.
            The transmission gear, however, will be seen to be
            applicable to a large number of other purposes in which it
            is desired to overcome a torque at the driven shaft variable
            between very wide limits either with a constant torque prime
            mover, or a prime mover having other characteristics, for
            example, using the transmission gear for driving rolling
            mills by steam turbines, IC engines or electric motors.
            Also, it can be applied to machine tools such as drilling
            machines, and as a mechanism for gearing down from high
            speed shafts for various purposes. Many other examples of
            transmission for which the gear is suitable will naturally
            present themselves.</font> </p>

            in apparatus constructed as above described the movement of
            the oscillating members is approximately harmonic and the
            movement of the driven shaft is unidirectional, the shock
            which would be expected to take place at the instant of
            gripping will in many cases be sufficiently taken up by the

            shaft to a shaft subject to a resisting torque as claimed in

            device which drives a rotor unidirectionally, the motion of
            the prime mover being distributed between the oscillating
            mass and the rotor. The proportion in which this motion is
            distributed depends upon the torque on the rotor. If there
            is no torque the oscillating mass receives little or none of
            the motion. If, on the other hand, the torque is infinite so
            that the rotor cannot move, the oscillating mass receives

            the apparatus shown in the figures, the prime mover consists
            of a single cylinder engine having a cylinder <i>a</i> in
            which moves a piston <i>b</i>. The piston is connected by a
            rod or rods <i>c</i> to a crank <i>d</i> on the primary
            shaft <i>e</i>, which rotates continuously.&nbsp; The
            piston is also connected by the rod <i>f</i>, directly and
            independently of the connecting rod or rods <i>c</i>, with
            the knuckle <i>g</i> of a toggle hk. The link <i>h</i>
            actuated an oscillating crank <i>l</i> on rocking shaft <i>o</i>.
            The shaft <i>m</i> carries a crank <i>u</i> connected by
            links <i>vw</i>, with heavy masses <i>yz</i>, which are
            mounted on the rotor shaft <i>t</i> so as to oscillate. The
            links <i>vw</i> oscillate the masses in opposite phase. The
            masses are not fixed on the shaft <i>t</i>; they oscillate
            freely about it. The rocking shaft <i>o</i> carries a crank
            <i>j</i> which is connected by links <i>pq</i>, with
            oscillating members <i>rs</i>, which, like the masses <i>yz</i>,
            are actuated in opposite phase. The oscillators carry
            ratchets or the like, which give unidirectional motion to a
            rotor fixed on the shaft <i>t</i>.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It



            will be seen that the toggle links oscillate symmetrically
            or substantially so about the position in which they are in
            line, and thus complete oscillations of the shaft <i>m</i>
            and <i>o</i> take place for each stroke of the piston, so
            that each of the driving ratchets make a complete
            oscillation for each stroke of the piston. In addition to
            this, it is evident that a distribution of them motion of
            the piston and of the shaft <i>e</i> between the inertia
            masses <i>yz</i> and the oscillators <i>rs</i>, takes
            place in the way described above. Thus if the resisting
            torque on the rotor is so great as to render it immovable,
            the oscillators <i>rs</i>, the links <i>pq</i>, and the
            shaft <i>o</i> and the crank <i>u</i>, are all stationary.
            The end of the link <i>k</i> remote from the knuckle is
            therefore fixed, and the whole motion of the prime mover is
            absorbed in oscillating the masses <i>yz</i>, if, on the
            other hand, there is no resisting torque on the rotor, the
            masses <i>yz</i> remain practically stationary by reason of
            their inertia. This fixes the shaft <i>m</i>, and similarly
            to the above described action, the whole motion of the prime
            mover is distributed between the rotor and the masses <i>yz</i>;
            the greater the torque, the greater the motion of the
            masses, and the less that of the rotor, and conversely. The
            principle is precisely the same as that of the invention
            described in my prior specifications above referred to.</font>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With



            a double frequency arrangement of this type, long strokes
            are required, and the arrangement is therefore especially

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It



            will be seen that the combined unit may be applied to
            internal combustion engines having any number of cylinders.

            its inertia, and all the motion of the prime mover is
            communicated to the unidirectional driving devices.&nbsp;
            Intermediate torques produce intermediate effects; the
            greater the torque on the rotor, the greater the surging in
            the pipe 21 and the less the movement of the driving
            devices; and conversely.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A
            variable inertia may be provided as shown in Figure 2. The
            apparatus consists of a casting comprising two branches 62,
            63, which are placed in communication by means of a slidable
            U-shaped pipe 64 which is connected to the ends of the
            branches 62, 63, suitable glands 65, 66, being provided to
            make liquid tight joints at the junctions. The pipe 64 is
            embraced by a socket 67 connected to a rod 68 which can be
            raised or lowered by turning the nut 69 by means of the
            handle 70. The branches 62 and 63 can be connected up to any
            point of the pipe 21 by passages 60 and 61. With this device
            the inertia of the liquid column can be increased or
            decreased by merely turning the handle 70 to raise or lower
            the U-shaped pipe 64.</font> </p>

            variable inertia devices as above described, the maximum
            pressures in the system may be varied without varying the
            speed of the prime mover.</font> </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In



            my British patent Specification # 185,022 I have shown a new
            method of transmitting power from a prime mover to a shaft
            which is to be rotated against a variable resisting torque
            by splitting alternating or sinusoidal motion derived from a
            steadily rotating shaft into component alternating motion of
            the same frequency; one component motion being caused to
            give alternating motion to a mass, while another is caused
            to give alternating motion to a pair of unidirectional
            driving devices working in opposite phase and rotating a
            shaft.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            main features of the invention are the ode in which
            reciprocating motion is derived from the prime mover and the
            way in which this reciprocating motion is apportioned
            between the two inertial masses which take the place of the
            single inertial mass as described in my prior
            specifications. The uniform motion of the prime mover is
            according to my invention split between the center of
            gravity of these two masses and the driven shaft, according
            to the torque on or the speed of, the shaft. For example,
            the prime mover causes an unbalanced mass to gyrate about an
            axis which is suspended by links from a fixed point. This
            axis is linked to a second mass which is capable of
            oscillating about another fixed point. The result, as will
            be explained hereinafter, is that the motion of the prime
            mover is distributed between the center of gravity of the
            two masses and the driven shaft. If, for instance, the
            torque opposing the motion of the driven shaft becomes
            infinite so that the shaft does not rotate, the travel of eh
            center of gravity of the two masses is a maximum. If there
            is no torque the motion of their center of gravity is a
            minimum.</font> </p>

            the form of the invention shown in Figure 1 a rotating mass
            21 at the end of a crank 22 is caused by a Cardan joint or
            other suitable means to gyrate or revolve about a pivot 23
            suspended by a link 24 from a fixed pivot 25. The pivot 23
            is connected by a rod 26 to a pivot 27 on a swinging lever
            28 pivoted at a fixed point 29 and carrying at its end a
            mass 30. A second pivot 31 on the lever 28 is connected by a
            rod 32 to a pivot 33 supported on a stabilizing link 34
            pivoted at fixed point 35. The driving pivot 33 is connected
            to a pair of oscillating members 36, 37 carrying ratchet
            devices 38, 39 driving a rotor 40 pivoted at a fixed point
            41.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            gyrations of the mass 21 set up by the prime mover, which is
            connected to the pivot 23 by the Cardan joint or other
            flexible coupling, cause this pivot to oscillate. These
            oscillations are communicated to the mass 30 and the motion
            of the prime mover is thus split between the center of
            gravity of the masses 30 and 21 and the unidirectional
            driving&nbsp; devices connected to the driving pivot 33, the
            splitting or division taking place according to the torque
            on or the speed of the rotor 40. Thus, for example, if the
            torque against the rotor 40 becomes infinite so that the
            rotor cannot rotate, the lever 28 and the axis 23 becomes
            fixed. But the mass 21 continues to gyrate about this axis,
            and the lateral motion of the center of gravity of the
            masses 21 and 30 is at its maximum. If, however, this torque
            vanishes, the mass 21 still gyrates, but the lever 28 now
            swings. The lateral motion of the center of gravity of the
            masses 21 and 30 is then zero or nearly so, and the whole
            motion of the prime mover is transferred to the rotor. The
            same action in principle occurs in all the succeeding
            embodiments of the invention. According to my prior
            specifications the motion of the prime mover was divided
            between a single periodically moving mass and a rotor; in
            the present case it is divided between the center of gravity
            of two periodically moving masses and a rotor.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In



            the form of the invention shown in Figure 2 the mass 51 is
            rotated about the pivot 52 on a lever 53 pivoted at a fixed

            52 is directly connected by the rods 56, 57 with the

            the pivot 52 and drives the oscillating members 36, 37

        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In



            the said specifications I have described a clutch comprising
            a sliding member and a rotating member and arranged so that
            relative movement of rotation between said sliding member
            and said oscillating member causes a movement of said
            sliding member at right angles to the movement of rotation
            with consequent engagement and jamming together of the three
            members, said sliding member having teeth or the equivalent
            on one side and smaller teeth or a friction surface on the
            other side brought into close engagement by the movement of
            said sliding member at right angles to the direction of
            rotation. In such device unless the clearance between the
            friction surface and the slider is extremely small, in the
            free position there is a certain relative movement between
            the oscillating member and the slider which gives rise to
            shocks when the slider overruns the oscillator at the end of
            the driving stroke and if a rubber or other pad is employed
            as the friction surface, this relative movement increases as
            the pad becomes worn, so that the gear is apt to become

            2 to 7 show a form of the invention in which the grippers or
            pawls are mechanically interconnected. In these figures the
            invention is applied to the clutch described in my prior US
            specification # 653,774. They also sow by way of
            illustration the application of this clutch modified
            according to my invention to a device for dividing the
            motion of a prime mover into two components which operate
            respectively upon an inertial mass and unidirectional
            driving devices which actuate a rotor the ratio of the two
            components varying as the torque opposing the motion of the
            rotor. As the principle of this mechanism is fully explained
            in my former US specification # 653,774 and it forms no part
            of the present invention it is not necessary to describe it
            in great detail. The prime mover drives a main shaft 101
            having an eccentric 102 driving on to the central pivots 103
            of the floating lever 104 by means of the strap 105. The
            floating lever 104 is connected at its ends to a pair of
            links 106, 107 which are pivoted to levers 108, 109 whose
            upper ends have their movement restrained by stops 110, 111
            one of these steps or the other coming into operation
            according to the direction of rotation of the driven rotor
            on the shaft 112.&nbsp; The levers 108, 109 are pivoted in
            the frame of the machine and one end of the floating lever
            104 is connected by links 116, 117 with a pair of
            oscillating members 18, 119 each of which acts through a
            sliding member 133 having large teeth on one side and a
            friction surface 134 on the other side to grip rotary
            members 135 on the driven shaft 112 alternately. The
            construction and operation of these gripping or sliding
            members is described in my US specification 653,774 referred
            to above. Fixed on each sliding member there are provided
            bosses 120, 121 connected by rods 122, 123 with a bell crank
            lever 124 which is pivoted on a link 125 capable of movement
            about a fixed pivot 126. Threaded through the link 125 there
            is provided an actuating rod 127 carrying flanges with
            buffers 128, 129 between them and the link 125. The rod 127
            is connected to an eccentric 130 on shaft 131 pivoted in the
            frame of the machine and the handle 132 is provided on this
            shaft by which either one or the other of the buffers 128,
            129 may be brought in contact with the link 125. By this
            means the pull in one direction or the other may be exerted
            on the two sliders so that by merely moving the handle 132,
            the direction of rotation may be reversed, as explained in
            my prior US specification # 653,477, already referred to.</font>

            which the usual differential gear is dispensed with.</font>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It



            consists in driving each wheel of the axle of a motor
            vehicle independently by two shafts each of which received
            unidirectional impulses fro a single engine driving one
            primary shaft. Alternating motions derived from this shaft
            are split between one or more oscillating masses and
            unidirectional driving mechanism which actuates the two
            independent shafts by power transmission means acting on the
            principle of the subject matter of my prior US Patent #
            1,542,668. The invention, however, is applicable not only to
            motor vehicles but to any other purpose where it is desired
            to drive more than one shaft form a single engine.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The



            invention provides a method by which the engine may be kept
            running at a steady speed while two or more shafts
            automatically drive independently variable loads. For
            instance, all four wheels of a vehicle may be driven from
            one engine by this method, thereby dispensing with
            complicated differentials.</font> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According



            to one embodiment of my invention the rear wheels are
            mounted independently and driven by reverse mitre gearing,
            each wheel having a gear to itself. The middle or driving
            pinion of each gear is mounted on a shaft, the two shafts
            being actuated preferably in opposite directions by separate
            unidirectional driving gears, each of which received a
            step-by-step motion from an oscillator. The oscillators are
            connected together by a rod so that they move together and
            one of them is driven from a prime mover through an inertia
            device on the principle explained in my prior specification

            to Figure 1, 1 represents in diagram a flywheel of an
            engine, not shown, with a mass 4 which is thus oscillated.
            The mass 4 is carried on an arm5 pivoted at 6 to a lever 7
            which is loosely mounted upon it and connected to the lever
            7 by a rod 11. The shafts 8 and 9 are parallel and are
            mounted in fixed bearings indicated diagrammatically at 12
            and 13. The lever 7 and arm 10 drive the shafts on which
            they are mounted unidirectionally by any suitable means
            indicated by arrows 14 and 15 which represent pawls after
            the manner described in my prior specification above cited.
            If, for example, the torque on either shaft becomes
            excessive so that lever 7 and arm 10 cannot oscillate, the
            point 6 becomes fixed and the whole motion of the engine is
            absorbed by the inertial mass. If, on the contrary, there is
            no torque, the point 6 can move freely and the motion of the
            inertial mass is little or nothing. Intermediate torques
            produce intermediate results, the motion in all cases being
            split between the unidirectional devices and the inertial
            mass in proportions varying with the torque as fully
            described in my prior specification.</font> </p>

            corresponding to arm 10 of Figure 1 and here shown as a bell
            crank lever 10 by a spring 18 as well as by the connecting

            terminate in sleeves 19 within which are splined stub shafts
            20 each of which carries a mitre-wheel 21. The sleeves are
            carried by ball bearings 22 and each sleeve is surrounded by
            a stuffing box 23 in the housing 24. The mitre wheel 21
            gears with corresponding pinions 25 and 26 which are loose
            on the axle 27, either being brought into engagement for
            forward or reverse drive with the axle 27 by a sliding
            clutch member 28 which is splined on the axle. Both clutch
            members are actuated from the same central rod 29 by links
            30 disposed toggle-wise. The mechanism for actuating the
            clutch members 28 is shown more particularly in Figure 5.
            Each link 30 is connected to a lever 31 which is mounted on
            a shaft 32 carrying a pair of arms 33. The arms engage with
            a half-collar 34 which is recessed into the clutch member
            28. The axle 27 is mounted in ball bearings 35 and passes
            through a stuffing box 36 and it carries at its outer end
            the wheel 37 and brake drums 38 in the usual way.</font> </p>
