      <p>A tiny generator the size of a grapefruit could be made to
        provide all the power your home needs --- from the waste furnace
        heat now going up your chimney. </p>
      <p>This is the conclusion of physicist and inventor Alvin M.
        marks, who recently patented a new way to generate electricity
        without moving parts, magnetic fields, or expensive chemical
        reactions. </p>
      <p>The new generator requires only a jet of gas containing liquid
        vapor and the presence of an electric field and the presence of
        an electric field that helps condense it into a fine,
        electrically charged mist or aerosol. </p>
      <p>What’s more, the little model aerosol generator sown here can
        be made so efficient in converting heat energy to electricity
        (up to 70%), that it promises to make obsolete conventional
        thermal generating conventional thermal efficiency of 35%.
        Reason: it converts heat and kinetic energy directly to
        electricity. </p>
      <p><i>How it works ---</i> First consider a conventional
        generator. As the armature is turned, coils of copper wire are
        moved through a magnetic field. Free electrons in the wire
        experience a force from the magnetic field that pushes them
        along the wire, creating a flow of current. </p>
      <p>Similarly, there is a field and motion in the aerosol
        generator. The field is electrical rather than magnetic, but it,
        too, extends through space to impart notion to electrons, which
        combine with atoms of gas to form negative ions. The motion is
        provided by the expanding gas itself. As it rushes through the
        field, a flow of current (ions) is established. </p>
      <p>There is, however, very little you can do with free ions unless
        you can move large numbers of them onto a conductor. This is
        where the aerosol comes in. Droplets of liquid condense out of
        the gas stream and deposited on a collector electrode to release
        their charges as useful electricity. </p>
      <p>The drawing of the model aerosol generator above shows how the
        hardware is arranged. Anions (negative ions) are created within
        the field set up by the spike-shaped negative electrode and the
        positive nozzle. In the working model, picking up water vapor.
        It expands and cools in passing from the small pipe into the
        charging chamber. Droplets of water immediately condense on the
        anions, exploding into a fine mist through mutual repulsion. </p>
      <p>The energy of the gas stream carries the aerosol out through
        the nozzle of the positive-charging electrode and through the
        conversion space. Droplets are deposited on the collector
        electrode to create a flow of electricity in an external load
        and back to the positive ground terminal of the generator. </p>
      <p><i>Something for Nothing!</i> --- While it looks as if the
        generator is producing something for nothing, a close
        examination shows where and how the work is done. As charged
        particles shoot out of the nozzle, they create a “space charge”.
        Additional particles run smack into this repulsive charge into
        this repulsive field. As they fight their way against it, they
        reach a high electrical potential, converting their heat and
        kinetic energy to electricity. </p>
      <p>Finally, they reach the collector. With their kinetic energy
        gone, and at a much higher negative potential than the
        collector, the charged particles are deposited around the walls
        of the collector. </p>
      <p>As the space charge gets greater and greater, nozzle pressure
        must be increased to overcome it. This is done by adding more
        heat primarily to the liquid, and it, in turn, heats the gas,
        causing it to rise in pressure. The voltage and current produced
        at the collector rise with the increase in nozzle pressure. </p>
      <p><i>A Practical Generator</i> --- A full-size aerosol, built
        under government contract, is being tested at Marks Polarized
        Corp., Whitestone, NY. </p>
      <p>Will it work? “We’re sure of it”, Mark says. “We’re not sure of
        the power output, but it will be from one to 10,000 watts ---
        we’re hoping for 10,000”. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1 --- </b>Diagram of working model of generator
        shows how charged aerosol is formed and blown across conversion
        space to collector electrode. In full-scale generator,
        gas-stream pressure will be increased by using stream instead of
        water to add heat energy. Voltage and current output go up with
        pressure. </p>

      <p><b>Figure 2 --- </b><i>Real Work is Done</i>: As space charge
        in conversion space increases, like-charged aerosol is repelled.
        To overcome “potential hill”, more energy is fed to generator to
        increase nozzle pressure, power output. </p>

        polarity to generator output and is supplied by different power
        source. </p>

      <p>Human ingenuity has had little trouble inventing ways to make
        the most of our energy resources. However, waste means added
        profit for power suppliers, so most of the technology remains on
        the drawing board, ignored by the captains of industry.
        Electrothermodynamic (ETD) energy is an example of this process
        in action. </p>
      <p>Ben Franklin’s dream of harnessing the storm principle has been
        realized by ETD designer Alvin marks. In a thunderstorm, bolts
        of lightning snap between pockets of positively and negatively
        charged particles (ions) that have been created by the friction
        of water droplets in turbulent winds. Marks’s charged aerosol
        generators create their tempest in a torus (doughnut-shaped
        bottle) filled with helium. Acting as a sort of gas flywheel,
        the helium is driven around the doughnut by high-speed jets of
        superheated steam. A small external electrical charge starts a
        buildup of hot ions, which, as they cool, discharge and release
        many times the electrical power that was put in --- much as a
        car engine uses a battery to start but thereafter can recharge
        the battery by driving a generator. </p>
      <p>ETD is twice as efficient in converting fuel into electricity
        as the mechanically driven magnetos now used. And its beauty is
        that it can make every building’s heat system produce the juice
        consumed by the occupants. Since heating needs a source of only
        a few hundred degrees Fahrenheit, most of the energy of fuel,
        which burns at several thousand degrees Fahrenheit, is normally
        lost. The ETD system generates electricity at high temperatures
        and uses only the residual heat for winter warmth. Thus, the
        device could spell an end to utility-company monopolies and
        regional blackouts as well as cut our consumption of fossil
        fuels in half and save billions on oil imports. </p>
      <p>Predictably, business and government response has been
        underwhelming. Marks had a proven prototype by 1968 and
        presented a $60-million changeover program to the federal Office
        of Science and Technology in 1971. Although $1 million in
        government grants has helped fund the researfh since 1958,
        federal agencies have shown no interest in the commitment needed
        for widespread use. Marks estimates that a mere $5 to $10
        million more could put an ETD home heating system on the market
        for $2000, including installation. </p>
      <p>Response from industry has been even more anemic. Last August,
        31 major corporations placed a full-page ad in the New York
        Times proclaiming, “Energy is not a political issue. It’s an
        issue of survival”, and calling on the private sector to invest
        in new and alternative sources of energy. Marks wrote to all 31
        and was not surprised to find that two-thirds answered only with
        vague dismissals that showed “more interest in short-term profit
        than long-term survival”. A few are intrigued enough to study
        the idea, but readers with loose capital are urgently needed by
        Alvin marks, marks Polarized Corp., 153-16 10th Ave.,
        Whitestone, NY 11357. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> A solid state Quantum high Energy density
        Storage or Retrieval device known as a quensor, and the
        trademark ENSOR(TM), having an energy density of about 1-15
        kwhr/kg, comparable to gasoline, or more, is described. A
        fundamentally new principle is employed: A quensor film
        comprises oriented molecules with donor and acceptor groups and
        with metal layers on its surfaces. A dipole electric field may
        be established in the gap between a donor and an acceptor.
        Electric energy is stored in or retrieved from dipole electric
        fields throughout the volume of the quensor film. Electric
        energy is stored in the quensor film by charging the dipole
        electric fields from an electric energy source. Electric energy
        is retrieved from a quensor film by discharging the dipole
        electric fields and supplying the energy to a load. Electric
        breakdown in the film is avoided because positive and negative
        electric charges in the film are balanced everywhere. Busbars
        attached to the metal layers are connected to terminals for
        charging or discharging the device. The manufacture of a quensor
        film is described. A composite photovoltaic and quensor panel
        for the storage or retrieval of solar-electric energy day or
        night on demand is also described. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> A bulk process is described which is capable
        of producing large area sheets about 8 micrometers thick having
        the property of light/electric power conversion at extremely
        high production rates (many m&lt;2&gt;/s) at low cost ( DOLLAR
        1/m&lt;2&gt;). The devices have an inherently high efficiency
        60-80% when laminated in an assembly to utilize both resolved
        light vectors. A light/electric power converter is described
        comprising a sheet containing oriented dipolar conducting linear
        structures forming an antennae array capable of absorbing light
        photons and producing a unidirectional electric current. These
        linear structures constitute submicron antennae and femto diode
        circuit elements. The individual antenna-circuit elements are
        self-ordered into the linear structure using a bulk process. The
        process utilizes (1) electro-ordering a suspension of elongated
        submicron metal crystals; or (2) molecules capable of absorbing
        a light photon and converting its energy to electric energy; or
        (3) visco-elastically stretch-orienting a light-electric
        responsive preformed heteropolymer. These submicron linear
        structures comprise a plurality of quantum well-steps, each with
        an assymetric tunnel junction at one end, in ordered three
        dimensional arrays. The manufacture uses a simple low cost bulk
        process and does not employ the submicron facility needed for
        the earlier planular process. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> A Femto Diode responsive to light
        frequencies, is described. Quantum principles are utilized. The
        Femto Diode comprises a submicron metal cylinder with an
        assymetric metal-insulator-metal tunnel junction at one end and
        a reflecting potential step at the other end. A light photon
        having a quanta of energy is absorbed by an electron in the
        cylinder producing an energetic electron. The cylinder acts as a
        potential well for the energetic electron, which travels back
        and forth in its own conduction band without loss of energy
        until it passes through the junction. The kinetic energy of the
        energetic electron is converted to electric energy at a greater
        voltage on the other side of the junction. The energy conversion
        is reversible. The Femto Diode may be used in light to electric
        power conversion, a laser which converts electric power to light
        power, 2D and 3D displays, high speed computers, communications
        and other devices. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> An electrothermodynamic generator and a
        compressor is described for use in a Marks/Ericsson Cycle. It
        uses a charged liquid tin droplet/nitrogen aerosol for
        heat/electric conversion at a maximum temperature of about 1800
        K and a charged water droplet/nitrogen aerosol
        electrothermodynamic compressor at 300 K in a Marks/Ericsson
        Cycle which has a theoretical efficiency of 83%, and a practical
        efficiency of 60% to 70%. An ETD compressor with a water charged
        droplet is described. The other cycle components, comprising a
        heat source, liquid tin loop, heat exchangers, water loop and
        liquid pump are not here considered. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> On a Charged Aerosol Wind/Electric Power
        Generator, electrically charged water droplets are dispersed
        into the wind stream. Using Induction Electric Charging, a water
        jet issues under water pressure from a small diameter (25-50 mu
        m) orifice, and the jet breaks into charged droplets. A plate
        orifice 35 mu m diameter, and 25 mu m long appears optimum; a
        single jet from such an orifice at a water pressure of 15 psig
        produces net electric power output substantially exceeding the
        hydraulic and electric power inputs. A practical Wind/Electric
        Generator utilizes a multi-orifice array scaled to a kilowatt or
        megawatt level. A water recovery and pressure regeneration solar
        and/or gravitational means is described by which water is
        conserved and the water power is free, so that there is a net
        output electric power without external power input of any kind,
        except natural wind and/or solar power. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> This invention relates to a high efficiency
        device for the direct conversion of light power to electrical
        power. Present photocells for accomplishing this purpose are
        well known to the art and have a theoretical efficiency not
        exceeding about 20%. In practice, realization of efficiency of
        about 10% has been achieved, but ultimately the theoretical
        limitation is an upper limit which cannot be exceeded by devices
        utilizing known construction. The present device differs from
        the prior art devices in that it utilizes a plurality of dipole
        antennae for absorbing light photons, employing an alternating
        electrical field of said photons to cause electrons in the
        dipole antenna to resonate therewith and absorb electrical power
        therefrom, with means for rectifying said AC power to DC, said
        DC being accumulated on conducting busbars from the plurality of
        antennae and associated rectifying circuits. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b>&nbsp; In an E.H.D. generator employing a
        charged aerosol as working medium, an efficiency approaching
        that of the ideal Carnot cycle is achieved by employing a large
        ratio of liquid mass to gas mass in the isothermal phases and a
        small ratio of liquid mass to gas mass during the adiabatic
        phases of the cycle. Heat may be injected isothermally into the
        working medium simultaneously with the extraction of electric
        power. The liquid component of the aerosol is used for
        heat-transfer. When the liquid component is large, most of the
        heat resides in the liquid which can thus maintain the carrier
        gas at uniform temperature, pro- ducing isothermal working.
        Similarly, when the liquid content is low, adiabatic working is
        achieved. Liquid may be sprayed in to increase its proportion
        and subsequently removed by standing or by centrifuging in the
        discharging region. The ratio of liquid mass to gas mass varies
        from 10 to 0À01. The aerosol is simultaneously charged and
        formed by forcing liquid 21 out of a capillary tube 20 whose tip
        is charged or is adjacent a charging ring 25 whose field assists
        in accelerating the droplets to the velocity of the carrier gas
        stream 22. The kinetic energy of the droplets and gas is turned
        into electrical energy in the conversion space 30, this energy
        being withdrawn in the collector 31 and fed out at lead 32 to
        load 33. It is des- cribed (Fig. 3, not shown), how a battery of
        capillaries associated with charging screens may be used. A
        single loop circuit for recircu- lating both gas and liquid in
        the necessary temperature cycle, is described (Fig. 2, not
        shown). A multistage system in which the heat rejected from one
        cycle is used in a following cycle of lower temperature, is also
        described (Fig. 3, not shown). The use of a heat-exchanger is
        avoided by transferring the liquid directly from one cycle to
        the next. Suitable working substances are water-steam or air;
        and gallium- nitrogen. </p>
