      August 19, 2009 <br>
      <br>
      A University of Queensland scientist said yesterday he had
      successfully tested technology that delivers twice the power from
      coal while minimising greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
      <br>
      The exciting breakthrough, which could provide a billion-dollar
      windfall for the state, may revolutionise the way the world uses
      coal, a university spokesman said. <br>
      <br>
      Professor John Zhu, of the school of chemical engineering, created
      a series of direct carbon fuel cells (DCFC) in which burning coal
      generates highly energy-efficient electricity. <br>
      <br>
      ''The very high-energy efficiency of the new technology will
      effectively halve the amount of coal required to create
      electricity,'' he said. <br>
      <br>
      ''When applied, it will provide industry with very significant
      cost and energy savings, which could then be passed on to the
      consumer. In addition to saving cost and energy, the direct carbon
      fuel cells will also provide clean power.'' <br>
      <br>
      Dr Zhu, 41, a father of three girls, said he worked in a ''hot and
      dirty'' steel factory in Hubei provence in central China while
      studying engineering. <br>
      <br>
      ''I have always wanted to do something for a cleaner environment.
      Now I'm feeling very positive,'' he said. <br>
      Dr Zhu, the son of a primary school teacher, said traditional
      power stations, which burnt coal to heat water to make steam to
      power turbines, were outmoded. He said his process used a coal and
      air mix to produce electrons inside special carbon fuel cells. <br>
      <br>
      He said scientists in California were working on a similar
      process, but he believed he and his team at the university had
      beaten them to the punch. <br>
      <br>
      He said he expected the fuel cells would enable the byproduct of
      coal-fired power - the harmful greenhouse gas carbon dioxide - to
      be trapped and stored easily and safely. <br>
      <br>
      ''One of the major challenges for coal-fired power is reducing its
      impact on the environment by developing ways to separate carbon
      dioxide from other gases produced in the power generation process,
      and ensuring it is not released into the atmosphere,'' he said. <br>
      <br>
      ''The DCFC produces pure carbon dioxide as a byproduct, making it
      much easier to manage." <br>
      <br>
      He said the next stage in the development would involve consulting
      with the energy sector and securing industry and government
      funding to ''scale up'' the fuel cell technology. This could take
      10 years. <br>
      <br>
      Professor Graham Schaffer, dean of the university's Faculty of
      Engineering, Architecture and Information Technology, said the new
      fuel cell technology was one of a number of clean energy
      technologies being developed at the university. <br>
      <br>
      ''Partnerships with industry and government have enabled our
      researchers to make significant progress towards these new
      technologies,'' he said.<br>

          Abstract -- The invention relates to a direct carbon fuel
          cell, which provides a direct carbon fuel cell directly taking
          carbon or carbon composite as the anode, and metal oxide as
          the cathode, single or double phase low medium temperature
          ceria composite as the electrolyte. The direct carbon fuel
          cell is power molding button cell with electrolyte in the
          middle and the anode and cathode separately on each side. The
          pressed sheets of anode and cathode are one to two mm thick.
          The invention can get the best performance about 0.25 watts
          per square centimeter under the temperature of 600 to 650
          degrees centigrade, which is two times above the performance
          of such fuel cell according to a report from USA and has
          reached the international leading level. <br>
