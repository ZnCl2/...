          <div align="center"><big><b>Sunglasses that relieve Stress?</b></big></div>
          <br>
        </b></b>The love of your life stood you up. You were passed over
      for a promotion. Your sports car was towed from a no-parking zone.
      A professor flunked you. You are angry. The adrenaline is pumping.
      Your teeth are grinding. You want revenge. You are out of control.
      Hold on. Science might have found a way to help. The secret could
      be in a new sunglasses design that is said to bring calm and
      rationality within minutes of wearing them.<br>
      <br>
      Marketed as NeuView ( www.neuviewglasses.com ), the glasses direct
      light at an angle to the optic nerve. The result is said to
      activate the more rational left side of the brain to balance the
      emotional right brain that is inflamed during stressful moments.<br>
      <br>
      They’re called lateral glasses, and the idea was researched and
      developed for psychotherapy by Fredric Schiffer of the Harvard
      Medical School. Veteran psychotherapist Robert Buck, in
      Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., modified the glasses and obtained a
      patent. Buck compares the process to turning on the light in a
      dark room so that you can see the entire room. When a man whose
      car had been towed came to his office several days after the
      incident threatening to flatten tires where he was parked, Buck
      gave him the glasses. Within seconds, he was able to say, “I don’t
      have to do that.”<br>
      <br>
      Kansas City boxer Katie Dallam, who was severely injured in a
      fight, has worn them before a television interview to keep her
      calm, Buck said. The glasses have been used by experienced
      golfers, before putting, to activate the right side of the brain
      as a balance to the over-active strategizing left side.<br>
      <br>
      The glasses are $72, including shipping charges, at the Web site.<br>

        </b></b>Now NeuView Sunglasses offer you a non-pharmaceutical
      way to lower your stress and anxiety. These patented "lateralized
      glasses" are based on research conducted by a leading
      neuroresearcher at Harvard Medical School and endorsed by mental
      health professionals in the U.S. and abroad.<br>
      <br>
      NeuView Sunglasses are a specially designed pair of sunglasses
      with wraparound lenses that have side sections that can be raised
      to let in more light on one side or the other.<br>
      <br>
      With NeuView Sunglasses you can easily and safely create the
      healthful balance between the right and left sides of your brain.
      And, by doing so, bring all you resources to bear to deal with the
      stress in your life.<br>
      <b><b><br>
          NeuView Glasses help you to:<br>
          <br>
          Sort out the real from the perceived threats of everyday life<br>
          Manage stress in any environment: at home, at work, or at play<br>
          Improve athletic performance by focusing and balancing your
          mental and physical energy<br>
          <br>
          WHAT ARE NEUVIEW GLASSES?<br>
          <br>
        </b></b>Glasses unlike any you have ever worn. NeuView Glasses
      are lateralized glasses. What does that mean? It simply means that
      they enable the user to access unfiltered light to either his
      extreme right or left visual field. This is accomplished by
      raising the right or left windows. This simple act initiates a
      profound and positive neurological event: namely, the stimulation
      and increased activation of the cerebral hemisphere opposite the
      light source.<br>
      <b><b><br>
          WHAT DO THEY DO?<br>
          <br>
        </b></b>NeuView Glasses enhance our ability to be "whole brain"
      thinkers. They provide us with a view as to how we experience our
      world, cognitively, emotionally, and even somatically, from both
      our right- brain and our left-brain. Often this view will be
      experienced as dramatically different from one side to the other.
      One individual who experienced himself as "a samurai warrior with
      my sword at the ready" on one side, was amazed and comforted by
      experiencing himself as "a shepherd tending my flock" on the other
      side. Now, with Neuview Glasses, the "right-brain person" has the
      opportunity to experience his less dominant left brain, and the
      "left-brain person" is introduced to his lesser known right brain.
      When this occurs we are presented with an important opportunity —
      the integration of knowledge and experience heretofore unavailable
      in our singular view of ourselves.<br>
      <br>
      However, it is our ability to shift back and forth between the two
      hemispheres that is, crucial to our sense of well-being, as well
      as to our success in the workplace. With NeuView Glasses the user
      can easily make these shifts that lead to an integrated view.
      NeuView Glasses enhance our sense of well-being.<br>
      <br>
      While using the glasses many people have the positive experience
      of "being more in touch with their feelings" for others it can be
      the experience of having overwhelming feelings of anxiety, panic,
      or depression subside when they access comforting information from
      their left brain. For the person with ADD it can be experiencing
      order where heretofore there was only chaos. In one such case, an
      extremely anxious test taker who studied long and hard for the
      exam and yet couldn't see how he would pass, knew instantly that
      he'd be fine and said, "I know the stuff" as he accessed that
      awareness held within his left brain. He did pass, he was right,
      he knew "the stuff."<br>
      <b><b><br>
          What do NeuView Glasses do?<br>
          <br>
        </b></b>They give us a new view — and the opportunity for a
      truer, healthier, more integrated view of ourselves and of the
      world.<br>

            <b>Method for using therapeutic glasses for stimulating a
              change in the psychological state of a subject</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
        </b></b>Therapeutic glasses for changing the psychological state
      of a user and a method for using the glasses are disclosed. The
      therapeutic glasses include at least one lens of a size sufficient
      to cover an eye of the user, wherein at least one lens restricts
      vision to a lateral visual field. The method includes wearing the
      glasses for a sufficient period of time, thereby stimulating the
      user to achieve a change in the psychological state of the user.<br>
      <b><b><br>
          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
        </b></b>It has been known since antiquity that the brain is
      composed of two hemispheres, and people have been attempting for
      centuries to exploit this fact in explanations of psychological
      function. By the middle of the 19th century, neurologists had
      begun to understand that the left hemisphere was dominant for
      language. In this century, scientists have found the right
      hemisphere to be dominant for other abilities, such as the
      understanding and expression of emotion. This partial independence
      of hemispheres was confirmed in split brain experiments in animals
      and later in humans showing that hemispheric specialization and
      partial hemispheric independence could exist together. Research
      has found that in normal persons the right brain has intelligence
      and autonomous mental functions separate from those of the left
      brain.<br>
      <br>
      The right brain and left brain are capable of having their own
      mentation and actions. Observations have indicated that the
      cognitive faculties of the right brain in split brain and
      left-hemispherectomy patients can be fully developed. An isolated
      right hemisphere has the capacity for autonomous perception,
      memory, thought, emotion and volition. The right brain, in
      split-brain patients, can also induce or affect behavior without a
      correct conscious, left-sided understanding of the reason behind
      it. In normal individuals, the right hemisphere can have intact
      mental faculties, separate from and often beyond the awareness of
      the patient's left-sided mind.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, a need exists for an apparatus and method that can
      stimulate a subject by changing the side of the brain which
      predominates to achieve a change in the psychological state of the
      subject.<br>
      <b><b><br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
        </b></b> The present invention is directed to therapeutic
      glasses for changing the psychological state of a user and is also
      directed to a method of using the therapeutic glasses.<br>
      <br>
      The therapeutic glasses include at least one lens of a size
      sufficient to cover an eye of the user, wherein at least one lens
      sufficiently restricts vision to a lateral visual field to achieve
      a change in the psychological state of the subject and wherein the
      lateral visual field can be selectively changed by the user. The
      lens can be selectively adjusted by the user to change the
      restriction of vision to a different lateral visual field.<br>
      <br>
      The method includes providing to a user therapeutic glasses having
      at least one lens of a size sufficient to cover an eye of the
      subject, wherein at least one lens restricts vision to a lateral
      field. The therapeutic glasses are worn for a sufficient period of
      time, thereby stimulating the user to achieve a change in the
      psychological state of the user.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has many advantages. The glasses are useful
      for treating people having psychological symptoms, such as
      anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, compulsions,
      eating disorders, addictions, attention deficit disorders and
      psychoses. Further, the invention is useful for helping to relieve
      stress and to enhance a person state of well-being.<br>

          </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b></b></b><br>
      The features and details of the method and apparatus of the
      invention will now be more particularly described with reference
      to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. The
      same numeral present in different figures represents the same
      item. It will be understood that the particular embodiments of the
      invention are shown by way of illustration and not as limitations
      of the invention. The principal features of this invention can be
      employed in various embodiments without departing from the scope
      of the invention. All percentages and parts are by weight unless
      otherwise indicated.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to therapeutic glasses for changing the
      psychological state of a user. As shown in FIG. 1, one embodiment
      of the invention is therapeutic glasses 10 formed from modified
      safety glasses of a transparent composition, such as polycarbonate
      or polystyrene, and having first lens 12 and second lens 14. Bows
      15 extend sufficiently to pass over the ears of the user.
      Therapeutic glasses 10 are suitable for covering at least one eye
      of the wearer. Therapeutic glasses 10 are covered on either the
      inside or outside surface of first lens 12 and second lens 14 with
      an essentially opaque substance, such as an adhesive tape, paint
      or other similar coating that can block the view of the wearer.
      Alternatively, first lens 12 and second lens 14 can be impregnated
      with the opaque substance. Typically, first lens 12 (right lens)
      is fully coated and portion 16 covers about half of second lens 14
      (left lens) proximate to bridge 18 of therapeutic glasses 10.
      Therapeutic glasses 10 are configured to restrict viewing to area
      20 of the left half of second lens 14. Covered portion 16 of
      second lens 14 can have a covered area in the range of between
      about 50 and 75 percent. In a preferred embodiment, second lens 14
      is covered on about sixty percent of the area. Such therapeutic
      glasses can be worn by a user for a sufficient period of time,
      thereby stimulating the user to achieve a change in the
      psychological state of the user.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 2, second therapeutic glasses 30 are essentially
      the same as therapeutic glasses 10 shown in FIG. 1. In this
      embodiment, first lens 32 (right lens) has partially covered area
      34 proximate to bridge 36 and transparent area 38 is distal from
      bridge 36 for limiting vision to the right lateral visual field of
      the right eye. Bows 35 extend sufficiently to pass over the ears
      of the user. Second lens 40 (left lens) is sufficiently opaque to
      block vision.<b><b><br>
        </b></b><br>
      As shown in FIG. 3, another embodiment of the invention includes
      third therapeutic glasses 50 having frame 52 typically used in
      eyeglasses and sunglasses. Frame 52 can be formed of a suitable
      material, such as wire or plastic.<br>
      <br>
      Therapeutic glasses 50 has first lens 54 and second lens 56. First
      lens 54 can be opaque on first side 58 proximate to bridge 60.
      Bows 55 extend sufficiently to pass over the ears of the user.
      Second side 62 can be essentially transparent. The tinting is
      substantially uniform along the vertical axis of first lens 54 and
      second lens 56. First lens 54 and second lens 56 can be tinted
      with various colors, such as blue, red or green. The color blue
      has been found to be particularly favorable by users.
      Alternatively, first lens 54 and second lens 56 are essentially
      opaque or dark on the right side of each and progressively less
      tinted towards the left side of the lenses where they can be
      essentially clear. In a preferred embodiment, the outer surfaces
      of the lenses are coated with a reflective material, such as gold,
      silver or aluminum, to provide a uniform appearance to a viewer,
      thereby giving the impression that the wearer is wearing regular
      sunglasses.<br>
      <br>
      First lens 54 and second lens 56 can be tinted with a photochromic
      material that allows the tinting to change as a result of lighting
      conditions. Alternatively, portions of the lenses can be tinted
      with an electrochromic material, which can be powered by a control
      unit and battery, to allow the user to change the degree of
      tinting in the lenses as desired and select the lateral visual
      field to be restricted. An example of a suitable tinting material
      and control unit is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,877, issued to
      Hussey, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by
      reference. Therapeutic glasses 50 can have the lenses mounted to
      frame 52 to allow them to be flipped up in direction 64 in a
      manner similar to sunglasses worn by baseball players.<br>
      <br>
      First lens 54 and second lens 56 in frame 52 can be mounted in a
      manner to allow the lenses to be rotated in direction 66 in which
      the plane the lenses lie. For example, the user may desire to
      rotate first lens 54 and second lens 56 in order to change the
      visual field restriction from the left side to the right side,
      thereby stimulating a different change in the psychological state
      of a user.<b><b><br>
        </b></b><br>
      As shown in FIG. 4, therapeutic glasses 80 has first lens 82 and
      second lens 84 in frame 86 which has bridge 88 between the lenses
      approximately midway between top portion 90 and bottom portion 92
      of the glasses. First lens 82 and second lens 84 can have a
      gradient tint similar to the lenses disclosed in FIG. 3. Bridge 88
      is configured to allow therapeutic glasses 80 to be flipped around
      and worn upside down in order to block the opposite lateral field.
      For example, therapeutic glasses 80 can have the right side of
      first lens 82 and second lens 84 sufficiently opaque to restrict
      vision to the right lateral visual field. Therapeutic glasses 80
      can then be flipped around and worn with the left lateral visual
      field blocked. Bows 85 are sufficiently straight to pass over the
      ears of the user to allow the user to wear therapeutic glasses 80
      in either direction. Bows 85 can be slightly curved in toward the
      head of the user to help secure the glasses. Depending on the
      hemisphere the wearer would like to stimulate, therapeutic glasses
      80 are worn with the left visual field blocked or the right visual
      field blocked.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment of the invention includes a contact lens having
      a tint gradient along the horizontal axis from left to right or
      right to left while having a substantially uniform tint gradient
      along the vertical axis of the contact lens. The tint gradient
      along the horizontal axis is preferably linear. The lens
      sufficiently restricts vision to a lateral visual field to achieve
      a change in the psychological state of the wearer.<br>
      <br>
      The therapeutic glasses have been found to be beneficial to a
      patient undergoing psychotherapy. The therapeutic glasses can be
      worn during psychotherapy sessions with a psychotherapist. In
      combination with psychotherapy sessions or by themselves, the
      therapeutic glasses can help reduce symptoms of anxiety,
      depression or a compulsive disorder, such as an eating disorder,
      including anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Other compulsive disorders
      including alcohol abuse and gambling may be helped. Other problems
      that can be helped include dyslexia, stress-induced heart disease
      and post-traumatic stress disorder. The therapeutic glasses can be
      used in counseling and for use in amplifying, diagnosing or
      describing a psychological problem. The therapeutic glasses are
      useful for circumstances where one hemisphere of the brain is
      visually stimulated over the other hemisphere by differentially
      stimulating the retinas. Such a stimulation can result in
      electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, indicating a shift in
      hemispheric dominance.<br>
      <br>
      In psychotherapy a patient can alternate between lateral visual
      fields and induce both an increase and a decrease in the person's
      symptoms to show him that his fears reside only in a part of his
      mind. The embodiments in FIGS. 3 and 4 are designed to facilitate
      easy switching between the left and right lateral fields. In the
      embodiment shown in FIG. 3, both lenses can be rotated 180 degrees
      to change the lateral visual field which is stimulated. In the
      embodiment shown in FIG. 4, the entire frame can be rotated 180
      degrees to change the lateral visual field which is stimulated.
      With the embodiments shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the subject can
      switch between embodiments to alter the lateral visual field which
      is stimulated. The method allows some patients who have had only a
      negative view of the world to see the world from a new more
      optimistic, more mature perspective.<b><b><br>

      The user does not need to undergo psychotherapy or the like to
      benefit from using the therapeutic glasses. Many people, who are
      considered normal and wear the therapeutic glasses, can perceive a
      reduction in stress and increase in well being. Depending upon the
      individual and the change in psychological state desired, the user
      can selectively change the restriction of the visual field to the
      field that provides the desired result.<br>
      <br>
      The therapeutic glasses are worn at various times, such as during
      psychotherapy counseling sessions and times of anxiety or at any
      time the wearer wants to decrease his stress. The therapeutic
      glasses are worn for a sufficient period of time that can be in
      the range of between a few minutes and many hours to stimulate the
      user to achieve a change in the psychological state of the user.
      For example, the therapeutic glasses can be worn by a passenger on
      an airplane to help reduce the anxiety of flying. In another
      embodiment, the therapeutic glasses are worn at home or in the
      office during a period of anxiety. The therapeutic glasses with
      translucent material can be worn while walking. However, because
      the therapeutic glasses with opaque restrict the vision of the
      user to one visual field while wearing, it is recommended that the
      glasses be worn while sitting or lying down. Walking with them
      should only be attempted after much experience while wearing. It
      is not recommended operating an automobile or heavy machinery
      while wearing the therapeutic glasses with opaque material.<br>
      <br>
      Although not wanting to be limited to a theory why the therapeutic
      glasses are effective in treating numerous problems and disorders,
      it is believed that certain changes in the psychological state of
      a person can be changed by stimulating one hemisphere of the brain
      separately from the other hemisphere. Whether it is the left or
      right hemisphere which dominates can often markedly affect a
      person's personality and some of the psychological systems he
      might have. By restricting vision to a portion of the retina of an
      eye that is connected to a particular hemisphere of the brain,
      that hemisphere can be stimulated preferentially. The eyes are
      connected to the brain so that vision to the left side of a person
      goes first to the opposite (right) hemisphere and vision to the
      right side of a person goes first to the left hemisphere.<br>
      <br>
      It is believed that humans can have two autonomous minds, one
      associated with the left brain and one with the right brain and
      that there is a human relationship between human left and right
      minds, and the issues which apply to any relationship apply to the
      one within us. For example, in some people the left minds
      "dominate" and "suppress" their right minds. In others, the right
      mind can dominate. Symptoms can be produced if a trouble side
      dominates the personality. For example, some of these right
      dominant people are called "neurotic", because they express
      emotions or engage in behaviors that are difficult to understand
      and often seem irrational. Of course, some peoples' minds live in
      harmony with mutual respect and cooperation.<br>
      <br>
      To test the efficacy of the therapeutic glasses, seventy
      out-patient psychotherapy patients were asked to participate. All
      gave written, informed consent, and each participated without
      remuneration. The patients ranged in age from 18 to 73 with a mean
      of 43 (sd=10.8). There were 39 males. Eleven patients were
      left-handed and 59 were right-handed by the Edinburgh Handedness
      criteria. The primary, current DSM-IV diagnoses by structural
      clinical research interviews fell into six groups: 1) dysthymic
      disorder (N=20); 2) anxiety disorders (N=7); 3) major depression
      (N=21); 4) schizophrenia (N=2); 5) bipolar I disorder (N=2); and
      6) post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (N=18). Thirty-seven were
      taking psychotropic medications, most commonly serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors or benzodiazepins or both. Thirty-three had not taken
      medications for at least two weeks prior to the study.<br>
      <br>
      Two pairs of therapeutic glasses, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, were
      constructed, each made by covering safety glasses with a white
      adhesive tape over one side and about sixty percent of the medial
      aspect of the other side. Each pair of therapeutic glasses was
      taped so that it permitted vision to only either the left visual
      field or the right visual field. Patients were free to move their
      eyes, head or body, but were encouraged to look out of the exposed
      area so that about half of their visual field on that side was
      obstructed.<br>
      <br>
      Following objective questions about their level of anxiety in the
      different conditions, 42 patients were engaged, who found at least
      a one point difference on a five-point anxiety scale (none, mild,
      moderate, quite-a-bit or extreme) between lateral visual fields,
      in an unstructured interview while they wore the therapeutic
      glasses a second time, shortly after the first. On repeat trials,
      as part of a pilot study, seven additional patients responded to
      the therapeutic glasses and were also interviewed with the glasses
      on.<br>
      <br>
      Of these 49 patients who experienced at least a one-point
      difference in anxiety between sides, the mean age was 42.9
      (sd=9.8). There were 24 females and 39 right-handed patients.
      Twenty-seven were taking psychotropic medications.<br>
      <br>
      Three of these responsive patients were tested in a follow-up
      session in which their EEG's were monitored during two baseline
      periods, as well as while they wore, in randomized order, the
      experimental therapeutic glasses and two comparison goggles. The
      comparison goggles were constructed so that either the left or
      right side was completely taped, and the other side was taped only
      over the bottom fourth of the lens. These comparison goggles
      allowed for monocular vision which a number of studies have
      demonstrated can activate the contralateral hemisphere. The bottom
      one fourth of the unoccluded side of the comparison goggles was
      taped to give them a more complex appearance in an attempt to
      disguise that they were being used as a control. At least ninety
      seconds of EEG tracings were recorded in each condition with
      electrodes placed in a standard 10/20 system. The electrodes were
      referenced to linked mastoids and all impedances were less than
      five ohms. After artifact removal, an asymmetry index (L-R/L+R)
      was calculated from the means of the frontal and temporal leads on
      the left (F1, F3, F7, T3, T5) and right (F2, F4, F8, T4, T6) sides
      for both the theta and the alpha power spectrums. The asymmetry
      indices for the two pairs of therapeutic glasses were compared as
      were those for the comparison goggles and the two baseline
      recordings.<br>
      <br>
      By Pearson chi-square tests, there were no significant differences
      between the 49 responders and the 21 non-responders, who were not
      interviewed, on the basis of diagnosis, sex, medication or
      handedness, although handedness approached significance
      (chi-square=2.717, df=1,68) p=0.099 because 91% left handers were
      responders.<br>
      <br>
      Forty of the 49 patients interviewed reported feeling more
      regressed and symptomatic on one side and more mature and less
      symptomatic on the other. These patients usually reported being
      surprised by their experience. Twenty-six patients later
      consistently used the therapeutic glasses in their ongoing
      psychotherapy, and all of these patients found their use in
      therapy sessions to be of value.<br>
      <br>
      All three patients tested with EEG monitoring manifested changes
      in their laterality indices with the two pairs of therapeutic
      glasses in the expected direction. That is, for each, the
      asymmetry index (L-R/L+R) derived from the mean frontal and
      temporal leads for theta activity was greater with the left vision
      field therapeutic glasses than with the right vision field
      therapeutic glasses (mean difference=-0.023 .mu.v, sd=0.025). In
      these patients, the lateralized differences were greater with the
      therapeutic glasses than with the comparison goggles (mean
      difference=-0.0144, sd=0.039) or with the repeated baseline
      conditions (mean difference=0.0076, sd=0.030). For these three
      patients, none of these differences were statistically significant
      by the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test.<br>
      <br>
      A test was conducted to determine whether lateral visual field
      stimulation could alter EEG activity and affect in a laboratory
      setting. A comparison was conducted of EEG and anxiety level
      changes induced by two pairs of experimental goggles, each taped
      over one lens entirely and over the middle 60% of the other side,
      and by two pairs of comparison goggles. The experimental goggles
      restricted vision to the left visual field (LVF) or right visual
      field (RVF); the comparison goggles, to the left or right eye.
      Eleven subjects, ten right-handed, seven male, included three
      patients with PTSD and eight asymptomatic college students. The
      theta and alpha EEG activity in the mean of frontal and temporal
      leads was compared. All leads were referred to linked mastoids.
      Ninety seconds of EEG's were recorded in each condition and after
      artifact removal. A laterality index (LI), which equals
      (L-R)/(L+R), for each pair of randomly presented goggles was
      calculated.<br>
      <br>
      With the experimental goggles the mean laterality index for the
      eleven subjects was less with the RVF than the LVF. The RVF-LVF
      difference in LI was -0.109, sd=0.19, (Wilcoxon
      Signed-Rank=-26.00, p=0.019) for theta, and -0.033, sd=0.054 for
      alpha (Signed-Rank=-21.00, p=0.067). For the comparison goggles,
      the R-L difference in LI was -0.033, sd=0.08 for theta
      (Signed-Rank=-9, p=0.25) and 0.002, sd=0.078 for alpha
      (Signed-Rank=0.00, p=1). The absolute differences in anxiety
      levels (rated on a 5 point scale) between experimental goggles
      were significantly greater than those between comparison goggles
      by Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, Signed-Rank=10.5, p=0.031. Thus,
      restricting vision to lateral visual fields appeared to activate
      the contralateral hemisphere and to change anxiety levels from
      those of the other lateral field.<br>

          <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
        </b></b>[0003] The application of intense light, a non-ionizing
      phototherapy, has been reported in over a thousand scientific
      publications to have therapeutic efficacy for a wide range of
      disorders in humans without any observed harmful effects. Light
      has been demonstrated in cell culture to increase mitochondrial
      respiration, increase ATP synthesis, increase heat shock proteins,
      induce transforming growth factor ß-1, and increase nerve cell
      proliferation and migration. Light has been tested in animals to
      facilitating wound healing, promote the process of skeletal muscle
      regeneration, and reduce infarct size in ischemic heart muscle by
      50 to 70% in an induced experimental model in rats and dogs. Light
      in the near infrared spectrum, which penetrates the scalp and
      skull, can significantly reduce damage from experimentally induced
      stroke in rats and rabbits, and to improve the memory performance
      of middle aged mice, and reduce damage from acute stroke in
      humans. A method of treating psychiatric disorders using light
      energy is needed.<br>

      hemisphere to treat the psychological disorder. In an embodiment,
      the light energy may include near infrared light (NIR). The
      methods of the present disclosure may be used to treat a variety
      of psychological disorders.<br>

      [0026] As used herein, the terms “depression,” “depressive
      disorder,” “dysthymic disorder,” “major depressive disorder” and
      “unipolar depression” refer to a DSM-IV definition of depression.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] As used herein, the term “psychiatric disorders” refers to
      any psychiatric disorders including, but not limited to,
      depression, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar
      disorder, anxiety disorders, alcoholism, eating disorders such as
      anorexia and bulimia, phobias, Asperser's syndrome, dissociative
      disorders, insomnia, and borderline personality disorder. The
      DSM-IV definition applies to these psychiatric disorders.
      Psychiatric disorders also include substance abuse disorders
      (i.e., alcohol abuse or opiate dependence or abuse) caused either
      by depression or not caused by depression, persistent anxiety,
      anxiety attacks, feelings of panic, fears of social contacts,
      nightmares, flashbacks, obsessive thoughts, compulsive behavior,
      attention disorder, sexual problem, and irrational thinking.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] As used herein, the term “co-morbid” or “co-existent”
      refers to any psychiatric disorders that exist in addition to a
      primary disease or disorder, such as depression.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] As used herein, the term “transcranial” refers to a
      procedure that is performed through the cranium, or the skull that
      covers and protects the brain. Transcranial refers to a
      noninvasive method that delivers energy to the neurons of the
      brain. Transcranial therapy can cause activity in specific or
      general parts of the brain with minimal discomfort, allowing the
      functioning and interconnections of the brain to be studied and/or
      treated. The light device is held on the scalp, no actual contact
      is necessary, and the energy passes through the skull and into the
      brain. Small induced currents can then make brain areas below the
      light device more or less active, depending on the settings used.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] As used herein, the term “treat”, “treating” or
      “stimulating” refers to enhancing a person's positive outlook or
      suppressing a person's negative outlook. This may refer to a
      person's psychological well-being, including but not limited to
      their emotional, cognitive, and motivational states. Those persons
      who are successfully treated can find more appreciation for life,
      for themselves (improved self-esteem), their work, and their
      personal relationships.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Well-being refers to a state of wellness of body, mind and
      soul, where all are in a state of health, the individual is happy
      and prospering. Well-being describes the overall welfare of an
      individual including a good or satisfactory condition of
      existence. Well-being is a state characterized by health,
      happiness, and prosperity.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Psychiatric disorders include, but are not limited to,
      depression, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar
      disorder, anxiety disorders, alcoholism, eating disorders such as
      anorexia and bulimia, phobias, Asperser's syndrome, dissociative
      disorders, insomnia and borderline personality disorder. One
      prevalent psychiatric disorder is depression. Depression may be
      defined as a combination of sadness, loss of energy, feelings of
      hopelessness, difficulty concentrating, insomnia, and
      irritability. The National Comorbidity Survey reported that 46% of
      men and 58% of women have suffered in their lifetime at least a
      two-week period in which they experienced a persistent depressed
      mood. Major depression has a lifetime prevalence of about 16%, and
      it is estimated that by 2020, it will be the second greatest
      contributor to the impairment of global health. A recent
      Australian survey reported that anxiety disorders were the most
      common mental disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 26%.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In psychiatry, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) is a manual published by
      the American Psychiatric Association (APA) that includes all
      currently recognized mental health disorders. In the DSM-IV, there
      are two diagnoses for depression, Major Depression and Dysthymic
      Disorder, as described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Major Depressive Disorder is characterized by one or more
      Major Depressive Episodes (i.e., at least 2 weeks of depressed
      mood or loss of interest accompanied by at least four additional
      symptoms of depression). Dysthymic Disorder is characterized by at
      least 2 years of depressed mood for more days than not,
      accompanied by additional depressive symptoms that do not meet
      criteria for a Major Depressive Episode.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Criteria for Major Depressive Episode include:<br>
      <br>
      [0036] A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been
      present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from
      previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1)
      depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. Note: Do not
      include symptoms that are clearly due to a general medical
      condition, or mood-incongruent delusions or hallucinations.<br>
      <br>
      (1) depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated
      by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or
      observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). Note: In
      children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.<br>
      <br>
      (2) markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost
      all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by
      either subjective account or observation made by others)<br>
      <br>
      (3) significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g.,
      a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease
      or increase in appetite nearly every day. Note: In children,
      consider failure to make expected weight gains.<br>
      <br>
      (4) insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day<br>
      <br>
      (5) psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day
      (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of
      restlessness or being slowed down)<br>
      <br>
      (6) fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day<br>
      <br>
      (7) feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
      (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely
      self-reproach or guilt about being sick)<br>
      <br>
      (8) diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness,
      nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by
      others)<br>
      <br>
      (9) recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying),
      recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide
      attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide<br>
      <br>
      [0046] B. The symptoms do not meet criteria for a Mixed Episode.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or
      impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
      functioning.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] D. The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological
      effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a
      general medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] E. The symptoms are not better accounted for by
      Bereavement, i.e., after the loss of a loved one, the symptoms
      persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked
      functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness,
      suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, or psychomotor retardation.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Diagnostic criteria for Dysthymic Disorder include:<br>
      <br>
      [0051] A. Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than
      not, as indicated either by subjective account or observation by
      others, for at least 2 years. Note: In children and adolescents,
      mood can be irritable and duration must be at least 1 year.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] B. Presence, while depressed, of two (or more) of the
      following:<br>
      <br>
      (1) poor appetite or overeating<br>
      <br>
      (2) insomnia or hypersomnia<br>
      <br>
      (3) low energy or fatigue<br>
      <br>
      (4) low self-esteem<br>
      <br>
      (5) poor concentration or difficulty making decisions<br>
      <br>
      (6) feelings of hopelessness<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The DSM-IV (1), the International Classification of
      Diseases (ICD-9-CM)(2), and as described in The Comprehensive
      Textbook of Psychiatry (3), thus, define depressive disorders,
      which in the DSM-IV and the ICD-9-CM are given specific diagnostic
      codes: major depression is 962.3 and dysthymia is 300.4. In
      distinction from the depressive disorders, the DSM-IV, ICD-9-CM,
      the Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, and the accepted
      practice in the profession (4) consider other disorders as
      separated and distinct psychiatric diagnoses. The DSM-IV list of
      major categories is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or
      Adolescence<br>
      Delirium, Dementia, and Amnestic and Other Cognitive Disorders<br>
      Mental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition<br>
      Substance-Related Disorders<br>
      Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders<br>
      Mood Disorders<br>
      Anxiety Disorders<br>
      Somatoform Disorders<br>
      Factitious Disorders<br>
      Dissociative Disorders<br>
      Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders<br>
      Eating Disorders<br>
      Sleep Disorders<br>
      Impulse-Control Disorders Not Elsewhere Classified<br>
      Adjustment Disorders<br>
      Personality Disorders<br>
      Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The depressive disorders are listed under Mood Disorders.
      The profession considers other diagnostic categories distinct and
      separate from depressive disorders in terms of diagnosis,
      treatment, clinical course, symptoms, genetics, and brain
      pathophysiology. For example, electro-convulsive therapy is
      commonly used to treat major depression, but is not used for
      childhood disorders, dementia, mental disorders due to a general
      medical condition, substance-related disorders, anxiety disorders,
      somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, dissociative
      disorders, sexual and gender identity disorders, eating disorders,
      sleep disorders, impulse-control disorders, adjustment disorders
      or personality disorders. Benzodiazepams such as diazepam or
      klonazepam are common treatments for anxiety disorders but are
      likely to make depressed patients more depressed. Schizophrenia is
      treated with antipsychotic medications that, with a few
      exceptions, are only used to treat psychotic patients.
      Buprenorphine is used to treat opiate dependence, but is not
      approved for any other diagnosis. Disulfiram is used only in the
      treatment of alcohol dependence.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Depression can run in families, and usually starts between
      the ages of 15 and 30. It is much more common in women. Women can
      also get postpartum depression after the birth of a baby. Some
      people get seasonal affective disorder in the winter. Depression
      is one part of bipolar disorder. There are effective treatments
      for depression, including antidepressants and talk therapy. Many
      depressed people do best by using both.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Depression is considered separate and distinct from other
      psychiatric or psychological disorders. Depression by any
      definition does not encompass most psychological disorders. For
      example, people who are diagnosed with schizophrenia have
      delusions and/or hallucinations, and have a deterioration of their
      personality rendering them almost always incapable of complex work
      or sustained relationships. A person with an anxiety disorder will
      suffer excessive apprehension and worry with heightened arousal,
      but will not feel sad or hopeless unless he suffers, in addition,
      a coexisting depressive disorder. A person who abuses substances
      will usually not also suffer anxiety or depression, although he
      may have a dual diagnosis in which both a substance abuse disorder
      and another disorder such as an anxiety disorder or a depressive
      disorder are also present. 47% of patients diagnosed with
      schizophrenia also have a substance abuse disorder.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Each of the diagnostic entities in the DSM-IV are supported
      not only by clinical descriptions, but also by biological studies
      that use electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalograpy
      (MEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), evoked
      potentials, electrodermal activity, biochemical markers
      (catecholamines and catecholamine metabolites; indoleamines and
      indoleamine metabolites, acetylcholine, histamine, aminoacids,
      melatonin, prostaglaindins, opoid petptides, neupropeptides,
      enzymes, receptor densities), psychoimmunological markers, genetic
      markers, and animal models.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] By modern scientific techniques, depressive disorders and
      other DSM-IV disorders can be distinguished from each other. For
      example, as reviewed in the textbook, Current Diagnosis and
      Treatment: Psychiatry by Loosen and Shelon, antidepressant
      treatments (including pharmacotherapy and electroconvulsive
      therapy [ECT]) cause desensitization of the norepinephrine
      receptor—coupled adenylate cyclase system in brain, which is
      linked to a decrease in the density of adrenoceptors in the brain.
      This decrease in receptor sites paralleled the delayed onset of
      action common to all antidepressants. Further, depression is
      associated with the integration of multiple intracellular signals
      that regulate neuronal response (i.e., changes in G protein,
      cyclic adenosine monophosphate, or protein kinase and the
      induction of gene transcription). These intracellular signals
      ultimately affect the expression of specific genes. It is these
      abnormalities of intracellular signal transduction and/or gene
      expression that underlie much of the physiology of depression.
      Other neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine, gamma amino butyric
      acid, melatonin, glycine, histamine), hormones (e.g., thyroid and
      adrenal hormones), and neuropeptides (e.g.,
      corticotropin-releasing hormone, endorphins, enkephalins,
      vasopressin, cholecystokinin, substance P) also play significant
      roles in the physiology of depression.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] In depression, functional imaging studies most consistently
      demonstrate a decreased prefrontal cortex (PFC), especially left
      PFC, blood flow. These findings correlate with severity of illness
      and cognitive impairment. Functional imaging in depressed patients
      also show basal ganglia abnormalities, involving decreased blood
      flow and metabolism as well as increased activity of amygdala. In
      major depression, other neuroimaging studies show abnormalities in
      the hippocampus, cingulate, and related parts of the striatum and
      thalamus. Together data offer a neural model for depression in
      which dysfunction of limbic, striatal, and PFC structures impair
      the modulation of the amygdala/hippocampus complex and lead to
      abnormal processing of emotional stimuli. Depression also tends to
      be associated with lesions in the left frontotemporal or right
      parieto-occipital regions.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Many patients with dysthymic disorder have brain wave (EEG)
      abnormalities that mimic those found in major depression such as
      reduced REM latency, increased REM density, reduced slow-wave
      sleep, impaired sleep continuity. Patients with dysthymia who have
      these EEG abnormalities more frequently have a positive family
      history for major depression. They also respond better to
      antidepressant medications.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Anxiety disorders have scientific findings that
      differentiate them from depression and other psychiatric or
      psychological disorders. In patients with anxiety disorders
      functional neuroimaging shows abnormalities during symptom
      provocation tests, in the limbic, paralimbic and sensory
      association regions.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] For anxiety there is a general theory of a neural
      behavioral-inhibition system. This system evaluates stimuli to
      attempt to determine their level of dangerousness and
      simultaneously in response produce behavioral inhibition and
      increase arousal and attention. Antianxiety drugs inhibit brain
      areas involved in these responses. From animal studies using
      pharmacological agents and/or brain lesions, anxiety is associated
      with several interconnected anatomical areas. Sensory stimuli that
      are interpreted as dangerous activate the hippocampus, especially
      the entorhinal cortex, which secondarily induces habituation by
      actions on the lateral and medial septal areas, which then
      stimulate the cingulate which induces behavioral inhibition.
      Several specific neurotransmitter systems influence this anxiety
      mechanism, including noradrenergic activity of the locus
      coeruleus, serotonergic systems originating in the raphe, and by
      widespread GABAA-receptor activity (which are the main locus of
      activity of the benzodiazepines).<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Stimuli that are interpreted as acute threats activate the
      “fight or flight” response, which is mediated especially by the
      locus coeruleus and the amygdala. The amygdala encodes fearful
      memories and aversive conditioning and participates in the acute
      fear and negative anticipation that we call anxiety.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Further, intense anxiety stimulates the sympathetic nervous
      system via the locus coeruleus, and this induces tachycardia,
      tremor, and diaphoresis. The frontal cortex becomes aware of the
      anxiety and induces behavioral responses which are attempts to
      improve survival, but which often cause more harm and increase
      danger. The cingulate, in anxiety disorders, attempts to improve
      the communication between the cortex and the subcortical areas.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Patients with a panic disorder can have a panic attack
      induced by intravenous sodium lactate or inhalation of 5-35% CO2.
      This will not affect individuals who do not suffer a panic
      disorder. These agents activate the locus coeruleus. There is new
      evidence that 5-HT1A-receptor binding is reduced in some patients
      with panic disorder.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In an embodiment, the methods of the present disclosure can
      be used to diagnose and treat the human brain for psychological,
      psychiatric, depressive, neurological, general well-being and
      other conditions. In an embodiment, the methods of the present
      disclosure may include the use of a light treatment device to
      diagnose and treat depression. In an embodiment, the methods of
      the present disclosure may be used to diagnose and treat
      psychiatric disorders other than depression including, but not
      limited to, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar
      disorder, anxiety disorders, substance abuse disorders such as
      alcohol abuse and drug abuse, eating disorders such as anorexia
      and bulimia, phobias, Asperser's syndrome, dissociative disorders,
      insomnia, borderline personality disorder or combinations thereof.
      In an embodiment, the methods of the present disclosure may be
      used to diagnose and treat other psychiatric or psychological
      disorders including, but not limited to, persistent anxiety,
      anxiety attacks, feelings of panic, fears of social contacts,
      nightmares, flashbacks, alcohol or drug abuse, obsessive thoughts,
      compulsive behavior, attention disorder, sexual problem, eating
      disorder such as anorexia, bulimia or obesity, irrational
      thinking, or combinations thereof. In an embodiment, the methods
      of the present disclosure may be used to diagnose and treat
      psychiatric disorders that are co-morbid or co-existent with
      depression. In an embodiment, the methods of the present
      disclosure may be used to diagnose and treat more than one
      psychiatric disorder at a given time. For instance, the method may
      diagnose and treat a patient having both depression and attention
      deficit disorder or a patient having both anorexia and insomnia.
      In an embodiment, the methods of the present disclosure may be
      used to benefit persons who do not have any psychological
      disorders. For patients without any of the above psychological
      disorders, the methods of the present disclosure may help improve
      their psychological well-being and enhance their positive outlook.
      These patients can find more appreciation for life, for themselves
      (improved self-esteem), their work, and their personal
      relationships. The methods of the present disclosure may improve
      patient self-confidence, positive disposition, interpersonal
      relationships, and/or quality of life.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] A recently published study was conducted of an open
      clinical trial of the use of transcranial near infra-red light to
      treat 10 psychiatric patients (5 males) with a current major
      depressive disorder with a comorbid anxiety disorder, including 3
      with a history of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Schiffer F,
      Johnston A L, Ravichandran C, Polcari A, Teicher M H, Webb R H,
      Hamblin M R. Psychological benefits 2 and 4 weeks after a single
      treatment with near infrared light to the forehead: a pilot study
      of 10 patients with major depression and anxiety. Behavioral and
      Brain Functions. 2009 Dec. 8; 5:46.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Seven of these patients had a past history of opiate
      dependence (6 patients) and one had a history of alcohol
      dependence. The patients were allowed to continue their usual
      psychiatric treatments, but were asked, if possible to not alter
      their on-going treatments. None altered their treatments from 2
      weeks before the NIR-PBM or during the 4-week follow-up.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] As a baseline measure each patient had a Standardized
      Clinical Diagnostic Interview to determine their diagnosis. The
      patients also had their hemispheric emotional valence measured
      using lateral visual field stimulation (LVFS), which includes
      having a patient look out of one side of taped safety goggles to
      allow their vision to be restricted on either the left or the
      right lateral visual field. Earlier studies found that LVFS can
      induce EEG, ear temperature, and fMRI changes. These results
      indicate that looking out the right visual field activates the
      left hemisphere of the brain and that looking out of the left
      visual field activates the right hemisphere of the brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Earlier studies further reported that looking out of one
      lateral visual field for a minute or more can induce a personality
      alteration such that one side (left or right) in 80% of patients
      will induce a more mature personality while looking out of the
      other visual field will stimulate a personality that is more
      immature and more negatively effected by past traumas. By
      measuring the affective state of the patient while he or she looks
      out of both visual fields we can calculate a hemispheric emotional
      valence which indicates the degree to which either the left or the
      right cerebral hemisphere is mature and healthy or immature and
      neurotic. Some studies suggest that using the patient's
      hemispheric valence might guide the application of lateralized
      treatments to the brain for psychiatric conditions as well as help
      in the evaluation of data from experiments treating one cerebral
      hemisphere. For example, two similar but different studies
      reported that the baseline hemispheric emotional valence predicted
      which patients would respond to left-sided transcranial magnetic
      stimulation, an FDA approved treatment for depression that applies
      a powerful electromagnet to the left-side of the head. Both
      studies suggested that treating a patient who has a positive
      hemispheric valence in his left hemisphere (the treated
      hemisphere) will do well, but that patients who have a negative
      hemispheric emotional valence in their left hemisphere (the
      treated hemisphere) will not do well.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] As another baseline measure each patient was given a
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, a Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale,
      and a Positive and Negative Affect Scale. The two Hamilton scales
      are used to measure changes in depression and in anxiety from a
      treatment over at least a week. The Positive and Negative Affect
      Scale is used to measure immediate changes in mood following a
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Each patient's cerebral blood flow in the frontal poles of
      their brain on both the left and right sides was measured using,
      for instance, a commercial device. The patients then received 4
      treatments. Two treatments were placebo treatments, with the near
      infrared light turned off, one treatment was over the left side of
      the forehead and another treatment was over the right-side. The
      two active treatments consisted of a 4-minute treatment with near
      infrared light at 240 mW, one on the left-side of the forehead and
      the other on the right-side. Patients were unable to detect
      whether the light was on or off, and so the light off condition
      acted as a placebo condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Immediately after each treatment (left-side “on”, left-side
      “off”, right-side “on”, right-side “off” we measured the patient's
      affective state with the Positive and Negative Affective Scale.
      During each treatment we measured the cerebral blood flow in the
      left and in the right frontal pole of the patient's brain. At two
      weeks post treatment and at four weeks post-treatment we repeated
      both of the Hamilton scales.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The study revealed several findings. First, following each
      of the 4 treatment conditions, the Positive and Negative Affective
      Scale scores showed an improvement if the side with a positive
      hemispheric emotional valence was treated but a worsening in the
      measured affective state if the hemisphere with a negative
      hemispheric emotional valence were treated. Second, the study
      found when the left side of the forehead was treated with the
      light on, the frontal pole blood flow was 0.65±sd 0.08, compared
      to 0.06±sd 0.05 when the left-side was treated with the light off,
      placebo condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] The study also revealed that at 2-weeks post treatment (all
      4 treatment conditions were given on the same day) there was a
      dramatic improvement in both the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
      and in the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Sixty percent of the 10
      patients went into a remission defined as a Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale score of &lt;10 at 2-weeks post treatment. For the
      Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, 70% achieved a remission at this
      criteria. These results compare favorably other treatments for
      depression or anxiety disorders such as cognitive behavior therapy
      of 30 weeks, serotonin reuptake inhibitors for 8 weeks, a course
      of transcranial magnetic stimulation or a course of
      electro-convulsive shock therapy as discussed in our publication.
      Since the sample of patients included those suffering from major
      depression, a generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress
      disorder, and recent substance abuse, this NIR-PBM treatment might
      be suitable for additional diagnostic groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The study further showed that the outcomes on the Hamilton
      Anxiety Rating Scale were predicted by an interaction between the
      individual patient's hemispheric emotional valence times the
      increase in blood flow in the frontal pole on the side of the
      positive hemispheric valence. (See FIG. 8)<br>
      <br>
      [0100] As a result, the study found that bilateral NIR-PBM
      treatments led to highly significant improvements 2 weeks post
      treatment. The study also found that immediately after treatment,
      patients did well when the hemisphere with a positive valence was
      treated and poorly when the hemisphere with a negative valence was
      treated. From this observation, it is likely that treating only
      the side with a positive hemispheric valence might give better
      results than the bilateral treatment results at 2-weeks post
      treatment. The location of treatment is likely also important.
      Treating over the upper side of the forehead, in an embodiment, is
      likely to activate the hemisphere while treating over the area of
      the forehead over the eye may have an inhibitory effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The study results are not likely due to placebo effects for
      several reasons. First, placebo effects are usually on the order
      of a 20% improvement and our improvement was on the order of 50 to
      60%. Second, cerebral blood flow increased when the NIR-PBM was
      “on” versus the placebo “off” condition. Patients could not
      determine whether or not the light was on or off. Third,
      immediately following the treatments, the patients improved to a
      greater extent when the hemisphere with a positive hemispheric
      emotional valence was treated. And finally, the Hamilton Anxiety
      Rating Scale scores were predicted by the product of the
      lateralized cerebral blood flow and the hemispheric emotional
      valence.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] The methods of the present disclosure can be used with
      light treatment devices known in the art that deliver light energy
      for diagnosis and treatment of the human brain for psychological,
      psychiatric, depressive, neurological, general well-being and
      other conditions. In one embodiment, the methods of the present
      disclosure may include the use of lateral visual field stimulation
      (LVFS) in conjunction with light treatments to help treat a
      variety of psychiatric disorders or psychological conditions. The
      brain is at its core an information processor. It takes sensory
      inputs, interprets them, and decides on a response. A computer is
      also an information processor that takes inputs and creates
      responses or outputs. The computer uses transistor states to code
      information; the brain uses neural firing patterns or biological
      neural networks to code its information. Like a computer the brain
      uses parallel and serial processing, and different biological
      neural networks in the brain operated somewhat independently, but,
      like a computer in a network, are related to other biological
      neural networks. The brain's neural networks have hierarchical
      arrangements. For example, sensory association areas of the brain
      have biological neural networks that process information from
      several primary sensory areas (perhaps for hearing, sight, and
      touch). The biological neural networks in the sensory association
      areas will relate to higher order association areas in the frontal
      cortices whose biological neural networks integrate the sensory
      information with information from other biological neural networks
      having to do with other functions such as emotion or memory. Each
      neural network processes information, and as such is a mini-brain,
      which combines with other biological neural networks to create
      higher levels of function and eventually create a mind with
      perceptions, emotions, motivations, and actions or behaviors. A
      person can have a dominant high-level set of biological neural
      networks that support his dominant personality, but he may have
      competing high-level sets of neural networks that support a
      personality with somewhat different perceptions, emotions,
      motivations, actions or behaviors. These high level biological
      neural networks appear to have a relationship with one or the
      other of the two cerebral hemispheres of the brain. The neural
      networks associated with one hemisphere (either the left or the
      right) might be more affected by past traumas and have a more
      neurotic perception of the world. For example, someone who was
      bullied as a child, might as an adult, have high level neural
      networks that incorrectly perceive the world as hostile and
      threatening. That person may have another set of high level neural
      networks, associated with the other cerebral hemisphere, that are
      healthier and see the world (as it now actually is) as safe.
      Depending on which set of high-level neural networks is dominant
      at a particular time, the person will manifest a personality that
      is either troubled or is healthier (or some combination of the
      two).<br>
      <br>
      [0103] Childhood traumas are almost always associated with
      biological neural networks that are associated with one hemisphere
      more than the other. Troubled biological neural networks may not
      be associated with only one hemisphere, but rather they may be
      associated more with one hemisphere over the other and once
      stimulated can take over the entire brain. Different set of neural
      networks can compete for dominance and when in control can use
      more and more of the brains neurons. In a computer, one program
      such as Word uses the same transistors that a different program
      such as Excel uses. The allocation of neurons within the brain may
      be determined by the struggles between competing sets of
      biological neural networks.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] Each diagnostic entity is manifested by different
      configurations of biological neural networks involving different
      brain locations and different neural transmitters and so are
      distinct entities as described above. However, each entity may
      involve a healthier and a more pathological set of neural networks
      that are associated each with one of the two cerebral hemispheres.
      Which hemisphere is associated with the more pathological neural
      networks has to be determined for each individual patient. This
      may refer to a hemispheric valence. The hemisphere with the
      healthier neural networks is said to have a more positive
      hemispheric emotional valence. The other cerebral hemisphere is
      thought to have a more negative hemispheric emotional valence.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] This explanation is based mainly on two observations. The
      first is that we know that the eyes in all people are connected to
      the brain so that images projected to the left visual field are
      sent first to the right cerebral hemisphere. The information can
      then be sent via the corpus callosum to the opposite hemisphere,
      but in patients in whom the corpus callosum has been severed as a
      treatment for epilepsy, the image is seen only by one hemisphere.
      This discovery led to the “Split-brain Studies” for which Roger
      Sperry won the Nobel Prize. We found that having patients limit
      their vision to either the left or right lateral visual field
      while in an fMRI scanner led to the observation illustrated in
      FIG. 2 that when the patients looked out of their right lateral
      visual field the blood flow (and presumably their brain activity)
      in their left brain was dramatically increased. The opposite
      occurred when the subjects looked out of the left lateral visual
      field.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] In an embodiment, based on earlier publications, having a
      person look out of one lateral visual field and then the other
      could cause dramatic changes in the patients' psychological state.
      About 60% of patients may feel differently when they look out of
      one visual field versus the other and about 30% have extreme
      responses. About 85% of patients with severe symptoms will have an
      extreme response. An example of an extreme response is the
      following: a patient who is a veteran of the war in Viet Nam
      looked out of his right lateral visual field and saw a large plant
      behind me and became alarmed. He said, “That plant looks like the
      jungle!” I asked him quickly to look out of the left lateral
      visual field and he said, “That's a nice looking plant.” He was
      obviously distressed when looking out the right lateral visual
      field and was relaxed and calmed when looking out of the left
      lateral visual field. The side in which the patient gets upset is
      consistent for that patient, but for another given patient the
      side that is upsetting can be either the left or right side.
      Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, about 65% of the
      time, feel more distressed when they look out of the right visual
      field (left brain is more distressed). Patients with major
      depression about 65% of the time feel more distressed when looking
      out of the left lateral visual field.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] LVFS can be used to guide the placement of light
      treatments. In an embodiment, LVFS may be used to activate
      positive neural networks and negative neural networks. The
      positive neural networks and the negative neural networks in the
      brain may be associated with positive or negative outlooks on the
      world, respectively. In an embodiment, traumatic experiences may
      be associated with specific neural networks that are in some way
      associated with one hemisphere. Treatment of psychological
      conditions may include treating these negative neural networks,
      either through education, suppression, by enhancing the positive
      neural networks associated with the hemisphere with a positive
      HEV, psychotherapy, deep brain stimulation, certain psychotropic
      medications, unilateral ECT, transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS) or by a combination of methods. In an embodiment, near
      infrared (NIR) treatments may be used to enhance the positive
      hemisphere, suppress the negative, and to support the teaching or
      healing of the negative neural networks so that the trauma can be
      tolerated, grieved and recovered from. In another embodiment, NIR
      treatments can be combined with other treatments.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] In an embodiment, the methods of the present disclosure may
      include the use of glasses for the LVFS treatment. As shown in
      FIG. 1, glasses, such as safety glasses or goggles, are taped or
      covered so that they permit vision to only one lateral visual
      field at a time. The patient is asked to look to one side and to
      fixate the center of his vision on the edge of the tape so that he
      or she is looking out of the lateral half of one eye. Vision from
      the other eye is occluded by the tape on the other side. While
      looking out of the specific visual field, the patient is asked to
      look at a photograph of a man or woman with a mildly angry facial
      expression. After 45 seconds, he or she is asked to verbally rate
      his or her present feelings for each of 10 affects from Positive
      and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), from none to extreme on a 5
      point scale. Following the PANAS measurements, the patient is
      asked to rest for 1 minute looking straight ahead so that vision
      from both eyes is occluded. The patient is then asked to repeat
      the procedure by looking out of the second visual field.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] The PANAS has 5 positive affects including alert, inspired,
      determined, attentive, active and 5 negative affects including
      upset, hostile, ashamed, nervous, afraid. For each visual field,
      the sum of the scores on the 5 negative affects is subtracted from
      the scores from the 5 positive affects and the difference is the
      PANAS score. The score measured when the person looks out of the
      right lateral visual field (RVF) is subtracted from the score
      measured when the person looks out of the left lateral visual
      field (LFV). The LVF is indicative of the state of the right
      hemisphere since the connection between the medial retinas and the
      cerebral hemispheres are crossed. Since a more positive PANAS
      score indicates more positive affect, we assign a value for the
      person's HEV according to the formula: LVF PANAS score—RVF PANAS.
      A positive score suggests that the right hemisphere has a more
      positive HEV. Research studies show that LVFS offers a good
      indication that the left and right cerebral hemispheres are
      generally associated with different emotional valences such that
      one hemisphere (either left or right) is associated with a more
      positive outlook on the world (positive hemispheric valence) and
      the other a more negative outlook on the world (negative
      hemispheric valence).<br>
      <br>
      [0110] A person's personality and some of the person's
      psychological characteristics may be affected by which hemisphere,
      right or left hemisphere, dominates. The eyes are connected to the
      brain so that vision to the left side of a person goes first to
      the opposite (right) hemisphere and vision to the right side of a
      person goes first to the left hemisphere. One hemisphere can be
      stimulated over the other by restricting vision to a portion of
      the retina of an eye that is connected to a particular hemisphere
      of the brain. For instance, LVFS has been shown by fMRI to induce
      a very large increase in brain activity in the hemisphere opposite
      the visual field, when the subject looked out of the left visual
      field (LVF) and the right visual field (RVF). FIG. 2 shows images
      of the brain having different activity in the left and right
      cerebral hemispheres after looking out of the left and right
      lateral visual fields. FIG. 2A shows brain activity after looking
      out of the left half of the left eye. FIG. 2B shows brain activity
      after looking out of the right half of the right eye. As an
      example, a person looking out of one visual field might see
      another person as very critical of him and he might feel very
      critical of himself. Looking out the opposite visual field he is
      apt to see another person as quite approving of him and he is apt
      to see himself positively.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] In an embodiment, the PANAS score may be used to determine
      which hemisphere of the brain to treat for a psychological
      disorder. Treating, or stimulating, one hemisphere of the brain at
      a time may cause certain changes in the psychological state of a
      person. These changes include, but are not limited to, a more
      positive outlook and a reduction in a negative outlook. In one
      embodiment, applying light over the upper side of the forehead
      (over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) will stimulate the
      hemisphere on that same side. In an embodiment, stimulating the
      brain in the medial pre-frontal cortex (stimulating transcranially
      on the forehead just above the eye on one side will inhibit the
      limbic system on that same side. In some embodiments, applying
      light on the forehead over the eye is likely to be emotionally
      inhibitory. In other embodiments, applying light over the upper
      side of the forehead (i.e., over the dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex) over the hemisphere with a positive valence is likely to
      be helpful as would be treating over the medial pre-frontal cortex
      of the other hemisphere (with a more negative valence) to inhibit
      the limbic system of the hemisphere with a negative valence. With
      clinical practice, one could expect to improve this art by
      learning better locations and parameters for light treatments.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] In an embodiment, diagnosing and treating one hemisphere of
      the brain may only cause changes in the psychological state of a
      person having a positive HEV. For example, treating the left
      hemisphere may benefit those patients who had a positive left
      hemispheric emotional valence (HEV), but not those with a negative
      left HEV. On the other hand, treating the right hemisphere may
      benefit those patients who had a positive right hemispheric
      emotional valence (HEV), but not those with a negative right HEV.
      In an embodiment, treating one hemisphere of the brain may only
      cause changes in the psychological state of person having a
      negative HEV. For example, treating the left hemisphere may
      benefit those patients who had a negative left hemispheric
      emotional valence (HEV), but not those with a positive left HEV.
      On the other hand, treating the right hemisphere may benefit those
      patients who had a negative right hemispheric emotional valence
      (HEV), but not those with a positive right HEV. In an embodiment,
      treating one hemisphere of the brain may cause changes in the
      psychological state of person having an either a positive HEV or a
      negative HEV. In an embodiment, diagnosis and treatment of a
      psychological disorder may be specific for each particular
      disorder. For example, treatment of anorexia may require treatment
      of the hemisphere with a positive HEV while treatment of insomnia
      may require treatment of the hemisphere with a negative HEV.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] In an embodiment, the methods of the present disclosure may
      include using light energy to treat a hemisphere of the brain. In
      an embodiment, the light energy may include near infrared light
      (NIR). During this procedure, subjects can wear protective eyewear
      to prevent the light to be shined into their eyes. NIR light may,
      in an embodiment, be applied using Photobiomodulation (PBM) in the
      form of an LED, as shown in FIG. 3. FIG. 4 shows a close up of the
      PBM device. FIG. 5 shows a control unit of the PBM device. The
      control unit may contain a power supply. The power supply may be
      in the form of a battery or it may be connected to a power outlet.
      In an embodiment, the control unit may include at least one socket
      to connect with a LED. In an embodiment, one socket and one LED
      may be used to treat one location on a patient's head at a given
      time. In an embodiment, more than one LED can be used to treat
      more than one location on a patient's head at a given time. For
      example, in stroke patients, NIR may be used over the entire head.
      A knob is situated on the control unit to control the voltage to
      the LED. An increase in the voltage may be associated with an
      increase in the light being delivered.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] In an embodiment, NIR light may be applied at a distance of
      about 0 to 1000 mm from the skin. In an embodiment, NIR light may
      be applied at a distance of about 4 mm from the skin. Placing the
      NIR light at a distance of about 4 mm from the skin at a power
      density of about 250 mW/cm&lt;2 &gt;allows an amount of NIR light
      and intensity to be directed at a person's brain without causing
      harm to the brain during a 4-minute treatment at a given site.
      This dose may be safely delivered to other sites on the head in
      the same treatment setting. This dose could be increased as long
      as it is below the ANSI standard of about 320 mW/cm&lt;2 &gt;on
      the skin at each site. It should be noted that the intensity of
      the NIR light increases as the NIR light approaches the skin and
      decreases in intensity by the square of the distance as the NIR
      light is moved away from the skin. One reason for choosing the
      distance of about 4 mm from the skin at a power density of about
      250 mW/cm&lt;2 &gt;is that the closer to the skin the more likely
      the LED will emit heat that cannot be dissipated by the heat sink
      and fan. If the patient can detect heat, placebo controlled
      studies may not be conducted as the patient may know whether the
      LED light was on or off. Also, the heat from the LED might cause
      the patient to feel pain the closer the LED is to the patient.
      Additionally, too much light, without heat, can cause damage to
      the skin. There is a conservative standard for the permissible
      amount of light (photons) at near infrared frequency of 810 nm,
      called the ANSI standard, as noted above, and studies with NIR
      light below that standard will not cause any harm to the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] During treatment, the light treatment device may be pulsed,
      or the light treatment may be continuously applied. In certain
      embodiments, the light treatment device may be combined with other
      types of treatments for an improved therapeutic effect. Treatment
      can include directing light through the scalp of the patient to a
      target area of the brain concurrently with applying an
      electromagnetic field to the brain. The light may be applied with
      a desired power density and with a desired electromagnetic field
      strength at the target area. In an embodiment, methods of treating
      a psychiatric disorder may include non-invasively irradiating at
      least a portion of a patient's brain with light energy having an
      efficacious power density and wavelength, sufficient to cause a
      neurotrophic effect and/or regulation of neurotransmitters. In
      another embodiment, methods of treating a psychiatric disorder may
      include non-invasively irradiating at least a portion of a
      patient's brain with light energy having an efficacious power
      density and wavelength, sufficient to cause a neurotrophic effect
      and/or regulation of neurotransmitters, and delivering the light
      energy for one or more treatment periods occurring over the course
      of at least one week, each treatment period having a duration of
      at least about 1 minute.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] In an embodiment, the NIR light may be pulsed when applied
      to the skin. Pulsing the NIR light can allow the use of a more
      intense light and yet remain below the ANSI standard. Pulsing the
      NIR light may be used to entrain the brain and thereby affect the
      state of the brain. A faster entrainment can increase brain
      activity, and a slower entrainment can decrease brain activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] The light output may be continuously applied at about 250
      mW/cm&lt;2 &gt;at a wavelength of about 810 nm with a full width
      half maximum of about 40 nm. In an embodiment, the NIR light may
      be directed at a person's brain for about 4 minutes (total
      delivered fluence per spot of 60 J/cm&lt;2&gt;). In an embodiment,
      the procedure with the NIR light may be repeated at at least one
      other site on the forehead. In an embodiment, the NIR light may
      penetrate the dura, or the outermost of the three layers of the
      meninges surrounding the brain, at about 3.7%. In accordance with
      a penetration of about 3.7%, approximately 2.1 J/cm&lt;2 &gt;of
      fluence is delivered to each of the treated areas of the brain. It
      should be noted that the level of light exposure is below the ANSI
      standard of 320 mW/cm&lt;2&gt;. The level of light exposure either
      to the skin (power density of 250 mW/cm&lt;2 &gt;and total fluence
      of 60 J/cm&lt;2&gt;), to the surface of the brain (power density
      of 9.5 mW/cm&lt;2 &gt;and total fluence of 2.1 J/cm&lt;2&gt;) and
      to each of the 2 treated areas of the forehead poses no
      significant risk to the skin or the brain. It should be noted that
      while described above with a specific frequency, the invention of
      the present disclosure could also use a frequency from about 300
      nm to about 1500 nm. Furthermore, the present invention can use
      any source of light, whether low level laser or LED, so long as

      [0118] The methods of the present disclosure may affect blood flow
      within the brain. Blood flow in the brain can be measured in left
      and right frontal poles by NIRS, by a blood flow monitoring
      device, such as a Somanetics INVOS system, modified by Somanetics
      to provide total hemoglobin (cHb). In an embodiment, the blood
      flow monitoring device uses a low power NIR LED. The blood flow
      monitoring device has no effect on the brain. The blood flow
      monitoring device measures the amount of blood in the brain once a
      second. In an embodiment, the Somanetics devices measures oxy- and
      deoxy-hemoglobin. The blood flow monitoring device poses no harm
      or discomfort to subjects and allows subjects to have relatively
      free movement. The blood flow monitoring device can be used to
      monitor cHb in the left and right frontal poles during PBM. Since
      the PBM used in an embodiment of the present disclosure is a
      continuous wave, the light from the PBM is not detected by this
      NIRS device because it has a proprietary mechanism for excluding
      continuous light so that sunlight does not affect the device's
      pulsed photon emitter. It should be noted that the Somanetics
      device is FDA approved, is commercially available, and is used
      throughout the world in hospital settings to monitor cerebral
      perfusion.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] In an embodiment, cHb can be measured by NIRS during
      treatments at at least one point. In an embodiment, there may be a
      correlation between NIR and improved cHb and mood. For example,
      there may be greater total (left plus right) cHb during NIR on
      versus off as shown in FIG. 6. FIG. 7 shows that there was a
      significantly more positive affect when the hemisphere with a
      positive HEV was treated with NIR-PBM and a significantly more
      negative affect after a hemisphere with a negative HEV was
      treated. In FIG. 7, “matched” refers to treating the hemisphere
      with a positive HEV and “unmatched” refers to treating the
      hemisphere with a negative HEV. PANAS scores declined when the
      negative hemisphere was treated. Thus, in a blind,
      placebo-controlled secondary study, the PANAS scores improved on
      the PANAS items, following NIR treatments to the hemisphere with a
      more positive HEV. The PANAS scores correlated very highly with
      the HEV values times agreement (1) or disagreement (-1) with the
      side treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] The increase in cHb with NIR suggests that the NIR
      treatment is affecting the brain. The improvement in PANAS
      immediately following the treatment may indicate that this effect
      on the brain likely relates to the alterations in affect. FIG. 8
      shows that at 2-weeks post treatment, a decrease in anxiety (as
      measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) was related to the
      patient's baseline HEV and cerebral blood flow (CBF). In an
      embodiment, patients with a left negative HEV and an increase in
      right frontal CBF had less anxiety. In an embodiment, patients
      with a right negative HEV and an increase in left frontal CBF had
      less anxiety. Thus, patients who had an increase in blood flow in
      their positive hemisphere did better at 2-weeks post treatment. If
      a person has a negative side, increasing the blood flow on the
      opposite side can have a beneficial effect at 2-weeks post
      treatment. The fact that the outcomes at 2-weeks were dependent in
      regression models on the baseline HEV value is consistent with the
      fact that right hemisphere is often associated with a positive HEV
      (in opposition to the popular notion that negative affect and/or
      cognition are associated always with the right hemisphere) and
      that knowing a patient's HEV can enlighten data reduction and
      guide treatment. Cerebral blood flow correlates with brain
      activity in the front of the brain. Patients with a negative right
      HEV and an increased left CBF and patients with a negative left
      HEV and an increased right CBF may have significantly better
      outcomes in terms of their Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores at
      2-weeks post NIR treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] Several theories may help explain the possible correlation
      between NIR light and improved cHb and mood. NIR light is known to
      increase and/or stimulate mitochondrial ATP and nerve growth
      factors. This may be because the energy from the NIR light may be
      absorbed by the mitochondria, which are the energy production
      centers of the brain. Increasing and/or stimulating mitochondria
      and mitochondrial ATP may help stimulate the positive neural
      circuits or inhibit the negative neural circuits. It is further
      known that light therapies may promote wound healing or reduce the
      damage from strokes or heart attacks. Such studies were conducted
      in rats and rabbits.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] It should be noted that patients who were treated
      bilaterally with the methods of the present disclosure experienced
      a remission of anxieties at a rate of about seventy percent.
      Remission refers to the state of absence of disease activity in
      patients with a chronic illness. Remission is measured using a
      rating scale where a score of greater than fifteen on the rating
      scale correlates to having an anxiety disorder and a score of ten
      or less on the rating scale correlates to being in remission and
      no longer manifesting an abnormal level of anxiety. Compared to
      other treatments, a remission rate of about seventy percent is
      very high. On the Hamilton Depression Scale there was an average
      percent decrease (percent less depression) of 54% 2-weeks after
      the single treatment, and on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, at
      2-weeks post treatment, there was a percent decrease of 63%. These
      also compare well with other treatments. For example, studies have
      found that after 29 patients with an anxiety disorder were treated
      with cognitive behavioral therapy for 30 weeks, those 29 patients
      achieved a 51% reduction on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale at
      the end of the treatment. In addition, studies have found that
      after 28 patients having an anxiety disorder were treated with
      short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for 30 weeks, those 28
      patients achieved a 43% reduction on this anxiety rating scale at
      the end of the treatment. In an embodiment, the methods of the
      present disclosure treats patients with light therapy for a total
      of about 8 minutes, is pain free, and without any observed side
      effects, and is generally inexpensive.<br>
