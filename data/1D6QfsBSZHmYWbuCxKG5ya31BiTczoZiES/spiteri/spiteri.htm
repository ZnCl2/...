      <p>Joe Spiteri Sargent recounts how, on a lonely drive to Banff,
        in Canada, way back in 1989, he got a flash of inspiration that
        enabled him to go on to develop the Spiteri Water Pump. </p>
      <p>The former Malta Drydocks apprentice, who spent 32 years in
        Canada and has residences in both countries, was missing a vital
        piece in his theoretical model, which he has since developed
        into a fully fledged prototype. </p>
      <p>He is now seeking funding to develop a second-generation
        machine and obtain an international patent. </p>
      <p>Mr Spiteri Sargent, 71, took an aeronautical draughtsman's
        course and in 1956 got a job in the Canadian Air Force as a
        navigator trainee. He completed his university education as a
        mechanical engineer and worked for 27 years as a tool and die,
        and single-purpose-machine designer. </p>
      <p>He owes the original inspiration to his invention to former
        Prime Minister Dom Mintoff, who in 1980 said: "If only Malta had
        some sort of a waterfall, our electricity would be much
        cheaper." It is this principle of using water pressure to create
        a waterfall to power a turbine that is the nub of Mr Spiteri
        Sargent's invention. </p>
      <p>In 1991, he started working on the project more intensely,
        performing experiments in Canada. Between 1991 and 1994, he
        wrote a force and energy analysis and then started building a
        working prototype in a four-metre high tank in Luqa. </p>
      <p>Parts for the prototype were built at Malta Drydocks according
        to working drawings supplied by Mr Spiteri Sargent. The basic,
        fundamental formula has not changed but he has continued to
        improve components to make them more resistant. </p>
      <p>By 2004, he was convinced that the prototype satisfied the
        force and energy analysis and last June he applied for an
        international patent, covering the US, China, Japan and Russia.
      </p>
      <p>This is a two-and-a-half-year process, including a request in
        six months' time for a technical review, which takes two years
        to obtain. Development, however, can continue and it will be
        covered by the patent. Meanwhile, on December 6 the patent was
        published in Malta and the UK. </p>
      <p>Mr Spiteri Sargent's work has been verified by two other
        engineers with master degrees in water technology. One of the
        engineers, Ing. Marco Cremona, told The Times Business that one
        of the fundamentals of physics is that you cannot create energy
        out of nothing. </p>
      <p>"When you have a submerged body in water there is latent
        hydrostatic energy in place. The invention exploits this
        energy." He gave as an example an air-conditioner on heating
        mode. This device, he said, appears to produce three times more
        energy (as heat) than it consumes (in electricity). However,
        this does not go against the laws of physics. </p>
      <p>"The reality is that the air-conditioner is taking advantage of
        latent (hidden) energy outside the room and transferring it into
        the room. It is not generating energy; it is transferring
        energy. The Spiteri Water Pump works on the same principle." </p>
      <p>Twenty-two family members and friends have an investment in
        Sargent Enterprises Ltd (SEL), which has enabled him to develop
        the prototype up to the current stage. </p>
      <p>He has already received interest from a UK water pump
        manufacturer, who visited Malta and saw the prototype. "I am
        looking for a joint development agreement, involving an
        investment of â‚¬900,000 into SEL," Mr Spiteri Sargent said. This
        will be used to build the second-generation prototype, which
        will be a larger scale version of the Luqa prototype with some
        improvements. The aim is to have a prototype that can be
        presented to large-sale investors like General Electric, Shell,
        BP and Siemens. </p>
      <p>The Spiteri Water Pump will convert hydraulic energy into
        mechanical energy. This is then used to pump water into a
        reservoir, generating electricity through the hydroelectric
        power system from the reservoir's waterfall. </p>
      <p>This machine is a low-tech prime mover suitable for various
        applications, such as electrical power, gas compression, pumping
        water and-other-mechanical uses. His second-generation-prototype
        is the Spiteri Hydroelectric power station, consisting of six
        Spiteri water pumps with sufficient output to provide
        electricity for 120 households. </p>
      <p>A bigger version of this model can generate an output of 250kW,
        and several of these modular units can generate enough power to
        meet as much as a quarter of Malta's electricity consumption. </p>
      <p>Mr Spiteri Sargent has also been in touch with the local
        authorities, with a view to using Malta as a test bed. </p>
      <p>He estimates that to replace this amount of Malta's fossil-fuel
        fired generating capacity, 11 sites are required, each having a
        footprint equivalent to a football pitch. </p>
      <p>These small generating stations can be built on land,
        underground or in the sea. </p>

          International Award</font></center>
      <p>The Spiteri Water Pump, a fuel-free, electricity-generating
        machine, walked away with the national prize during an awards
        ceremony held at the European Parliament in Brussels. </p>
      <p>Developed by Joe Spiteri Sargent, the machine operates under a
        water surface and harnesses latent hydrostatic energy naturally
        present in a body of water, transferring it to produce an
        artificial waterfall to produce electricity via a hydro-electric
        power system. Present for the 2007 Energy Globe Award ceremony
        were Mr Spiteri Sargent and hydrologist Marco Cremona, who was
        also involved in the project. </p>
      <p>A total of 853 project submissions were made from 109
        countries, falling under five categories: earth, fire, air,
        water and youth. The Malta project was submitted in the fire
        category. A working prototype has been constructed in Malta and
        worldwide patents have been filed. </p>
      <p>According to Mr Spiteri Sargent, the main benefits of this
        innovative product are that it has very low running costs and
        operates without the use of consumables. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, it can be placed in any water body in the world
        and produces energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There are
        no emissions from this energy transfer process. </p>
      <p>The winners were selected by a panel including members from the
        UN Industrial Development Organisation, the World Bank and the
        European Renewable Energy Council. The awards were an initiative
        by engineer and environmentalist Wolfang Newmann Wolfgang
        Newmann. </p>
      <p>The awards have been dished out annually since 1999 to
        recognise projects that 'make careful and economical use of
        resources and employ sources'. </p>
      <p>For the second year in a row, the ceremony was held at the
        Plenary Hall of the European Parliament in Brussels. A number of
        high-profile personalities were present including EP President
        Hans-Gert Pottering, European Commission President JosÃ© Manuel
        Barroso, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan as well as
        former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev as honorary guest. </p>
