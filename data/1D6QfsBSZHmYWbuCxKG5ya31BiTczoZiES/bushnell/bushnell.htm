          <p align="left">Five years ago, Ray Bushnell shut down his
            engineering office in Oregon City and left the hardwood
            floors, 12-foot ceilings and high-tech clients behind for a
            pole barn in his back yard in rural Clackamas County. </p>
          <p align="left">With money from investors, he installed a
            $50,000 dynamometer in the concrete floor and bought a raft
            of electronic equipment that rivals a DEQ emissions station.
          </p>
          <p align="left">He then set out on a single-minded pursuit of
            what is becoming the auto industry's holy grail: high
            mileage. </p>
          <p align="left">Now, Bushnell and company co-founder Bob Reid,
            a retired venture capitalist, say they're close to
            perfecting Vapor Fuel Technologies' fuel delivery system, a
            new twist on the old challenge of optimally mixing fuel and
            air before it explodes in a combustion chamber. <br>
            Brent Wojahn / The OregonianOregon engineer Ray Bushnell is
            working on a fuel delivery device that could cut gasoline
            use by nearly a third. </p>
          <p align="left">The race for high-mileage gold is crowded with
            auto manufacturers, international upstarts and countless
            garage tinkerers, all spurred of late by $4-a-gallon gas and
            the talk of tougher mileage requirements. </p>
          <p align="left">Vapor Fuel's product faces daunting hurdles,
            not least the difficulty of adding devices to today's
            computer-controlled gas engines, an ambitious 2009
            production schedule and the potential for demand to plummet
            if gas prices return to earth. </p>
          <p align="left">But the company has five patents in hand and
            four pending. And a certified testing lab last year in
            Southern California documented a 30 percent mileage increase
            in a Ford F-150 with the Vapor Fuel system. "Timing is
            everything," said Joe Jones, the California lab's research
            director. "And certainly their timing is right." </p>
          <p align="left">When it comes to improving mileage, electric
            cars and fuel cells get a lot of ink. But all the major
            automakers are retooling gas engines for better mileage,
            too. </p>
          <p align="left">Today's engines are far more complex, notes
            Jack Friedman, general manager of Unichip of North America
            in Hillsboro, which is developing an add-on to sync Vapor
            Fuel's device with manufacturers' on-board engine computers.
          </p>
          <p align="left">Computers monitor everything from air
            temperatures to throttle position to atmospheric pressure
            fast enough to regulate an engine turning up to 100 times a
            second. Unichip's software includes 94,000 data points for
            engine timing alone. </p>
          <p align="left">The engine in a typical muscle car of the
            1960s measured about 7 liters (more than 400 cubic inches)
            and generated roughly 400 horsepower. Friedman, a former Air
            Force fighter pilot, drives a BMW M3 coupe. Its
            computer-managed engine generates 420 horsepower -- from
            just 4 liters. </p>
          <p align="left">"Everybody pooh-poohs the gasoline engine,"
            Friedman says. "But it's very powerful. It's relatively
            inexpensive. It's relatively available. And engines run well
            on it." </p>
          <p align="left">Vapor Fuel started out far away from Detroit,
            moving to Bushnell's spread in part to save money, in part
            to keep the work under wraps. "This is such a competitive
            field," said Reid, 75. </p>
          <p align="left">The company started out by heating gasoline
            enough to vaporize it before it entered the piston chamber
            -- an idea inspired by one of Reid's acquaintances, who ran
            a car off a 6-foot-long tank of vaporized fuel. </p>
          <p align="left">The idea isn't new: In patent searches, the
            company found a 1940s picture of a guy with a similar tank.
            But the vaporized and expanded gasoline burned far more
            efficiently than the fuel injection systems that Bushnell
            bypassed. Driving up Interstate 5, Reid's acquaintance got
            up to 90 percent increases in gas mileage. He could get 50
            percent increases without noticeable performance drops. </p>
          <p align="left">But the idea had a fatal flaw, pointed out in
            2005 by Tony Dean, a Colorado School of Mines chemical
            engineering professor who partnered with Toyota on fuel
            technology when he worked at Exxon. </p>
          <p align="left">The problem, Dean told the company, was one
            the auto industry had long faced in trying to increase
            mileage. Putting less gas in the mix increased the ratio of
            oxygen-to-fuel and caused a condition known as "lean burn."
            And the higher oxygen content baffled the pollution control
            system's catalytic converter, hampering removal of nitrogen
            oxides, a smog-causing pollutant. </p>
          <p align="left">"The day that Tony Dean came in to explain NOX
            was not a good day," Bushnell said. "It was like falling off
            your bike onto the bar in the middle." </p>
          <p align="left">Automakers are responding to the problem in
            various ways, including technology that explodes gas in the
            combustion chamber through compression, like a diesel
            engine, rather than a spark. </p>
          <p align="left">But Bushnell continued tinkering, now with
            Dean's critiques, settling on an idea that they believe the
            auto industry hasn't thought of. Why not heat the incoming
            air, too? </p>
          <p align="left">That causes it to expand ( the same principle
            a hot air balloon relies on) and fill up more space with
            less air. Combined with vaporized gasoline, they could keep
            the air-fuel ratio the same, dodging the pollution problem.
          </p>
          <p align="left">The heated mixture had another benefit,
            Bushnell and Dean said. Its "flame speed" -- how fast it
            burned -- and its explosive potential were higher than
            normal. That meant much more of it could be exploded when
            the piston was at its optimum position. And that meant they
            could use less gasoline without sacrificing power. </p>
          <p align="left">The system pulls heat from the radiator system
            to heat the fuel, and waste heat from the exhaust manifold
            to heat the air. </p>
          <p align="left">"We're the poor folks from Beavercreek. We
            aren't in the (automakers') club," Bushnell says. "We got
            outside the box, because we can never be included in the
            box." </p>
          <p align="left">There's good reason for skepticism, said Jim
            Hossack, a market analyst for AutoPacific in Tustin, Calif.,
            and a former engineer for Ford, Chrysler and Mazda Motor.
            Usually there's a fatal flaw in mileage inventions, he said.
          </p>
          <p align="left">A device doesn't work in cold weather or high
            altitude, or it isn't durable enough. It's "hard to imagine
            that a small undercapitalized outfit with a few people could
            make a breakthrough," Hossack said in an e-mail. </p>
          <p align="left">The California Air Resources Board has to
            certify any add-on device used in the state, making sure
            that it doesn't increase pollution and that it can hold up
            over time. </p>
          <p align="left">John Swanton, an air pollution specialist in
            the board's El Monte, Calif., lab, says the board has seen a
            spike in interest in mileage-enhancing devices since gas
            prices surged. But it hasn't yet seen gizmos that improve
            mileage in modern gasoline vehicles. Newer cars are
            relatively clean and complex, he said, and hard to modify
            without manufacturer cooperation. </p>
          <p align="left">On the other hand, Jones, research director
            for California Environmental Engineering, a CARB-certified
            lab, said the tests his lab ran last year showed
            surprisingly strong results, with mileage improving 30.1
            percent. </p>
          <p align="left">"I've been here over 20 years, and there's
            nothing that's worked quite that dramatically and
            consistently," Jones said. </p>
          <p align="left">Vapor Fuels hopes to get CARB certification
            later this summer after Unichip completes its work.
            Meantime, they're talking with investors and potential
            buyers, with plans to start sales by the third quarter of
            2009. Its first target market: North America's 102 million
            light trucks and sport utility vehicles. </p>
          <p align="left">"Is there another iceberg we're not seeing? We
            don't know," he said. "But it looks pretty promising." </p>

          </center>
          <p align="left">Vapor Fuel Technologies has created a system
            that is based on vaporizing fuel and heating the air that
            mixes with the vaporized fuel prior to entering the cylinder
            for combustion. When properly controlled, this vaporization
            and heating causes a thermal expansion that accomplishes the
            dilution of both the fuel and air in the mixture without
            changing the ratio that allows the catalytic converter to
            work and provide acceptable emissions, including oxides of
            nitrogen (NOx). Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) can be used
            in lesser quantities with the VFT System to complete the
            dilution process and balance the power requirements of a
            normal driving cycle. </p>
          <p align="left">The vaporization process and heating of the
            fuel vapor and air mixture, along with moderate EGR, also
            improves the combustion process by increasing flame speed
            and creating the conditions for a chain reaction
            Autoignition. The resulting combustion is shorter in
            duration and significantly more efficient since it
            substantially occurs closer to the optimal crank angle of
            the engine. This allows the VFT system to use less fuel yet
            provide the power to be used in all normal driving
            conditions. </p>
          <p align="left">Vapor Fuel Technologies system and equipment
            are, in conjunction with necessary modification of the
            onboard-computer system, adaptable to the vast majority of
            motor vehicles in either retrofit or new applications. The
            added cost to include this technology in a new vehicle is
            estimated to be less than one hundred dollars U.S. </p>
          <p align="left"><b>Limitations of Current Gasoline Technology</b>
          </p>
          <p align="left">The Auto Industry understands the benefit of
            using less fuel to power the vehicle (dilution) and creating
            a better combustion event (autoignition) to replace the
            power loss due to dilution but they have pursued those goals
            in ways that have presented significant and unnecessary
            roadblocks. Diluting the fuel using more air or EGR has
            created a difficult, and extremely time consuming situation.
          </p>
          <p align="left">Using more air in the fuel air mixture
            accomplishes the goal of using less fuel to fill the
            combustion chamber but the resulting lean burn event results
            in an inability of the catalytic converter to remove the NOx
            from the exhaust. </p>
          <p align="left">The new regulations, especially in California
            and the eleven other states following their lead, are
            becoming less tolerant of these emissions. Diluting the fuel
            within the mixture to approximately 50% of normal decreases
            the NOx production to very low levels but there is so little
            power remaining this method can only be used at very light
            loads and moderate speeds. Most of the fuel savings are also
            lost due to the lack of power. </p>
          <p align="left">EGR can be used to dilute the fuel air mixture
            by recirculation of exhaust, mostly inert gasses such as
            nitrogen and carbon dioxide, into the cylinder with the fuel
            and air. This accomplishes the goal of diluting the fuel but
            the resulting gaps of inert gas between the fuel and air
            components can diminish the efficiency of the combustion if
            used excessively. </p>
