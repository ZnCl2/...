      A diet high in green vegetables is known to reduce the incidence
      of cancer, and now scientists have found evidence that they could
      help fight cancer already present in tumours.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers in the US have found that a compound in dark-green
      vegetables (aka cruciferous vegetables) called sulforaphane may be
      able to treat cancer and help existing cancer drugs work more
      effectively.<br>
      <br>
      Sulforaphane is found in the highest concentrations in young
      sprouts of broccoli, but it's also present in Brussels sprouts,
      kale, cauliflower, and cabbage. In addition to natural produce,
      you can also buy sulforaphane in the dietary supplement broccoli
      sprout extract (BSE).<br>
      <br>
      In a new study conducted by researchers at the Texas A&amp;M
      Health Science Centre, 28 human volunteers aged 50+ who were
      already undergoing routine colonoscopies were surveyed on their
      cruciferous vegetable-eating habits.<br>
      <br>
      When the researchers examined the volunteers' colon biopsies, they
      found that those who ate more servings of dark-green vegetables
      had higher levels of expression of a tumour suppressor gene
      (called p16) than those who ate few or no cruciferous vegetables.<br>
      <br>
      What surprised the researchers was finding that the p16 benefits
      from vegetable intake persisted even when volunteers indicated
      that they didn’t eat vegetables every day. That's strange, because
      suloraphane usually clears out of the body in less than 24 hours
      after being consumed.<br>
      <br>
      "This hints at the possibility that epigenetic mechanisms are
      initially triggered by sulforaphane and its metabolites, and
      downstream mechanisms could be sustained, at least in the
      short-term, even after compounds are eliminated from the body,"
      said one of the researchers, Praveen Rajendran.<br>
      <br>
      What this means is eating cruciferous vegetables or taking
      sulforaphane in a supplement form – effectively, a broccoli pill –
      may end up changing your genes, helping your body to get better at
      preventing tumour growth. The findings are published in Clinical
      Epigenetics.<br>
      <br>
      Previous research by the same team had found that sulforaphane
      could inhibit colon and prostate cancer cells in laboratory tests,
      but discovering that the benefits extend to humans is significant.<br>
      <br>
      "Our work provides comprehensive proof-of-principle using
      cell-based, animal and human studies that dietary compounds like
      sulforaphane can be chemopreventive," said Rajendran. "However,
      we’re not quite ready to recommend everyone take a BSE supplement,
      and it’s certainly worth reiterating what nutritionists have said
      for years: eat your vegetables."<br>

      A compound in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables may be
      able to not only help prevent cancer but also help to treat it — a
      new approach researchers at Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center
      are calling “from the table to the bedside.” Although no one is
      suggesting giving up traditional chemotherapy and radiation
      treatments for cancer, compounds from food may actually help
      cancer drugs work more effectively.<br>
      <br>
      This cancer-fighting compound is called sulforaphane, and it is
      found in vegetables like Brussels sprouts, kale, cauliflower and
      cabbage, but its highest concentrations are in the young sprouts
      of broccoli. Sulforaphane can also be found in a dietary
      supplement called broccoli sprout extract, or BSE.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center Institute
      of Biosciences and Technology (IBT) in Houston, along with
      collaborators in Oregon, had previously found that sulforaphane
      could inhibit colon and prostate cancer cells in the laboratory.
      They’ve now shown that it seems to help humans as well.<br>
      <br>
      Roderick H. Dashwood, professor and director of the Center for
      Epigenetics &amp; Disease Prevention at the Texas A&amp;M IBT,
      takes a “field-to-clinic” approach to cancer prevention. He and a
      collaborator, Praveen Rajendran, Ph.D., assistant professor at the
      center, published a new study in the journal Clinical Epigenetics
      that indicates a BSE supplement may help prevent or even treat
      colon cancer and hints at the biological pathways involved.<br>
      <br>
      The BSE supplement seems to be generally safe. “We have not seen
      any serious adverse events in healthy volunteers who consumed BSE
      pills for seven days,” Rajendran said, although some people did
      experience mild abdominal discomfort. He cautions, however, that
      not all broccoli supplements are necessarily as effective as the
      one tested. “We have used a standardized broccoli extract in our
      study provided by Johns Hopkins University,” Rajendran said. “This
      BSE supplement is being evaluated in several other clinical trials
      around the country, but I’m not sure other, similar supplements
      available to the public have the same level of active ingredients,
      including sulforaphane.”<br>
      <br>
      In a separate clinical study, 28 human volunteers over the age of
      50, who were undergoing routine colonoscopies, were surveyed for
      their cruciferous vegetable-eating habits. When their colon
      biopsies were examined, those who ate more servings were found to
      have higher levels of expression of the tumor suppressor gene p16
      than those who ate few or no cruciferous vegetables. This effect
      on p16 held even for people who didn’t eat these vegetables every
      single day, which may seem strange, as a single serving of
      sulforaphane is generally cleared from the body in less than 24
      hours. “This hints at the possibility that epigenetic mechanisms
      are initially triggered by sulforaphane and its metabolites, and
      downstream mechanisms could be sustained, at least in the
      short-term, even after compounds are eliminated from the body.” In
      other words, eating vegetables containing sulforaphane can
      actually change your genes to make your body better able to
      prevent tumor growth.<br>
      <br>
      However, it’s not all good news. In animal models, sulforaphane
      was shown to generally inhibit the development of colon cancer,
      but it’s a bit of a two-edged sword. Sulforaphane induces a
      protein called Nrf2, which has beneficial antioxidant and
      detoxifying effects — and is obviously good for fighting cancer.
      Later in the development of cancer, though, Nrf2 can also have a
      role in tumor growth and can even enhance the buildup of plaque in
      the arteries. “Because of all this, we believe that Nrf2 status is
      worthy of further investigation,” Rajendran said, “not just for
      cancer treatment but for its role in modulating cardiovascular
      disease.”<br>
      <br>
      “Our work provides comprehensive proof-of-principle using
      cell-based, animal and human studies that dietary compounds like
      sulforaphane can be chemopreventive,” or able to help prevent
      cancer, Rajendran said. “However, we’re not quite ready to
      recommend everyone take a BSE supplement, and it’s certainly worth
      reiterating what nutritionists have said for years: eat your
      vegetables.”<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Background</b><br>
      <br>
      The dietary agent sulforaphane (SFN) has been reported to induce
      nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2
      (Nrf2)-dependent pathways as well as inhibiting histone
      deacetylase (HDAC) activity. The current investigation sought to
      examine the relationships between Nrf2 status and HDAC expression
      in preclinical and translational studies.<br>
      <b><br>
        Results</b><br>
      <br>
      Wild type (WT) and Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2 −/+ ) mice were treated
      with the colon carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) followed by
      400 ppm SFN in the diet (n = 35 mice/group). WT mice were more
      susceptible than Nrf2 −/+ mice to tumor induction in the colon.
      Tumors from WT mice had higher HDAC levels globally and locally on
      genes such as cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor 2a (Cdkn2a/p16)
      that were dysregulated during tumor development. The average tumor
      burden was reduced by SFN from 62.7 to 26.0 mm 3 in WT mice and
      from 14.6 to 11.7 mm 3 in Nrf2 −/+ mice. The decreased antitumor
      activity of SFN in Nrf2 −/+ mice coincided with attenuated Cdkn2a
      promoter interactions involving HDAC3. HDAC3 knockdown in human
      colon cancer cells recapitulated the effects of SFN on p16
      induction. Human subjects given a broccoli sprout extract
      supplement (200 μmol SFN equivalents), or reporting more than five
      cruciferous vegetable servings per week, had increased p16
      expression that was inversely associated with HDAC3 in circulating
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in biopsies
      obtained during screening colonoscopy.<br>
      <b><br>
        Conclusions</b><br>
      <br>
      Nrf2 expression varies widely in both normal human colon and human
      colon cancers and likely contributes to the overall rate of tumor
      growth in the large intestine. It remains to be determined whether
      this influences global HDAC protein expression levels, as well as
      local HDAC interactions on genes dysregulated during human colon
      tumor development. If corroborated in future studies, Nrf2 status
      might serve as a biomarker of HDAC inhibitor efficacy in clinical
      trials using single agent or combination modalities to slow, halt,
      or regress the progression to later stages of solid tumors and
      hematological malignancies.<br>

      Sulforaphane is a compound within the isothiocyanate group of
      organosulfur compounds. It is obtained from cruciferous vegetables
      such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts or cabbages. It is produced
      when the enzyme myrosinase transforms glucoraphanin, a
      glucosinolate, into sulforaphane upon damage to the plant (such as
      from chewing), which allows the two compounds to mix and react.
      Young sprouts of broccoli and cauliflower are particularly rich in
      glucoraphanin.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Occurrence and isolation<br>
        <br>
      </b>Sulforaphane was identified in broccoli sprouts, which, of the
      cruciferous vegetables, have the highest concentration of
      sulforaphane.[1] It is also found in Brussels sprouts, cabbage,
      cauliflower, bok choy, kale, collards, Chinese broccoli, broccoli
      raab, kohlrabi, mustard, turnip, radish, arugula, and watercress.<br>
      Research<br>
      <br>
      Basic research on sulforaphane includes its potential effect on
      mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders and cancer; however,
      results to date are contradictory.[2][3] Sulforaphane is under
      study for a potential neuroprotective effect on recovery from
      spinal cord injury[4] and as a possible factor in Helicobacter
      pylori-associated gastric diseases.[5][6]<b><br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A wide variety of acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases,
      including ischemic/traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease,
      and Parkinson's disease, share common characteristics such as
      oxidative stress, misfolded proteins, excitotoxicity,
      inflammation, and neuronal loss. As no drugs are available to
      prevent the progression of these neurological disorders,
      intervention strategies using phytochemicals have been proposed as
      an alternative form of treatment. Among phytochemicals,
      isothiocyanate sulforaphane, derived from the hydrolysis of the
      glucosinolate glucoraphanin mainly present in Brassica vegetables,
      has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in several in vitro and
      in vivo studies. In particular, evidence suggests that
      sulforaphane beneficial effects could be mainly ascribed to its
      peculiar ability to activate the Nrf2/ARE pathway. Therefore,
      sulforaphane appears to be a promising compound with
      neuroprotective properties that may play an important role in
      preventing neurodegeneration.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, including stroke,
      traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and
      Parkinson's disease (PD), are illnesses associated with high
      morbidity and mortality, and few or no effective options are
      available for their treatment [1, 2]. These diseases result in
      acute, as well as gradual and progressive neurodegeneration,
      leading to brain dysfunction and neuronal death. Although
      molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of acute and
      chronic neurodegenerative diseases remain elusive, oxidative
      stress, misfolding, aggregation, accumulation of proteins,
      perturbed Ca2+ homeostasis, excitotoxicity, inflammation, and
      apoptosis have been implicated as possible causes of
      neurodegeneration in the previously mentioned neurological
      disorders [3, 4]. In addition, recent studies demonstrated that
      acute brain injuries are also environmental risk factors
      associated with chronic neurodegenerative diseases [5–7].<br>
      <br>
      In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in a
      number of pharmacological approaches aimed at preventing and
      counteracting the neuronal dysfunction and death associated with
      neurodegenerative diseases. However, while enormous efforts have
      been made to identify agents that could be used to alleviate
      debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, a source of potentially
      beneficial agents, namely, phytochemicals, would appear to have
      significant benefits in counteracting neurodegenerative diseases.
      Phytochemicals have long been recognized as exerting different
      biological effects, including antioxidant, antiallergic,
      antiinflammatory, antiviral, antiproliferative, and
      anticarcinogenic effects [8–10]. Considering that these
      age-related neurological disorders are multifactorial and that no
      drugs are available to stop their progression, intervention
      strategies using phytochemicals have been proposed as an
      alternative form of treatment for their prevention. Among
      phytochemicals, sulforaphane
      (isothiocyanato-4-(methylsulfinyl)-butane) (SF) has been
      demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects in several
      experimental paradigms. Reports in the literature have shown a
      pleiotropic role of this natural compound, thanks to its ability
      to address different targets and to modulate different pathways in
      neuronal/glial cells.<br>
      <br>
      In this review, we will discuss the most recent experimental
      evidence on the role of SF in counteracting brain oxidative stress
      in both acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. SF
      bioavailability is also considered, since it is a fundamental
      aspect in the evaluation of the “in vivo” bioactivity of a
      nutritional compound.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Sulforaphane Bioavailability</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Various Brassica vegetables and especially broccoli contain
      glucoraphanin. Following cutting or chewing, it is hydrolyzed into
      the corresponding isothiocyanate SF either by the plant
      thioglucosidase myrosinase or by bacterial thioglucosidases in the
      colon [11].<br>
      <br>
      Because of its lipophilicity [12] and molecular size, SF is likely
      to passively diffuse into the enterocytes [13]. After absorption,
      SF is conjugated with glutathione (SF-GSH) by
      glutathione-S-transferase (GST) leading to maintenance of a
      concentration gradient and facilitating a fast passive absorption
      into the cell [14]. It is metabolized via the mercapturic acid
      pathway, producing predominantly cysteinylglycine (SF-CG),
      cysteine (SF-Cys), and N-acetyl-cysteine (SF-NAC) conjugates that
      are excreted in the urine [15].<br>
      <br>
      Pharmacokinetic studies in both humans and animals showed that the
      plasma concentration of SF and its metabolites increased rapidly,
      reaching a maximum between 1 and 3 h after administration of
      either SF, glucosinolate, or broccoli [16–21]. In particular,
      Veeranki and colleagues [21] reported the ability of SF and its
      metabolites to reach different tissues in the gastrointestinal and
      genitourinary tracts and other organs such as liver, pancreas,
      lung, and heart, in vastly different concentrations and that
      bioactivity, in terms of induction of cytoprotective phase II
      enzymes, may differ significantly among organs. Both plasma and
      tissue levels of these SF metabolites are rapidly eliminated
      through urinary excretion within 12–24 h reflecting the rapid
      elimination of SF. The in vivo bioactivity of each SF metabolite
      is still unclear, although many in vitro studies have shown the
      ability of SF-Cys, and SF-NAC metabolites to exert some
      bioactivity [22–24]. These data suggest the hypothesis that
      repeated consumption of SF or cruciferous vegetables is required
      to maintain the SF metabolite concentration in tissues.<br>
      <br>
      Interestingly, more recent SF bioavailability studies in human
      subjects consuming broccoli showed its bioconversion into
      isothiocyanate erucin (isothiocyanato-4-(methylthio)-butane) (ER),
      a sulfide analog [25, 26]. Whether this conversion from SF to ER
      is important for the health promoting effects of glucosinolate
      still remains to be determined although some reports provide a
      glimpse into the possibility of differing activities between these
      two isothiocyanates [27–29].<br>
      <br>
      In order to exert protective effects towards neurodegenerative
      disorders or improve brain function, SF must traverse the
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulate in the central nervous
      system (CNS). As reported in the following sections of this
      review, various studies in animal models of neurodegeneration
      suggest the ability of SF to reach CNS and to display protective
      effects at this level. In this context, Jazwa et al. [30]
      demonstrated in mice that after SF gavage, SF is able to cross the
      BBB and to accumulate in cerebral tissues such as the ventral
      midbrain and striatum, with a maximum increase and disappearance
      after 15 min and 2 h, respectively. Interestingly, Clarke et al.
      [19] also detected SF-GSH, SF-Cys and SF-NAC metabolites, but not
      SF alone, in the CNS in a similar experimental in vivo model after
      2 h and 6 h. However, the authors suggest that low levels of the
      various SF metabolites recorded in the CNS indicate their poor
      ability to cross the BBB. These results show the ability of SF to
      quickly reach the CNS and the potential contribution of SF
      metabolites to prolong the presence of SF at this level because
      they are unstable under physiological conditions and readily
      dissociate back to SF [21, 30].<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Protective Effects of Sulforaphane against Oxidative Stress</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Oxidative stress results from an imbalance of
      pro-oxidant/antioxidant homeostasis that leads to an abnormal
      production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen
      species (RNS). The main ROS/RNS involved in neurodegeneration are
      superoxide anion radical (O2•−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the
      highly reactive hydroxyl radical (•OH), and nitric oxide (NO) that
      can react with superoxide anion to produce peroxynitrite [31]. At
      high levels, ROS can react with different cell molecules, causing
      damage to DNA, lipids, and proteins and modulate intracellular
      signaling pathways, leading to cellular degeneration and
      apoptosis. ROS can also initiate proinflammatory pathways, further
      exacerbating the deleterious oxidized environment. The brain is
      particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress because of its high
      oxygen consumption, high content of oxidizable polyunsatured fatty
      acids, and low antioxidant defense capacities especially in aging
      brains [32–34]. Oxidative stress is involved in many
      neurodegenerative diseases and is a proposed mechanism for
      age-related degenerative processes as a whole [35, 36]. Numerous
      studies have provided compelling evidence that oxidative stress is
      an important causative factor in PD [2, 37–40], AD [41–43],
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [44, 45], and multiple
      sclerosis (MS) [46, 47].<br>
      <br>
      Cells possess a complex network of nonenzymatic and enzymatic
      components to counteract oxidative stress. GSH is the major
      nonenzymatic regulator of intracellular redox homeostasis. On the
      other hand, enzymatic antioxidants include glutathione
      S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione
      peroxidase (GPx), NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1),
      thioredoxin reductase (TR), heme oxygenase 1 (HO1),
      peroxiredoxins, and many others. These enzymes are now recognized
      as primary defense mechanisms against many degenerative and
      chronic disease conditions [48]. These antioxidants and
      cytoprotective enzymes are regulated by a common mechanism that
      involves two proteins: nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2
      (Nrf2) and Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) [49, 50].
      Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by
      its repressor protein Keap1 [51]. Keap1 contains several reactive
      cysteine residues that serve as sensors of the intracellular redox
      state. Nrf2 is released from Keap1 upon oxidative or covalent
      modification of thiols in some of these cysteine residues. Nrf2
      translocates to the nucleus where it heterodimerizes with small
      Maf proteins before binding to the antioxidant responsive element
      (ARE) [35, 52] within the promoter regions of many cytoprotective
      genes [36]. In addition, Nrf2 has a key role against inflammation
      thanks to its ability to antagonize the transcription factor
      nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) which regulates the expression of
      inflammatory genes [37].<br>
      <br>
      ARE induction by chemical activators has been shown to protect
      neuronal cell lines against various oxidative damages induced by
      dopamine, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and glutamate [38–40]. SF has
      been demonstrated to increase many ARE-dependent antioxidant
      enzymes in different cell systems [41–43], such as GR, GPx,
      glutaredoxin (GLRX), thioredoxin (TX), TR, HO1, and NQO1. It has
      been shown that SF directly interacts with Keap1 by covalent
      binding to its thiol groups [44].<br>
      <br>
      Negi et al. [45] demonstrated that SF increased the expression of
      Nrf2 and of downstream targets HO-1 and NQO-1 in Neuro2a cells and
      the sciatic nerve of diabetic animals. SF was also effective in
      counteracting oxidative stress induced by antipsychotic drugs in
      human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells, increasing GSH levels and
      inducing NQO1 activity [46].<br>
      <br>
      Sulforaphane prevented oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in
      rat striatal cultures by raising the intracellular GSH content via
      an increase in γ-GCS expression induced by the activation of the
      Nrf2-antioxidant responsive element pathway [47].<br>
      <br>
      It has also been observed that oxidative stress can inactivate
      peroxiredoxins, an important family of cysteine-based antioxidant
      enzymes that exert neuroprotective effects in several models of
      neurodegeneration [48, 53–55]. Interestingly, in both neurons and
      glia, SF treatment upregulates sulfiredoxin, an enzyme responsible
      for reducing hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins [56]. SF pretreatment
      also leads to attenuation of the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) induced
      ROS production thanks to the increase in mRNA levels and enzymatic
      activity of NQO1 in DAergic cell lines CATH.a and SK-N-BE(2)C
      [57].<br>
      <br>
      Kraft et al. [58] demonstrated the importance of ARE activation in
      astrocytes of a mixed primary culture system. They observed that
      SF induced an ARE-mediated genetic response that is highly
      selective for astrocytes over neurons and conveys neuroprotection
      from oxidative insults initiated by H2O2 or nonexcitotoxic
      glutamate toxicity. Innamorato et al. [59] observed a direct
      association between the protective effect of SF against oxidative
      stress induced by lipopolysaccharide with HO-1 induction in BV2
      microglial cells.<br>
      <br>
      Oxidative stress induces Ca2+-dependent opening of the
      mitochondrial inner membrane permeability transition pore (PTP),
      causing bioenergetic failure and subsequent death in different
      cell models, including those related to acute brain injury
      [60–62]. Intraperitoneal injection of rats with a nontoxic level
      of SF resulted in resistance of isolated nonsynaptic brain
      mitochondria to peroxide-induced PTP opening [63], and this could
      contribute to the neuroprotection observed with SF.<br>
      <br>
      BBB damage following oxidative stress has been extensively
      investigated [64]. Postinjury induction of Nrf2-driven genes by SF
      treatment attenuated the loss of endothelial cells and tight
      junction proteins and reduced BBB permeability and cerebral edema
      [65]. Another study demonstrated that SF administration reduced
      BBB permeability in a rat subarachnoid hemorrhage model likely
      through the antioxidative effects of the activated Nrf2-ARE
      pathway [66].<br>
      <br>
      Less attention has been focused on oxidative damage at the
      blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier (BCSFB) located at the
      choroid plexus (CP) epithelium. Even modest changes in the CPs may
      have a marked impact on the brain. For example, changes in CP
      function have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease [67]. A study
      by Xiang et al. [68] demonstrated that SF can protect the BCSFB in
      vitro from damage caused by H2O2 and reduced H2O2-induced cell
      death in primary CP epithelial cells and a CP cell line Z310.<br>
      <br>
      Summarizing, the observed protective effects of SF against brain
      oxidative stress are mainly associated with Nrf2 activation and
      the resulting upregulation of antioxidant cytoprotective proteins
      and elevation of GSH (Figure 1).<br>

      <b>4. Protective Effects of Sulforaphane against Acute
        Neurodegeneration</b><b><br>
      </b><b>4.1. Ischemic Brain Injury</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>The pathophysiology of ischemic brain injury involves various
      biochemical mechanisms, such as glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity,
      the generation of ROS, apoptosis, and inflammation [69]. In
      adults, brain ischemic insults typically result from stroke or
      cardiac arrest, while in infants, cerebral ischemia is mediated by
      complications during labor and delivery, resulting in neonatal
      hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. In both groups, restoring blood
      flow to the ischemic brain is essential to salvage neurons.
      However, reperfusion itself causes additional and substantial
      brain damage referred to as “reperfusion injury.”<br>
      <br>
      In a neonatal hypoxia/ischemia brain injury model, Ping et al.
      [70] observed that SF significantly increased Nrf2 and HO-1
      expression which was accompanied by reduced infarct volume. In
      particular, SF treatment reduced the number of apoptotic neurons,
      activated macroglia, and some oxidative parameters such as the
      amount of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine and MDA level. In a similar
      model of ischemia/reperfusion induced by either oxygen and glucose
      deprivation or hemin in immature mouse hippocampal neurons, SF
      treatment activated the ARE/Nrf2 pathway of antioxidant defenses
      and protected immature neurons from delayed cell death [71]. Zhao
      et al. [69] demonstrated that delayed administration of a single
      dose of SF significantly decreased cerebral infarct volume in rats
      following focal ischemia. Moreover, in rat cortical astrocytes, SF
      treatment before or after oxygen and glucose deprivation
      significantly reduced cell death, stimulating the Nrf2 pathway of
      antioxidant gene expression [72]. In contrast to these data,
      Porritt et al. [73] showed that SF treatment initiated after
      photothrombosis-induced permanent cerebral ischemia in mice did
      not interfere with key cellular mechanisms involved in tissue
      damage. The authors suggest that the small volume of infarcted
      cortical tissue resulting from the photothrombosis injury might
      result in the generation of relatively smaller amounts of ROS and
      may explain why they did not observe any neuroprotection after SF
      administration. In addition, Srivastava et al. [74] recorded that
      the pretreatment of rats with SF decreased the nuclear
      accumulation of Nrf2 following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
      injury. On this topic, the authors speculate that rapid
      accumulation of SF in the brain and subsequent upregulation of
      Nrf2 and antioxidant enzymes may reduce the need for the later
      adaptive increase in Nrf2 expression following stroke.<br>
      <br>
      These lines of evidence indicate that SF may counteract
      ischemia/reperfusion due to its ability to modulate Nrf2 and
      intracellular redox signaling.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4.2. Traumatic Brain Injury</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is defined as damage to the brain
      caused by external mechanical force [75]. Survivors of TBI are
      left with long-term disabilities, and even a mild TBI can leave
      people with cognitive impairments, difficulty in concentrating,
      headaches, and fatigue [76]. TBI is a complex disease process [77]
      that results in early phase of mechanical damage of brain tissue
      and a secondary phase of cellular and molecular events that cause
      oxidative damage and brain cell death [78, 79]. Despite advances
      in prevention measures, surgical, and diagnostic techniques, no
      pharmacological treatment has so far been found to confer
      neuroprotection by targeting secondary injury mechanisms [76].<br>
      <br>
      Recent studies in a rat model of TBI showed that postinjury
      administration of SF reduces the BBB impairment and cerebral edema
      after TBI [65, 80]. In particular, Zhao et al. [80] showed that SF
      attenuated aquaporin-4 (AQP4) channel loss in the injury core and
      further increased AQP4 protein levels in the penumbra region at
      24 h and 3 days following TBI. In contrast to the early increase
      of AQP4 levels, the decrease in cerebral edema was observed only
      at 3 days, confirming the important role of AQP4 channels to clear
      the water in excess and to maintain the brain water homeostasis
      [81]. However, the authors suggest that the observed SF
      neuroprotective effect may be due to a combination of mechanisms
      that include decreased BBB permeability, enhanced cell survival,
      and/or increased AQP4 channel levels. In particular, the
      restoration of AQP4 channel activity prevented the impaired
      clearance of extracellular potassium with neuronal depolarization
      and glutamate release. It should be noted that the glutamate
      release is involved in an important sequel of CNS injury [80]. In
      the same rat model of TBI, Zhao et al. [65] demonstrated that
      postinjury administration of SF preserved BBB function through the
      reduction of endothelial cell markers and tight junction protein
      loss. These protective effects were mediated by the activity of
      Nrf2. In particular, SF increased the expression of Nrf2-driven
      cytoprotective genes such as GSTα3, GPx, and HO-1 in the parietal
      cortex and brain microvessels. More recent papers confirmed these
      findings in both rat and mice models of TBI [82]. Interestingly,
      Dash et al. [83] showed that in addition to vascular protection of
      SF, postinjury SF treatment preserved neurological function in
      injured animals. This improvement was demonstrated by enhanced
      learning and memory and by improved performance in a working
      memory task. The authors propose that the ability of SF to improve
      the hippocampal- and prefrontal cortex-dependent cognitive
      function could be ascribed to its ability to protect the neurons
      and other cell types of the neurovascular unit from the oxidative
      damage elicited by TBI. Taken together, these findings suggest
      that SF may protect against the various pathophysiological
      consequences of TBI and other neurological traumatic injuries. On
      this topic, a recent study demonstrated that SF provides
      neuroprotective effects in the spinal cord after contusive injury
      [84].<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. Protective Effects of Sulforaphane against Chronic
        Neurodegeneration</b><b><br>
      </b><b>5.1. Alzheimer's Disease</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative
      disease that accounts for most cases of dementia experienced by
      older people and is characterized by a progressive decline in
      memory and impairment of at least one other cognitive function
      [85].<br>
      <br>
      This neurodegenerative disease is characterized by the
      accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides that result in
      oxidative damage, inflammation and increased intracellular calcium
      levels [86, 87]. Two major hallmarks of AD are the extracellular
      aggregation of Aβ peptides and the intracellular
      precipitation/aggregation of hyperphosphorylated Tau (forming
      neurofibrillary tangles) protein [87]. In particular, Aβ 1–40 and
      Aβ 1–42 peptides, produced by the cleavage of the precursor
      protein, can exist in multiple aggregation forms, including
      soluble oligomers or protofibrils, and insoluble fibrils, which
      are responsible for various pathological effects [88, 89].<br>
      <br>
      Several studies showed that increased oxidative stress, the
      impaired protein-folding function of the endoplasmatic reticulum,
      and deficient proteasome- and autophagic-mediated clearance of
      damaged proteins accelerated the accumulation of Aβ peptides and
      Tau protein in AD [90, 91].<br>
      <br>
      In this context, Kwak et al. [92] demonstrated that the
      neuroprotective effects of SF against oxidative stress, in terms
      of protein carbonyl formation and cytotoxicity elicited by
      hydrogen peroxide, could be ascribed to its ability to induce
      proteasome expression in murine neuroblastoma Neuro2A cells. In
      similar cellular models, Park et al. [93] confirmed the ability of
      SF to enhance the proteasome activities and to protect the
      neuronal cells from Aβ1–42-mediated cytoxicity. More recent
      studies reported that SF induced the expression of heat shock
      protein 27, demonstrating that SF-stimulated proteasome activity
      may contribute to cytoprotection [94]. These data suggest that
      induction of proteasome by SF may facilitate the clearance of the
      Aβ1–42 peptides and lead to the improvement of protein misfolding
      in AD. Kim et al. [95] investigated the potential neuroprotective
      effects of SF in an Aβ1–40 peptide-induced AD acute mouse model.
      In particular, they recorded the ability of SF to ameliorate the
      cognitive function impairment although it did not directly
      interact with Aβ. These findings reinforce the indirect
      neuroprotective effects of SF against Aβ toxicity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>5.2. Parkinson's Disease</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative
      disease with progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the
      substantia nigra pars compacta and with accumulation of neuronal
      inclusions known as Lewy bodies [96]. The exact etiology of PD
      remains to be fully elucidated, but the most reliable theories
      propose either an environmental [97, 98] or a genetic [99] origin,
      or a combination of both. Genetic studies have demonstrated that
      α-synuclein protein, a principal component of Lewy body inclusions
      [100], is a key participant in the pathogenesis of this disorder
      [101–103]. The exact biological function of α-synuclein and the
      mechanism by which mutations in this gene lead to neuron loss are
      still not clear, although it has been observed that an excess of
      α-synuclein protein can cause DA neuron loss [104].<br>
      <br>
      Overwhelming evidence indicates that oxidative damage induced by
      ROS participates in the progression of DA neurons. In particular,
      the metabolism of dopamine (DA) might be responsible for the high
      basal levels of oxidative stress in the SN. Autooxidation of
      dopamine leads to the formation of neurotoxic species such as
      electrophilic DA quinone and ROS including superoxide anion (O2•)
      and H2O2 [105]. DA quinone is also thought to cause mitochondrial
      dysfunction [106] and to mediate α-synuclein-associated
      neurotoxicity in PD by covalently modifying α-synuclein monomer
      [107] and by stabilizing the toxic protofibrillar α-synuclein
      [108].<br>
      <br>
      Using a Drosophila model of α-synucleinopathy, Trinh et al. [109]
      observed that the neuronal death accompanying α-synuclein
      expression is enhanced by loss-of-function mutations in genes
      involved in the phase II detoxification pathway, specifically,
      glutathione metabolism. This neuronal loss can be overcome by
      pharmacological inducers, including SF, that increase glutathione
      synthesis or glutathione conjugation activity. They also observed
      similar neuroprotective effects of SF in Drosophila parkin
      mutants, another loss-of-function model of PD.<br>
      <br>
      Several in vitro studies showed that SF was able to significantly
      reduce DA quinone levels in dopaminergic cell lines, such as
      CATH.a and SK-N-BE(2)C, as well as in mesencephalic dopaminergic
      neurons, evoked by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and BH4 [110]. In
      particular, Han et al. [57] demonstrated that SF can protect
      dopaminergic cells from the cytotoxicity of 6-OHDA and BH4 by
      removal of intracellular DA quinone, because NQO1 enzyme activity
      and mRNA level are increased by SF treatment and quinone-modified
      proteins are decreased.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, DA quinone may yield neurotoxic species following its
      reaction with cellular thiols to form the 5-S-cysteinyl-dopamine
      (CysDA) [111–113]. CysDA adducts have been reported in human brain
      tissue and are elevated in the brains of patients suffering from
      PD [114]. We have demonstrated that SF is able to protect primary
      cortical neurons against CysDA-induced injury. In particular, we
      found that the protection exerted by SF against this neurotoxin is
      linked to the activation of ERK1/2, to the associated release of
      Nrf2 from Keap1, and to a subsequent increase in the expression
      and activity of specific detoxifying phase II enzymes [115].
      Moreover, we demonstrated that SF prevented the dopaminergic-like
      neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell death, in terms of apoptosis and
      necrosis, induced by oxidant compounds, such as H2O2 and 6-OHDA,
      by its abilities to increase endogenous GSH, enzymes involved in
      GSH metabolism including GST and GR, and to normalize the
      intracellular redox status (Figure 2) [116]. Interestingly, we
      recorded similar in vitro neuroprotective effects also with the
      erucin generated by bioconversion of the SF suggesting a
      neuroprotective role of SF metabolites in PD [117].<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2<br>
      <br>
      SF prevents 6-OHDA-induced ROS formation in SH-SY5Y cells.
      Representative images of SH-SY5Y cells incubated with SF for 24 h
      and then treated with 6-OHDA for 3 h. At the end of incubation,
      ROS formation was determined by fluorescence probe, ...<br>
      <br>
      Deng et al. [118] observed that SF inhibited 6-OHDA-induced
      cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells through increasing Nrf2 nuclear
      translocation and HO-1 expression in a PI3 K/Akt-dependent manner.
      Further, other authors confirmed that Nrf2 activation by SF may
      play an important role in DA neuron protection against
      6-OHDA-induced toxicity in rat organotypical nigrostriatal
      cocultures [119]. As regards in vivo neurodegeneration models,
      Jazwa et al. [30] demonstrated that SF induced an Nrf2-dependent
      phase II response in the basal ganglia and protected against
      nigral dopaminergic cell death, astrogliosis, and microgliosis in
      the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model of
      PD. Further, we reported the ability of SF to exert
      neuroprotective effects on DA neurons in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. In
      particular, these effects may be attributed to SF ability to
      enhance GSH levels and its dependent enzymes, including GST and
      GR, and to modulate neuronal survival pathways, such as ERK1/2
      [120].<br>
      <br>
      <b>6. Conclusions</b><br>
      <br>
      Several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the ability
      of SF to prevent various neurodegenerative processes that underlie
      stroke, traumatic brain injury, AD, and PD. The ability of SF to
      exert neuroprotective effects in different acute and chronic
      neurodegenerative diseases could be ascribed to its peculiar
      ability to activate the Nrf2/ARE pathway. Nrf2 is a recent
      therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases because it
      regulates several genes that have been implicated in protection
      against neurodegenerative conditions [121, 122]. In this context,
      SF presents many advantages, such as good pharmacokinetics and
      safety after oral administration as well as the potential ability
      to penetrate the BBB and deliver its neuroprotective effects in
      the central nervous system [123]. Based on these considerations,
      SF appears to be a promising compound with neuroprotective
      properties that may play an important role in preventing
      neurodegenerative diseases.<br>

      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a method to extract sulforaphane,
      and more particularly to a multifunction sulforaphane extracted
      from broccoli sprouts in Alkyl methods.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background technique</b><br>
      <br>
      Sulforaphane also called sulforaphane, formula C6H11NOS2,
      iso-thiocyanate derivative, relative molecular mass The amount of
      177.29, is a potent anti-cancer substances vegetables, which are
      more present in cruciferous vegetables, and cruciferous to
      Broccoli with higher levels, it turned broccoli broccoli seed and
      seedling period were higher than those of mature vegetables. US
      Johns Paul Talalay Hopkins University School of Medicine published
      proof, broccoli sprouts (broccoli sprouts) in anti-cancer
      compounds The content of sulforaphane than mature broccoli
      (broccoli) 20-30 times more. British scientists in early 1997 once
      The results show that the anti-cancer vegetables, broccoli and
      Brussels sprouts contain very rich in glucose iso cyanate salts
      Sulphur The auxiliary compounds. Gluconeogenesis from Sulphur
      cyanate decomposes a sulforaphane, and separating from broccoli
      with Sulforaphane growth gene DNA material, this material
      implanted in a variety of cabbage and radish, will help people to
      cancer cells Resistance cells and reduce the risk of cancer.
      Brassica Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
      Chemooprotection Lab found Broccoli contains a lot of iso cyanate
      Sulphur and Sulphur these iso cyanate excitable Live body's own
      anti-cancer substances "Phase Two Enzymes". This enzyme can
      neutralize suspected carcinogen, prevent carcinogens Mass
      destruction of healthy genes within cells. Japan's Agriculture
      Research Institute also said isothiocyanate can prevent melanoma
      cancer Growth. Among them, the most dynamic sulforaphane is a
      class of isothiocyanates, which have anti-cancer effects of breast
      cancer in rats Obtained sufficient proof.<br>
      <br>
      The prior art, the preparation method sulforaphane mainly chemical
      and enzymatic. Chemical method is through chemical synthesis
      Methods. Stereochemistry in synthesis of chiral synthesis method,
      this method from the perspective of stereochemistry to produce
      sulforaphane, Process is simple, but difficult to control, it is
      seldom used. Sulforaphane, existing research enzymatic production
      are from the cruciferous vegetables Before sulforaphane extracted

      Compared with the prior art, the invention has the following
      advantages:<br>
      (1)<br>
      <br>
      (1) The present inventors have found creative with broccoli
      sprouts growing increase in the number of days for which the body
      content of sulforaphane first accumulator Volume increases and
      then decreases, while the content of sulforaphane to grow 6 to 10
      days of broccoli sprouts is maintained at a high level, Especially
      in growth to a maximum of sulforaphane content on the 7th day of
      broccoli sprouts. Therefore, the growth of 6 to 10 days to select
      Zealand flower bud Seedling vegetables as raw materials can
      effectively improve the extraction yield of sulforaphane.<br>
      (2)<br>
      <br>
      (2) different non-polar organic solvent has a great influence on
      the extraction rate of sulforaphane from the chemical structure
      sulforaphane Constructions can be seen by the sulforaphane
      glucosinolate, sulfonic acid oxime and a side chain, whose choice
      of solvent extraction Can be used ether, methylene chloride, ethyl
      acetate and chloroform extraction rate of sulforaphane organic
      solvent with a dielectric constant Increases increases,
      dichloromethane as extraction solvent extraction rate greater
      degree higher than the ether, ethyl acetate and chloroform,
      because This present invention extraction agent sulforaphane
      choice dichloromethane. For dichloromethane toxicity, since the
      compound has a very Good volatility, and the rate of photolysis
      quickly, the initial degradation product of phosgene and carbon
      monoxide, and then reconverted to carbon Dioxide and hydrochloric
      acid. So that it can be completely removed in the process of
      follow-up treatment will not cause accumulation in the product.
