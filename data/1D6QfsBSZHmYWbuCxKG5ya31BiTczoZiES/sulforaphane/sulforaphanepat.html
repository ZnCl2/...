      The invention relates to a method for extracting sulforaphane from
      broccoli, and belongs to the field of sulforaphane. The method
      comprises the following steps: performing variation on escherichia
      coli to obtain escherichia coli producing a glucosinolate enzyme;
      culturing variated escherichia coli; performing treatment and
      ultrasonic extraction on the broccoli to obtain an extracting
      solution; performing enzymolysis, adding sodium hydroxide, normal
      hexane and the like to remove impurities of oil grease, metal
      ions, proteins and the like so as to obtain a glucose sulforaphane
      glycoside solution; fermenting the escherichia coli; adding
      glucose sulforaphane glycoside into the fermentation liquor for
      reacting; performing centrifugal separation, CO2 ultra-critical
      extraction, normal-pressure distillation and low-temperature
      vacuum freeze drying to obtain sulforaphane. The prepared
      sulforaphane has high yield and high purity, and can be applied to
      large-scale production, compared with the conventional method, the
      production time is shortened by 6-8 hours, and the purity is over
      95 percent.<br>

      Sulforaphane is an isothiocyanate with antimicrobial and
      anticarcinogenic properties, is found in a wide variety of plants
      of the genus Brassica oleracea, the most important among them
      being broccoli and cabbage. The present invention describes a
      method for the extraction, identification and quantification of
      sulphoraphane edible portions of broccoli and cabbage leaves by
      high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The sample
      preparation for quantification of sulforaphane includes the
      conversion of glucoraphanin to sulforaphane (45 +- 2 DEG C for 2.5
      h), extracted with dichloromethane, purification of the extract by
      solid-phase extraction columns, and detection by HPLC-UV. The
      sulforaphane concentration in broccoli plants was found within the
      range of from about 196 microg/g DW (whole head) to about 499
      microg/g DW (inflorescences). Red cabbage plants showed higher
      values of sulforaphane ((101.99 microg/g DW) than those of green
      cabbage plants (7.58 microg/g DW). The characteristic me thod of

      process comprises the following steps of: milling Broccoli seed,
      degreasing, carrying out enzymatic hydrolysis, carrying out freeze
      drying, carrying out supercritical CO2 extraction, and separating
      to obtain an isorhodanate extract which is rich in benzyl
      isorhodanate and sulforaphane. The product is safe and nontoxic,
      has no side-effect, and can be used as a product ingredient of
      food, health food and medicines. As the supercritical CO2
      extraction technology provided by the invention replaces a
      traditional solvent extraction technology, the yield of

      The extraction of sulforaphane from broccoli seed extract
      containing glucoraphanin, comprises hydrolyzing the extract, and
      extracting carbohydrates and lipids in the hydrolyzed extract, by
      a water (1:1 weight ratio) containing sulforaphane. The extraction

      The invention provides a synthetic method for sulforaphane and
      belongs to the field of drug synthesis. The method comprises the
      following steps that: after amino in 4-amino-1-butanol is
      protected by Boc groups, hydroxy in 4-amino-1-butanol is changed
      into methanesulfonyl ester by methanesulfonyl chloride, and then
      the resultant reacts with sodium methyl mercaptide to produce
      4-methylthio butyl-1-tert-butoxycarbonylamide; Boc protective
      groups are removed under acidic condition to obtain
      4-methylthio-1-butylamine; 4-methylthio-1-butylamine reacts with
      carbon disulfide for one hour in the presence of triethylamine and
      p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is added for treatment for half an hour
      to produce 4-methylthio butyl-1-isothiocyanate; and at last
      4-methylthio butyl-1-isothiocyanate is oxidized by m-CPBA to
      produce sulforaphane. According to the invention, complex
      hydrazinolysis of phthalimide in aftertreatment is avoided and
      toxic thiophosgene is not needed in the preparation of
      isothiocyanate; overall yield of sulforaphane is 64%,
      substantially higher than the overall yield of 8% reported in
      literature; the whole preparation process is simple and
      time-saving and is suitable for large scale production.<br>
