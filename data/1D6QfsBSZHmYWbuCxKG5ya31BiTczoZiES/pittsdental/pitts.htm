      could spell the end of the dreaded filling as it prepares damaged
      enamel and then uses a tiny electric current to push calcium and
      minerals into the tooth<br>
      <br>
      The dreaded dentist’s drill could soon be a thing of the past
      thanks to a painless new tooth treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists will today unveil the device which allows decayed teeth
      to rebuild themselves without fillings and could be available in
      three years’ time.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Nigel Pitts, one of its creators, said: “The way we
      treat teeth today is not ideal. When we repair a tooth by putting
      in a filling, it enters a cycle of drilling and re-filling as
      ­ultimately each repair fails.<br>
      <br>
      “Not only is our device kinder to the patient and better for their
      teeth but it’s expected to be at least as cost-effective as
      current dental treatments.” Prof Pitts, of King’s College London,
      said the device also whitened teeth.<br>
      <br>
      The ­treatment, named Electrically Accelerated and Enhanced
      Remineralisation, prepares damaged enamel and then uses a tiny
      electric current to push calcium and minerals into the tooth.<br>
      <br>
      A firm called Reminova has been set up in Perth, Scotland, to
      introduce the treatment. It is the first company to emerge from
      King’s Dental Innovation and ­Translation Centre, which aims to
      bring such technology to market.<br>
      <br>
      King’s College is also part of MedCity, a project to make
      ­universities in the South East world leaders in life sciences.
      MedCity chairman Kit Malthouse said: “It’s brilliant to see the
      really creative research taking place at King’s making its way out
      of the lab so quickly”.<br>

          'time warp'</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Dentists could soon be giving your teeth a mild ‘time warp’ to
      encourage them to self-repair, thanks to a new device being
      developed by dental researchers. Reminova Ltd, a new spin-out
      company from King’s College London, aims to take the pain out of
      tooth decay treatment by electrically reversing the process to
      help teeth ‘remineralise’. <br>
      <br>
      With 2.3 billion sufferers annually, dental caries is one of the
      most common preventable diseases globally. Tooth decay normally
      develops in several stages, starting as a microscopic defect where
      minerals leach out of tooth. Minerals continue to move in and out
      of the tooth in a natural cycle, but when too much mineral is
      lost, the enamel is undermined and the tooth is said to have
      developed a caries lesion (which can later become a physical
      cavity). Dentists normally treat established caries in a tooth by
      drilling to remove the decay and filling the tooth with a material
      such as amalgam or composite resin.<br>
      <br>
      Reminova Ltd takes a different approach – one that re-builds the
      tooth and heals it without the need for drills, needles or
      amalgam. By accelerating the natural process by which calcium and
      phosphate minerals re-enter the tooth to repair a defect, the
      device boosts the tooth’s natural repair process. Dentistry has
      been trying to harness this process for the last few decades, but
      the King’s breakthrough means the method could soon be in use at
      the dentist’s chair.<br>
      <br>
      The two-step method developed by Reminova first prepares the
      damaged part of the enamel outer layer of the tooth, then uses a
      tiny electric current to ‘push’ minerals into the tooth to repair
      the damaged site. The defect is remineralised in a painless
      process that requires no drills, no injections and no filling
      materials. Electric currents are already used by dentists to check
      the pulp or nerve of a tooth; the new device uses a far smaller
      current than that currently used on patients and which cannot be
      felt by the patient.<br>
      <br>
      The technique, known as Electrically Accelerated and Enhanced
      Remineralisation (EAER), could be brought to market within three
      years.<br>
      <br>
      The company is the first spin-out from the King’s College London
      Dental Innovation and Translation Centre which was launched in
      January 2013. This centre was formed to take research and novel
      technologies and turn them into products, change practice and
      inform policy which will improve health and healthcare
      internationally.<br>
      <br>
      Reminova Ltd will be based in Perth, Scotland to benefit from the
      strong life sciences and dentistry base. It will commercialise the
      work of Professor Nigel Pitts and Dr Chris Longbottom, based in
      the Dental Institute at King’s College London. With a combined 80
      years’ experience in dentistry they have previously brought dental
      devices to market to detect tooth decay. The company was formed in
      collaboration with Innova Partnerships, who commercialise
      healthcare and life science enterprises.<br>

          BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL</b><br>

      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PITTS NIGEL // LONGBOTTOM
      CHRISTOPHER // CRAYSTON JOSEPH<br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract </b>-- According to the present invention, there is
      provided an apparatus for mineralising a biological material, the
      apparatus comprising an ultrasonic source, operable to generate an
      ultrasonic signal, an ultrasonic probe and one or more
      mineralising probes, operable to receive a mineralising agent,
      wherein the mineralising agent is transferred from at least one
      mineralising probe to the biological material using the ultrasonic
      signal. There is also provided a mineralisation agent and a method
      of mineralising a biological material, said method comprising the
      steps of: providing an ultrasound source, providing a mineralising
      agent, generating an ultrasonic signal from the ultrasound source,
      applying the ultrasonic signal and the mineralising agent to the
      biological material separately, sequentially or simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for
      mineralising biological material and in particular for
      re-mineralising demineralised and hypo-mineralised tissue, such as
      tooth or bone.<br>
      <br>
      Caries is the decay of tooth or bone. Dental caries (also known as
      dental decay, caries or carious lesions) is caused by acids
      produced by microbial enzymatic action on ingested carbohydrate.
      The acids decalcify (demineralise) the inorganic portion of the
      tooth initially creating a sub-surface lesion, the organic portion
      then disintegrates leading to the creation of a cavity. In
      dentistry, demineralisation of a tooth through the development of
      a carious lesion can be described in terms of the depth of the
      carious lesion.<br>
      <br>
      Dental caries is commonly treated by the removal of the decayed
      material in the tooth and the filling of the resultant hole
      (cavity) with a dental amalgam or other restorative material. In
      more severe cases, the entire tooth may be removed. Prior to
      lesion cavitation, it is possible to heal or reverse the tissue
      destruction by remineralising the caries lesions. However, this
      process works better where exogenous (e.g. salivary- or
      food-derived) proteins and lipids have been removed from the
      caries lesions.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that the level of tooth decay alters the electrical
      characteristics of a tooth. This arises because as minerals are
      lost the porosity of the tooth increases and the consequent
      increased numbers of ions within the pores increase the
      conductivity i.e. the electrical transport in the tooth.
      Consequently, demineralisation of a tooth will result in an<br>
      <br>
      enhancement of its charge transport properties. This may be
      manifested in a decrease in the potential difference which must be
      applied to a demineralised tooth, compared with a healthy tooth,
      in order to achieve a comparable current therethrough.
      Correspondingly, this may be manifested in an increased current
      measurable from a demineralised tooth, compared with a healthy
      tooth, on application of the same potential difference. These
      effects can be detected on application of a constant current or
      constant potential difference respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the impedance (which includes the DC resistance)
      can be monitored by using AC signals.<br>
      <br>
      There are a number of devices specifically designed to detect
      dental caries by the application of an alternating electrical
      current to a tooth using a probe or contact electrode and counter
      electrode. As described above, the main source of impedance in the
      circuit formed by the counter electrode and the probe is provided
      by the tooth and therefore changes to the impedance of the circuit
      give a measure of changes in the impedance of the tooth. This
      technique is described in international patent application
      WO97/42909.<br>
      <br>
      Iontophoresis is a non-invasive method of propelling a charged
      substance, normally a medication or a bioactive agent, using an
      electric current. It is known to use iontophoresis in transdermal
      drug delivery. Iontophoresis may also be used in conjunction with
      fluoride containing compounds to treat dentine hypersensitivity
      and to remineralise non-cavitated dental caries lesions.
      Iontophoresis devices typically include an active electrode
      assembly and a counter electrode assembly each coupled to opposite
      poles or terminals of a voltage source. The active agent can be
      cationic or anionic and the voltage source can be configured to
      apply the appropriate voltage polarity based upon the polarity of
      the active agent. The active agent may be stored in for example, a
      reservoir such as a cavity or in a porous structure or a gel.
      Ultrasound is a longitudinal pulse..It is known to use ultrasound
      for trans-dermal drug delivery -sonophoresis. In dentistry
      ultrasound is known generally for cleaning, e.g. removal of
      calculus from the external surface of teeth or debris from the
      pulp chamber and root canal inside a tooth during root canal
      treatment. Electrosonophoresis is a combination of iontophoresis
      and ultrasound.<br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved
      apparatus, system and method for mineralising biological material.
      In accordance with a first aspect of the invention there is
      provided apparatus for mineralising a biological material, the
      apparatus comprising an ultrasonic source, operable to generate an
      ultrasonic signal, an ultrasonic probe and one or more
      mineralising probes, operable to receive a mineralising agent,
      wherein the mineralising agent is transferred from at least one
      mineralising probe to the biological material using the ultrasonic
      signal.<br>
      <br>
      At least one mineralising probe may be the ultrasonic probe.<br>
      <br>
      According to one embodiment, the apparatus comprises an
      iontophoresis probe.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus of the present invention may utilise
      electrosonophoresis. The apparatus advantageously further
      comprises a first electrode and a second electrode and an
      electrical signal generator, operable to generate an electrical
      signal between the first and second electrodes, a detector,
      operable to detect the electrical response of the electrical
      signal between the first and second electrodes, and a controller
      operable to receive the detected electrical response and to
      control the ultrasonic signal relative thereto.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus advantageously further comprises a mineralising
      probe electrode and a modulator, operable to modulate the
      electrical signal between the mineralising probe electrode and the
      second electrode and thereby cause the transfer of mineralising
      agent to the biological material using the electrical signal.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the mineralising probe electrode is the first
      electrode.<br>
      <br>
      The controller is preferably operable to control modulation of the
      electrical signal relative to the detected electrical response.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus advantageously further comprises a reference
      electrode operable to control at least one of the modulation of
      the electrical signal and the ultrasonic signal.<br>
      <br>
      The controller advantageously comprises a first software module
      having a dataset which describes the characteristic electrical
      response of a sample biological material at various stages of
      mineralisation, and a second software module which compares said
      data with the detected electrical response and thereby determine
      any required modification of at least one of the electrical signal
      and ultrasonic signal.<br>
      <br>
      The second software module may apply a function which defines the
      relationship between mineralisation and the electrical response in
      order to compare said data with the detected electrical response
      and to thereby determine any required modification of at least one
      of the electrical signal and ultrasonic signal.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the second software module may apply a look-up
      table containing information on the electrical response of the
      biological material and its mineralisation in order to compare
      said data with the detected electrical response and to determine
      any required modification of at least one of the electrical signal
      and ultrasonic signal.<br>
      <br>
      The mineralising probe electrode advantageously transfers the
      mineralising agent to the biological material by iontophoresis.
      According to one embodiment, the mineralising probe electrode
      advantageously transfers the mineralising agent to the biological
      material by electrosonophoresis.<br>
      <br>
      When used in accordance with the present invention, ultrasound is
      generally used in the range of between about 20Hz to 200 MHz;
      typically from about 5 MHz to about 200MHz; suitably from about 10
      MHz to about 150 MHz; more suitably from about 100 MHz to about
      150 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      There is an inverse relationship between the ultrasound frequency
      and the particle size which may be applied to the biological
      material by the apparatus and method of the present invention. The
      higher the frequency of the ultrasound, the smaller the particle
      size which may be applied to the biological material by the
      apparatus and method of the present invention. Using a higher
      frequency of ultrasound allows a greater range of particle sizes
      to be utilised.<br>
      <br>
      The detector is advantageously operable to determine, from the
      electrical response, the presence of at least one of exogenous
      proteins and lipids on or in the biological material.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus may further comprise means for applying a
      conditioning agent.<br>
      <br>
      The conditioning agent may comprise at least one of an oxidising
      agent, de-proteinising agent and a de-lipidising agent. Generally
      the conditioning agent comprises more than one of an oxidising
      agent, de-proteinising agent and a de-lipidising agent, typically
      the conditioning agent comprises at least a de-proteinising agent
      and a de-lipidising agent.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus is advantageously operable to apply the ultrasonic
      signal and transfer the mineralising agent separately,
      sequentially or simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus is advantageously operable to apply the ultrasonic
      signal and the electrical signal separately, sequentially or
      simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus is advantageously operable to apply the modulated
      electrical signal and transfer the mineralising agent separately,
      sequentially or simultaneously. According to one embodiment, the
      apparatus is operable to apply the ultrasonic signal and an
      iontophoresis signal separately, simultaneously or sequentially
      and/or in combination. Generally the ultrasonic signal and the
      iontophoresis signal are applied simultaneously. The apparatus is
      advantageously adapted for use with hard tissue biological
      materials such as tooth and/or bone.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the operation of the apparatus of the present
      invention can be interrupted in order to re-apply the conditioning
      agent thereby removing exogenous proteins and/or lipids.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention there
      is provided a mineralising agent for use with apparatus, as
      described above, for mineralising biological material.<br>
      <br>
      The mineralising agent may comprise at least one of a source of
      calcium ions and a source of phosphate ions and source of hydroxyl
      ions (such as water), optionally in the presence of a source of
      fluoride ions. <br>
      Generally the mineralising agent comprises a source of calcium
      ions and a source of phosphate ions and a source of hydroxyl ions
      (such as water). Typically the mineralising agent comprises a
      source of calcium ions, a source of phosphate ions, water, and a
      source of fluoride ions.<br>
      <br>
      The mineralising agent may be in a form soluble in water or
      insoluble in water (in an aqueous dispersion) under the conditions
      generally used to operate the apparatus/conduct the method of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The mineralising agent may comprise casein phosphopeptide -
      amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) The mineralising agent may
      comprise calcium, phosphate, hydroxy l/water and fluoride.<br>
      <br>
      The mineralising agent may comprise casein phosphopeptide -
      amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate (CPP-ACFP). The mineralising
      agent suitably comprises one or more mineralisation enhancers.
      More suitably, the mineralising agent comprises two mineralisation
      enhancers, wherein one of the enhancers is a source of calcium
      ions and the other is a source of phosphate ions.<br>
      <br>
      The mineralising agent preferably comprises a calcium:phosphate
      ratio of between 1 :1 and 22:10. More preferably, the mineralising
      agent comprise a calcium:phosphate ratio of between 3:2 and 22:10.
      More preferably, the mineralisation agent comprises a<br>
      <br>
      calcium:phosphate ratio of approximately 10:6. Alternatively or
      additionally, at least one of the mineralisation enhancers may
      comprise strontium.<br>
      <br>
      The mineralisation agent advantageously comprises nano-particles,
      having an average particle diameter of less than 500nm, generally
      less than 100nm, typically less than 50nm, suitably less than
      10nm, more suitably from 1 to 10nm. According to one embodiment,
      the mineralisation agent consists of nano-particles.<br>
      <br>
      According to one embodiment, the average particle diameter of the
      mineralisation agent is 1 to 50nm.<br>
      <br>
      The use of a mineralisation agent comprising or consisting of
      nano-particles is believed to allow a greater proportion of the
      mineralisation agent to be forced into the biological tissue,
      promoting a more efficient mineralising method, and/or greater
      retention of the mineralisation agent in the biological tissue.<br>
      <br>
      The nano-particles typically comprise at least one of a source of
      calcium ions, a source of phosphate ions, a source of hydroxyl
      ions and a source of fluoride ions. Generally the nano- particles
      comprise calcium hydroxyapatite.<br>
      <br>
      According to a third aspect of the present invention there is
      provided a kit comprising apparatus for mineralising a biological
      material, as described above, and a mineralisation agent as
      described above. The kit may further comprise a conditioning
      agent.<br>
      <br>
      According to a fourth aspect of the present invention there is
      provided a method of mineralising a biological material,
      comprising the steps of: providing an ultrasound source, providing
      a mineralising agent, generating an ultrasonic signal from the
      ultrasound source, applying the ultrasonic signal and the
      mineralising agent to the biological material separately,
      sequentially or simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      The method of the present invention generally involves the use of
      the apparatus as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      According to one embodiment, the method may be involve
      electrosonophoresis.<br>
      <br>
      Whilst the inventors do not wish to be bound by theory, it is
      believed that the use of electrosonophoresis (the combination of
      ultrasound and iontophoresis), in a method of mineralising
      biological material allows a greater proportion of the
      mineralising agent to be forced into the biological material,
      rather than remaining on the surface of the biological material.
      This allows a more effective method of mineralisation. More
      mineralising agent is forced into the biological material in a
      shorter time period than equivalent methods using only
      iontophoresis. The use of electrosonophoresis is also believed to
      promote greater retention of the mineralising agent in the
      biological material, meaning that the mineralisation of the
      biological tissue lasts for longer than methods using only
      iontophoresis,<br>
      <br>
      The method may further comprise the step of conditioning the
      biological material prior to applying at least one of the
      ultrasonic signal and mineralising agent thereto. The step of
      conditioning comprises at least substantially removing at least
      one of protein and lipids from the biological material (generally
      substantially removing both of proteins and lipids from the
      biological material). The step of conditioning preferably
      comprises the application of at least one of a deproteinisation
      agent and a delipidisation agent.<br>
      <br>
      The method advantageously further comprises the steps of:
      providing a first electrode and a second electrode, an electrical
      signal generator and a controller; generating an electrical signal
      between the first and second electrodes; detecting the electrical
      response of the electrical signal, between the first and second
      electrodes; and controlling the ultrasonic signal relative to the
      detected electrical response.<br>
      <br>
      The method advantageously further comprises the steps of providing
      a mineralising probe; providing a modulator; modulating the
      electrical signal between the mineralising probe and the second
      electrode and thereby cause the transfer of mineralising agent to
      the biological material using the electrical signal.<br>
      <br>
      The mineralising probe may be provided by the first electrode.<br>
      <br>
      The method advantageously further comprises the step of
      controlling the modulation of the electrical signal relative to
      the detected electrical response.<br>
      The method advantageously further comprises the step of providing
      a reference electrode and controlling at least one of the
      modulation of the electrical signal and the ultrasonic from
      information derivable therefrom.<br>
      <br>
      The steps of controlling at least one of the ultrasonic signal and
      the electrical signal relative to the detected electrical response
      may comprise the steps of: comparing a dataset of characteristic
      electrical responses derived from a set of samples of biological
      material at various stages of mineralisation with the detected
      electrical response; and determining any required modification to
      at least one of the ultrasonic signal or electrical signal. The
      step of comparing the data set may comprise applying a function
      which defines the relationship between the mineralisation and the
      electrical response in order to compare said data with the
      detected electrical response.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the step of comparing the data set may comprise
      applying a look-up table containing information relating to the
      electrical response of the biological material and its
      mineralisation; and comparing the said data with the detected
      electrical response.<br>
      <br>
      The method may further comprise the step of detecting the presence
      of at least one of proteins (such as exongenous proteins) and
      lipids on or in the biological material from the detected
      electrical response; typically detecting the presence of proteins
      and lipids.<br>
      <br>
      The mineralising agent is generally as described above.<br>
      <br>
      The mineralising agent may comprise casein phosphopeptide -
      amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP)<br>
      <br>
      The mineralising agent may comprise calcium, phosphate,
      hydroxyl/water and fluoride.<br>
      <br>
      The mineralising agent may comprise casein phosphopeptide -
      amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate (CPP-ACFP).<br>
      <br>
      The mineralising agent may be substantially insoluble in water
      under the conditions used in the method of the present invention.
      According to one embodiment of the present invention, the
      mineralising agent remains in or on the bone/dental tissue to
      which is it applied for at least 3 months, generally at least six
      months, typically at least one year from application thereto.<br>
      <br>
      The mineralising agent advantageously comprises one or more
      mineralisation enhancers. More advantageously, the mineralising
      agent comprises two mineralisation enhancers, wherein one of the
      enhancers is a source of calcium ions and the other is a source of
      phosphate ions. The mineralising agent may comprise a
      calcium:phosphate ratio of between 1 :1 and 22:10.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the mineralising agent comprises a calcium:phosphate
      ratio of between 3:2 and 22:10. More preferably, the
      mineralisation agent comprises a calcium: phosphate ratio of
      approximately 10:6.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively or additionally, at least one of the enhancers may
      comprise strontium. The mineralisation agent advantageously
      comprises nano-particles. The nano-particles preferably comprise
      at least one of calcium, phosphate, hydroxyl and fluoride.<br>
      <br>
      The nano-particles may comprise calcium hydroxyapatite. The method
      is advantageously adapted for use in mineralising hard tissue such
      as tooth and/or bone.<br>

      The present invention provides an apparatus and method for
      mineralising a biological material. The invention is particularly
      suitable for remineralisation of teeth where decay by
      demineralisation has occurred or for occluding dental tubules to
      treat dentine hypersensitivity, or for tooth whitening or in the
      treatment of dental erosion. It will be appreciated that the
      apparatus and method described herein is not restricted to the
      remineralisation of teeth but can be used to mineralise other
      biological material but is particularly applicable to the
      mineralisation of hard tissue such as, for example, it may be used
      in the remineralisation of bones for the treatment of
      osteoporosis, osteopenia or periodontal disease.<br>
      <br>
      Generally the apparatus and method of the present invention
      involve electrosonophoresis.<br>
      <br>
      In preferred embodiments of the present invention, spatial imaging
      data or 3D structural information can be used to generate
      different characterising parameters, including, tracking changes
      (and/or relative changes) in grey- scale values (in micro-CT
      images) in a variety of different parallel vectors in any one of
      many different planes, to generate an average representation of
      the mineral density changes in the direction of those vectors. The
      averaging process is performed preferably over the whole volume of
      the lesion; and the resulting information therefrom is processed
      to calculate, amongst other parameters, the depth of the carious
      lesion in the direction of the pulp. In view of the complex
      spatial geometries of lesions, the image analysis technique
      provides substantially more information than that normally
      available to a dentist. Thus, it may be possible to determine
      other lesion parameters which may be more useful in characterising
      the loss of mineral density than the traditionally-used lesion
      depth parameter.<br>
      <br>
      As described previously, changes in the impedance and/or
      resistance of a tooth can be detected on the application of an AC
      signal or a DC constant current or constant potential difference.
      The application of a pulse or square- wave current or potential
      difference to a healthy or demineralised tooth also yields dynamic
      information from the plot of current (or potential) vs time.<br>
      <br>
      Figure la is a graph 1 of voltage against time which shows a
      pulsed voltage 3 of substantially constant magnitude. Figure lb is
      a graph of current against time which shows the current decay rate
      in response to the applied potential difference (voltage) pulse
      for a healthy tooth and one which has been demineralised. The
      curve 7 shows the current response for the healthy tooth and the
      curve 9 shows the response for the demineralised tooth.<br>
      <br>
      Using a mechanistic understanding of charge transport through a
      tooth and the effect of tooth demineralisation on tooth ionic
      conductivity, a relation may be formed between the mineral density
      profiles determined from the above-mentioned image processing
      technique and a measured temporal electrical response profile. The
      present invention forms the relation through image-analysis and
      electrical properties analysis of a large number of healthy teeth
      and teeth with carious lesions by establishing an analytical model
      which creates a mathematical function to describe this
      relationship.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the present invention may employ a look-up table
      between the measured electrical response data and average mineral
      density values (determined from the above image analysis
      techniques) obtained from the studies of the healthy and diseased
      teeth In establishing the above relation and/or look-up table,
      micro-CT techniques can be used in which data is calibrated
      against a plurality of phantoms, so as to ensure that the measured
      variation in grey scale values is actually representative of a
      change in mineral density though a tooth, as opposed to an
      aberrant effect (or imaging artefacts). The above process will be
      described in more detail below.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus of the present invention employs a feedback
      mechanism, wherein an electrical measurement (which may be AC or
      DC related) is made whilst a tooth is being remineralised by
      iontophoresis. The electrical measurement is related to the
      mineral density of a carious lesion in the tooth (through the
      above-mentioned relation and/or look-up table formed during an
      offline process) to calculate an appropriate control signal for
      the apparatus to optimally tune the iontophoretic process.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2a shows an embodiment of the method of the present
      invention which comprises the following steps. Step 0:<br>
      <br>
      A pre-step which involves calibrating the grey-scale values
      obtained from a micro-CT analysis (used in forming the mineral
      density values employed in the above- mentioned relation and/or
      look-up table) a plurality of phantoms (comprising a homogeneous
      isotropic material which substantially matches dental material)
      are scanned using a micro-CT device. In the present example, the
      phantoms comprise hydroxyapatite disks representing a particular
      material density.<br>
      <br>
      Step I:<br>
      <br>
      Following the micro-CT analysis of the phantoms alone, a plurality
      of healthy teeth and teeth with carious lesions are each subjected
      to a similar scanning process, together with the phantoms. The
      calculated mineral densities of the scanned teeth are processed
      using a known segmentation technique to identify the boundaries of
      any lesions therein. A profile of the mineral density is
      established within the boundaries determined by the segmentation
      process; and the mineral density profiles are related to a
      steady-state or temporal electrical measurement obtained from the
      same teeth.<br>
      <br>
      Step 2:<br>
      <br>
      During the application of an ultrasonic signal and generally,
      iontophoresis, a constant potential difference or current is
      applied to a tooth with a carious lesion 13. An electrical
      response function is measured 15 from the tooth under treatment;
      and the relation (and/or look-up table) established in Step 1 is
      used to determine 17 the mineral density of the carious lesion.<br>
      <br>
      Step 3:<br>
      <br>
      The mineral density range of the healthy tooth material proximal
      to the boundaries established during step 1 is determined 19. This
      is used to establish the desired degree of remineralisation
      required of the ultrasonic signal (and generally iontophoretic)
      treatment. Step 4:<br>
      <br>
      A change in the magnitude of the ultrasonic (and generally
      iontophoretic) signal is calculated 21 , the calculated change
      being sufficient to drive mineral into the lesion so that the
      mineral density of the lesion more closely matches that of the
      healthy dental material.<br>
      <br>
      In implementing the method of Figure 2a, the apparatus of Figure
      2b comprises a logic block 23, which in addition to receiving an
      indication of the desired change in the magnitude of the
      ultrasonic (and generally iontophoretic) signal (from Step 4),
      receives information regarding the time 25 over which the
      iontophoresis treatment has been operating. The logic block 23
      also receives additional protocol information 27 regarding times
      for example at which the ultrasonic (and generally iontophoresis)
      should be started or stopped (e.g. to allow the electrical probe
      to be cleaned and further conditioning agent 29 to be applied
      thereto). The apparatus according to the present invention may
      function to mineralise biological material either using ultrasound
      alone to propel mineralising agent into the biological material or
      a combination of ultrasound and iontophoresis. Figure 3a shows a
      first embodiment of an apparatus 31 for mineralising a biological
      material, in accordance with the present invention, comprising an
      ultrasonic probe 33 having a handle 35, a neck 37 and head 39. The
      ultrasonic probe 33 is connected to an ultrasound source 40 and a
      controller 41 , by cable 45, which in turn is connected to a
      second counter electrode 43 by cable 47. Electrode 43 may be a
      hand-held or mouth or lip "loop" electrode.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 3b shows a second embodiment of an apparatus 131 for
      mineralising a biological material, in accordance with the present
      invention, comprising an ultrasonic probe 133a having a handle
      135a, a neck 137a and head 139a. The apparatus further comprises
      an iontophoresis probe 133b, operable as a fist electrode, having
      a handle 135b, a neck 137b and a head 139b. The ultrasonic probe
      133a is connected to an ultrasound source 140 and a controller 141
      , by cable 145, which in turn is connected to a second counter
      electrode 143 by cable 147. Electrode 143 may be a hand-held or
      mouth or [Iota][iota][rho]'[Iota][omicron][omicron][rho]"
      electrode. The iontophoresis probe 133b is also electrically
      connected to the controller 141.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 4 shows, in more detail, the controller 41 which comprises
      a modulator 49 which adjusts the ultrasonic signal to the
      ultrasonic probe 33a (133a) and, if the iontophoresis probe 133b
      in accordance with the second embodiment is utilised, modulates
      the shape and/or frequency and/or amplitude of the waveform sent
      to the probe 133b.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 5a shows the ultrasonic probe 33 (133a), in more detail,
      wherein it has an ultrasonic waveguide 34 which extends through
      the handle 34 of the probe to the ultrasound source 40. Disposed
      between the head 39 (139a) and the ultrasound source 40 is a
      reservoir 55 (155a) for storing mineralising agent 57 (157a). In
      use, the mineralisation agent is propelled out from the reservoir
      55 (155a) through the head 39 (139a) of the probe 33 (133a) by the
      ultrasonic signal and into contact with the biological material
      such as, for example, a tooth or bone.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 5b shows the iontophoresis probe 133b, in more detail,
      wherein the cable 45 extends through the handle 135b of the probe
      133b to a reservoir 155b containing a mineralising agent 157b. In
      use, the mineralisation agent is propelled out from the reservoir
      155b, by the electrical signal (iontophoresis) through the head
      139b of the probe 133b and in to contact with the biological
      material such as, for example, a tooth or bone. In other
      embodiments of the present invention, the mineralising agent may
      be stored in other ways such as in a porous structure or a gel
      which may be applied directly to a tooth. In <br>
      embodiments of the present invention where the mineralising agent
      is stored in a chamber in the probe it can be introduced onto the
      probe surface by making the chamber of flexible material to allow
      the mineralising agent to be squeezed out. Alternatively, the
      chamber may have a plunger or similar component which pushes the
      mineralising agent out of the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      In order to prevent cross-infection the mineralising agent is
      typically held separately from the device or embodied as a
      detachable 'probe tip' which detachably attachable to the end of
      the probe.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 6 is a flow chart 61 which shows a method of the present
      invention in which the ultrasonic signal and (if iontophoresis is
      used) the waveform of the electrical signal in the circuit formed
      from the first (probe) electrode 33(133a and/or 133b) and the
      second counter electrode 43 (143) is controlled so as to transfer
      a mineralising agent to the biological material 63. The electrical
      response of the circuit is then detected 65 and the detected
      signal is analysed so as to determine whether or not the signal
      needs to be modified and, if so to what extent, in response to the
      detected electrical response of the circuit 67.<br>
      The following example of use of an embodiment of the present
      invention is given in relation to the remineralisation of teeth.
      The dentist identifies, within a patient, a specific tooth site
      which is to be remineralised. Thereafter a conditioning agent is
      applied and the site is cleansed to remove exogenous proteins
      and/or lipids from the site. The conditioning agent may be
      propelled into a hypo-mineralised or demineralised caries lesion,
      by iontophoresis, utilising the probe and counter electrodes, to
      optimise the disruption and removal of the exogenous protein
      and/or lipid content.<br>
      <br>
      The probe 33 (133a/133b) is inserted into the mouth of the patient
      and on to the tooth site. The counter electrode 43 (143) is
      connected to the patient. The probe(s), which in this example
      comprises an ultrasonic (and optionally an iontophoretic) device,
      propels the mineralising agent 57 (157) through the external
      surface of the tooth in order to remineralise the caries lesion at
      that tooth site.<br>
      <br>
      During this process, the electrical circuit formed by the probe(s)
      33 (133a/133b), patient and counter electrode 43 (143) provides an
      output signal which identifies changes in the electrical response
      of the circuit which have been caused by the ongoing
      remineralisation process. The electrical response is detected by
      detector 53, the signal is passed to the controller 51 which
      processes and compares the electrical response to a dataset of
      known, experimentally obtained electrical responses to
      remineralisation. These responses provide 3D structural
      information on the amount and location of remineralisation of the
      tooth. The controller is therefore able to send program
      instructions to the modulator to alter the ultrasonic signal and
      waveform of the electrical signal input to the probe(s) 33
      (133a/133b) by changing its frequency and/or amplitude and/or
      shape. Once any change to the ultrasonic signal and waveform has
      been determined, the modulator 49 provides an output to the
      probe(s) 33 (133a/133b) which in turn determines the manner in
      which the mineralising agent is propelled through the external
      surface of the tooth. A response to changes in the
      remineralisation pattern of the tooth can be made in real time or
      otherwise.<br>
      The comparison of the dataset of known, experimentally obtained
      electrical responses to remineralisation with the output signal
      detected by detector 53 requires the creation of a dataset or
      library of experimentally obtained responses. This information is
      derived from experimental data in which micro CT images are taken
      to provide virtual tooth slices. In this example of the present
      invention, the process is as follows.<br>
      &nbsp;A sample having dental caries, or other general defects
      (e.g. loss of mineral density), is scanned using a 3D tomography
      system (e.g. x-ray, MRI, neutron (ultrasound). A calibration
      phantom is used to determine the relationship between attenuation
      coefficient and electron density; hardware and software solutions
      are used to minimise intrinsic image artefacts (e.g. beam
      hardening, ring artefacts, scattering). Reconstruction of the
      sample is achieved using acquired 2D angular projection images,
      and is accomplished for different voxel (i.e. 3D pixels) or
      spatial resolutions. 3D image processing algorithms are employed
      to calculate spatial distributions of electron density, as
      represented by attenuation data linked to the phantom. These
      distributions provide information on the degree of mineralization
      of relevant volumes of interest.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      After ultrasonic (and generally iontophoretic) remineralisation
      treatment, the sample is rescanned and subjected to the above
      mentioned methodologies. The subsequent distributions (before and
      after treatments) of mineral density of relevant volumes of
      interest are compared to inform of induced changes in
      mineralization patterns.<br>
      <br>
      This process is repeated for samples with varying degrees of
      remineralisation to provide information on changes in internal
      sample structure, which can be related to changes in electrical
      responses of the sample which occurred during the treatment of the
      sample.<br>
      <br>
      The described technique would inform any spatial heterogeneity of
      remineralisation, providing feedback from the electrical responses
      of the sample to the spatial location of remineralisation.
      Representative experimentally acquired datasets are encoded into
      the device library to provide characteristic signatures of the
      spatial location and distribution of mineral densities which
      enable the clinician to decide on real-time responses to
      remineralisation patterns. The feedback provided by the
      integration of the AC impedance or DC resistance values from the
      sample tooth and its incorporation in the controller, informs the
      settings of the device in order to optimise the remineralisation
      of the tissue. Suitably, the initial settings may involve the use
      of controlled potential coulometry where longer pulses are applied
      or chrono-amperometry where shorter pulses are applied. Feedback
      on the nature and extent of the remineralisation process provided
      by the present invention includes information about if and when to
      switch the settings to controlled current coulometry to optimise
      the remineralisation throughout the lesion.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of controlled current coulometry the current is at a
      constant level which means that the flow of the remineralising
      agent would be constant also. This would be desirable in promoting
      a constant rate of remineralisation, since the rate of
      remineralisation is expected to be directly proportional to the
      amount of current flowing. Alternatively, the current may be
      allowed to fall as a function of time and so the rate of
      remineralisation is not constant with time.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment of the present invention shown in figure 7, in
      addition to characterising the state of mineralisation of the
      tooth, the electrical response of the circuit gives information
      indicative of the build-up of exogenous proteins and/or lipids in
      the area of interest. The flow diagram 71 illustrates the transfer
      of a mineralising agent to the biological material 73. The
      electrical response of the circuit is then detected 75 and the
      detected signal is analysed so as to determine whether, and the
      extent to which, the ultrasonic signal and electrical signal needs
      to be modified in response to the detected electrical response of
      the circuit 77. In addition, the detector of the present invention
      is adapted to detect 81 changes in the electrical response that
      are as a result of a build up of exogenous proteins, lipids and
      other materials. Once detected the remineralisation process is
      interrupted 83 and a conditioning agent is re-applied 85 for a
      specific period. Thereafter, the process of remineralisation may
      resume.<br>
      <br>
      The presence of the exogenous proteins and/or lipids may be
      indicated by the apparatus of the present invention by analysis of
      the electrical response. In these circumstances, the user will be
      advised that a re-conditioning step is required and will take the
      appropriate action to re-apply a conditioning agent.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment of the invention, the apparatus is provided
      with a reference electrode which in this example comprises a small
      Ag/ AgCI wire placed close to the probe electrode. The reference
      electrode allows more precise control of electrical potential and
      is of particular use when large currents are required to treat
      large lesions. The impedance of the tooth can be measured by the
      application of an AC signal as described above. Alternatively, a
      current interruption technique can be used whereby a current is
      applied for a certain amount of time and then the circuit is
      broken rapidly using a relay. The decay of the potential with time
      can give information on the resistance of the tooth.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the invention can be used in the preconditioning of,
      for example, a tooth where ultrasonic signals (and generally
      iontophoresis) are used in preconditioning. A conditioning agent
      may be propelled into a hypo-mineralised or demineralised caries
      lesion, by ultrasonic signals (and generally iontophoresis) to
      optimise the disruption of the exogenous protein and lipid content
      and then the polarity of the iontophoresis reversed, if required,
      in order to aid the removal of the proteinacious and other organic
      material from the hypo-mineralised or demineralised tissue.
      Examples of suitable agents include bleach, detergent, chaotropic
      agents such as urea, high phosphate concentrations, cocktails of
      proteases (e.g. endopeptidases, proteinases and exopeptidases) and
      any other protein solubilising, disrupting or hydrolysing agent.
      In this example of the present invention, the probe is attached to
      a detachable chamber containing a conditioning agent and
      ultrasound (and optionally iontophoresis) is used with this
      chamber to propel the conditioning agent into the tooth prior to
      the remineralising step. The apparatus and method of the present
      invention provides electrical feedback during ultrasonic (and
      generally iontophoretic) conditioning to a detector and a
      controller which modifies the waveform of the electrical input in
      response to the detected electrical response of the circuit during
      conditioning. According to a third aspect of the present invention
      a kit comprises apparatus as described above and a mineralising
      agent. The kit may further comprise a conditioning agent.<br>
      <br>
      The conditioning agent is an oxidising agent, de-proteinising
      agent or a de-lipidising agent. According to a fourth aspect of
      the present invention a mineralising agent comprises a source of
      phosphate, calcium and hydroxy l/water. The remineralising agent
      may comprise casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate
      (CPP-ACP). The remineralising agent may comprise nano-particles of
      (calcium) hydroxyapatite. In a preferred embodiment the
      remineralising agent contains fluoride. An example of such a
      remineralising agent is casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium
      fluoride phosphate (CPP-ACFP).<br>
      The remineralising agent also advantageously includes one or more
      remineralisation enhancers. Typically the remineralising enhancers
      are sources of calcium and phosphate ions. Examples of
      remineralisation enhancers may include, but are not limited to,
      Dicalcium phosphate dehydrate (DCPD), mineral brushite; Dicalcium
      phosphate anhydrous (DCPA), mineral monetite; Octacalcium
      phosphate (OCP); alpha-tricalcium phosphate (alpha-TCP);
      beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP); Amorphous calcium phosphate
      (ACP); Calcium- deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA); Hydroxyapatite
      (HA or OHAp); Fluorapatite (FA or FAp); Tetracalcium phosphate
      (TTCP or TetCP), mineral hilgenstockite); nano-particles of
      hydroxyapatite or fluorhydroxyapatite. More preferably, the
      remineralisation enhancer is strontium. The remineralising agent
      may include at least two remineralisation enhancers wherein one of
      the enhancers is a source of calcium ions and the other is a
      source of phosphate ions. For example the remineralising agent may
      include a source of calcium e.g. calcium hydroxide and a source of
      phosphate e.g. orthophosphoric acid. The ratio of
      calcium:phosphate in the remineralising agent may be between 1 :1
      and 22:10. Preferably the ratio of calcium:phosphate is about 10:6
      (i.e. 1.67), which represents the ratio of calcium to phosphate
      ions in calcium hydroxyapatite. Alternatively the ratio of
      calcium:phosphate in the remineralising agent may be between 9:6
      and 22:10. Alternatively still, the ration of calcium:phosphate in
      the remineralising agent may greater than 1 :1 but less than 3:2
      (i.e. 1.0 up to 1.49).<br>
      <br>
      The remineralising agents may thus be selected from the following:<br>
      <br>
      i) Ca:P ratio = 1.67: e.g. Hydroxyapatite (including
      nano-particles): Fluorapatite.<br>
      <br>
      ii) Ca: P ratio = 1.5 - 2.2 (but not 1.67): e.g. Alpha-Tricalcium
      phosphate; Beta-Tricalcium phosphate; Amorphous calcium phosphate;
      Calcium deficient Hydroxyapatite; Tetracalcium phosphate, mineral
      hilgenstockite.<br>
      <br>
      iii) Ca:P ratio = 1-1.49: e.g. Dicalcium phosphate dehydrate,
      mineral brushite; Dicalcium phosphate anhydrous, mineral monetite.
      The remineralising agent may be prepared from its component parts
      by driving in calcium ions sonophoretically (in aqueous solution)
      and subsequently driving in phosphate ions (in aqueous solution)
      with a second sequence of sonophoresis - the calcium and phosphate
      ions would thus meet within the lesion during the second sequence
      of sonophoresis and precipitate out as a calcium phosphate mineral
      (or minerals). The hydroxyl ion of the generated apatite would
      come from the aqueous solution. The water-soluble calcium-
      containing agent may be, for example, calcium hydroxide, calcium
      chloride, or calcium nitrate; the water-soluble
      phosphate-containing agent may be, for example, orthophosphoric
      acid (H 3PO 4), sodium (or potassium) hydrogen phosphate, sodium
      (or potassium) dihydrogen phosphate or magnesium phosphate. The
      calcium agent containing solution may be separate from the
      phosphate agent containing solution, or combined into one
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      Thus a preferred method of the invention may comprise the steps
      of: i) pre-conditioning the biological material (hard tissue) to
      remove protein and/lipids, and ii) applying to the hard tissue a
      calcium phosphate-containing aqueous solution whilst separately,
      sequentially or simultaneously applying ultrasound. The
      pre-conditioning step can be effected with or without the use of
      ultrasound to drive in the de-proteinisation agent, e.g. sodium
      hypochlorite. The frequency of this ultrasound can be in the range
      which will generate cavitation or Ultrasonic streaming.<br>
      <br>
      A further preferred method of the invention comprises the steps of
      i) pre-conditioning the biological material (hard tissue) to
      remove protein and/lipids ii) applying to the tissue a
      calcium-containing aqueous solution or phosphate-containing
      aqueous solution whilst separately, sequentially or simultaneously
      applying sonophoresis, and iii) either (a) applying a
      phosphate-containing aqueous solution where in (ii) a
      calcium-containing aqueous solution was applied or (b) applying a
      calcium-containing aqueous solution where in (ii) a phosphate-
      containing aqueous solution was applied whilst separately,
      sequentially or simultaneously applying sonophoresis. The
      pre-conditioning step is performed, with or without the
      application of ultrasound, prior to application of the
      remineralising agent/ultrasound. The pre-conditioning step may
      further comprise treatment with a hypochlorite and preferably
      treatment with an acid, more preferably, phosphoric acid. The
      method, according to the present invention, may be used for the
      treatment or alleviation of dental caries and/or dental fluorosis
      in a mammal. It may also be used for remineralising of
      hypo-mineralised or de-mineralised (carious) dentine. The present
      invention also provides a remineralising agent for use in
      ultrasonic remineralising treatment of hard tissue which has been
      subject to pre-conditioning to remove protein and/or lipids, the
      remineralising agent being a source of both phosphate and calcium.
      A variety of mineralising agents may be used, including a mixture
      of mineralising agents. The mineralising agent may depend upon the
      tissue to be treated. However, preferably, the mineralising agent
      is a phosphate or calcium source, preferably a source of phosphate
      and calcium. An especially preferred mineralising agent is casein
      phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP).<br>
      <br>
      For use in the remineralisation of tooth, the mineralising agent
      may be a fluoride containing agent as hereinbefore described, such
      as casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate
      (CPP-ACFP). Other mineralising agents may comprise calcium
      phosphate compounds, such as fluoroapatite, monetite, brushite,
      amorphous calcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite, etc. Furthermore, it
      may be possible to incorporate additional elements in the
      mineralising agent of the invention which may enhance the
      remineralisation effect, such as strontium. Nano-particles of the
      mineralising agents, e.g. hydroxyapatite, are a preferred
      mineralising agent. It will be understood by the person skilled in
      the art that the terms hypo-mineralised tissue and demineralised
      tissue are intended to include any tissue that is deficient in its
      level of mineralization and includes tissue, such as tooth, that
      is substantially or completely demineralised, e.g. as a result of
      the dental caries process, thus including dental caries lesions,
      or a result of acid erosion, thus including 'surface-softened'
      enamel or dentine.<br>
      <br>
      The ultrasound may comprise the application of a single frequency
      or a range of frequencies. Alternatively, the ultrasound may
      comprise the application of a mixture of frequencies, for example,
      the combination of frequencies may be applied in specific
      sequences so as to optimise remineralisation.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, as previously mentioned, in the method of the
      present invention a preconditioning step is also included prior to
      application of the mineralising agent/ultrasound. This
      preconditioning step is now discussed in more details. The
      pre-conditioning step may vary but may, for example, comprise the
      removal of proteins and/or lipids prior to application of the
      mineralising agent/ultrasound. Although a variety of
      pre-conditioning steps may be used, preferably, the
      preconditioning step comprises a variety of processes or a mixture
      of processes. Any suitable protein removing agent can be used in
      the preconditioning step of the present invention. The agent is
      required to reduce the proteinaceous barrier formed over the
      surface to be treated, such as the pellicle over teeth or the
      exogenous protein within a caries lesion. The preconditioning step
      may optionally include the use of ultrasound and the various
      preconditioning agents, e.g. protein removing agents, may be used
      in a variety of combinations and/or sequences. Furthermore, any of
      the pre-conditioning agents may be propelled into a
      hypo-mineralised or demineralised region, e.g. caries lesion, by
      ultrasound to optimise the disruption of the protein layer and
      removal the proteinacious material from the hypo-mineralised or
      demineralised tissue. Examples of suitable agents include bleach,
      detergent, chaotropic agents such as urea, high phosphate
      concentrations, cocktails of proteases (e.g. endopeptidases,
      proteinases and exopeptidases) and any other protein solubilising,
      disrupting or hydrolysing agent. Examples of suitable bleaches
      include sodium hypochlorite and peroxide bleaches. In a preferred
      embodiment, the bleach is an alkaline bleach. In a further
      preferred embodiment the alkaline bleach is sodium hypochlorite.
      The protein disrupting agent acts to solubilise and partially or
      wholly remove proteins from the surface of the tooth mineral, e.g.
      proteins of the pellicle on the tooth surface. However, preferably
      the preconditioning step comprises treatment with an acid, such as
      an organic acid, e.g. acetic acid, an inorganic acid, e.g.
      phosphoric acid, or a bleaching agent, e.g. hypochlorite, for
      example, sodium hypochlorite. The application of the ultrasound in
      the lower frequency range acts to generate cavitation during the
      pre-conditioning step which promotes removal of the exogenous
      organic material from the surface of and within the lesion.<br>
      <br>
      The mineralising agent may be applied in a variety of forms, for
      example, in the form of a gel or mousse. For use in the treatment
      of tooth other oral applications known per se may be used.<br>
      <br>
      Pre-conditioning is preferably carried out not more than one
      minute before the application of the mineralising agent. More
      preferably, the mineralising agent is applied almost
      contemporaneously, i.e. within seconds, of the preconditioning.<br>
      <br>
      A preferred treatment sequence involves repeated conditioning
      followed by mineralising, particularly in a case where the
      mineralising agent includes material, such as protein, which is
      removed in a subsequent conditioning step. The present invention
      further provides a method of cosmetic treatment of tissue by
      application to the tissue of a mineralising agent whilst
      separately, sequentially or simultaneously applying ultrasound. It
      will be further understood by the person skilled in the art that
      the method of the invention may also be advantageous in the field
      of orthopaedics, for example, in the treatment of bone pathologies
      in mammals, i.e. human or animals, such as fractures and/or during
      surgery. The present invention provides improved mineralisation of
      tissue. However, conventional methods of remineralisation of tooth
      generally comprise remineralisation of the surface tissue, i.e.
      remineralisation of enamel. It is a particular advantage of the
      present invention that the method and/or use provide for
      remineralisation of dentine. Dentine is the term for a hard
      substance which is related to bone and forms the core of the tooth
      in mammals and man. Dentine consists to the extent of
      approximately 30% of a cell-free organic base substance, in
      particular glycoproteins in which collagen fibres are
      incorporated. The inorganic constituents are predominantly
      hydroxyapatite, fluoroapatite and small amounts of carbonates,
      magnesium and trace elements. The present invention further
      provides a kit for use in ultrasonic remineralising treatment of
      tissue comprising a pre-conditioning agent and a mineralising
      agent. The remineralising agent may comprise a source of calcium
      and phosphate ions such as defined herein.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the pre-conditioning agent and the remineralising
      agent are present in the kit in a suitable form for application,
      for instance, a liquid or a gel form.<br>
      <br>
      The kit may also provide an applicator for applying the, or each,
      agent to the site of treatment. Throughout the description and
      claims of this specification, the singular encompasses the plural
      unless the context otherwise requires. In particular, where the
      indefinite article is used, the specification is to be understood
      as contemplating plurality as well as singularity, unless the
      context requires otherwise. Features, integers, characteristics,
      compounds, chemical moieties or groups described in conjunction
      with a particular aspect, embodiment or example of the invention
      are to be understood to be applicable to any other aspect,
      embodiment or example described herein unless incompatible
      therewith. Throughout the description and claims of this
      specification, the words "comprise" and "contain" and variations
      of the words, for example "comprising" and "comprises", mean
      "including but not limited to", and are not intended to (and do
      not) exclude other moieties, additives, components, integers or

        <p class="printTableText" lang="en"><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0001] The present invention relates to an apparatus and
          method for mineralising biological material and in particular
          for re-mineralising demineralised and hypo-mineralised tissue,
          such as tooth or bone.<br>
          <br>
          <b> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0002] Caries is the decay of tooth or bone. Dental caries
          (also known as dental decay, caries or carious lesions) is
          caused by acids produced by microbial enzymatic action on
          ingested carbohydrate. The acids decalcify (demineralise) the
          inorganic portion of the tooth initially creating a
          sub-surface lesion, the organic portion then disintegrates
          leading to the creation of a cavity. In dentistry,
          demineralisation of a tooth through the development of a
          carious lesion can be described in terms of the depth of the
          carious lesion.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] Dental caries is commonly treated by the removal of the
          decayed material in the tooth and the filling of the resultant
          hole (cavity) with a dental amalgam or other restorative
          material. In more severe cases, the entire tooth may be
          removed. Prior to lesion cavitation, it is possible to heal or
          reverse the tissue destruction by remineralising the caries
          lesions. However, this process works better where exogenous
          (e.g. salivary- or food-derived) proteins and lipids have been
          removed from the caries lesions.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] It is known that the level of tooth decay alters the
          electrical characteristics of a tooth. This arises because as
          minerals are lost the porosity of the tooth increases and the
          consequent increased numbers of ions within the pores increase
          the conductivity i.e. the electrical transport in the tooth.
          Consequently, demineralisation of a tooth will result in an
          enhancement of its charge transport properties. This may be
          manifested in a decrease in the potential difference which
          must be applied to a demineralised tooth, compared with a
          healthy tooth, in order to achieve a comparable current
          therethrough. Correspondingly, this may be manifested in an
          increased current measurable from a demineralised tooth,
          compared with a healthy tooth, on application of the same
          potential difference. These effects can be detected on
          application of a constant current or constant potential
          difference respectively. Alternatively, the impedance (which
          includes the DC resistance) can be monitored by using AC
          signals.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] There are a number of devices specifically designed to
          detect dental caries by the application of an alternating
          electrical current to a tooth using a probe or contact
          electrode and counter electrode. As described above, the main
          source of impedance in the circuit formed by the counter
          electrode and the probe is provided by the tooth and
          therefore, changes to the impedance of the circuit give a
          measure of changes in the impedance of the tooth. This
          technique is described in international patent application
          WO97/42909.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] Iontophoresis is a non-invasive method of propelling a
          charged substance, normally a medication or a bioactive agent,
          using an electric current. It is known to use iontophoresis in
          transdermal drug delivery. Iontophoresis may also be used in
          conjunction with fluoride containing compounds to treat
          dentine hypersensitivity and to remineralise non-cavitated
          dental caries lesions. Iontophoresis devices typically include
          an active electrode assembly and a counter electrode assembly
          each coupled to opposite poles or terminals of a voltage
          source. The active agent can be cationic or anionic and the
          voltage source can be configured to apply the appropriate
          voltage polarity based upon the polarity of the active agent.
          The active agent may be stored in for example, a reservoir
          such as a cavity or in a porous structure or a gel.<br>

            THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b> </b>[0079] The present invention provides an
          apparatus and method for mineralising a biological material.
          The invention is particularly suitable for remineralisation of
          teeth where decay by demineralisation has occurred or for
          occluding dental tubules to treat dentine hypersensitivity, or
          for tooth whitening or in the treatment of dental erosion. It
          will be appreciated that the apparatus and method described
          herein is not restricted to the remineralisation of teeth but
          can be used to mineralise other biological material, for
          example, it may be used in the remineralisation of bones for
          the treatment of osteoporosis, osteopenia or periodontal
          disease.<br>
          <br>
          [0080] In preferred embodiments of the present invention,
          spatial imaging data or 3D structural information can be used
          to generate different characterising parameters, including,
          tracking changes (and/or relative changes [bearing in mind
          that normally there is some variation in the mineral density
          of healthy enamel and dentine]) in grey-scale values (in
          micro-CT images) in a variety of different parallel vectors in
          any one of many different planes, to generate an average
          representation of the mineral density changes in the direction
          of those vectors. The averaging process is performed
          preferably over the whole volume of the lesion; and the
          resulting information therefrom is processed to calculate,
          amongst other parameters, the depth of the carious lesion in
          the direction of the pulp. In view of the complex spatial
          geometries of lesions, the image analysis technique provides
          substantially more information than that normally available to
          a dentist. Thus, it may be possible to determine other lesion
          parameters which may be more useful in characterising the loss
          of mineral density than the traditionally-used lesion depth
          parameter.<br>
          <br>
          [0081] As described previously, changes in the impedance
          and/or resistance of a tooth can be detected on the
          application of an AC signal or a DC constant current or
          constant potential difference. The application of a pulse or
          square-wave current or potential difference to a healthy or
          demineralised tooth also yields dynamic information from the
          plot of current (or potential) vs time.<br>
          <br>
          [0082] FIG. 1a is a graph 1 of voltage against time which
          shows a pulsed voltage 3 of substantially constant magnitude.
          FIG. 1b is a graph of current against time which shows the
          current decay rate in response to the applied potential
          difference (voltage) pulse for a healthy tooth and one which
          has been demineralised. The curve 7 shows the current response
          for the healthy tooth and the curve 9 shows the response for
          the demineralised tooth.<br>
          <br>
          [0083] Using a mechanistic understanding of charge transport
          through a tooth and the effect of tooth demineralisation on
          tooth ionic conductivity, a relation may be formed between the
          mineral density profiles determined from the above-mentioned
          image processing technique and a measured temporal electrical
          response profile.<br>
          <br>
          [0084] The present invention forms the relation through
          image-analysis and electrical properties analysis of a large
          number of healthy teeth and teeth with carious lesions by
          establishing an analytical model which creates a mathematical
          function to describe this relationship. Alternatively, the
          present invention may employ a look-up table between the
          measured electrical response data and average mineral density
          values (determined from the above image analysis techniques)
          obtained from the studies of the healthy and diseased teeth<br>
          <br>
          [0085] In establishing the above relation and/or look-up
          table, micro-CT techniques can be used in which data is
          calibrated against a plurality of phantoms, so as to ensure
          that the measured variation in grey scale values is actually
          representative of a change in mineral density though a tooth,
          as opposed to an aberrant effect (or imaging artifacts). The
          above process will be described in more detail below.<br>
          <br>
          [0086] The apparatus of the present invention employs a
          feedback mechanism, wherein an electrical measurement (which
          may be AC or DC related) is made whilst a tooth is being
          remineralised by iontophoresis. The electrical measurement is
          related to the mineral density of a carious lesion in the
          tooth (through the above-mentioned relation and/or look-up
          table formed during an offline process) to calculate an
          appropriate control signal for the apparatus to optimally tune
          the iontophoretic process.<br>
          <br>
          [0087] FIG. 2a shows an embodiment of the method of the
          present invention which comprises the following steps.<br>
          <br>
          [0088] Step 0:<br>
          <br>
          [0089] In first step towards calibrating the grey-scale values
          obtained from a micro-CT analysis (used in forming the mineral
          density values employed in the above-mentioned relation and/or
          look-up table) a plurality of phantoms (comprising a
          homogeneous isotropic material which substantially matches
          dental material) are scanned using a micro-CT device. In the
          present example, the phantoms comprise hydroxyapatite disks
          representing a particular material density.<br>
          <br>
          [0090] Step 1:<br>
          <br>
          [0091] Following the micro-CT analysis of the phantoms alone,
          a plurality of healthy teeth and teeth with carious lesions
          are each subjected to a similar scanning process, together
          with the phantoms. The calculated mineral densities of the
          scanned teeth are processed using a known segmentation
          technique to identify the boundaries of any lesions therein. A
          profile of the mineral density is established within the
          boundaries determined by the segmentation process; and the
          mineral density profiles are related to a steady-state or
          temporal electrical measurement obtained from the same teeth.<br>
          <br>
          [0092] Step 2:<br>
          <br>
          [0093] During iontophoresis, a constant potential difference
          or current is applied to a tooth with a carious lesion 13. An
          electrical response function is measured 15 from the tooth
          under treatment; and the relation (and/or look-up table)
          established in Step 1 is used to determine 17 the mineral
          density of the carious lesion.<br>
          <br>
          [0094] Step 3:<br>
          <br>
          [0095] The mineral density range of the healthy tooth material
          proximal to the boundaries established during step 1 is
          determined 19. This is used to establish the desired degree of
          remineralisation required of the iontophoretic treatment.<br>
          <br>
          [0096] Step 4:<br>
          <br>
          [0097] A change in the magnitude of iontophoretic signal is
          calculated 21, the calculated change being sufficient to drive
          mineral into the lesion so that the mineral density of the
          lesion more closely matches that of the healthy dental
          material.<br>
          <br>
          [0098] In implementing the method of FIG. 2a, the apparatus of
          FIG. 2b comprises a logic block 23, which in addition to
          receiving an indication of the desired change in the magnitude
          of the iontophoretic signal (from Step 4), receives
          information regarding the time 25 over which the iontophoresis
          treatment has been operating. The logic block 23 also receives
          additional protocol information 27 regarding times for example
          at which the iontophoresis should be started or stopped (e.g.
          to allow the electrical probe to be cleaned and further
          conditioning agent 29 to be applied thereto).<br>
          <br>
          [0099] FIG. 3 shows another embodiment of an apparatus 31 for
          mineralising a biological material in accordance with the
          present invention comprising a probe 33 having a handle 35, a
          neck 37 and head 39. The probe 33 is connected to a controller
          41 by cable 45 which in turn is connected to counter electrode
          43 by cable 47. Electrode 43 may be a hand-held or mouth- or
          lip-"loop" electrode.<br>
          <br>
          [0100] FIG. 4 shows in more detail, the controller 41 which
          comprises a modulator 49 which modulates the shape and/or
          frequency and/or amplitude of the waveform sent to the probe
          33.<br>
          <br>
          [0101] FIG. 5 shows in more detail, the probe 33 of the
          apparatus of the first embodiment of present invention. In
          this embodiment, the cable 45 extends through the handle 35 of
          the probe 33 to a reservoir 55 containing a mineralising agent
          57. The mineralisation agent is pushed out from the reservoir
          55 through the head 39 of the probe 33 and in to contact with
          the biological material which in this example is a tooth.<br>
          <br>
          [0102] In other examples of the present invention, the active
          agent may be stored in other ways such as in a porous
          structure or a gel which may be applied directly to a tooth.
          In embodiments of the present invention where the mineralising
          agent is stored in a chamber in the probe it can be introduced
          onto the probe surface by making the chamber of flexible
          material to allow the mineralising agent to be squeezed out.
          Alternatively, the chamber could have a plunger or similar
          component which pushes the mineralising agent out of the
          chamber.<br>
          <br>
          [0103] In order to prevent cross-infection the remineralising
          agent is typically held separately from the device or embodied
          as a detachable 'probe tip' which attaches/clicks to the end
          of the device.<br>
          <br>
          [0104] FIG. 6 is a flow chart 61 which shows a first
          embodiment of the method of the present invention. In the
          method of the present invention, the waveform of the
          electrical input signal in the circuit formed from the probe
          electrode and the counter electrode is controlled so as to
          transfer of a mineralising agent to the biological, material
          63. The electrical response of the circuit is then detected 65
          and the detected signal is analysed so as to determine whether
          and the extent to which the waveform of the electrical input
          should be modified in response to the detected electrical
          response of the circuit 67.<br>
          <br>
          [0105] The following example of use of an embodiment of the
          present invention is given in relation to the remineralisation
          of teeth. The dentist identifies, within a patient, a specific
          tooth site which is to be remineralised. Thereafter a
          conditioning agent is applied and the site is cleansed to
          remove exogenous proteins and/or lipids from the site. The
          conditioning agent may be propelled into a hypo-mineralised or
          demineralised caries lesion, by iontophoresis, utilising the
          probe and counter electrodes, to optimise the disruption and
          removal of the exogenous protein and/or lipid content.<br>
          <br>
          [0106] The probe 33 is inserted into the mouth of the patient
          and on to the tooth site. The counter electrode 43 is
          connected to the patient. The probe, which in this example
          comprises an iontophoretic device, propels the charged
          remineralisation agent 57 through the external surface of the
          tooth in order to remineralise the caries lesion at that tooth
          site.<br>
          <br>
          [0107] During this process, the electrical circuit formed by
          the probe 33, patient and counter electrode 43 provides an
          output signal which identifies changes in the electrical
          response of the circuit which have been caused by the ongoing
          remineralisation process. The electrical response is detected
          by detector 53, the signal is passed to the controller 51
          which processes and compares the electrical response to a
          dataset of known, experimentally obtained electrical responses
          to remineralisation. These responses provide 3D structural
          information on the amount and location of remineralisation of
          the tooth. The controller is therefore able to send program
          instructions to the modulator to alter the waveform of the
          electrical signal input to the probe 33 by changing its
          frequency and/or amplitude and/or shape. Once any change to
          the waveform has been determined, the modulator 49 provides an
          output to the probe 33 which in turn determines the manner in
          which the mineralising agent is propelled through the external
          surface of the tooth. A response to changes in the
          remineralisation pattern of the tooth can be made in real time
          or otherwise.<br>
          <br>
          [0108] The comparison of the dataset of known, experimentally
          obtained electrical responses to remineralisation with the
          output signal detected by detector 53 requires the creation of
          a dataset or library of experimentally obtained responses.
          This information is derived from experimental data in which
          micro CT images are taken to provide virtual tooth slices. In
          this example of the present invention, the process is as
          follows.<br>
          <br>
          [0109] A sample having dental caries, or other general defects
          (e.g. loss of mineral density), is scanned using a 3D
          tomography system (e.g. x-ray, MRI, neutron (ultrasound). A
          calibration phantom is used to determine the relationship
          between attenuation coefficient and electron density; hardware
          and software solutions are used to minimise intrinsic image
          artifacts (e.g. beam hardening, ring artifacts, scattering).<br>
          <br>
          [0110] Reconstruction of the sample is achieved using acquired
          2D angular projection images, and is accomplished for
          different voxel (i.e. 3D pixels) or spatial resolutions. 3D
          image processing algorithms are employed to calculate spatial
          distributions of electron density, as represented by
          attenuation data linked to the phantom. These distributions
          provide information on the degree of mineralization of
          relevant volumes of interest.<br>
          <br>
          [0111] After iontophoretic remineralisation treatment, the
          sample is rescanned and subjected to the above mentioned
          methodologies. The subsequent distributions (before and after
          treatments) of mineral density of relevant volumes of interest
          are compared to inform of induced changes in mineralization
          patterns.<br>
          <br>
          [0112] This process is repeated for samples with varying
          degrees of remineralisation to provide information on changes
          in internal sample structure, which can be related to changes
          in electrical responses of the sample which occurred during
          the treatment of the sample.<br>
          <br>
          [0113] The described technique would inform any spatial
          heterogeneity of remineralisation, providing feedback from the
          electrical responses of the sample to the spatial location of
          remineralisation. Representative experimentally acquired
          datasets will be encoded into the device library to provide
          characteristic signatures of the spatial location and
          distribution of mineral densities which would enable the
          clinician to decide on real-time response to remineralisation
          patterns.<br>
          <br>
          [0114] The feedback provided by the integration of the AC
          impedance or DC resistance values from the sample tooth and
          its incorporation in the controller, informs the settings of
          the device in order to optimise the remineralisation of the
          tissue. Suitably, the initial settings may involve the use of
          controlled potential coulometry where longer pulses are
          applied or chrono-amperometry where shorter pulses are
          applied. Feedback on the nature and extent of the
          remineralisation process provided by the present invention
          includes information about if and when to switch the settings
          to controlled current coulometry to optimise the
          remineralisation throughout the lesion.<br>
          <br>
          [0115] In the case of controlled current coulometry the
          current is at a constant level which means that the flow of
          the remineralising agent would be constant also. This would be
          desirable in promoting a constant rate of remineralisation,
          since the rate of remineralisation is expected to be directly
          proportional to the amount of current flowing. Alternatively,
          the current may be allowed to fall as a function of time and
          so the rate of remineralisation is not constant with time.<br>
          <br>
          [0116] In the embodiment of the present invention shown in
          FIG. 7, in addition to characterising the state of
          mineralisation of the tooth, the electrical response of the
          circuit gives information indicative of the build-up of
          exogenous proteins and/or lipids in the area of interest. The
          flow diagram 71 illustrates the transfer of a mineralising
          agent to the biological material 73. The electrical response
          of the circuit is then detected 75 and the detected signal is
          analysed so as to determine whether and the extent to which
          the waveform of the electrical input should be modified in
          response to the detected electrical response of the circuit
          77. In addition, the detector of the present invention is
          adapted to detect 81 changes in the electrical signal that are
          as a result of the build up of exogenous proteins, lipids and
          other materials. Once detected the remineralisation process is
          interrupted 83 and a conditioning agent is re-applied 85 for a
          specific period. Thereafter, the process of remineralisation
          may resume.<br>
          <br>
          [0117] The presence of the exogenous proteins and/or lipids
          may be indicated by the apparatus of the present invention by
          analysis of the electrical response. In these circumstances,
          the user will be advised that a re-conditioning step is
          required and will take the appropriate action to re-apply a
          conditioning agent.<br>
          <br>
          [0118] In another embodiment of the invention, the apparatus
          is provided with a reference electrode which in this example
          comprises a small Ag/AgCl wire placed close to the probe
          electrode. The reference electrode allows more precise control
          of electrical potential and is of particular use when large
          currents are required to treat large lesions.<br>
          <br>
          [0119] The impedance of the tooth can be measured by the
          application of an AC signal as described above. Alternatively,
          a current interruption technique can be used whereby a current
          is applied for a certain amount of time and then the circuit
          is broken rapidly using a relay. The decay of the potential
          with time can give information on the resistance of the tooth.<br>
          <br>
          [0120] In addition, the invention can be used in the
          preconditioning of, for example, a tooth where iontophoresis
          is used in preconditioning. A conditioning agent may be
          propelled into a hypo-mineralised or demineralised caries
          lesion, by iontophoresis to optimise the disruption of the
          exogenous protein and lipid content and then the polarity of
          the iontophoresis reversed, if required, in order to aid the
          removal of the proteinacious and other organic material from
          the hypo-mineralised or demineralised tissue. Examples of
          suitable agents include bleach, detergent, chaotropic agents
          such as urea, high phosphate concentrations, cocktails of
          proteases (e.g. endopeptidases, proteinases and exopeptidases)
          and any other protein solubilising, disrupting or hydrolysing
          agent. In this example of the present invention, the probe is
          attached to a detachable chamber containing a conditioning
          agent and iontophoresis is used with this chamber to propel
          the conditioning agent into the tooth prior to the
          remineralising step.<br>
          <br>
          [0121] The apparatus and method of the present invention
          provides electrical feedback during iontophoretic conditioning
          to a detector and a controller which modifies the waveform of
          the electrical input in response to the detected electrical
          response of the circuit during conditioning.<br>
          <br>
          [0122] Improvements and modifications may be incorporated
          herein without deviating from the scope of the invention.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b> -- There is described an electrode assembly
      for passing electrical current through at least part of a tooth,
      the assembly comprising: an electrode holder; and a plurality of
      resilient projecting elements coupled to the holder, each element
      comprising one or more electrodes, the assembly being arranged in
      use such that when the assembly is positioned adjacent a tooth,
      the electrodes contact respective parts of at least one surface of
      the tooth. The assembly is preferably for use in A.C. impedance
      spectroscopy for caries detection and monitoring.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to an electrode assembly for
      passing electrical current through at least part of a tooth.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] There is increasing interest in developing techniques for
      providing an accurate determination of the structure of teeth in
      both animals and humans. It is well known that the tooth
      structure, particularly in terms of the hard outer enamel of the
      tooth, can be affected by wear, by localised chemistry on the
      tooth surface, and other factors. Such changes in the structure
      are important in providing diagnosis of dental and medical
      conditions, and for general research purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] One of the techniques under development is that of using
      electrical impedance to determine the tooth structure. In this
      technique, an electrical current is passed through the tooth under
      study and the electrical response of the circuit so formed is then
      monitored, this response providing information in the form of
      voltage, current and their respective phase. This information is
      then used to determine the structure of the tooth itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Taking human teeth as an example, it will be appreciated
      that there are a number of different types of human teeth
      (incisors, canine, premolar and molar), and some of the tooth
      surfaces are more accessible than others when positioned in the
      mouth. There are three general types of tooth surfaces, these
      being the free smooth surfaces (facing inwardly and outwardly of
      the mouth), the occlusal surfaces (biting surfaces), and the
      approximal surfaces (these being between adjacent teeth) . Where
      it is desired for the determination of tooth structure to be
      related to dental problems such as dental caries, it is
      particularly important to provide structure determinations of the
      tooth enamel on the occlusal and approximal surfaces since this is
      where caries is more prevalent. There is therefore a need for
      apparatus which is capable of producing accurate electrical
      impedance measurements upon the occlusal and/or approximal
      surfaces in particular.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] To date, the apparatus and electrodes used for performing
      electrical impedance measurements upon any tooth surface have been
      rather experimental, for example the contact electrode being
      formed from a conducting metallic wire which is simply pressed
      against the surface of the tooth under study.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Since the commercial use of the electrical impedance
      technique is attracting increased interest, there is a desire to
      provide novel electrode apparatus which is compact, reliable and
      provides for easy and rapid operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention,
      we provide an electrode assembly for passing electrical current
      through at least part of a tooth, the assembly comprises:<br>
      <br>
      [0008] an electrode holder; and<br>
      <br>
      [0009] a plurality of resilient projecting elements coupled to the
      holder, each element comprising one or more electrodes, the
      assembly being arranged in use such that when the assembly is
      positioned adjacent a tooth, the electrodes contact respective
      parts of at least one surface of the tooth.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The present invention therefore conveniently addresses the
      problems discussed above. We have realised that, by using a
      plurality of projecting resilient elements, if these elements are
      provided with or indeed constitute electrodes, then electrical
      impedance measurements can be carried out upon tooth surfaces
      which are difficult to access by other means. Furthermore, the use
      of a plurality of such electrodes allows for multiple measurements
      to be taken in multiple locations upon the tooth, and these may
      advantageously be upon more than one surface of the tooth without
      need for the electrode assembly to be moved. Whilst in many cases
      it is desired to make electrical impedance measurements on one or
      more surfaces of one tooth, in some cases such measurements can be
      made upon one or more surfaces of a plurality of teeth, such as
      adjacent teeth, without moving the assembly.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The electrodes can be used in a number of different ways
      depending upon the structure information required. The electrode
      assembly may therefore be used with each electrode acting as
      effectively a contact electrode. In this case, current is provided
      through each contact electrode, with the circuit being completed
      by the use of an additional counter electrode which may be
      positioned at another part of the body of the human or animal in
      question, or touched against another part of the tooth.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Although in principal a direct current may be used for the
      measurements, it is expected that the electrode assembly of the
      invention will be used primarily with alternating current of one
      or more frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] It is advantageous of course to ensure that reliable
      electrical contact is provided with the desired area of the tooth.
      In some cases therefore, a number of the electrodes in different
      elements may be connected together electrically. This ensures that
      a measurement may be made, even where only one of the elements is
      in electrical contact with the tooth.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The elements may therefore be arranged in groups with the
      elements either connected together electrically to form a single
      electrode, or not connected, so as to form separate electrodes.
      The elements may be arranged individually or in groups in any
      desired pattern such as in an array (the elements or the elements
      within groups either being electrically connected together or
      otherwise).<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Where the electrodes of different elements are desired not
      to be connected electrically, then preferably the assembly further
      comprises one or more electrical insulating resilient elements
      which are positioned between the elements having electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Alternatively, or in addition, one or more barriers of
      insulating material may be provided, projecting from the holder so
      as to prevent contact between the electrically conductive elements
      on opposed sides of the barrier. The barriers may take the form of
      strips or plates of an electrically insulating material such as
      polyethylene teraphthalate (PET).<br>
      <br>
      [0017] It will be appreciated that the degree of resilience of the
      elements (those with and/or without electrodes) depends upon their
      geometry and material from which they are made. In particular, the
      function of the resilience is to provide biasing of the element
      electrodes against the respective tooth surface when in use and/or
      deflection so as to allow other electrodes to also contact the
      tooth surface. Were the elements extremely rigid, then the lack of
      deflection or biassing would likely only allow some electrodes to
      come into contact with the tooth.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The primary function of the holder is to provide an anchor
      point for the elements. However it may also be formed so that it
      may be gripped by a user so that the electrodes can be correctly
      located against the tooth surface(s). The holder may therefore
      comprise two or more separable parts one of which may, for
      example, act as the anchor point for the elements, allowing it to
      be disposable. By providing suitable electrical and mechanical
      connections between these separable parts, the part containing the
      elements can be changed for other such parts, for example for
      making measurements on different teeth, or upon children rather
      than adults. If each part containing the elements has similar
      connections then these can be used interchangeably with the other
      part(s) of the holder to which they are connected when in use.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] A number of different electrode assembly configurations are
      envisaged, depending upon the type of tooth under analysis, and
      the surfaces of the tooth in question. The elements may therefore
      project from the holder in substantially at least one direction.
      In the case of a single direction, the electrode assembly may take
      the appearance of a toothbrush and the elements may in this case
      be particularly suited for measurements upon the occlusal surfaces
      of teeth. However, since five surfaces of a tooth are accessible,
      these being one occlusal, two approximal and two free smooth
      surfaces, then the elements may be arranged to project in
      substantially two, three, four or five directions, in this case
      preferably the projection direction being in the direction of the
      respective tooth surface in question when the electrode assembly
      is positioned for use.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Of course elements for measuring combinations of any of
      these surfaces may be provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In most cases, the elements have different lengths with
      respect to one another, depending upon their intended use. These
      lengths may vary within elements intended for use upon the same
      surface, and/or between those for use upon different surfaces.
      Typically the relative lengths are adapted so as to conform
      generally with the shape of the surface of the tooth being
      investigated.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In some cases, more than one electrode is provided upon a
      particular projecting element. These may be connected together
      electrically for providing multiple contact positions, or more
      preferably, these may be arranged to form individual electrodes
      providing different contact locations for respective measurements.
      Preferably in the latter case, each electrode is arranged such
      that the part of the electrode that contacts the tooth is
      substantially a point contact.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In other examples, the projecting element may itself be
      formed from an electrically conductive material (for example
      stainless steel) such that the element itself is an electrode, and
      electrical contact can be made at any point along its length. The
      material in this case (forming the elements) may be metallic
      although the use of conductive polymers is also advantageous for
      cost and biological inactivity. Such polymers may have a matrix
      formed from materials such as natural rubbers or synthetic
      elastomers. The matrix is provided with conductive components
      formed from carbon or metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Whilst in some cases the entire element may be formed from
      a conductive material, in others it may be formed generally from
      an insulating material that is coated within an electrically
      conductive material such that again it may act as an electrode by
      contact at substantially any point along its length. The coating
      may be provided by a material which can be easily used for coating
      and has biological inactivity, such as gold, titanium, copper,
      stainless-steel, bronze and their respective alloys, or carbon.
      Multi-layers of such materials could be employed. Some of these
      materials may be sputtered onto the elements whereas the use of
      conductive paints provides a further alternative. The material
      that is to be coated, and therefore forming most of the element,
      may be an insulating material such as various plastics, for
      example nylon or polyesters such as polybutylene terephthalate or
      polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Each of the examples later described herein can be
      constructed using electrically conductive elements of the various
      types mentioned above, such as by using solid stainless steel
      wires as the elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Depending upon the configuration of the electrodes, an
      electrical connection to each of the elements having the
      electrodes may be provided using a respective conductive wire or
      track.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The dimensions of the elements themselves is dependent upon
      the application and materials used, although typically the length
      of the elements lies in the range of 0.5 millimetres to 10
      millimetres. The typical thickness in cross-section of the
      elements lies in the range 50 to 500 micrometres.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Preferably for hygiene purposes, the electrode assembly is
      disposable in the sense that it is a "one use only" device or at
      least a "one use only for each patient" device, the latter meaning
      that the assembly may be reused with only the same patient (or
      animal). Preferably therefore, the assembly further comprises a
      connector having contacts arranged in electrical communication
      with the electrodes, the connector being adapted to detachably
      couple electrically to a corresponding connector of a monitoring
      system which provides the electrical current for the measurements.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] For ease of use by a user, preferably the holder is formed
      having an elongate handle such that the holder may be grasped in
      use so as to hold the electrodes in position in contact with the
      tooth. Typically the holder is formed from an insulating material
      such as a plastics material, for example polypropylene, polyamide
      or SAN, and may also include elastomer parts. In some example
      assemblies, first and second sensor elements project in a mutually
      opposed direction from a central electrically insulating barrier,
      such that the first and second sets are insulated from each other,
      this assembly being arranged such that, when in use, the first and
      second sets contact respective first and second teeth. Such an
      assembly may be used therefore upon surfaces such as the
      approximal surfaces. Each of the sets of elements in this case is
      preferably formed from electrically conducting bristles. The
      bristles of each set are preferably connected together
      electrically to all other elements in their respective set. The
      barrier itself may take a number of forms, although typically it
      is a substantially planar plate formed from a suitable plastics
      material. For each of these sets of elements, a corresponding wire
      is preferably provided which runs along one side of the barrier in
      each case, the bristles forming the electrode elements thereby
      being attached to the wire so that an equal electrical potential
      is provided for all electrodes within a particular set.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The monitoring system in some examples may comprise a
      self-contained hand-held unit, particularly in the case where
      relatively simple measurements are made.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention
      we provide a system for monitoring the structure of a tooth
      comprising:<br>
      <br>
      [0032] an electrode assembly according to the first aspect of the
      invention; and<br>
      <br>
      [0033] a monitoring device adapted in use to pass an electrical
      current through at least one electrode of the assembly and at
      least a corresponding part of the tooth, and to monitor the
      electrical response of the circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The electrode assembly according to the first aspect can
      therefore be used in association with a number of different
      monitoring devices which may form part of a larger monitoring
      system. It is envisaged that, in some cases, the assembly and
      monitoring device may together form a hand-held unit which a
      dentist could hold in a single hand and use to determine the
      electrical response of each tooth in question.<br>
      <br>

      present invention will now be described, with reference to the

      <br>
      [0057] FIG. 1 is a side view of a first example electrode assembly
      according to the invention, this having the approximate appearance
      of a toothbrush. The assembly comprises a holder 2 formed from
      polyamide The holder 2 is elongate and from one surface of the
      holder towards one end, a series of elements project substantially
      perpendicularly from a lower surface 3 of the holder 2. Two types
      of elements are illustrated in FIG. 1, the first type being
      electrically insulating elements 4, and the second being
      electrically conductive elements 5. The elements 4 are formed from
      a suitable insulating material such as nylon. The electrically
      conductive elements 5 are also formed from nylon, although in this
      case they are coated with an electrically conductive layer of
      carbon. This coating is provided over the entire exposed surface.
      As illustrated, each conductive element 5 is spaced from the next
      adjacent conductive element by an intervening insulating element
      4.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Referring to FIG. 2, which shows the assembly 1 when viewed
      from the end having the elements, it can be seen that a number of
      elements of both the conductive and insulating types are
      positioned into the plane of the figure of FIG. 1. Again, the
      conductive elements 5 are each separated from adjacent conductive
      elements 5 by insulating elements 4. The conductive elements
      therefore form an array of such elements, this being interleaved
      with a similar array of insulating elements 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The electrode assembly 1 in the first example is an
      "occlusal" electrode assembly in that it is adapted for applying
      electrical currents to an occlusal surface of a tooth. An upper
      part of a tooth 6 (including the occlusal surface) is illustrated
      schematically in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Each of the projecting elements of the present example has
      a length of about 5 millimetres and a diameter of about 100
      micrometres. The elements are substantially circular in
      cross-section although other geometrical shapes in cross-section
      are envisaged.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] As is illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, since the elements are
      anchored at the holder 2, each with a distal free end, the free
      end may be deflected about the respective anchoring point as is
      shown by the arrows "x" and "y" in FIGS. 1 and 2. The ease of
      deflection is controlled by the stiffness of the material used,
      the length of the element and its cross-section.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Since the exposed surfaces of the conductive elements 5 are
      arranged to be electrically conducting, each conductive element 5
      in the present example is an electrode 10. At the point where each
      of the elements 5 is anchored to the assembly 1 (for example by an
      adhesive or by melt bonding), the conductive coating is
      electrically connected to respective wires 11 which pass within
      the structure of the holder 2, to the other end of the holder 2
      which is remote from the elements. The wires may be formed from
      copper. They may also run along the outer surface of the holder
      provided they are suitably insulated. At the distal end of the
      holder, a connector 12 is provided, this having a series of pins
      13, each pin being connected to one of the wires 11. The connector
      may take any suitable form and be adapted to connect to a
      corresponding socket connector of a lead cable (not shown in FIG.
      1). The lead cable is in turn connected to a system for providing
      the electrical current to the electrodes 10 via the connector 12
      and wires 11 so as to perform the electrical impedance
      measurements.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In FIG. 1, each of the elements is illustrated as having
      approximately the same length. However, this is schematic since
      the occlusal surfaces of teeth typically comprise relatively deep
      fissures. In practice, the lengths of the elements are arranged so
      as to conform to the different levels of the occlusal surface as a
      function of position.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] FIG. 3 shows an example arrangement when viewed along the
      elements, in this case as an example modification to the first
      example, there is a larger number of insulating elements 4 than
      conducting elements 5. Each conductive element is surrounded by
      eight insulating elements. In FIG. 4, an example is shown of how
      the arrangement of conducting elements in FIG. 3 can be connected
      together such that four of the conducting elements 5 are
      electrically connected by wiring 11' so as to form a single
      electrode 10' having four elements 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] FIG. 5 shows an alternative arrangement in which a number
      of the projecting elements 5 are physically anchored together at
      their base or may even form a single component at their base
      anchor point within the holder 2. This is advantageous since only
      one of the elements 5 need contact the respective surface of the
      tooth so as to provide the required electrical connection.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] FIG. 6 shows the structure of a conductive element 5 in
      more detail, the internal (nylon) material 14 forming the main
      structure of the element is coated in a thin layer of carbon
      illustrated at 15. The thickness of the carbon layer may be
      typically 100 nanometres to 100 micrometres in thickness. FIG. 7
      shows the corresponding cross-section of the element 5. FIG. 8
      shows an alternative structure of the element 5 in which a coating
      is not used. In this case, the conductivity is provided by
      conductive particles embedded in a polymer matrix. The conductive
      particles may be carbon, gold, copper, nickel or other metals
      (including solid "noble" metal particles or such metals coated on
      a core material). The conductive particles are indicated at 16
      with the matrix material, such as any suitable plastic, being
      illustrated at 17. Alternatively a conductive matrix such as a
      conducting polymer matrix or metallic matrix (for example gold)
      could be used and therefore the need for conductive particles
      obviated.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] FIG. 9 shows various alternative configurations for the
      ends of the elements, including two forms of sharpened end, a
      hemispherical or rounded end, and a flat end. These arrangements
      can be used for elements in which the ends provide the contact
      points of the electrodes, for example in the case of solid
      conductive elements or coated conductive elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Whilst the extreme ends of the elements may be made to
      adopt certain geometries, the respective lengths of the elements
      may similarly be adapted to adopt certain geometries as shown in
      FIG. 10a to 10c. In FIGS. 10a to 10c, the elements are each
      arranged in groups. In FIG. 10a the elements in each group are of
      the same length and lengths of the elements in different groups
      are also the same.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In FIG. 10b the lengths of the elements are in accordance
      with a saw-tooth waveform. Whereas in FIG. 10c, the element
      lengths are in accordance with a substantially of sinusoidal
      waveform. In each case, the elements need not necessarily be
      arranged in groups or, when they are arranged in groups, the
      number in each group may be different.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] A second example electrode assembly is now described, this
      being adapted for providing simultaneous electrical contact of
      electrodes upon multiple surfaces of a tooth. This example is
      particularly suited for use with a premolar or molar tooth and is
      shown in FIG. 11. In this case, the holder 2 takes the general
      form of three connected sides of a rectangular prism. It therefore
      has three connected substantially planar parts, a first occlusal
      part 21 being designed to be located above the occlusal surface of
      a premolar or molar tooth. Two substantially planar parts 22
      project from the occlusal part, these being smooth surface parts.
      The holder 2 as a whole is therefore designed to sit on the
      occlusal surface of the tooth 6 (in this case being a premolar).
      FIG. 11 shows the holder 2 according to the second example
      correctly located. As is illustrated, three groups of elements are
      provided, these being occlusal elements and inward-facing and
      outward-facing elements, the terms "inward" and "outward"
      referring to the mouth in which the tooth 6 is positioned. The
      occlusal elements are illustrated at 23 with the inward elements
      (inward towards the mouth centre) being shown at 24, and those
      facing away from the mouth centre (outward) being shown at 25.
      Each of the three sets of elements 23, 24, 25 is of a length which
      generally conforms with the shape of the tooth 6 (see FIG. 11). It
      should be noted also in FIG. 11 that the elements 23 and 25 are
      simply drawn as straight lines for illustration purposes only. In
      practice, contact by these elements with the tooth causes them to
      deflect in use and this is illustrated with the elements 24. Note
      that, as in the first example, the elements 23, 24 and 25 are in
      each case separated by insulating elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Each of the optional configurations in association with the
      first example, including groups of elements, and how they are
      electrically connected together, are also envisaged with respect
      to the second example shown in FIG. 11. In FIG. 11 an electrical
      connector 12 and pins 13 are also illustrated, although the wiring
      between these and the respective electrodes 10 is not shown but of
      course is present.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Along the lower edge of the parts 22 (closest to the
      gingiva), electrically insulating pads 26 are attached so as to
      prevent the ingress of saliva between the electrodes 10, and also
      to prevent electrical contact between the gingiva and the
      lowermost electrodes. The presence of a large amount of saliva is
      undesirable since it provides a low impedance path between the
      electrodes. Similarly insulating pads 27 are provided between the
      sets of elements of the parts 21 and 22, so as to separate the
      elements from the surface 21 from coming into contact with those
      on the surfaces 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] With reference to FIG. 11, it will be appreciated that the
      assembly, and in particular the parts 21, 22, 26 and 27 all extend
      into the plane of the figure, with more elements being provided in
      this third dimension.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Whilst this second example is adapted for measurements of
      the occlusal and opposed free smooth surfaces, a modified example
      is envisaged in which further electrodes are provided for taking
      measurements upon the approximal surfaces. Since there is normally
      either contact or a close approach of, adjacent teeth along the
      approximal surfaces, such a modified embodiment may advantageously
      be provided with two parts (for each approximal surface) extending
      downwardly from the part 21 of FIG. 11 (parallel to the plane of
      the figure), one part being positioned to the inward side of the
      mouth, and the other to the outward side of the mouth with a gap
      between them.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] It will be understood that, with use of plastics materials
      for the holder 2, a degree of resilience and flexibility is
      provided by the holder such that the assembly may be positioned
      over the desired tooth. The spacing of the elements, together with
      their length and resilience is adjusted according to the
      application.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] A third example is now described which is capable of
      providing measurements upon all five surfaces of a tooth. This is
      illustrated in FIGS. 12 to 14. In this case, the elements 5 again
      project away from a holder 2. However, each element 5 is of a
      specialised resilient form. Each element 5 initially projects from
      the holder 2 in a first direction, curves outwardly (away from a
      central axis passing through the holder 2) and then inwardly once
      more to terminate once again in approximately the first direction.
      Each of the elements 5 can therefore be thought of as taking a
      similar form, each having a form curving outwardly and then
      inwardly again with respect to a central axis. The elements 5 are
      arranged symmetrically about this axis. This is shown in FIG. 12,
      with the central axis being indicated at 50.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] FIG. 13 shows the assembly of the third example positioned
      upon a molar tooth 6, this being illustrated schematically. In
      order to fit onto the tooth the elements 5 are deflected such that
      the tooth can be accommodated between the elements. When in use,
      the elements are biassed, due to their resilience, against the
      tooth surfaces, particularly the approximal 60 and free smooth
      surfaces 61. It will be noted that each of the elements 5 is this
      time provided with a number of contact electrodes 30, some nearer
      the holder being positioned, due to the deflection of the elements
      5, in contact with the occlusal surface 62. Each of the contact
      electrodes 30 is individually wired to the connector 12 attached
      to the holder 2. The number of contact electrodes 30 upon each
      element 5 may be selected according to the application in
      question.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The individual contact electrodes 30 may be formed from a
      suitable spot of metallic material with individual wires 11 being
      provided in the element 5. This is shown in FIG. 14. The
      connections by wires 11 inside the elements 5 may be provided by
      copper wires or tracks in an insulating polymeric matrix.
      Alternatively, individual insulated wires may be used, these being
      bundled together in a tube so as to form the element 5. These may
      be anchored additionally to a core element providing some or all
      of the resilience. A metal with an insulated coating can be used
      having a suitable modulus of elasticity to provide the required
      level of resilience without yielding. A spring steel or shape
      memory alloy could be used for this purpose. In an alternative
      form of this example, with fewer electrodes, each of the elements
      may be formed from stainless steel and each may comprise a single
      electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In each of the embodiments described the connector 12 has
      been positioned adjacent the holder 2. However, in some cases it
      may be beneficial to provide a short length of electrical wire to
      separate the connector 12 from the holder 2 such that a reliable
      connection with an external lead of monitoring apparatus can be
      provided. This can therefore be kept clear of the animal or human
      mouth in which the electrode assembly is positioned.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The electrode assembly in each case is used in conjunction
      with a system for applying electrical currents to teeth and
      monitoring the performance of the localised circuits formed. A
      schematic representation of such a system 100 is shown in FIG. 15.
      Here a monitoring device 101 provides electrical currents to parts
      of the tooth 6 using an electrode assembly 1 such as any assembly
      described earlier. In this case the connector 12 is spaced from
      the holder 2 by a short length of wire 102. This is connected
      electrically to a corresponding connector 103 of a lead 104. The
      lead 104 contains a number of wires to allow circuits to be formed
      using the electrodes of the elements 5 of assembly 1, and is
      connected to the monitoring device 101. The device 101 may be a
      self-contained unit for monitoring and also processing the
      electrical response of the circuits formed using the electrodes.
      It may also represent a system comprising a number of units
      including for example a computer for processing the data. In
      addition, each of the components shown in FIG. 15 may be formed
      within a single unit which is held in one hand by a dentist. This
      might be the case in a device where a visual indication is given
      to the dentist regarding the condition of the particular tooth or
      teeth in question, this being provided for example audibly or via
      a "traffic lights" series of LEDs.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] FIG. 16A shows an alternative monitoring system, this being
      hand-held (in a single hand) rather like a pen. All of the
      elements within the system 100 of FIG. 15 are contained within the
      single unit 200. An elongate hand-held part 201 contains a power
      supply, signal generator, microprocessor and associated
      electronics so as to provide electrical signals to a plurality of
      electrodes within a detachable head portion 202. The unit could be
      provided with rechargeable batteries and adapted so as to fit in a
      charging cradle.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] A display is provided at 203 in the form of red, orange and
      green LEDs which indicate the condition of the tooth being
      monitored, green representing a healthy tooth for example. The
      head portion 202 is detachable from the hand-held unit part and in
      this case contains electrodes for monitoring two adjacent teeth.
      The part of the head portion containing the electrodes is angled
      with respect to the elongation axis of the hand-held portion 201.
      The head portion 202 forms part of a fourth example assembly of
      the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The electrodes 5 in this case are provided in the form of
      two opposed conducting "brushes". These are indicated at 204a and
      204b respectively. The elements of the brushes in this example are
      formed from stainless steel coated carbon-loaded plastic so as to
      provide a very low impedance. Each brush electrode 204a, 204b is
      in the form of half of a "bottle brush" that is, a half of a
      cylindrical brush in which bristles project from a central region
      in a radial manner and a large number of such brushes project
      radially along the axis of the cylinder. The cylinder is divided
      in half along its axis so the brushes of each electrode 204a, 204b
      can be thought of as projecting radially through up to 180 degrees
      of angle about the cylinder axis.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The electrode brushes 204a and 204b are electrically
      insulated from each other by a central insulating barrier 205. The
      barrier 205 may take the form of a plastic plate or strip. In the
      present case the barrier is rectangular in design with a thickness
      of 80 to 100 micrometres, a height of about 2 millimetres and a
      length of about 10 millimetres. The upper and lower edges are
      preferably bevelled (at an angle of typically 60 degrees).<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The assembly is shown in more detail in FIGS. 16B and C.
      FIG. 16B shows the barrier 205 and one of the brush electrodes, in
      this case the electrode 204a. Each of the bristles of the brush
      204a project from an elongate wire 206a which is mounted to the
      barrier 205. A similar electrode wire 206b is provided upon the
      other side of the barrier for the electrode 204b. The wires pass
      into the plastic head 202 and are coupled electrically to the
      signal generator and so on, via connectors in the head 202 and
      hand-held portion 301. In FIG. 16A, it should be noted that the
      bristles project at various angles out of the plane of the figure.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] The electrode wires have a diameter of about 0.3
      millimetres. The brush electrode elements are about 0.6 to 0.8
      millimetres in length with a thickness of about 0.1 to 0.2
      millimetres.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] As will be appreciated, a large number of bristles are
      provided for the electrode brushes, each of these are electrically
      conducting and may take the form of the various electrodes
      discussed earlier. In the present example there are up to 20 rows
      of bristles, the rows being spaced apart by a gap of about 0.5
      millimetres. The distal end of the barrier extends beyond the end
      of the bristles by about 1 millimetre.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The bristles together act effectively as a common electrode
      such that all bristles have an equal electrical potential for the
      electrode 204a. Similarly, all points upon the electrode 204b also
      have an equal electrical potential although the electrodes 204a
      and 204b are electrically isolated from each other so that they
      may be used to perform measurements upon adjacent teeth. FIG. 16D
      is a view looking along the axis of the electrodes and here is can
      be seen that the bristles of the electrode 204a and 204b do indeed
      project through substantially 180 degrees of angle each, about the
      elongate axis of the electrode as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The two electrodes 204a and 204b can be operated
      independently of one another using a switch placed upon the
      assembly body. A trigger switch is also provided so that an
      operator can initiate the electrical impedance measurement in
      question.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] By way of further explanation, the barrier (which can be
      thought of as a separating strip), is aligned approximately
      orthogonally to the elongation axis of the hand-held portion 201
      in each of the "horizontal" and "vertical" planes. When the
      hand-held portion 201 is held such that the display 203 faces the
      buccal part of the mouth (away from the teeth), the electrodes are
      inserted into the interproximal space between the two teeth whose
      impedance it is desired to measure. The electrodes are pushed
      lingually into the contact area and thereafter in an occlusal
      direction until firmly positioned. The mesial of the two brush
      electrodes contacts the distal surface of one of the two
      approximating teeth and the distal of the brush electrodes
      contacts the mesial surface of the other approximating tooth. The
      assembly of this fourth example allows the bristles to deform and
      conform to the three-dimensional curvature of the approximating
      surfaces of the teeth. This facilitates the electrical measurement
      of each of the two surfaces to be performed independently, with no
      short-circuit between the two brush electrodes.<br>
      [0091] When in use therefore, this electrode assembly is suitable
      for performing separate measurements upon opposed surfaces of
      adjacent teeth. In particular, it is suitable for performing
      measurements upon the approximal surfaces, particularly adjacent
      the gingiva, although it could also be used for the parts of the
      approximal surfaces which border the respective occlusal surfaces
      of the adjacent teeth. The arrangement shown in FIGS. 16A to 16D
      has a high degree of symmetry which allows this assembly to be
      used in all four quadrants of the mouth of a patient (upper and
      lower and left and right parts of the mouth).<br>
      [0092] The system shown in FIG. 16A is advantageous in that it is
      simple to use and the detachable nature of the head 202 allows
      various different electrode arrangements to be used with a single
      common part 201 (containing the electronics). Various teeth may
      therefore be investigated by electrical impedance measurements
      using interchangeable heads 202 and different heads may be
      provided for adults and children.<br>
      [0093] This system is described only in a schematic and general
      manner since the electrode assembly may be used in association
      with many different systems. The electrode assembly can be used to
      implement many forms of electrical caries detection, including AC
      Impedance Spectroscopy and Electrical Impedance Tomography amongst
      others. These systems are riot limited to the monitoring of human
      teeth and are intended to include systems for monitoring animal
      teeth. In either case this may be in vitro or in vivo, with the in
      vivo application of course providing many benefits relating to
      dental health.<br>

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The invention concerns cosmetic and therapeutic treatment
      of tissue, such as tooth, to effect, for instance, whitening and
      tissue re-building through mineralisation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Iontophoresis is a non-invasive method of propelling high
      concentrations of a charged substance, normally a medication or a
      bioactive agent, using a small electric charge applied to an
      iontophoretic chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] It is known to use iontophoresis in transdermal drug
      delivery. Also, iontophoresis is known to be used in conjunction
      with fluoride containing compounds to treat dentine
      hypersensitivity.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Simone, J. L., et al, Iontophoresis: An Alternative in the
      Treatment of Incipient Caries? Braz. Dent. J, 1995, 6(2), 123-129
      describes, inter alia, treating dental lesions iontophoretically
      with sodium fluoride and claimed to find good remineralisation due
      to the formation of calcium fluoride, though this was not
      validated.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] CPP-ACP is a casein derived peptide, with added calcium and
      phosphate, specifically, casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium
      phosphate. CPP-ACP acts as a calcium and phosphate reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Conventionally, CPP-ACP is delivered to a tooth surface in
      several vehicles, such as chewing gum, mouth wash, toothpaste and
      other restorative materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Thus, for example, International Patent Application No. WO
      02/094204 describes a composition for dental restoration including
      a dental restorative material and an effective amount of a casein
      phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) complex or
      casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate
      (CPP-ACFP) complex.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] When used herein, the term remineralisation is used to mean
      mineralisation of an area to which further material is being
      added, whether or not there was insufficient material at the area
      before the treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] According to a first aspect of the invention, there is
      provided a method of remineralising tissue which comprises
      pre-conditioning the tissue to remove protein and/lipids, and then
      applying to the tissue a remineralising agent whilst separately,
      sequentially or simultaneously applying iontophoresis.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Preferably, the remineralising agent is a source of
      phosphate, calcium and water.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Preferably, the method comprises the remineralisation of
      hypo-mineralised or demineralised tooth.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In one aspect, the method is a cosmetic treatment which is
      directed to lightening or whitening tooth.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The method may be directed to the prevention or treatment
      of tooth erosion.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In another aspect the method may comprise the
      remineralisation of bone.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Preferably, the remineralising agent comprises casein
      phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP).<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The remineralising agent preferably contains fluoride. An
      example of such a remineralising agent is casein
      phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate (CPP-ACFP).<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Preferably, the remineralising agent includes one or more
      remineralisation enhancers. Typically the remineralising enhancers
      are sources of calcium and phosphate ions. Examples of
      remineralisation enhancers may include, but are not limited to,
      Dicalcium phosphate dehydrate (DCPD), mineral brushite; Dicalcium
      phosphate anhydrous (DCPA), mineral monetite; Octacalcium
      phosphate (OCP); alpha-tricalcium phosphate (alpha-TCP);
      beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP); Amorphous calcium phosphate
      (ACP); Calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA); Hydroxyapatite (HA
      or OHAp); Fluorapatite (FA or FAp); Tetrcalcium phosphate (TTCP or
      TetCP), mineral hilgenstockite). More preferably, the
      remineralisation enhancer is strontium.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The remineralising agent may include at least two
      remineralisation enhancers wherein one of the enhancers is a
      source of calcium ions and the other is a source of phosphate
      ions. For example the remineralising agent may include a source of
      calcium e.g. calcium hydroxide and a source of phosphate e.g.
      orthophosphoric acid. The ratio of calcium:phosphate in the
      remineralising agent may be between 1:1 and 22:10. Preferably the
      ratio of calcium:phosphate is about 10:6 (i.e. 1.67), which
      represents the ratio of calcium to phosphate ions in calcium
      hydroxyapatite. Alternatively the ratio of calcium:phosphate in
      the remineralising agent may be between 9:6 and 22:10.
      Alternatively still the ration of calcium:phosphate in the
      remineralising agent may greater than 1:1 but less than 3:2 (i.e.
      1.0 up to 1.49).<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The remineralising agents may thus be selected from the
      following:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] i) Ca:P ratio=1.67: e.g. Hydroxyapatite: Fluorapatite.<br>
      ii) Ca:P ratio=1.5-2.2 (but not 1.67): e.g. Alpha-Tricalcium
      phosphate; Beta-Tricalcium phosphate; Amorphous calcium phosphate;
      Calcium deficient Hydroxyapatite; Tetracalcium phosphate, mineral
      hilgenstockite.<br>
      iii) Ca:P ratio=1-1.49: e.g. Dicalcium phosphate dehydrate,
      mineral brushite; Dicalcium phosphate anhydrous, mineral monetite.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The remineralising agent may be prepared from its component
      parts by 'driving' in calcium ions iontophoretically (in aqueous
      solution) and subsequently changing the polarity of the set-up and
      'drive' in phosphate ions (in aqueous solution) with a second
      sequence of iontophoresis-the calcium and phosphate ions would
      thus 'meet' within the lesion during the second sequence of
      iontophoresis and precipitate out as a calcium phosphate mineral
      (or minerals). The hydroxyl ion of the generated apatite would
      come from the aqueous solution. The water-soluble
      calcium-containing agent might be, for example, calcium hydroxide,
      calcium chloride, or calcium nitrate; the water-soluble
      phosphate-containing agent might be, for example, orthophosphoric
      acid (H3PO4), sodium (or potassium) hydrogen phosphate, sodium (or
      potassium) dihydrogen phosphate or magnesium phosphate. The
      calcium agent containing solution may be separate from the
      phosphate agent containing solution, or combined into one
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Thus a preferred method of the invention comprises the
      steps of: i) pre-conditioning the tissue to remove protein
      and/lipids, and ii) applying to the tissue a calcium-containing
      aqueous solution and/or phosphate-containing aqueous solution
      whilst separately, sequentially or simultaneously applying
      iontophoresis. Optionally after sufficient time for the ingress of
      a predetermined amount of calcium ions, determined (indirectly) by
      measurement of the amount of current discharged into the tooth,
      this first phase of remineralisation would be stopped and the
      polarity of the iontophoresis electrode at that surface would be
      changed to negative; the remineralising agent would be changed to
      an aqueous solution of orthophosphoric acid and the iontophoresis
      method re-applied in order to cause the ingress of phosphate ions
      into the tooth. The reversal of the previous iontophoresis
      polarity will cause the previously migrated calcium ions within
      the tooth to migrate towards the surface as the phosphate ions are
      migrating into the tooth-this combination of calcium and phosphate
      ions, in aqueous solution, within the tooth will result in the
      deposition of orthophosphates within the tooth-i.e.
      remineralisation. This second phase of iontophoresis will be
      stopped when a pre-determined level of current has been discharged
      into the tooth.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Thus a further preferred method of the invention comprises
      the steps of i) pre-conditioning the tissue to remove protein
      and/lipids ii) applying to the tissue a calcium-containing aqueous
      solution or phosphate-containing aqueous solution whilst
      separately, sequentially or simultaneously applying iontophoresis,
      and iii) either (a) applying a phosphate-containing aqueous

      <br>
      [0023] Preferably, the pre-conditioning step is performed, with or
      without the application of iontophoresis, prior to application of
      the remineralising agent/iontophoresis.<br>

      and calcium.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Preferably, the remineralising agent comprises casein

      <br>
      [0031] Preferably, the pre-conditioning agent and the

      <b>MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0033] As indicated above, the present invention provides a method
      of remineralising hypo-mineralised or de-mineralised tooth.
      However, the method may be utilised in the remineralisation of
      other hypo-mineralised or de-mineralised tissue, such as, bone.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] A variety of remineralising agents may be used, including a
      mixture of remineralising agents. The remineralising agent may
      depend upon the tissue to be treated. However, preferably, the
      remineralising agent is a phosphate or calcium source, preferably
      a source of phosphate and calcium. An especially preferred
      remineralising agent is casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium
      phosphate (CPP-ACP). For use in the remineralisation of tooth, the
      remineralising agent may be a fluoride containing agent as
      hereinbefore described, such as casein phosphopeptide-amorphous
      calcium fluoride phosphate (CPP-ACFP). Other remineralising agents
      may comprise calcium phosphate compounds, such as fluoroapatite,
      monetite, brushite, amorphous calcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite,
      etc. Furthermore, it may be possible to incorporate additional
      elements in the remineralising agent of the invention which may
      enhance the remineralisation effect, such as strontium.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] It will be understood by the person skilled in the art that
      the terms hypo-mineralised tissue and demineralised tissue are
      intended to include any tissue that is deficient in its level of
      mineralization and includes tissue, such as tooth, that is
      substantially or completely demineralised, e.g. as a result of the
      dental caries process, thus including dental caries lesions, or a
      result of acid erosion, thus including 'surface-softened' enamel
      or dentine.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The iontophoresis may comprise the application of a
      voltage, e.g. a fixed voltage, or a current, e.g. a fixed current.
      Alternatively, the iontophoresis may comprise the application of a
      mixture of voltage and current, for example, the combination of
      voltage and current may be applied in specific sequences so as to
      optimise remineralisation.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In addition, in the method of the invention a
      preconditioning step is also included prior to application of the
      remineralising agent/iontophoresis. The pre-conditioning step may
      vary but may, for example, comprise the removal of proteins and/or
      lipids prior to application of the remineralising
      agent/iontophoresis. Although a variety of pre-conditioning steps
      may be used, preferably, the preconditioning step comprises a
      variety of processes or a mixture of processes. Any suitable
      protein removing agent can be used in the preconditioning step of
      the present invention. The agent is required to reduce the
      proteinaceous barrier formed over the surface to be treated, such
      as the pellicle over teeth or the exogenous protein within a
      caries lesion. The preconditioning step may optionally include the
      use of iontophoresis and the various preconditioning agents, e.g.
      protein removing agents, may be used in a variety of combinations
      and/or sequences. Furthermore, any of the pre-conditioning agents
      may be propelled into a hypo-mineralised or demineralised region,
      e.g. caries lesion, by iontophoresis to optimise the disruption of
      the protein layer and then the polarity of the iontophoresis
      reversed in order to aid the removal the proteinacious material
      from the hypo-mineralised or demineralised tissue. Examples of
      suitable agents include bleach, detergent, chaotropic agents such
      as urea, high phosphate concentrations, cocktails of proteases
      (e.g. endopeptidases, proteinases and exopeptidases) and any other
      protein solubilising, disrupting or hydrolysing agent. Examples of
      suitable bleaches include sodium hypochlorite, and peroxide
      bleaches. In a preferred embodiment, the bleach is an alkaline
      bleach. In a further preferred embodiment the alkaline bleach is
      sodium hypochlorite. The protein disrupting agent acts to
      solubilise and partially or wholly remove proteins from the
      surface of the tooth mineral, e.g. proteins of the pellicle on the
      tooth surface. However, preferably the preconditioning step
      comprises treatment with an acid, such as an organic acid, e.g.
      acetic acid, an inorganic acid, e.g. phosphoric acid, or a
      bleaching agent, e.g. hypochlorite, for example, sodium
      hypochlorite.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The remineralising agent may be applied in a variety of
      forms, for example, in the form of a gel or mousse. For use in the
      treatment of tooth other oral applications known per se may be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Pre-conditioning is preferably carried out not more than
      one minute before the application of the remineralising agent.
      More preferably, the remineralising agent is applied almost
      contemporaneously, i.e. within seconds, of the preconditioning.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] A preferred treatment sequence involves repeated
      conditioning followed by remineralising, particularly in a case
      where the remineralising agent includes material, such as protein,
      which is removed in a subsequent conditioning step.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The present invention further provides a method of cosmetic
      treatment of tissue by application to the tissue of a
      remineralising agent whilst separately, sequentially or
      simultaneously applying iontophoresis.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] It will be further understood by the person skilled in the
      art that the method of the invention may also be advantageous in
      the field of orthopaedics, for example, in the treatment of bone
      pathologies in mammals, i.e. human or animals, such as fractures
      and/or during surgery.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The present invention provides improved remineralisation of
      tissue. However, conventional methods of remineralisation of tooth
      generally comprise remineralisation of the surface tissue, i.e.
      remineralisation of enamel. It is a particular advantage of the
      present invention that the method and/or use provide for
      remineralisation of dentine. Dentine is the term for a hard
      substance which is related to bone and forms the core of the tooth
      in mammals and man. Dentine consists to the extent of
      approximately 30% of a cell-free organic base substance, in
      particular glycoproteins in which collagen fibres are
      incorporated. The inorganic constituents are predominantly
      hydroxyapatite, fluoroapatite and small amounts of carbonates,
      magnesium and trace elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The present invention further provides a kit for use in
      iontophoretic remineralising treatment of tissue comprising a
      pre-conditioning agent and a remineralising agent. The
      remineralising agent may comprise a source of calcium and
      phosphate ions such as defined herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Preferably, the pre-conditioning agent and the
      remineralising agent are present in the kit in a suitable form for
      application, for instance, a liquid or a gel form.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The kit may also provide an applicator for applying the, or
      each, agent to the site of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The EAER pre-treatment and iontophoresis remineralisation
      treatment procedure is implemented with the aid of a kit
      comprising several or all of the following: (1) the EAER
      remineralisation smart applicator pen; (2) battery pack and/or
      optional mains supply/recharger; (3) a set of disposable
      pre-treatment electrode pads which attach to the electrode of the
      EAER pen; (4) bottle of hypochlorite pre-treatment hydrogel, paste
      or liquid; (5) a bottle of peroxide pre-treatment hydrogel, paste
      or liquid; (6) a set of disposable EAER remineralisation electrode
      pads which attach to the electrode of the EAER pen; (7) one or
      more bottles of hydrogel, paste or liquid containing the
      remineralisation agents specified above including: CPP-ACP,
      CPP-ACPF, etc; (8) all necessary wiring to complete the
      iontophoresis circuit, including a wrist-attached or
      mouth-attached counter electrode; (9) full instructions. The gels
      complete the electrical path between the electrode pad and the
      tooth. Further optional add-on kits would supply dental trays,
      strips or holders or extension applicators.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The pre-treatment electrode pads (3) and remineralisation
      electrode pads (6) provide a disposable barrier between the EAER
      pen electrode and the gel for cross-infection control purposes,
      and also provide a support for the hydrogel. Alternatively, the
      pads could be washable and sterilisable. They would preferably be
      composed of electrically conductive material such as carbon-filled
      polymer or graphite felt, or high surface area silver/silver
      chloride electrodes. Alternatively, they may be thin,
      non-conductive, open, porous sponge-like materials such as
      silicone or dried hydrogel which allow the applied hydrogel, paste
      or liquid to permeate throughout the material, providing an
      ionically conductive path to the underlying EAER pen electrode. In
      another embodiment the hydrogels may be applied directly to the
      EAER pen electrode without the use of an intervening electrode pad
      (3) or (6).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] To increase shelf-life, the pre-treatment gels or pastes
      (4) and (5) would preferably use an inorganic-based hydrogel or
      paste, such as inorganic gel formers tricalcium silicate,
      dicalcium silicate, and sodium silicate, or a non-reactive organic
      hydrogel such as polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl
      alcohols, hydroxymethyl cellulose, konjac, p-HEMA
      (polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate) and
      polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene. Alternatively, the pre-treatment
      gel would be prepared immediately before application by mixing the
      dried or partially-dried hydrogel with the water-based
      pre-treatment agent. The remineralisation gels or pastes (7) may
      be based on organic hydrogels or pastes. The hydrogel should be
      non-toxic, non-irritant and easily mouldable to the tooth contour.
      Examples of such hydrogels are the non-reactive hydrogels
      mentioned above. These viscous gels would have viscosities on the
      order of 100,000 to 1,000,000 cp. Solutions or preparations with
      lower viscosities, such as aqueous solutions and glycerin-based
      compositions can also be used. Generally, neutral pH gels are
      advantageous; however, the pH is preferably optimized to allow the
      ionized form of the pre-treatment or remineralization agent to
      exist at a sufficient concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The Tooth-whitening (TW) and pre-treatment procedure is
      implemented with a similar kit, comprising of the above parts with
      the addition of: various tooth whitening agents in the form of a
      gel, paste or liquid substituted for, or used in addition to, the
      remineralisation agent (7). In addition, the EAER pen supplied
      would be modified with the TW (Tooth Whitening) voltage modulation
      programme memory card and/or processor. The gels or pastes would
      be organic-based as outlined above.<br>

      specification, the singular encompasses the plural unless the
      context otherwise requires. In particular, where the indefinite
      article is used, the specification is to be understood as
      contemplating plurality as well as singularity, unless the context

      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0058] In this experiment the current-time responses of an
      extracted tooth after the application of -1 V at the working
      electrode were recorded. One electrode (the shorted
      reference/counter electrode) was a 0.5 mm stainless steel wire
      inserted into the tooth root. The other electrode (the working
      electrode) was a Pt sheet electrode of area ca 0.25 cm&lt;2
      &gt;held in contact with a saline-soaked tissue pad, which in turn
      was held in contact with the tooth surface close to the enamel
      lesion.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] FIG. 1 shows the saline response (upper dotted line)
      measured after the tooth was previously held in contact with a
      hypochlorite-soaked pad for 3 mins. The initial current after this
      topical hypochlorite pre-treatment was 18 [mu]A, over 20% higher
      than that of the tooth before pre-treatment, and the extended-time
      current was similar. The lower, solid trace shows the saline tooth
      response for the same tooth measured after being held in contact
      with a hypochlorite pad under electrically-assisted (EA)
      pre-treatment for 3 mins at -1 V applied at the working electrode.
      The initial current is similar, but the extended-time current is
      over five times larger (i.e. the current is more negative, being
      lower down the negative current scale) after EA hypochlorite
      pre-treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0060] FIG. 2 shows a comparison of two lesions in one tooth
      before and after treatment using CPP-ACP (Tooth Mousse) as the
      remineralising agent. Analysis of the mean mineral density of the
      lesions resulted in Demineralisation Parameters of 0.76 (left
      side) and 0.83 (right side) prior to treatment and 0.92 (left) and
      0.83 (right) after treatment. This Demineralisation Parameter was
      derived by a comparison of average grey-scale levels within the
      Micro-CT image of: a) the lesion and b) the healthy tissue.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] This in vitro demonstration indicates that, applying a
      current at a level safe and not perceived by patients at a fixed
      voltage to a pre-conditioned natural caries lesion, in combination
      with CPP-ACP in the form of Tooth Mousse resulted in significant
      (approximately 67%) remineralisation of the lesion (as measured by
      Image Analysis of Micro-CT images of the tooth before and after
      treatment) after 3 hours electrophoresis/iontophoresis
      application. The passive application of the agent Tooth
      Mousse-Plus (also known as MI paste) to the other natural caries
      lesion on the same tooth for 3 hours resulted in minimal
      remineralisation (measured on Micro-CT images).<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The comparison in FIG. 2 is of two lesions in one tooth
      before and after treatment. The images represent an approximately
      10 micron thickness horizontal Micro-CT (XCT slice) through the
      same path of the tooth with separate mesial and distal lesions.
      The XCT image on the left shows the lesions prior to any
      treatment. The image on the right shows the lesions after the
      lesions were pre-treated to remove protein and lipids. The lesion
      on the left was treated with CPP-ACP and iontophoresis for three
      hours, whilst the lesion on the right was treated only with
      CPP-ACP plus Fluoride (MI paste) for three hours.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0063] FIG. 3 shows an incisor tooth before any treatment, after
      pre-conditioning and after the iontophoresis-remineralising method
      has been applied.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The uppermost image shows an extracted incisor tooth which
      exhibits both a large carious cavity (caused by tooth decay),
      which is significantly discoloured, and areas of dark
      discolouration on the labial (flat) facing surface of the crown of
      the tooth, adjacent to the carious cavity in the direction of the
      incisal (lower) edge of the tooth. This image was taken prior to
      any treatment being carried out.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The middle image shows the same tooth after 2 minutes of
      pre-conditioning with sodium hypochlorite solution. There is very
      little difference between the uppermost and middle images in terms
      of tooth discolouration.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The lowermost image shows the tooth after the
      iontophoresis-remineralisation has been carried out using Tooth
      Mousse (CPP-ACP) as the re-mineralising agent for 1 hour. It is
      clear that the cavity has now lost its dark discolouration
      completely. The dark discolourations in the enamel of the crown of
      the tooth adjacent to the cavity have also disappeared. There is
      some increased whitening of the edges of the carious cavity at
      both the upper and lower margins of the cavity.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] These images demonstrate the tooth-whitening effect of the
      iontophoresis-remineralising method.<br>
