      <p>In Europe half of the cars sold are using diesel engines. The
        pollution from these cars (carbon particles, nitrogen oxides NOX
        and unburned hydrocarbons) is to be more strictly restricted by
        the EU regulations. </p>
      <p>Risø Danish Technical University has started a new project to
        develop an effective method for making diesel engines cleaner.
        The Danish Council for Strategic Research has approved DKK 17
        million ($2.9 million) to finance the four year project for a
        new DeNOx technology. </p>
      <p>The university is working on an Electrochemical flue gas
        purification method. Compared with existing methods with
        particulate filters and SCR Catalyst or recirculation of the
        exhaust gas, the electrochemical flue gas purification has a big
        advantage: it can do all the purification in the same filter
        unit. So nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon particles and unburned
        hydrocarbons are being stopped together. </p>
      <p>The new device has another advantage, as it does not use
        expensive materials to work (existing devices usually contain
        nitrogen-containing urea as a reducing agent), so it will lower
        the price of filtering the exhaust from diesel engines, contrary
        to the existing methods. </p>
      <p>In the electrochemical flue gas purification method, the engine
        is completely separated by the filtering process and it could
        lead also to fuel savings. In the future, the same technology
        could also be used in the purification of flue gas from power
        plants, maybe also in the shipping industry. </p>
      <p>For this project, the University will involve more people, five
        PhDs and two post-docs in the near future. The team has the
        objective of developing a successful prototype using the
        electrochemical flue gas purification method to be used
        economically in diesel engines. </p>

      <p><b>1. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] The present invention relates to a method and apparatus
        for electrochemical reduction of nitrogen oxides in a mixture of
        nitrogen oxides and oxygen. </p>
      <p>[0002] In an aspect, the invention relates to a working
        electrode for an electrochemical reactor, an electro-chemical
        reactor comprising such a working electrode, a method of
        reducing nitrogen oxides in a mixture of nitrogen oxides and
        oxygen using an working electrode comprising an electric
        conductive ceramic of lanthanum manganite doped with an oxygen
        ion vacancy quencher. </p>
      <p>[0003] In another aspect, the invention relates to an
        electro-chemical reactor comprising nitrogen oxide absorber
        adapted for electrochemical regeneration, and a method of
        electrochemical reduction of nitrogen oxides in a mixture of
        nitrogen oxides and oxygen using such an electro-chemical
        reactor. </p>
      <p><b>THE TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>[0004] In the present context the expression "nitrogen oxides",
        which are often denoted by the term NO.sub.x, is intended to
        designate one or more compounds of oxygen and nitrogen, e.g. NO
        and NO.sub.2, etc. Further, the expression "nitrogen oxide
        absorber" is intended to designate an absorber for nitrogen
        oxides, e.g. in form of a compound or a composition of
        compounds. </p>
      <p>[0005] Reduction of NO.sub.x in presence of oxygen is known. </p>
      <p>[0006] In a method adapted to combustion processes, an excess
        of fuel is added for a short period of time thereby providing a
        reducing agent, i.e. addition of CH, whereby NO.sub.x is reduced
        according to the concurrent reactions: </p>
      <p>2NO.sub.x+xCH+x/2O.sub.2-&gt;N.sub.2+xCO.sub.2+x/2H.sub.2O (1)
      </p>
      <p>11/2O.sub.2+CH-&gt;CO.sub.2+.sup.1/2H.sub.2O (2) </p>
      <p>[0007] However, the addition of CH affects the combustion
        processes and thereby the produced heat of the engine. </p>
      <p>[0008] In electrochemical reduction of NO.sub.x in presence of
        O.sub.2, concurrent electrode processes between electrons and
        NO.sub.x and O.sub.2 takes place at the working electrode, e.g.
        as expressed by the electrode processes at the cathode: </p>
      <p>2NO.sub.x+4xe.sup.--&gt;N.sub.2+2xO.sup.2- (3) </p>
      <p>O.sub.2+4e.sup.--&gt;2O.sup.2- (4) </p>
      <p>[0009] For a given potential and current density, the available
        electrons react with either of the reactants NO.sub.x or O.sub.2
      </p>
      <p>[0010] A method of increasing the selectivity of NO.sub.x
        -reduction relative to O.sub.2-reduction comprises increasing
        the amount of NO.sub.x relative to that of O.sub.2 prior to
        electrochemical reduction. Alcaline earth metals such as MgO or
        CaO have been used to absorb NO.sub.x. Subsequently, NO.sub.x is
        released by heat regeneration before electrochemical reduction
        of NO.sub.x. </p>
      <p>[0011] Another method of increasing the selectivity of
        NO.sub.x-reduction relative to O.sub.2-reduction comprises
        increasing the access of NO.sub.x to reactive electrons of the
        working electrode compared to the access of O.sub.2, or
        equivalent by increasing access of electrons of the working
        electrode to NO.sub.x compared to access of electrons to O. </p>

        composition of a gas stream including removing SO and NO; in an
        embodiment said device comprises gadolinia stabilized ceria as

        reduction of NO.sub.x to N.sub.2 and O.sub.2 in solid-oxid
        electrochemical cells. </p>

      <p><b>2. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0016] It is an object of the present invention to seek to
        provide an improved method and apparatus for selective
        electrochemical reduction of nitrogen oxides in presence of
        oxygen. </p>
      <p>[0017] It is an object of the present invention to seek to
        provide such an improved method and apparatus for selective
        electrochemical reduction of nitrogen oxides in presence of
        oxygen in gaseous combustion mixtures. </p>
      <p>[0018] Further objects appear from the description elsewhere. </p>
      <p><b>[0019] Solution According to the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>[0020] According to the present invention, these objects are
        fulfilled by providing a working electrode for an
        electrochemical reactor, the electrochemical reactor comprising
        a working electrode, a counter electrode, and an ion-selective
        electrolyte; the working electrode comprising an electric
        conductive ceramic oxide material having the general formula: </p>
      <p>A.sub.xA'.sub.(1-x)B.sub.yB'.sub.(1-y)O.sub.(3-.delta.) </p>
      <p>[0021] wherein A and A' designate first substitution metals of
        similar sizes, said first substitution metals having a high
        efficiency for reducing vacancies for oxygen ions,
        0.ltoreq.x.ltoreq.51; </p>
      <p>[0022] B and B' designate second substitution metals of similar
        sizes, said second substitution metals being of smaller sizes
        than those of said first substitution metals, and having a high
        transition efficiency between oxidation states,
        0.ltoreq.y.ltoreq.1; </p>
      <p>[0023] O designates oxygen; </p>
      <p>[0024] and .delta. is a small number, positive or negative,
        that allows for compensation of differences in valences of said
        metals. </p>
      <p>[0025] It has surprisingly turned out that selecting a working
        electrode comprising an electric conductive ceramic oxide
        material having the ABO.sub.3 formula as defined, the number of
        vacances in the oxygen ion lattice can be minimized whereby
        oxygen ion conductivity in the ceramic oxide material can be
        minimized. </p>
      <p>[0026] Consequently, a working electrode having high
        selectivity for reduction of NO.sub.x and at the same low
        activity for reduction of O.sub.2 can be provided. </p>
      <p>[0027] The components A, A', B, and B' of the AA'BB'0.sub.3
        material can be selected within wide ranges. </p>
      <p>[0028] In a preferred embodiment, the working electrode A is
        selected from the group consisting of rare earth metals: Sc, Y,
        La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, hb, Lu; metals of
        group 3a: Al, Ga, and In; and croup 3b: Sc, Y, La of the
        periodic table, preferably La, Gd, In and Y; </p>
      <p>[0029] and A' is selected from the group consisting of alkaline
        earth metals: Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba; and Eu, preferably Ca, Sr, Ba,
        and Eu </p>
      <p>[0030] whereby it is achieved that the electrical and
        chemical/catalytic properties of the working electrode can be
        tailored within wide ranges. </p>
      <p>[0031] In another preferred imbodiment, B and B' are selected
        from the group consisting of transition metals: </p>
      <p>[0032] croup 1b: Cu and Ag; </p>
      <p>[0033] group 2b: Zn; </p>
      <p>[0034] group 3a: Ga, In, and Tl; </p>
      <p>[0035] group 3b: Sc, and Y; </p>
      <p>[0036] group 4b: Ti, Zr, Hf; </p>
      <p>[0037] group 5b: V, Nb, Ta; </p>
      <p>[0038] group 6b: Cr, Mo, W; </p>
      <p>[0039] group 7b: Mn and Re; and </p>
      <p>[0040] group 8: Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt; </p>
      <p>[0041] preferably Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni </p>
      <p>[0042] whereby it is further achieved that the electrical and
        chemical/catalytic properties of the working electrode can be
        tailored within wide ranges. </p>
      <p>[0043] The actual elements and stoichiometric coefficients can
        be selected by experimentation. </p>
      <p>[0044] For y=0, a particularly preferred working electrode
        comprises a LSM material. </p>
      <p>[0045] In a preferred embodiment, the ceramic oxide comprises
        lanthanum manganite doped with strontium oxide,
        La.sub.xSr.sub.1-xMnO.sub.3, the stoichiometric coefficient 1-x
        being in the range 0.05 to 0.20, preferably 0.10 to 0.18, most
        preferred about 0.15 whereby a good selectivity can be obtained
        for reduction of nitrogen oxides compared to reduction of
        oxygen. </p>
      <p>[0046] An aspect of the invention relates to an electrochemical
        reactor comprising the working electrode, the counter electrode,
        and the ion-selective electrolyte wherein the working electrode
        is according to the invention. Such a reactor can be utilised
        for the reduction of nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas from
        diesel engines or lean burn otto engines, where the high content
        of oxygen precludes the use of standard techniques, such as
        chemical reduction in a three way catalyst, for the reduction of
        the content of nitrogen oxides. </p>
      <p>[0047] Another aspect of the invention relates to a method of
        reducing nitrogen oxides in a mixture of nitrogen oxides and
        oxygen, the method comprising: providing an electrochemical
        reactor comprising a working electrode, a counter electrode, and
        an ion-selective electrolyte; said working electrode being
        adapted to reduce nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and oxygen, and
        said working electrode being adapted to suppress reduction of
        oxygen to oxygen ions; said working electrode processes being
        substantially according to the cathode electrode processes: </p>
      <p>2NO.sub.X +2xe.sup.--&gt;N.sub.2+2x0.sup.2- (a) </p>
      <p>O.sub.2+4e.sup.--&gt;2O.sup.2- (b) </p>
      <p>[0048] and the anode electrode process: </p>
      <p>2O.sup.2--&gt;O.sub.2+4e.sup.- (c) </p>
      <p>[0049] said cathode electrode processes (a) and (b) being
        carried out at a potential selected within a range of -1500 mV
        to +1500 mV between said working electrode and said counter,
        electrode, and at a temperature within a range of 200 to
        500.degree. C.; </p>
      <p>[0050] and said working electrode comprising an electric
        conductive ceramic of lanthanum manganite; said lanthanum
        manganite being doped with an oxygen ion vacancy quencher for
        quenching vacancies for oxygen ions; said oxygen ion vacancy
        quencher being in an effective amount to suppress said reduction
        of oxygen to oxygen ions at the working electrode so that the
        rate of reduction of nitrogen oxides is faster than the rate of
        reduction of oxygen at the selected potential and temperature. </p>
      <p>[0051] In a preferred embodiment said selected potential is
        selected within the range from -200 mV to 800 mV, said potential
        being measured versus a hydrogen electrode of 8% H.sub.2O and 3%
        H.sub.2 in Ar whereby it is obtained that the selectivity is
        further enhanced, and the total power demand decreased by
        lowering the potential as much as possible, without reaching a
        situation where the reduction rate becomes too small. </p>
      <p>[0052] In a particularly preferred embodiment said oxygen ion
        vacancy quencher is selected from the group consisting of Sr,
        Ca, Ba, and Eu. </p>
      <p>[0053] In still another embodiment said method uses
        electrochemical reactor comprising a working electrode according
        to the invention whereby particular improved selectivity of
        reduction of nitrogen oxides is obtained. </p>
      <p>[0054] In some applications the concentration of nitrogen
        oxides is low. Consequently, a preconcentration of nitrogen
        oxides may be desired. </p>
      <p>[0055] An aspect of the invention relates to an
        electro-chemical reactor for reduction of nitrogen oxides in a
        mixture of nitrogen oxides and oxygen, the electro-chemical
        reactor comprising a working electrode, a counter electrode, an
        ion-selective electrolyte, and a nitrogen absorber for absorbing
        nitrogen oxides; wherein said nitrogen absorber is adapted for
        electrochemical regeneration thereof; whereby it is achieved
        that nitrogen oxides can be adsorbed readily, even from gas
        mixtures with low concentrations of nitrogen oxides. Said
        electrochemical reactor can then easily regenerate the NOx
        adsorber by electrochemical reduction, without the need for
        addition of external heat or a chemical reducing agent. </p>
      <p>[0056] In a preferred embodiment said nitrogen absorber and
        said working electrode are intermixed whereby it is achieved
        that there is an intimate contact between the adsorbed
        NOx-containing species and the working electrode. This assures a
        fast, selective and efficient reduction of the NOx-containing
        compound. </p>
      <p>[0057] In another preferred embodiment said nitrogen absorber
        comprises a porous layer on said working electrode whereby a
        separate absorber is obtained which can be advantageous for some
        applications with respect to easy assembling and maintenance. </p>
      <p>[0058] In a preferred embodiement the nitrogen absorber
        comprises a material or a combination of materials selected from
        the group consisting of Na.sub.2O, K.sub.2O, MgO, CaO, SrO, and
        BaO, preferably BaO whereby nitrates and nitrites are easily
        formed in the presence of nitrogen oxides. Further, these
        nitrates and nitrites can easily be converted back to oxides
        under reducing conditions at elevated temperature. </p>
      <p>[0059] In a preferred embodiment of this electrochemical
        reactor said working electrode is a working electrode according
        to the invention. </p>
      <p>[0060] In another aspect the invention relates to a method of
        electrochemical reduction of nitrogen oxides in a mixture of
        nitrogen oxides and oxygen, the method comprising: </p>
      <p>[0061] providing an electrochemical reactor comprising a
        working electrode, a counter electrode, an ion-selective
        electrolyte, and a nitrogen oxide absorber for absorbing
        nitrogen oxides; </p>
      <p>[0062] absorbing nitrogen oxides from the mixture of nitrogen
        oxides and oxygen into said nitrogen oxide absorber; </p>
      <p>[0063] electrochemically regenerating said nitrogen oxide
        absorber by electrochemically reducing species containing said
        absorbed nitrogen oxides; said species being produced during
        said absorption. </p>
      <p>[0064] In a preferred embodiment the nitrogen oxides are
        absorbed in said nitrogen oxide absorber without applying and
        the counter electrode whereby the adsorption process is made
        more efficient by not polarising the reactor and furthermore
        power is saved by only polarising the reactor during the
        relatively short regeneration period. </p>
      <p>[0065] In a particularly preferred embodiment said nitrogen
        oxide absorber is regenerated by applying an electrical
        potential between said nitrogen oxide absorber and said counter
        electrode in the range from 0 to 1.5 V, preferably from 0.2 to
        1.0 V, most preferred from 0.4 to 0.7 V whereby the potential
        can be kept as low as possible to save power. In the case of
        energetically unfavourable conditions for the reduction,
        selecting a higher potential can boost the process. </p>
      <p>[0066] In still preferred embodiment said regeneration is
        carried out at an electrical current density allowing more than
        80% regeneration of said nitrogen oxide absorber after a
        regeneration time in the range from 5-40 s, preferably 5-30 s,
        most preferred 5-15 s whereby the adsorber is inactive during
        the regeneration process. Therefore, by minimising the
        regeneration time and keeping it short compared to the
        adsorption time, the total reduction rate for the NOx content in
        the exhaust has can be optimised. </p>
      <p>[0067] By changing the length of the adsorption period and the
        regeneration period relative to each other, the process can be
        adapted to cope with strongly varying contents of nitrogen
        oxides in the exhaust gas. </p>
      <p>[0068] In another preferred embodiment said electrical current
        density allowing more than 90% regeneration of said nitrogen
        oxide absorber after said regeneration time. </p>
      <p>[0069] In another preferred embodiment said nitrogen oxide
        absorber absorbs more than 60%, preferably in the range 60-80%
        of the nitrogen oxides of the mixutre of nitrogen oxides and
        oxygen. </p>
      <p>[0070] In another preferred embodiment said absorption of
        nitrogen oxides is carried out to saturation of said nitrogen
        oxide absorber. </p>
      <p>[0071] In another preferred embodiment said nitrogen absorber
        and said working electrode are intermixed. </p>
      <p>[0072] In another preferred embodiment said working electrode
        is a working electrode according to the invention. </p>
      <p><b>[0073] Definition of Expressions</b> </p>
      <p>[0074] The expression electrical current density is intended to
        designate electrical current per electrode area, said electrode
        area typically being the geometrical area of the electrode. In
        assessment of a measure of an electrode area, adjustment for
        variations of the microstructure and porosity of the electrode
        material can be done. </p>

      <p><b>4. DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0085] FIG. 1 shows an exemplary cyclic voltametric measurement
        of a working electrode comprising
        La.sub.0.82Sr.sub.0.14Fe.sub.0.1Mn.sub.0.9O.- sub.3 in presence
        of nitrogen monooxide, curve B, and in presence of oxygen, curve
        A, respectively. </p>
      <p>[0086] The y-axis indicates electric current density in I/.mu.A
        of the working electrode having an electrode area of about 0.01
        cm.sup.2. </p>
      <p>[0087] The x-axis indicates the potential of the working
        electrode E in V versus a standard hydrogen gas electrode of
        2.9% H.sub.2 and 3.1% H.sub.2O in argon in equilibrium with a
        platinum electrode. </p>
      <p>[0088] An electrochemical cell comprising a working electrode
        comprising La.sub.0.82Sr.sub.0.14Fe.sub.0.1Mn.sub.0.9O.sub.3 was
        prepared according to the procedure used in Example 1 (see
        below). </p>
      <p>[0089] It is seen that at an decreasing potential from about
        0.5 V to about -0.1 V, the reaction rate of the reduction of
        O.sub.2 increases steadily, while the reduction rate for NO is
        close to zero. For even lower potentials, the reaction rate for
        NO increases very strongly. These conditions are not in favour
        for NO.sub.x reduction. </p>
      <p>[0090] FIG. 2 shows an exemplary cyclic voltametric measurement
        of a comparison working electrode comprising CO.sub.3O.sub.4 in
        presence of nitrogen monooxide, curve B, and in presence of
        oxygen, curve A, respectively. </p>
      <p>[0091] The y-axis indicates electric current density in I/.mu.A
        of the working electrode having an electrode area of about 0.01
        cm.sup.2 </p>
      <p>[0092] The x-axis indicates the potential of the working 7
        electrode E in V versus a standard hydrogen gas electrode of 3%
        H.sub.2, and 8% H.sub.2O in argon in equilibrium with a platinum
        electrode. </p>
      <p>[0093] FIG. 3 shows an exempel of cyclic voltametric
        measurement of a working electrode comprising
        La.sub.0.85Sr.sub.0.15MnO.sub.3 in presence of nitrogen
        monooxide, curve B, and in presence of oxygen, curve A,
        respectively. </p>
      <p>[0094] The reduction rate for NO (curve B) steadily increases
        numerically as the potential is lowered from about 1 V to about
        0 V. Note the polarisation is negative for the working
        electrode. The reduction rate for O.sub.2 is very low (close to
        zero electric current density) from about 0 V to about 0.5 V. At
        lower potentials the reduction rate for O.sub.2 increases
        steadily. </p>
      <p>[0095] In the range of about 0.9 V to about 0.5 V, the
        reduction rate for NO is more than 2 orders of magnitude higher
        than the reduction rate for O.sub.2. Consequently, the LSM
        material, here, specifically La.sub.0.85Sr.sub.0.15MnO.sub.3, is
        very well suited as electrode material for selective reduction
        of nitrogen oxides in presence of oxygen. </p>
      <p>[0096] FIG. 4 shows five examples of cyclic voltametric
        measurements of a series of working electrodes in presence of
        nitrogen monooxide, curves LSM05, LSM15, LSM25, LSM35 and LSM50,
        said working electrodes comprising LSM materials having
        different degrees of doped strontium as cathode. </p>
      <p>[0097] The designation of the curves LSMy defines used LSM
        materials of the formula La.sub.(1-x)Sr.sub.xMnO.sub.3 wherein y
        is 100*x, e.g. LSM15 designates the LSM matial
        La.sub.0.85Sr.sub.0.15MnO.sub.3. </p>
      <p>[0098] The reduction rate for NO is significantly higher for
        LSM15 as the cathode material than for any of the other tested
        LSM materials in the range 0.2 to 0.8 V. </p>
      <p>[0099] FIG. 5 shows five examples of cyclic voltametric
        measurements of a series of working electrodes in presence of
        oxygen, curves LSM05, LSM15, LSM25, LSM35 and LSM50, said
        working electrodes comprising LSM materials having different
        degrees of doped strontium as cathode similar as the LSM
        materials used for the measurements shown in FIG. 4. </p>
      <p>[0100] It is seen that the reduction rate for O.sub.2increases
        significantly with increasing x. </p>
      <p>[0101] FIG. 6 shows a cross sectional sketch of an embodiment
        of an electrochemical reactor according to the invention; The
        electrochemical cell comprises an oxygen ion conducting
        electrolyte 1, here CGO, a selective cathode 2, here an LSM15
        material, and an anode 3, here platinum. </p>
      <p>[0102] The electrochemical cell is placed in an gas conduit
        means 21, 22 for an exhaust gas stream from an engine, here a
        gas inlet tube 21 and a gas outlet tube 22. The raw gas stream
        11 containing NOx enters the cathode area 2 of the
        electrochemical cell, where the NOx is reduced to N, and
        O.sub.2. The treated gas 12 leaves the cathode area. </p>
      <p>[0103] The cell is polarised from an external power supply 5
        with controlled potential through the leads 4. </p>
      <p>[0104] FIG. 7 shows a cross sectional sketch of an embodiment
        of an electrochemical cell for an electrochemical reactor
        according to the invention. </p>
      <p>[0105] The electrochemical cell comprises an oxygen ion
        conducting electrolyte 1, a cathode, 2, made from a mixture of
        cathode catalyst particles 7, here LSM15, and NOx adsorbing
        particles 8, here BaO particles, and an anode 3, here a platinum
        electrode. </p>
      <p>[0106] For illustrative purpose the size of the particles is
        strongly exaggerated. In the real cell the particle size was in
        the range of about 0.1 to 10 .mu.m. </p>
      <p>[0107] FIG. 8 shows a cross sectional sketch of another
        embodiment of an electrochemical cell for an electro-chemical
        reactor according to the invention. </p>
      <p>[0108] The electrochemical cell comprises an oxygen ion
        conducting electrolyte 1, a cathode 2, here made from a layer of
        cathode catalyst material 7, here LSM15, and a porous layer of a
        NOx adsorbing material 8, here sintered BaO particles, and an
        anode 3, here a platinum electrode. </p>
      <p>[0109] FIG. 9 shows a cross sectional sketch of an experimentel
        electrochemical set-up for cyclic voltametric measurements. </p>
      <p>[0110] The electrochemical cell comprises an oxygen ion
        conducting electrolyte 1, a working cathode electrode 2, e.g.
        made from a layer of cathode catalyst material as LSM15 and
        formed in the shape of a cone with a narrow tip for improved
        positioning of the electrode, said working cathode electrode
        further comprising e.g. a porous layer of a NOx adsorbing
        material 8, here sintered BaO particles, and an anode 3, e.g. a
        platinum electrode. </p>
      <p>[0111] The set-up further shows a potentimetric power supply
        51, e.g. a potentiostatic power supply supplied by University of
        Southern Denmark, Odense, supplying electrical currenct through
        the leads 41, 42. </p>
      <p><b>5. EXAMPLES</b> </p>
      <p>[0112] Preferred embodiments of the invention are further
        illustrated by examples of production of electrochemical cells
        having working electrodes based on LSM materials. </p>
      <p><b>Example 1</b> </p>
      <p><b>"Series of La.sub.1-xSr.sub.xMnO.sub.3 Working Electrodes"</b>
      </p>
      <p>[0113] "Preparation" </p>
      <p>[0114] A series of 5 electrochemical cells were produced, each
        comprising an ion selective electrolyte produced by pressing 1
        mm thin plates of CGO (cerium oxide doped with 10 atomic-%
        gadolinium oxide, i.e. Ce.sub.0.9Gd.sub.0.1O.sub.1.95, supplied
        Rhodia Electronics and Catalyst, and subsequently placing the
        CGO plates in an electrical furnace sintering the plates at a
        temperature in the range 1400-1550.degree. C. for 2-4 hours. </p>
      <p>[0115] Working electrodes of the LSM type were provided by
        depositing La.sub.1-xSr.sub.xMnO.sub.3 onto the exposed upper
        side of the sintered CGO plates. </p>
      <p>[0116] LSM materials were prepared by evaporating a solution of
        the corresponding metal nitrates, e.g. La(NO.sub.3).sub.3,
        Sr(NO.sub.3).sub.2 and Mn(NO.sub.3).sub.2 stabilised by addition
        of citric acid. The residue powder was calcinated at a
        temperature in the range of 900-1100.degree. C. for 1-3 hours. </p>
      <p>[0117] A slurry of fine powder of LSM in water was prepared and
        organic binder, e.g. methylcellulose and other additves, e.g.
        dispersing agents were added to stabilize the slurry. </p>
      <p>[0118] The slurry was then applied to one side of the sintered
        CGO plates by painting or screen printing. </p>
      <p>[0119] The CGO plates were then sintered further at a
        temperature in the range 1000-1200.degree. C. for 2-4 hours. </p>
      <p>[0120] Counter electrodes were provided on the other side of
        the sintered CGO plates by applying platinum paste comprising
        platinum powder and organic binder supplied from Engeldhard. </p>
      <p>[0121] Then CGO plates were then sintered at 8000C for 1 hour.
      </p>
      <p>[0122] The preparation of electrochemical cells were repeated
        with different LSM materials having values for x in the general
        formula of 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, and 0.50. </p>
      <p>[0123] "Cyclic Voltametric Measurements" </p>
      <p>[0124] Cyclic voltametric measurements were performed on the
        produced electrochemical cells in a N.sub.2 gas containing 2
        vol-% NO and in an N.sub.2 gas containing 10 vol-% O.sub.2. The
        N.sub.2-gas mixture was supplied by Hede Nielsen/Air Liquide,
        Denmark. </p>
      <p>[0125] Measurements were performed at temperatures in the range
        between 300 and 500.degree. C. The results are shown in FIGS. 5
        and 6 for measurements at 500.degree. C. </p>
      <p>[0126] At increasing x the reaction rate of the cathodic
        reduction of O.sub.2 increases. At lower x values than 0.25, the
        reaction rate of O.sub.2 is significant at potentials below 0.5
        V. </p>
      <p>[0127] It appears that cathodic reduction of NO reaches a
        maximum at x=0.15. </p>
      <p>[0128] The experiments show that good selectivity for
        La.sub.0.85Sr.sub.0.15O.sub.3 between electrochemical reduction
        of NO and O.sub.2 can be obtained. </p>
      <p>[0129] Further experiments have shown that similar good
        selectivity can be obtained for x values in the range of 0.12 to
        0.18. Outside this range, the selectivity becomes less good
        either because of a relatively faster reduction rate of O.sub.2
        and/or a slower reduction rate of NO. </p>
      <p><b>Example 2</b> </p>
      <p><b>"La.sub.0.85Sr.sub.0.15MnO.sub.3 Based Working Electrode"</b>
      </p>
      <p>[0130] An electrochemical cell with a working electrode
        comprising La.sub.0.85Sr.sub.0.15MnO.sub.3 was prepared as
        described in Example 1. The cell was tested at a temperature of
        300.degree. C. in a flowing N.sub.2 gas containing 1000 ppm NO
        and 10 vol.-% O.sub.2. The cell was polarised with 0.5 volts. </p>
      <p>[0131] Because some NO.sub.2 is formed in the mixture of NO and
        O.sub.2, the contents of NO and NO.sub.2 were measured in the
        exhaust gas of the electrochemical cell by mass spectrometry
        analysis using a Varian mass spectrometer. The reduction rate of
        NO was measure in the range of 40 to 80% depending on the gas
        flow rate through the cell, said reduction rate being based on
        the combined content of NO and NO.sub.2 measured. </p>
      <p><b>Example 3</b> </p>
      <p><b>"La.sub.0.85Sr.sub.0.15MnO.sub.3, and BaO Based Working
          Electrode"</b> </p>
      <p>[0132] An electrochemical cell with a working electrode
        comprising a mixture of 50 weight-%
        La.sub.0.85Sr.sub.0.15MnO.sub.3 and 50 weight-% BaO supplied
        from Merck was prepared as described in Example 1. During the
        preparation, the working electrodes were activated by addition
        of platinum. Platinum was added by impregnating a solution of
        PtCl.sub.4 in 0.1 N hydrochloric acid into the working electrode
        material. Then the working electrode were dried and heated to a
        temperature of 600.degree. C. BaO functions as an absorber of
        nitrogen oxides. Pt functions as an auxiliary catalyst for the
        NOx adsorption reactions. </p>
      <p>[0133] Depending on the exact composition of the exhaust gas
        several possible reaction can take place, e.g. </p>
      <p>2 NO+1.50.sub.2+BaO-&gt;(Pt) Ba(NO.sub.3) .sub.2 </p>
      <p>[0134] The electrochemical cells were tested at a temperature
        of 300.degree. C. in a N.sub.2 gas containing 1000 ppm NO and
        10% O.sub.2. The cells were run for 2 min without polarisation
        of the working electrode allowing NO to become absorbed into the
        working electrode BaO material. Then the working electrode was
        polarised with 0.5 volts for 20 seconds. </p>
      <p>[0135] The content of NO and NO.sub.2 were measured in the
        exhaust gas of the electrochemical cell. The reduction rate of
        NO was between 60 and 90% depending on the gas flow rate through
        the cell, said reduction rate being based on both the measured
        contents of NO and NO.sub.2. </p>
      <p><b>Example 4</b> </p>
      <p><b>"Energy Consumption--Calculation"</b> </p>
      <p>[0136] In a typical automobile with turbo charged diesel engine
        of 2 l displacement, driving at constant speed of 120 km/h,
        NO.sub.X in exhaust gas is typically 750 ppm. </p>
      <p>[0137] Under these conditions, the engine will deliver about
        20-25 kW. The exhaust gas flow will be about 80 l/s. The
        temperature will be about 300.degree. C. </p>
      <p>[0138] For simplicity NO.sub.x is calculated as NO, since in a
        diesel engine, the NO content is more than about 90 vol.-% of
        the total NO.sub.x. The NO content is 80*750 ppm=0.06 l/s. </p>
      <p>[0139] The number of moles of NO is n=0.06/0.082/575=0.00127
        mol/s. </p>
      <p>[0140] Multiplying with Faradays constant and multiplying with
        2 for the number of electrons in the reaction provides the
        demand for current: </p>
      <p>I=0.00127*96500*2=246 A </p>
      <p>[0141] With a current efficiency of 60% and a potential of 0.5
        volts, this provides a power demand of </p>
      <p>P=216*0.5/80*100=205 W </p>
      <p>[0142] This corresponds to 0.8% of the engine's power. </p>
