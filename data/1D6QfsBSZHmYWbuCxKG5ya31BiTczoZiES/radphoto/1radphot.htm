      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The photograph on page 92 of
          <i>Pursuit</i> (Summer 1977) is a fairly easy paranormal
          phenomenon to obtain.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Briefly, one model of
          reality can be constructed whereby orthogonal worlds (3D
          spaces) all share the same 4th dimension, time, much like
          spokes of a wheel around an axle. In this model, all 3-spaces,
          three or more orthogonal turns away from the laboratory
          3-space (i.e., from the observer’s spatial frame) are minds or
          mind-worlds. Each thought is an object in the mind-world of
          the thinker, in such a model. Further, all the 3-spaces
          crosstalk a tiny bit, usually so small a magnitude as to be
          virtual (unobservable even in theory). However, under certain
          amicable conditions, thought-forms or thought energies in such
          thought worlds can superpose sufficiently to breach the
          threshold between worlds. When progressively turning or
          rotating towards the laboratory frame a s a result of such
          super-position, the tulpoid energies/forms pass first into one
          frame away, which constitutes the ordinary electromagnetic
          field. In that frame they can affect ordinary photographic
          film, particularly film which is sensitive in the ultraviolet
          or infrared. In fact, if visible light is of low intensity or
          nonexistent, the effect is enhanced because visible light is a
          quenching of the paranormal channel.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Quite simply, the infrared
          and UV regions are essentially windows into other orthogonal
          3-spaces and hence mindworlds. If the effect of visible light
          is lessened or eliminated, but these windows are left open,
          paranormal pictures are fairly simple to initiate.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Trevor Constable uses a
          Wratten 18A filter to accomplish this (See Psychic Observer
          #197).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the picture shown,
          obviously the occasion was an emotional one, so emotional
          energy was present. It is probable that this energy provided
          the motivating force for the paranormal burst or discharge of
          energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Further, any type of
          ionization discharge/spark discharge/cascade discharge serves
          as a sort of collector for the tulpoidal energy to superimpose
          upon and emerge from. In this case, it is the candle flame,
          with millions of glowing, energetic, excited
          photon-emitting&nbsp; molecules and atoms that it is acting as
          the cascade collector for the effect. In Kirlian photography,
          e.g., it is the spark discharge. Here the ordinary light is
          what is impressed on the film, but it is the rotating of
          higher fields into the EM field that forms and shapes the
          changes noted in the discharge pattern. Water also enhances
          the effect. A Geiger counter tube, e.g., contains a cascade
          discharge mechanism -- and Geiger counter readings are often
          obtained in association with paranormal phenomena. Here it is
          not actually radioactivity that is being read, but cascading
          electrons. The higher fields, when superimposing sufficiently
          to reach the first orthogonal flame, then start inducing or
          producing charge in conductive paths, hence cause bursts of
          electrons to start in the first stage of the Geiger tube,
          initiating the cascade discharge and the reading.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Note also that Fuji film
          seems to be a bit more sensitive to infrared and to uv than
          ordinary film.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So in the situation photo,
          it is probably a burst or discharge of orthorotated thought
          energy or emotional energy that emerges from the candle flame.
          Parallelism of the two lines from each pair shows the
          coherence (timewise) that is necessary to have such
          superposition of higher biofields and consequent threshold
          orthorotation of them into the ordinary UV window.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Finally, one other effect is
          important: the kindling or flashing effect, i.e., repetitive
          shots or snaps also pulses through the IR/UV windows and
          causes time oscillations a la Kozyrev. If the visible light
          quenching effect (dampening) of the persistent decay curve of
          each pulse is not too great, then the pulses build into
          resonance -- or bursts across the threshold through the UV/IR
          windows.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Bearden’s Hypothesis:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The quenching of the
          hyper-channel (the paranormal channel) by photon interaction
          (i.e., by light) is proportional to the spectral luminous
          efficiency.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A host of data fits this
          hypothesis.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It also explains the
          sensitivity of cats and other animals (whose eyes work further
          into the UV/IR portions of the spectrum than do the eyes of
          humans) to paranormal phenomena.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, animals which
          compete in a sunlit world must also hold onto that quenching
          peak at the visible light peak at about 570 nanometers
          wavelength. Otherwise, they would become so preoccupied with
          the paranormal (tulpa) dither in/out that some other animal
          not so preoccupied would eat them. For the same reason,
          competition forces humans to do likewise.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The photon interaction --
          which quenches the hyperchannel by differentiating and
          removing time -- creates objectively (L3, separated
          spatially), totally. And this is clearly shown by the most
          fundamental experiment of quantum mechanics, Young’s two-slit
          experiment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And God said, "Let there be
          light!" -- and that was objective creation, the separation of
          the L3 spatial macroworld from the dimensionless, timeless,
          nothingness/allness voidless void.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have only just begun to
          comprehend.</font> </p>

        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">by Raymonde Guidot</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1958 Mr Philip Chancellor
          of Cuernevaca, Mexico, visited the DeLaWarr Laboratories at
          Oxford in order to learn more of the work that they were doing
          and especially about the special type of camera used. I had
          been privileged to stay with Mr Chancellor and observe some of
          the interesting research he was doing in his lab in broadcast
          treatment. As a registered healer, or Magnisateur patente,
          residing in Pontarlier in the east of France, I was extremely
          interested in the radionic apparatus he was using and I was
          delighted to receive as a gift on my arrival in Cuernevaca a
          DeLaWarr Diagnostic Instrument. I was soon able to operate
          this apparatus and to take part in the research being done.
          Having been invited originally to stay in Mexico for one
          month, what was to have been a short visit of four weeks soon
          developed into a stay of 5 months. During this period I
          developed a technique of using the Diagnostic Apparatus and
          evolved a method of arriving at an accurate diagnosis based on
          the cosmic awareness of the patient that I will describe in a
          later article.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whilst I was enjoying
          Mexican hospitality I was permitted to see some of the earlier
          photographic experiments conducted by Mr Chancellor. He
          explained to me that during his visit to the DeLaWarr
          Laboratories he was most impressed by the photographs obtained
          on the Mark I Camera and he was, at Mr DeLaWarr’s suggestion,
          trying to reproduce the process by using film instead of
          photographic plates. This was important if the Camera was to
          be universally used because photographic plates are virtually
          unobtainable in Mexico.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Using various emulsions and
          combination of developers Mr Chancellor succeeded in arriving
          at&nbsp; a suitable combination that enabled him to produce
          significant energy patterns on photographic film. At first he
          found difficulty in stabilizing his results and obtaining
          consistent images but by persistent experimentation over a
          period of several months he finally arrived at the process as
          it stands today.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whereas the DeLawarr method
          used Ilford Ordinary plates and the standard developer and
          fixer the Chancellor method used Kodak contrast process ortho
          film and developer D8 at full strength in combination with
          Kodak rapid fixer. Using this combination the patterns of the
          type seen in Figures 12 and 13 were produced. Experiments
          showed that the strength of these patterns was substantially
          increased when the stop bath was eliminated and the film
          placed directly into the fixing bath from the developer. The
          optimum developing time was 1-1/2 minutes and the fixing time
          was 2 minutes or more. After fixing the film it was washed and
          dried in the usual manner. It also became apparent that the
          temperature of the developer was not critical and that
          agitation of the film in the developer was unnecessary.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It became increasingly
          apparent that the patterns appeared to be abstractions and it
          subsequently became routing to decide on what was to be taken
          and to record it in a notebook prior to the exposure being
          taken. This action would thereby fix the request in the
          subconscious mind and the abstraction would be classified
          accordingly. The conscious effort of the operator during the
          time of the exposure would not appear to be as important as
          the pre-determined desire. Whether the resulting pattern is
          influenced by the mental or the emotional state of the
          operator has not yet been elucidated.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Bath Process ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Two techniques are being
          developed by Mr Chancellor, the bath Process and the
          Photographic Process. The former consists of inserting a piece
          of Kodak contrast process ortho film 6 cm square in a tray of
          D8 developer situated immediately in front of the operator
          having previously decided upon the request to be made
          mentally. After 1-1/2 minutes the film is removed from the
          developer and immediately placed in the fixing bath. It is
          there that the patterns appear and they can be observed by
          using the safe light.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The interesting feature
          about the process is that the photographs are obtained without
          the use of a camera and without exposure to light. It was
          found that there was no apparent effect on the photographs
          whether developed in total darkness or with the aid of safe
          light as would normally be used.&nbsp; The process has been
          studied by qualified observers among whom was Dr Felix
          Saunders, formerly Prof, of Chemistry at the Univ. of Chicago
          and currently engaged in the study of photographic emulsions.
          In an attempt to define the process involved it has not been
          possible to exclude or to establish the possibility of
          artifact. It has been agreed, however, that the extreme
          variation in density of form and pattern obtained by a variety
          of persons at the same time and under the same conditions
          would indicate that the patterns tend to suggest an emanation
          of energy hitherto unrecognized.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The nature of the image and
          of the energy causing it has naturally been the subject of
          much attention and interest. Attempts to influence the pattern
          noticeably by various means, other than a chemical or any
          light process, such as blowing ammonia around the film, or
          introducing an electromagnetic field has not met with any
          success. However, when exposing the film in the DeLaWarr
          Camera a change in the image is evident.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Chancellor
            Photographic Process ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The foregoing Bath Process
          when applied to a film exposed in the usual manner with a box
          camera produces photographs of an unusual character. All the
          Figures 14 to 26 were taken with a plate camera loaded with
          film; some of the objects were placed in front of a black
          backdrop. In these subsequent pictures no attempt was made to
          influence the pattern by a mental request. Fig. 14 shows a
          dress ring photographed against a backdrop and developed by
          the Chancellor technique. No explanation is attempted of what
          the pattern represents. Fig. 15 is also a Chancellor type
          photograph of a pre-Columbian figure. Fig. 16 is a photograph
          of a jar of pure Royal Jelly.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Moving to animate objects,
          Fig. 17 is a photograph taken out of doors in front of a
          backdrop. Figs. 18 and 19 are taken by flashlight. Fig. 19 is
          of a Yoga initiate and may possibly be showing the human aura
          of a person who is spiritually advanced. It has been "held
          back" a trifle in the developer in order to retain better
          definition of the emanation patterns. It is difficult to form
          conclusions concerning what the patterns represent. If they
          are artifacts due to using strong fixer then why are not more
          evenly distributed over the whole photograph?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figs. 20 to 31 were taken
          out of doors in the grounds of the DeLaWarr Laboratories in
          accordance with normal photographic practice. Figs. 20 and 22
          were taken of one of the several elm trees there. They were
          taken into the sun in order to obtain a dark background from
          the surface of the tree and were developed and fixed by the
          Chancellor Process.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figs. 21 and 23 show
          immediate repeats of Figs. 20 and 22 but with Miss DeLaWarr in
          the foreground.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fig. 24 is a Chancellor
          process photograph of one of the DeLaWarr Laboratory buildings
          using a box camera. Fig. 25 is a similar photograph taken the
          following day, also using a box camera. One hour later a
          control photograph was taken to show the view as it really was
          and this is seen in Fig. 26. Owing to a misunderstanding he
          used the same Chancellor process as in Fig. 25 but his object
          was to take a normal photograph.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I do not attempt to offer an
          explanation of these photographs apart from saying that the
          superimposed patterns appear in the fixing process. In my
          opinion the patterns and depth of image present variations
          that are capable of interpretation. A means of producing
          repeatable patterns is being sought and experiments are being
          undertaken to combine the Chancellor process with the DeLaWarr
          Camera. The initial photographs taken before I left Oxford
          showed considerable promise. Several persons were able to get
          an image in the Mark I Camera who had hitherto been unable to
          do so when using Ilford Ordinary Plates.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I would like to add that the
          Chancellor Process is being simultaneously investigated by
          research foundations at San Pedro and San Antonio, California.</font>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Early in 1954 an important
          experiment was carried out with the assistance of a nuclear
          physicist that should be recorded in this series of articles
          as it opens up a constructive line of thought. The story
          begins in 1953 when I approached Lord Glyn, a Member of
          Parliament of long standing, and asked him for help in
          obtaining a hearing with Sir John Cockcroft, one of Britain’s
          leading atomic physicists. We had taken some thousands of
          radionic photographs with our Mark I Camera and among them was
          a number of fairly good examples on which we wanted expert
          opinion. Those of the atomic lines (reproduced in Mind and
          Matter, December 1957) were especially interesting and we
          hoped they would find some concordance with current knowledge
          in atomic physics.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lord Glyn approached Sir
          John Cockcroft who arranged for a chemist from the Atomic
          Energy Research Establishment at Harwell to meet me. In due
          course Dr. A. Charlesby arrived and we showed him something of
          the work we were doing, finally demonstrating the Camera.
          Imagine our surprise when after developing our first
          photographic plate we found nothing on it. The image
          apparently would not appear when Dr Charlesby was in the room
          and we therefore had to ask him to wait outside while the
          photograph was being taken, a request that probably confirmed
          any suspicions he may have had. It is a simple matter of fact
          that we did not know then of the negative power of critical
          thought. We tried various methods of insulating Dr Charlesby
          and finally cut a peephole in the door of the Camera Room, so
          that he could observe our activities from outside. This was
          reasonably successful and the investigation then proceeded
          quite amicably.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The radiating lines in our
          photographs of atoms and molecules from a central well-defined
          point puzzled us. An example of this ‘central point feature’
          is seen in Fig. 2 of Oxford tap water which would appear to
          show the radiation from the constituent atoms. I had a theory
          that these lines of energy were released in space from a tiny
          vortex at this central point according to the type of atom.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fig. 2 tends to give this
          impression but possibly I am biased as I believe it is
          possible to materialize atoms. I expressed the opinion that
          even an atom could undergo an experience and that an atom of
          oxygen existing in a copper sulfate crystal was receiving a
          different experience from an oxygen atom in a silver nitrate
          crystal. Dr Charlesby was interested in this possibility and
          suggested that we might try giving atoms an experience and
          photographing them before and after the event.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Polythene Experiment
            ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dr Charlesby had invented a
          process at Harwell whereby soft polythene could be toughened
          to a more useful product by putting it in the atomic pile. He
          suggested that we should therefore photograph a sample of soft
          polythene before and after it had this experience. Fig. 3 was
          therefore taken on our Mark I Camera showing the carbon and
          hydrogen lines of the polythene sample. We then had to
          determine which was the hydrogen line and so the photograph in
          Fig. 4 was taken on the tuning for hydrogen. The polythene was
          then taken to Harwell, subjected to intense atomic radiation
          and rephotographed as in Fig. 5. It will be noticed that the
          carbon line remained unaffected, whereas the hydrogen line had
          moved. This was most exciting and although it did not
          necessarily prove that my theory was correct, it had opened up
          a line of investigation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An interesting feature of
          this experiment was the appearance of the two little lines at
          the center of the photo. We resolved to find out what they
          were and after various attempts we decided that they were
          connected with heavy hydrogen, deuterium. This was confirmed
          by a separate pot showing only the two little lines. The
          opposite directions of each line tend to confirm the presence
          of deuterium as its atomic arrangement consists of two atoms
          of hydrogen coupled together but pulling in opposite
          directions and the two opposing lines would certainly suggest
          this.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dr Charlesby made another
          suggestion when we were discussing the nature of the lines of
          the image. He thought that we should use two photographic
          plates with their emulsion faces together. We did this and
          were successful in obtaining an image on each plate, one being
          the mirror image of the other (Fig. 6). This was most
          interesting as it suggested that actual particles had appeared
          between the plates and diverged away from each other in the
          same plane. Also around the central point at which I fondly
          hoped there was materialization taking place there was a ring.
          We often obtain this effect at the central point, but no
          satisfactory explanation has occurred to us yet unless there
          is possibly a process of polarization taking place.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Back to Normal ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When Dr Charlesby was again
          able to visit the Laboratories further tests were given, but
          as these were probably based on an entirely erroneous concept
          of the phenomenon we were frequently "caught out" with images
          on the wrong plates. This was our swan song and once again we
          were working alone, suspect as usual; but we had progresses
          considerably. We had learnt that negative thought could affect
          the image; that the ability to obtain such images was in fact
          due to a personal ability possessed by my assistant in
          conjunction with the Camera; that atomic bombardment altered
          the image we obtained, and finally that we could expect no
          more assistance from Harwell.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I met Dr Charlesby again
          when I was addressing a society at Cambridge University. He
          was in the audience and very kindly stated that after having
          given the matter very considerable thought he could not
          formulate a scientific test of any kind in view of the nature
          of the phenomenon. He also said he was at least convinced of
          my integrity, and that was naturally a welcome statement.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is difficult for me to
          realize that ten years ago my wife, I and our Chief Assistnat
          were just entering the photographic side of this work. An
          accumulation of unexplained phenomena had softened us up over
          the previous nine years and confirmed our ignorance of what
          lies behind radionics. We had successfully completed the tests
          on our Colorscope treatment apparatus and demonstrated the
          therapeutic value of specific colors. This drew our attention
          to the possibility of detecting disease conditions by the use
          of light.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We had failed to get any
          response from the supposed radiations of a blood specimen in
          the electronic sense and we therefore proceeded to try in the
          photonic sense. If only we could get a start with a physical
          demonstration of some kind we felt that all would be well and
          that the medical profession would soon see the implications
          for humanity.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A Photographic Emulsion
            As A Detector ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We accordingly bought some
          x-ray half plates from a local photographer and we set to
          work. From the very first plate we started getting strange
          patterns and particle tracks, and these not being what we
          expected I discounted them somewhat; but fortunately they are
          all still intact in our extensive filing system. In March
          1959, w startled ourselves by placing a specimen of blood (on
          filter paper) in contact with the emulsion of a photographic
          plate for a half minute and obtaining an exposure on the pate,
          identical in pattern but slightly larger than the area of the
          blood spot, seen in Fig. 27.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This was a very satisfactory
          step in my opinion and my learned colleagues assured me that
          there was no known radiation that could have caused this
          picture and that nothing like it had ever been done before
          without radioactivity of some kind. My colleagues were in fact
          wrong because I have dug into some records, of the research
          carried out by Prof. Cremonese (now deceased) of Milan, who
          managed to obtain photographic impressions of samples of
          sputum in a similar manner. The work of Prof. Cremonese is
          virtually unknown, largely because no one else appeared to be
          able to reproduce the phenomenon, and also possibly because
          his images were not as clear as ours.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our own experiment described
          above was repeated successfully 12 times in succession with
          very little difference in the images obtained and the
          rotational position of the specimen made no difference. Seven
          years later we attempted to repeat the experiment, using the
          Ilford Ordinary Plates that we have since accepted as standard
          in the mark I Camera technique, but we failed. This has
          worried us considerably but we are now inclined to believe
          that there is a specific response according to the type of
          emulsion used. The Chancellor Process tends to substantiate
          this.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Specific response of a blood
          specimen to radionic tuning was described in our September
          1958 issue; it was then shown that the specimen of a person
          with tuberculosis would respond to the radionic tuning for
          tuberculosis but not, for instance, to the tuning for
          diabetes. This is not, however, necessarily the type of
          specific response I am referring to in connection with the
          emulsion. In the experiment seen in Fig. 27 no radionic tuning
          was used anyway and I have been reviewing our earlier
          experiments accordingly.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The most significant
          information already unearthed in this connection relates to
          the precise moment when we ran out of x-ray half plates and
          changed to another type of emulsion. It will be recalled that
          in the early experiments before lenses were added to the
          Camera (Fig. 28) the image of copper sulfate crystals on the
          plate of the treatment Instrument was found at Z.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This image is seen in Fig.
          29. The lens was then added as in Fig. 28 and an exposure was
          taken at position 4 which is 9 inches from the lens. The image
          obtained in this position is seen in Fig. 30 and the slightly
          elongated copper sulfate crystal that we used on the apparatus
          below is beginning to come into focus.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was at this moment that
          we realized we had no more x-ray half plates to spare and as
          they could only be obtained by having them specially made we
          suspended the experiment and resumed work on the blood
          specimens. We did return to the copper sulfate experiment,
          however, some time later but we had to use Ilford ordinary
          quarter plates. The first image we obtained was that
          reproduced in Fig. 31. This so delighted us that we went on to
          take many more thrilling variations but completely overlooking
          the possible significance of the difference in the two
          emulsions used.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If there is indeed specific
          response by an emulsion to the radionic principle we have
          taken a big step in understanding the 12,000 photos we have
          taken on Ilford Ordinary Plates. The next thing is to find out
          more about this principle and whether it is the operator’s
          presence, his thought, the radionic apparatus or a combination
          of all three that induces the specific response in the
          emulsion. A review of the evidence we have accumulated is long
          overdue and this series of articles is serving a useful
          purpose in revealing much that has been overlooked.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Elusive Image ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When discussing the
          constructional details recently of a new Mark I Camera for Mr
          Chancellor in order that he may continue his research in
          Mexico I recalled our earlier difficulties in the design of
          the camera head. The Mark I Camera head is the light tight box
          approximately 11" x 9" x 8" containing the reflector, lenses
          and photographic plate holder. It is the box seen in Fig. 32
          on the four supports. In 1956 Mr A. Broad of the Cavendish
          Laboratory at Cambridge agreed to have a two-beam Mark I
          Camera at his home so that he could do some research on the
          processes involved. The two-beam Camera seemed to work as well
          as the three-beam and it was therefore agreed that an improved
          design should be followed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1955 when Dr Charlesby
          came from the Harwell Atomic Research Organization to test the
          Camera we found that each component part should have a
          critical position to suit the operator’s individual field.
          This was our first intimation that the physical presence of
          the operator was essential in order to obtain a photo. After
          nearly three months’ work we made an improved type of Camera
          with all the components adjustable. It was rather an expensive
          undertaking and we had to increase the size of the camera head
          to accommodate the required variation in the different people
          we tried. Twelve people in all were tried, including Mr Broad
          and our staff doctor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It so happened that when the
          enlarged camera head was adjusted to suit Mr Broad it was so
          low that the blood specimen sat on the top of the lower box
          could not be rotated by hand and so the two bottom corners of
          the camera head were splayed back to allow room for the hand.
          Altogether it looked a very attractive piece of apparatus in
          mahogany and chromium as it was taken off to Cambridge by my
          assistant. On arrival it was placed in the correct magnetic
          N-S position and tested out but no image could be obtained.
          Fortunately our own original Camera had been taken along in
          case the difference in latitude between Oxford and Cambridge
          made any difference to the results. We were relieved to find
          that our own Camera still worked but Mr Broad’s simply would
          not function and we had to bring it back to Oxford.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was all very disturbing.
          We then tried to find the trouble by a process of elimination
          and discovered that it was in the design of the camera head.
          As soon as we replaced the two corners we had splayed off and
          restored the rectangular shape the elusive image returned. The
          Camera was then taken to Cambridge again and order was
          restored. Mr Broad and my assistant were able to proceed with
          their research and produced very good photos under test
          conditions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I well remember how anxious
          we all were to get the phenomenon demonstrated to the
          University pundits and so we decided to invite Prof. Stratton
          who held the Chair of Para-Psychology and who was a very
          pleasant person. We met for lunch and then drove to Mr Broad’s
          house. A test image had been taken before lunch, so we knew
          the Camera would work. The new packet of sealed plates was
          produced and one plate was placed in the Camera. This was our
          big moment when a perfect image would start a chain reaction
          among the Universities. The dripping plate was produced, but
          it was completely black and there was no image. Each
          subsequent plate was black; altogether it was a black day.
          Prof. Stratton then explained that he had never been
          privileged to witness any psychic phenomena because the moment
          he appeared on the scene all phenomena ceased. We were all
          desolated, the Professor departed and the Universities were
          left in peace. I may add that the Camera showed signs of
          indisposition for several days afterwards.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These are interesting
          sidelights and show how little we understood the phenomenon.
          The negating power of the "30 percent", that is to say, those
          who cannot work the Diagnostic Instruments, or get plants to
          increase their growth for them, or who cannot heal the sick by
          radionics, is a very real stumbling block to the fulfillment
          of our purpose.</font> </p>

          significant event. Coupled with this is the closely allied
          phenomenon of Thoughtography, or implanting thought forms on a
          photographic emulsion. Many cases are on record but the most
          thorough and spectacular are those recorded by Prof. Fukurai
          about 1910. Fig. 2 shows one of a series of thought
          photographs arranged by him using the special ability of a Mr
          Konichi Mita to produce them.</font> </p>

          series of tests on either photographic papers or plates after

          clairvoyant who was allowed to work at a distance from the
          casket but at no time to touch it or the contents. The
          authenticity of each experiment was attested by a full

          medicine, physics and psychology attested to the validity of
          the experiments in which they took part. The score of
          successful shots was approximately 20 percent.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1950, at the Delawarr
          Laboratories, with the aid of Mr L. Corte, a series of
          photographs was taken, using apparatus containing a magnet and
          lenses to ensure repeatability. The images obtained were of an
          extra-dimensional character and over 10,000 exposures were
          taken during 9 years work. The score of successful shots was
          90 percent and Fig. 3 is an example of a thought photograph
          produced on the Delawarr Camera.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A technique of using a state
          of magnetic rapport between a distant person and the camera
          operator was developed. Such an advanced technique is unknown
          to science but may well be understood in the field of ESP.
          Fig. 4 shows the effect of tuning the apparatus in to a
          distant person for Ulceration of the Duodenum. It transpired
          that the person had recently had an operation on the duodenum
          and the stitches had become septic.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hundreds of similar
          exposures have been taken over the past 17 years and may be
          inspected at the Laboratories. All work on the Camera was
          slowed down in 1960 for financial reasons and it is important
          that work should be resumed while Mr Corte is still able to
          produce the phenomenon and also in order to find other
          potential operators. It may also be possible to provide a
          service for probing disease problems in humans, animals and
          plants from an entirely new aspect.</font> </p>

        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(December 15, 1939)</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention
          relates to a method of and means for obtaining photographic
          images of parts of the human body or of other objects. One
          object of my invention is to enable accurate photographs of
          healthy and diseased parts of living bodies somewhat similar
          to x-ray photography to be obtained in simple and easily
          applied manner. Another object is to provide a compact,
          portable apparatus for obtaining photographic images according
          to the invention.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is believed that the
          action obtained by my present method consists in activating
          the flow of electrons of the unidirectional flow of current
          from the battery or other equivalent source and the radiant
          energy of the body being examined.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In pursuance of the
          foregoing and according to my present invention a method of
          obtaining photographic images of living and other objects and
          more particularly human beings consists in subjecting a highly
          sensitized photographic plate or film to an electromotive
          force so as to produce a field thereon and providing means
          susceptible to the influence of invisible energy rays or
          electrons of the atoms of the object to be photographed to
          produce a change in voltage drop across an electrical circuit
          to correspondingly influence said field.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The apparatus for carrying
          out the invention does comprise a light-sensitive cell, a
          uni-directional source of current connected at the negative
          side of the cathode of the light-sensitive cell and at the
          positive side to the anode of the cell. A series of impedance
          rheostats connected so as to have a condenser action and
          connected in parallel with the cell and the source of energy,
          a rectifier, and a photographing device comprising the opposed
          plates of a fixed condenser between which film or plate is
          located, said rheostats being connected across one of the
          plates of the condenser and the cell plates, and the other
          plate of the condenser being connected to the filtered
          negative side of the said source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In carrying an embodiment of
          my invention into practice it should be understood that the
          latent image is carried to the sensitized surface by means of
          a magnetic field having certain lines of force and the
          thickness or width of the field, i.e., transverse to the
          shortest distance between the negative and positive points,
          can vary from 1/32 of an inch to an inch. This field, when
          applied across a sensitized surface, spreads or is trapped to
          the plane of such surface and by action of a suitable
          developer the image of the field can be printed. Consequently,
          if the potential of the applied force is varied by using the
          electronic or light ray influence of the object to be
          photographed to affect the photo-electric cell included in the
          circuit of the apparatus, the lines of force will be
          correspondingly varied on the plate.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In practice the subject to
          be photographed is placed close to the photo-electric cell and
          it is found that the radiant energy of the subject impinges on
          the cathode of the tube resulting in an increasingly higher
          resistance placed across the cell. Such increase will cause an
          exceedingly minute change of the current in the anode circuit,
          in turn producing a change in the voltage drop across the
          circuit, such voltage drop or change in potential being led
          through the selecting or tuning section constituted by the
          rheostat. That is to say a photoelectric cell is used to
          isolate a particular section to be photographed and in doing
          so it pictures changes in electromotive force in an electrical
          circuit, such changes of the electromotive force being
          utilized to excite the circuit producing a field across a
          highly sensitized emulsion surface, the resulting distortion
          or change of the lines of force across said surface producing
          an image which can be developed chemically. Suitable apparatus
          for achieving this result is illustrated by the appended
          sheets of drawings wherein:--</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to the drawings a
          source of direct or unidirectional current 1 is connected by
          its negative filter 4 which can consist of coils of insulated
          wire or solenoids wound on both iron cores and air cores and
          in series. The source of potential may be a battery carried in
          the portable casing 5 so that the apparatus can be
          self-contained and available for use anywhere. The positive
          side of the source 1 is connected to the anode of the cell
          3.&nbsp; Connected across the anode and a rectifier 7 is one,
          or preferably as shown, a plurality of series-coupled
          impedance rheostats 8 which are constructed to act as
          condensers, the rectifier 7 being in turn connected to the
          filtered negative side of the source 1 so that the rheostats
          are in parallel with the circuit of the battery and cell. This
          rectifier may be a quartz-crystal type, a vacuum tube
          rectifier, a rectifier of the oxide type or a chemical
          rectifier. A pair of large surface area (in relation to their
          thickness) conducting plates 9 and 10 are located in narrowly
          spaced relationship, e.g., after the manner of a fixed
          condenser and are connected in parallel with a rectifier. This
          condenser device forms in effect a photographing device
          because between them is interposed a highly sensitized plate
          or film.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With the source of the
          potential connected as shown there will always be a difference
          of potential&nbsp; between the cathode and anode of the cell,
          the anode being positive to the cathode by reason of the
          applied direction of polarity of the source of potential.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In practice the object to be
          examined is placed close to the surface of the cathode so that
          the invisible light rays or radiation will always be a
          difference of potential between the cathode and anode of the
          cell, the anode being positive to the cathode by reason of the
          applied direction of polarity of the source of potential.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In practice the object to be
          examined is placed close to the surface of the cathode so that
          the invisible light rays or radiation will impinge upon the
          cathode resulting in negative electrons being emitted from the
          cathode. This places a negative potential on the anode and an
          increased resistance is placed across the cell resulting in an
          exceedingly minute change of current in the anode circuit.
          Because of this change in current there will be a voltage drop
          across the circuit which is led through the selecting or
          tuning section constituted by the rheostats.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The changes in dielectric
          stress of the condenser-like arrangement of plates 9 and 10
          caused by the changes of potential applied to the plates 9 and
          10, produces corresponding changes in the field which is
          contained in the sensitized surface of the photographic plate
          or film. This field is in the nature of a magnetic field with
          appropriate line sof force depending upon the particular
          settings of the tuning device constituted by the impedance
          rheostats 8. As the tuned-in electromotive force which
          produces the field is varies or regulated by the energy
          derived from the nervous system or organism of the living
          object being photographed, the field is varied accordingly.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The tuning device can
          comprise any suitable number of rheostats connected in series
          as shown in Fig. 1 to afford a wide variety of adjustment.
          Each rheostat comprises a plurality of conductor studs 14
          arranged in an arcuate path about a center conductor pivot pin
          15 from which radiates a contact 16engaging the studs singly.
          Each stud is lined with an insulating sleeve 17 about which is
          wound a wire 18 so that there is a capacity between the wire
          and the conductor stud 14. The windings 18 are in series for
          each rheostat, and the conductor pivot pin 15 of each rheostat
          is connected to the first winding of the next rheostat in
          succession as shown in Fig. 1. Such an arrangement affords a
          wide range of fine tuning, the impedance formed in the circuit
          being determined by the number of windings selected.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The rheostats can be mounted
          on a panel 19 fixed in the portable casing 5. A switch 20 for
          making and breaking the circuit of the battery can be provided
          on this panel, and the photo-electric cell 3 can be plugged
          into a socket 21 on the base of the casing between the panel
          19 and a partition 22 separating a compartment 23 containing
          the condenser plates 9 and 10. Immediately above the space
          between these two plates is a narrow lid 24 adapted to light
          seal the compartment 23, and to be opened for insertion and
          removal of a mount containing the photographic plate or film.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Having now particularly
          described and ascertained the nature of my said invention and
          in what manner the same is to be performed, I declare that

          so as to produce an EM field which provides a means
          susceptible to the energy rays or electrons of the atoms of
          the object or area to be photographed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To produce a change in
          voltage drop across an electrical circuit to correspondingly
          influence the aforementioned EM field, via a sample from the
          donor Body, this sample can be of blood, hair, sputum,
          handwriting, etc., or any part of the subject or subject
          matter to be photographed. When the sample from the donor Body
          is presented to the IR sensor, the energy transmitted from the
          donor Body to the sample produces sufficient energy to effect
          a change in the circuit by way of a minute voltage drop, this
          in turn is led through the tuning potentiometers and
          influences the said EM field by reason of the applied
          direction of polarity of the source of the potential.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Description ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The camera functions through
          the medium of harnessing the energy rays emitted by the donor
          Body via a sample from the donor Body. This sample can be of a
          blood spot, hair, sputum, handwriting, or any part of the
          donor Body. In practice, a sample from the donor Body is
          placed close to the surface of the IR sensor (5) so that the
          energy rays or radiations will impinge upon the cathode of the
          IR sensor (5), resulting in negative electrons being emitted
          from the cathode. This in turn places a negative potential on
          the anode circuit, resulting in an increased resistance being
          placed across the IR sensor, resulting in a minute change of
          current in the anode circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Due to this change in
          current, there will be a voltage drop across the circuit. This
          voltage drop is led through the potentiometers (6) which are
          used as the selection or tuning device. The tuning is effected
          by setting the energy pattern of the area to be photographed
          numerically on the potentiometers (6).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The change in dielectric
          stress of the condenser-like arrangement of conducting plates
          (8) and (9) caused by the change of potential applied to the
          conducting plates (8) and (9) produces corresponding changes
          in the EM field which is contained in the emulsion face of the
          photographic paper or film. This field is in the nature of an
          EM field with appropriate lines of force, depending upon the
          particular setting, set numerically on the potentiometers or
          tuning device (6).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As the tuned EM force which
          produces the field is varied or regulated by the energy
          derived from the nervous system or organism of the donor Body
          being photographed, the EM field is varied accordingly.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The tuning device can be
          comprised of any suitable number of potentiometers (6)
          connected in series to afford a wide range of selection. The
          potentiometers are capable of tuning on a scale of 0 to 10.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to be able to take
          a photograph, you have to dial in the energy pattern of the
          area to be photographed on the potentiometers (6). For
          example, if we wished to photograph "Cancer of the Spine" that
          the donor Body is suffering from, we would dial in number 5 on
          the first potentiometer, 0 on the second, 2 on the third, 4 on
          the fourth, 2 on the fifth, 7 on the sixth, 9 on the seventh
          potentiometer. This is the energy pattern of Cancer of the
          Spine expressed numerically, as 5024279.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The camera is now set to
          photograph Cancer of the Spine. Using the sample from our
          donor Body to act as a catalyst we trigger the action needed
          to effect the photograph.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In fact, what happens is
          that the donor Body is in tune with the sample taken from it,
          and that energy is passing between the donor Body and the
          sample in a continuous stream. Time and distance are
          irrelevant.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the sample is presented
          to the IR sensor (5), energy generated by the donor Body flows
          through the sample in sufficient strength to effect negative
          electrons being emitted from the cathode of the IR sensor (5).
          This in turn places a negative potential on the anode of the
          IR sensor (5), resulting in an increased resistance being
          placed across the IR sensor, which in turn results in a minute
          change of current in the anode circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Due to this change in
          current, a voltage drop is effected. This voltage drop is led
          through the potentiometers (6) on which we had set our energy
          pattern for Cancer of the Spine, expressed numerically as
          5023279. The energy pattern being carried on this EM field
          flows on to, and becomes trapped in the emulsion face of the
          film or photographic paper. Developing the film results in a
          picture of Cancer of the Spine, that the donor Body is
          suffering from, and from which can only be obtained by use of
          the donor Body sample.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The camera will produce the
          same photograph effect when a numerically expressed energy
          pattern is selected on the Potentiometers (6) and the same
          donor Body sample is used. No other criteria is required to
          obtain repetitive results.</font> </p>
