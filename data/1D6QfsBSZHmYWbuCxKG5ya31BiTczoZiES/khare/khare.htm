      A California teen has attracted the attention of tech giants
      Google for her potentially revolutionary invention which charges a
      phone in 20 seconds flat.<br>
      <br>
      The super-fast charging device has been dubbed a supercapacitor by
      18-year-old Esha Khare, of Saratoga - as she took home $50,000
      from the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, which
      took place in Phoenix this week.<br>
      <br>
      The device will make waiting hours for a phone to charge a thing
      of the past and the gizmo packs more energy into a smaller space
      than traditional phone batteries and holds the charge for longer.<br>
      <br>
      Eesha Khare, 18, of Saratoga, Calif., received the Intel
      Foundation Young Scientist Award of $50,000 for the invention of a
      tiny energy-storage device With great power: The supercapacitor is
      flexible and tiny, and is able to handle 10,000 recharge cycles,
      more than normal batteries by a factor of 10<br>
      <br>
      So far, Khare has only used her supercapacitor to power a
      light-emitting diode or LED - but she sees a bright future that
      one day will see her invention powering cellphones, cars and any
      gadget that requires a rechargeable battery.<br>
      <br>
      Heading to Harvard, Khare told CBS San Francisco that this is only
      the start and that she will 'be setting the world on fire' from
      here.<br>
      <br>
      'My cellphone battery always dies,' she told NBC News when asked
      what inspired her to work on the energy-storage technology.<br>
      <br>
      Specializing in nanochemistry allowed Khare to reduce the size of
      her invention. 'Really working at the nanoscale to make
      significant advances in many different fields.'<br>
      <br>
      'It is also flexible, so it can be used in rollup displays and
      clothing and fabric,' Khare added.<br>
      <br>
      'It has a lot of different applications and advantages over
      batteries in that sense.'<br>
      <br>
      The supercapacitor is flexible and tiny, and is able to handle
      10,000 recharge cycles, more than normal batteries by a factor of
      10.<br>
      <br>
      How an 18-year-old girl has managed to figure out something that
      multi-national corporations have not has led to her being flooded
      with offers for her amazing leap forward.<br>
      <br>
      Google have been in contact with Khare to explore how she plans to
      change the makeup of cell phone battery life.<br>

        Abstract<br>
        <br>
        Objectives/Goals<br>
        <br>
      </b>With the rapid growth of portable electronics, it has become
      necessary to develop efficient energy-storage technology to match
      this development. While batteries are currently used for
      energy-storage, they suffer from long charging times and short
      cycle life. Electrochemical supercapacitors have attracted
      attention as energy-storage devices because they bridge the gap
      between current alternatives of conventional capacitors and
      batteries, offering higher energy density than conventional
      capacitors and higher power density than batteries. Despite these
      advantages, supercapacitor energy density is much lower than
      batteries and increasing energy density remains a key challenge in
      supercapacitor research. The goal of this work was to design and
      synthesize a supercapacitor with increased energy density while
      maintaining power density and long cycle life.<b><br>
        <br>
        Methods/Materials<br>
        <br>
      </b>To improve supercapacitor energy density, I designed,
      synthesized, and characterized a novel core-shell nanorod
      electrode with hydrogenated TiO2 (H-TiO2) core and polyaniline
      shell. H-TiO2 acts as the double layer electrostatic core. Good
      conductivity of H-TiO2 combined with the high pseudocapacitance of
      polyaniline results in significantly higher overall capacitance
      and energy density while retaining good power density and cycle
      life. This new electrode was fabricated into a flexible
      solid-state device to light an LED to test it in a practical
      application.<br>
      <b><br>
        Results<br>
        <br>
      </b>Structural and electrochemical properties of the new electrode
      were evaluated. It demonstrated high capacitance of 203.3 mF/cm2
      (238.5 F/g) compared to the next best alternative supercapacitor
      in previous research of 80 F/g, due to the design of the
      core-shell structure. This resulted in excellent energy density of
      20.1 Wh/kg, comparable to batteries, while maintaining a high
      power density of 20540 W/kg. It also demonstrated a much higher
      cycle life compared to batteries, with a low 32.5% capacitance
      loss over 10,000 cycles at a high scan rate of 200 mV/s.<br>
      <b><br>
        Conclusions/Discussion<br>
        <br>
      </b>This project successfully designed, synthesized and
      characterized a novel nanorod electrode supercapacitor with
      increased energy density while retaining power density and long
      cycle life. This work is an important initial step in introducing
      this new electrode material in supercapacitors to replace
      conventional batteries in flexible electronic devices.<br>
      <b><br>
        Summary Statement<br>
        <br>
      </b>This project designed and synthesized a novel supercapacitor
      with increased energy density while maintaining power density and
      long cycle life using a new core-shell structure.<br>

        Field of technology<br>
        <br>
      </b>The invention belongs to the field of semiconductor thin film

      titanium dioxide nanorods composite electrode method.<br>
      <b><br>
        Second, Background<br>
        <br>
      </b>Existing technologies: nano-TiO2 is an important inorganic
      functional materials, with their photoelectric conversion, gas,
      dielectric effects and excellent photocatalytic properties, etc.,
      so that the solar cells, sensors, dielectric materials,
      self-cleaning materials and photocatalytic degradation of organic
      compounds have important applications in areas such prospects,
      become a hot research.<br>
      In recent years, many researchers are committed to synthesize
      different morphologies of TiO2 nano-, micro objects, such as
      nanotubes, nanorods, nanowires, nanoparticles, etc. (Wang D, Yu B,
      Hao J, Liu W.Mater Lett2008 ; 62:2036-2038).<br>
      <br>
      In these TiO2 nanometer, micrometer objects in a uniform
      orientation nanorod arrays as one-dimensional electron
      conductivity, large surface area, and good chemical stability and
      optical properties caused widespread concern.<br>
      <br>
      In general, the titanium alkoxide or titanium halide used in the
      preparation of TiO2 nanorods precursors, but these two substances
      are often costly and is easy on the environment pollution.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile precursor processing requires multiple steps,
      time-consuming and laborious.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the choice of titanium as a precursor prepared by
      hydrothermal reaction of TiO2 nanorods composite electrode is a
      simple and practical approach, but hydrothermal solution type and
      concentration of TiO2 nanorods is a key factor.<br>

      of titanium substrate prepared TiO2 nanorods (PENG.X, Appl.<br>
      Phys. A, 2005,80:473), this method requires heating and oxidation
      step, and the need to carry out in an inert atmosphere under
      high-temperature oxidation protection, so the process is
      complicated, the equipment requirements.<br>
      <br>
      Other research group using the AAO template prepared TiO2 nanorods
      (Jiang Wufeng, etc., Materials Science and Engineering,
      2006,104:805), AAO template as a generic template has been applied
      to the preparation of a variety of substances tube, rod array
      However, the biggest disadvantage of this method is the use of AAO
      template can not be repeated, and is not suitable for large-scale
      preparation.<br>
      <br>
      2006 Nanjing University of Ma Guobin reported using titanium
      tetrachloride as the precursor, the use of microwave hydrothermal
      method in silicon and glass coverslips were prepared rutile TiO2
      nanorods (Ma Guobin, etc., Chinese Journal of Stereology and Image
      Analysis , 2006,11 (4): 243), but its preparation process is
      complicated, the binding force of the film and the substrate is
      not good, and the titanium tetrachloride may cause pollution to
      the environment.<br>
      <br>
      2008 Wilson Smith, who used an atomic beam deposition method on
      silicon or glass slides were prepared composite TiO2 nanorods
      array and shows excellent photocatalytic properties.<br>
      <br>
      Preparation of this physical equipment requirements, the
      production cost is higher.<br>
      <br>
      Based on the above advantages and disadvantages of various methods
      known hydrothermal method is an efficient, low cost, simple and
      practical step in preparing crystalline TiO2 nanorods array.<br>
      <br>
      Including Zhejiang University, Wu Jinming in 2005, 2006
      applications on the surface of the metal titanium, hydrogen
      peroxide solution in water of TiO2 nanorods patent (Wu Jinming,
      CN200510060751, CN200610052743.9).<br>
      <br>
      These two patents in a hot solution of water used in the hydrogen
      peroxide solution are single component.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the preparation of TiO2 nanorods technical difficulties: (1)
      titanium dioxide nanorods sexual orientation is difficult to be
      controlled, or directed to be deposited by means of a template to
      grow, but this method is cumbersome, and equipment requirements
      for higher; (2) TiO2 nanorods array and a contact layer for the
      mechanical properties of nanorod arrays is particularly important.<br>
      <br>
      If TiO2 nanorods grown in situ on titanium surface is made of pure
      titanium layer as a thin film of TiO2 nanorods contact layer, you
      can ensure that TiO2 nanorod array film layer has good mechanical
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      Select other materials as the substrate tends to cause TiO2
      nanorods binding properties of the film and the substrate is not
      good, thus affecting its application performance; (3) hydrothermal
      method is simple and practical, but the water type and
      concentration of the hot solution is prepared in a single
      orientation TiO2 nanorods are two key factors.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, the hydrothermal reaction is a directional dimension of
      growth characteristics, the product is grown while the
      three-dimensional space, are often the product particles.<br>
      <br>
      To prepare the product of the growth in a particular dimension,
      you must use a special solution with directional adsorbed
      substances can restrict the growth direction of the other
      dimensions, to ensure the direction of substance in the growth of
      a particular dimension.<br>
      On the other hand, the solution concentration can affect the
      reaction rate and direction of the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      In the hydrothermal reaction substance is first dissolved in a hot
      solution of water and high pressure conditions in the nucleation,
      crystal growth and dissolution reaction is to provide crystal
      growth material, the crystal growth is the consumption of raw
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, only at the right concentration to make the raw
      materials under the "output" and "consumption" balance of these
      two processes carried out in order to ensure a uniform product
      orientation, or can not control the morphology and orientation.<br>
