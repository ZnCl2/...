            hydroxy technology in the world</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>By Sterling D. Allan</b><br>

      <br>
      With seven years of development, over 400 installations, reams of
      data, international patents awarded, for protection in 147
      countries, inventor James Culture says their H2HyPod is ready for
      international roll-out in a major way. Typical mileage improvement
      is 35% but in some cases is much higher.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hydroxy</b><br>
      <br>
      Put simply, what is happening in a typical HHO or hydroxy system
      is that water is being electrolyzed on board from electricity from
      the battery, creating "Brown's gas", which includes hydrogen and
      oxygen, as well as possibly some new species not fully
      characterized or appreciated by academia yet. It is probably in
      the formation of this new species of gas (some call it ionized HHO
      or HHOi, because of its electrical characteristics) that the
      environmental energy shows up or is harvested. The Brown's gas
      interacts with the fuel to break the larger chain molecules (that
      often go unburnt in a typical system) into smaller molecules that
      are readily burned. In highly optimized systems, allegedly the
      vehicle can run on HHO alone.<br>
      <br>
      At last week's Evolve Expo in Denver, the booth right next to ours
      was H2HyPod.<br>
      <br>
      Early on, I overhead them telling someone that they were seeing
      between 25% and 50% improvement in mileage, and that they had a
      bunch of data to support their claims. They report that on
      average, 75% of their customers get at least a 35% improvement in
      their mileage. A few have gotten as high as a 225% gain.<br>
      <br>
      They had a well-stationed booth, with 3-5 people with matching lab
      coats with their "H2HyPod" logo. It seems that every time I saw
      their booth there were several people standing there, interested
      in receiving their sales pitch and liking what they were hearing.
      And H2HyPod was very glad they had decided at the last minute to
      come, feeling like it had been well worth their while and expense,
      for the exposure and customer base they were growing.<br>
      <br>
      I was able to do a brief video interview with James Culture, the
      inventor.<br>
      <br>
      He said that what they were producing wasn't just "hydroxy" or
      "HHO" but was a "proprietary blend" that is able to trick the
      car's computer into accepting what it does to the mileage without
      counteracting it because it senses too much of one thing or
      another. Most HHO technologies have to modify the car's computer,
      which can void the warranty. At a minimum, in the other systems,
      they usually have to shut the system off when the vehicle is
      undergoing annual inspection to the vehicle so it will "pass"
      according to the computer algorithms, which are not written to
      accommodate or acknowledge the benefits of hydroxy addition to the
      fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The unit will pay for itself from the savings on fuel consumption,
      not to mention improved performance of the engine.<br>
      <br>
      The electrolyte in the water keeps it from freezing in cold
      conditions. Rather than freezing and expanding, the solution goes
      to a contracting gel, which is reconstituted in a few minutes via
      fluid dynamics.<br>
      <br>
      They have systems for everything from motorcycles to 16 L engines.<br>
      <br>
      With international patents awarded, for protection in 147
      countries, they say on their site that the "H2HyPod has a 40%
      minimum advantage over all other previously patented technology
      advancements."<br>
      <br>
      Pursuing this for seven years, with reams of data, many tests and
      improvements, including installation on over 400 customer
      vehicles, now H2HyPod is ready to roll this out in a major way.
      They are open to discussions about licensing for manufacturing and
      distribution worldwide, as well as discounts for bulk purchases
      and reselling.<br>
      <br>

        <b>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A
          HYDROGEN-CONTAINING GAS MIXTURE</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>&nbsp;</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Also published as: WO2010130845 // EP2440687</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a method for producing a
      hydrogen-containing gas mixture and to a corresponding apparatus.
      In order to further develop a method in which charge surfaces to
      which electric current is applied are in contact with a water
      mixture, and a corresponding apparatus while considerably
      increasing efficiency, the charge surfaces to which electric
      current is applied are electrically insulated in relation to each
      other as completely as possible and are connected by way of the
      water mixture only in an intermediate region in direct vicinity to
      the charge surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, from the market for retrofit kits for motor
      vehicles are known various approaches to methods and apparatus of
      the aforementioned type.<br>
      <br>
      Corresponding devices are also available for self-assembly in a
      very large number for a variety of motor vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      These devices can be roughly divided into two groups: The first
      group produced oxyhydrogen gas, or HHO gas, which is called from
      the Anglo-American area out as Brown 'basic gas.<br>
      <br>
      A second group of gas generator devices generated at a gas outlet,
      more or less pure hydrogen gas and, separately therefrom to a
      further outlet of the oxygen gas.<br>
      <br>
      Without limiting use of a field of the invention will be received
      only on passenger vehicles to display.<br>
      <br>
      However, the invention generally relates to any design of internal
      combustion engines, ie combustion engines and turbomachines, such
      as jet engines on aircraft or stationary turbine of a cogeneration
      plant.<br>
      <br>
      A further field of application of the present invention in
      combination with a fuel cell is that such<br>
      <br>
      As obtained by converting electric energy into hydrogen or a
      hydrogen-containing gas mixture can be temporarily stored in the
      regenerative braking.<br>
      <br>
      When braking at a red light then is a part of the alternatively
      converted into heat and lost braking energy in the form of
      additional fuel amount for a starting acceleration when the lights
      on green available.<br>
      <br>
      During the described process, not to large amounts of gas to fall,
      so that their caching problem and also id<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;lasting only a short time duration.For the preparation of
      larger amounts of oxyhydrogen include<br>
      <br>
      Electrolysers known of the filter press type from CH 417 544A or
      WO 2008/138125 Al.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found in trials by the applicant that the known
      devices and methods are not effective at least with respect to an
      injected current, respectively, and a generated gas amount.<br>
      <br>
      It is therefore an object of the present invention to further
      develop a method of the aforementioned type and a corresponding
      device under considerably improved efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      This object is solved by the features of the independent claims.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, an inventive method for producing a
      hydrogen-containing gas mixture is distinguished in that with
      electricity acted charge areas as completely as possible against
      each other electrically operated insulated and only in an
      intermediate region immediately adjacent to the cargo spaces
      connected via a water mixture.<br>
      <br>
      A corresponding device is characterized accordingly by the fact
      that the costs associated with an electrical power supply charge
      surfaces, in particular, as plates are connected in pairs at their
      front edges of a frame-shaped electrically insulating separator
      with each other to form a closed cell, the separator in an
      installed position an upper and a lower side surface each having
      at least one opening for fluid inlet and gas outlet and said
      openings aligned with openings in a comb-like structure of a
      cover, wherein the cover-free areas of the cargo space covering
      electrically insulating.<br>
      <br>
      Thus according to the invention is first ensured that the
      effective for an electrolysis current flow between the adjacent
      and always oppositely charged surfaces charge extends to a vast
      majority through the fluid.<br>
      Thus, the intermediate area immediately adjacent to the cargo
      spaces across the water mixture is almost exclusively connected
      electrically active, so that takes place here, an electrolytic
      decomposition of water and thus a gas generation with improved
      efficiency to an even greater mass.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageous developments of the invention are the subject matter
      of the respective dependent claims.<br>
      <br>
      A separator having two substantially oppositely disposed openings
      is prepared in one embodiment by corresponding milled recesses or
      bores.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, however, a two or three-layer structure is selected to
      substantially cover the same thin frame members, two of which or a
      middle gaps or have perforations.<br>
      <br>
      An integral separator with corresponding number and shape of
      openings in a mass-market and efficient production is thus created
      by gluing or laminating or other durable and also fluid-tight
      connection technology.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, an efficiency
      increase of the effect of the gas mixture generated by the
      combination of a HHO cell with H2 and 02 ~ gas a means of
      separating generating second electrolysis cell is such that the
      HHO gas mixture, an additional H2 content is added .<br>
      <br>
      This H2 content is preferably controlled by a separate power
      connection of the second cell.<br>
      <br>
      For good results, the flow of current through this was H2 and O2
      gas generating means of separating the electrolysis cell is about
      10% of passing through the HHO cell current.<br>
      <br>
      Further has instead use a pure direct current applying a square
      wave current having a fundamental frequency of about 30 to 80 Hz,
      preferably 48 Hz, has proved to increase efficiency with regard to
      the amount of the gas mixture produced.<br>
      <br>
      In an alternative design, each of a separator diaphragm for
      maintaining a separation of the broadest generated in a space
      adjacent electrode H2 and O2 components.<br>
      <br>
      This membrane is slightly twisted from each other in itself to
      generate spatially separate gas outlets or wound.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred manufacturing method, the membrane is fixed
      thereto, as it is wound between two C-shaped mirror symmetrical
      halves of the frame.<br>
      <br>
      The structure here is similar to the holder of a slide image into
      two cracked slide frame halves.<br>
      <br>
      Following further features and advantages of embodiments of the
      invention are explained in detail with reference to an embodiment

      Without limiting the invention, only a use of a cell according to
      the invention is hereinafter illustrated and described in a motor
      vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 1 shows a basic structure of a first embodiment of an
      apparatus 1 according to the invention to implement a method in
      efficiency can be enhanced.<br>
      <br>
      The schematic diagram indicates an assembly of an inventive device
      1 comprising an electrolysis cell 2 for producing a
      hydrogen-containing gas mixture or in the form of HHO Oxyhydrogen
      mixture at in which a number of executed as stainless steel plates
      P charge surfaces are laterally interconnected pairs in the region
      at their front edges adjacent K on a frame-shaped electrically
      insulating separator S.<br>
      <br>
      This structure corresponds largely to a closed cell, but in this
      case at least one opening O are provided for fluid inlet and gas
      outlet in a fully assembled on an upper and a lower side surface F
      of each separator S ever.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, below a water mixture W occur from water with low addition
      of electrolyte between the adjacent charge surfaces P and also
      escape an emerging under the influence of electricity gas or gas
      mixture between the charge surfaces P of the separator S out
      again.<br>
      <br>
      The openings O the side face F of each separator S are
      subsequently covered aligned in a comb-like structure formed of a
      slotted cover A with recesses V, which cover A free areas or Front
      edges of K P charge surfaces covered electrically insulating and
      so includes.<br>
      <br>
      This means that by the inventive introduction of extended paths
      for potential equalization between see the cargo area forced all
      currents to flow through the water mixture.<br>
      <br>
      This increases the yield of the generated gas or Gas mixture
      considerably.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2 shows the fully assembled cell of Figure 1 in a
      three-dimensional sketch with attached comb-like with U-or
      V-shaped recesses V slotted structures formed of the covers A. The
      assembly is and predominantly by gluing the gesture existing
      acrylic glass electrically insulating parts with corresponding
      known tested adhesives accomplished.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the end edges of adjacent panels and K are especially
      electrically connected only by a not shown further water mixture
      W, parasitic current paths without contact with the water mixture
      W are largely suppressed.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 3 shows an embodiment of an electrolytic cell having an
      electrically adjustable extended composition to a
      hydrogen-containing forming gas mixture, the composition of the
      other side of one of the pure 2: 1 stoichiometry of the H20
      molecule side gas mixture.<br>
      <br>
      This combined device 1 comprises a first cell 2 according to
      Figures 1 and 2, here in a side view, along with a separate and
      individually controllable in terms of current flow electrode of a
      second cell pair e 3<br>
      <br>
      It can be seen that in this way a via controllable by the second
      cell 3 is the current flow at an adjustable mass, only the
      H2-content of the second cell 3 and the HHO<br>
      <br>
      Is supplied oxyhydrogen mixture of the first cell 2.<br>
      <br>

      the design of detour routes or Been reduced labyrinths.<br>
      <br>
      An extension of the embodiment of Figure 3 to a heated storage
      tank is shown in Figure 4.<br>
      <br>
      The heater can be operated electrically or by exhaust heat, but it
      is to be coupled to an engine cooling circuit not shown is
      preferred to make the water mixture to an operating temperature
      and keeping it there as well.<br>

      shape is not shown in more detail the gas outlets for selectively
      supplying in a fresh air inlet in front of a turbo-compressor of a
      respective internal combustion engine.<br>
      <br>
      While in the embodiment shown in the illustration of FIG from a
      common storage tank 4 of the water mixture w a first cell 2 is
      disposed on a second cell 3 4, according to Figures 9 to 11 are
      the first cell 2 adjacent to the second cell 3 in another
      exemplary embodiment, essentially the same level of co-located
      with the storage tank 4.<br>
      <br>
      The isometric view of Figure 9 shows that layers produced in two
      different thicknesses of about 3.1 mm here and about 0.91 mm of
      acrylic glass.<br>
      <br>
      The recognizable thicker layers of 3.1 mm carry channels for
      supplying water mixture W and the dissipation of the gas bubbles G
      of the electrodes P, E. The essential difference to the foregoing
      embodiments, here is a measure against excessive heating of the
      water mixture W normal operation taken by selective pumping of the
      water mixture W.<br>
      <br>
      This is based on the realization that the formation of gas bubbles
      on the electrodes, in itself, has a cooling effect, but also by
      locally insulation changes the electrical properties.<br>
      <br>
      This change may be due to the adhesion of gas bubbles be
      relatively permanently to a respective electrode and thus
      elsewhere lead to local congestion.<br>
      <br>
      A sufficient movement of the water mixture W now causes a quasi
      flushing away the newly formed gas bubbles from the electrodes.<br>
      Without additional movable or even parts to be driven this flow is
      generated using the Venturi effect itself by the fact that the
      mixture of water and gas bubbles from the respective electrodes by
      meandering paths 5, 6, 7 to the storage tank 4 through rises and
      forms a pump.<br>
      These paths 5, 6, 7 are separated from each other in different
      layers of the arrangement shown, see Figure 10<br>
      <br>
      The arrangement of Figure 9 has three trained as pump meandering
      channels 5, 6, 7, wherein the negatively charged and thus
      hydrogen-gas-emitting electrodes produces the channels in a common
      area with two structures 8, 9 lead to foam-reduction, is taken
      from which the gas mixture G via an opening 10.<br>
      <br>
      The positively charged, and thus oxygen gas generating electrode E
      of the second cell 3 is connected along the dash-dotted arrow line
      via the channel 7 to a discrete region thereof to its own
      structure 11, for foam-reduction and thus clearly separated.<br>
      <br>
      Here, too, an opening 12 is provided for replenishing water.<br>
      <br>
      The relatively thinner layers frame the respective electrodes and
      possibly electrical leads.<br>
      <br>
      In the electrical leads is again to be observed with reference to
      Figure 10, seen thatin a mounting position - always contact from
      below the corresponding electrode plates so that electrolysis
      takes place only at the electrode-sheet and not on leads.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the feed cables run only out in a U-curve over a MAX
      mark, only to come snapping off from the bonded acrylic case out
      only down.<br>
      Thus, the leakage of water mixture along the electrical leads can
      be prevented even in continuous operation.<br>
      <br>
      This therefore results in a very compact and space-efficient
      structure in stratified design, which is in terms of performance
      in terms of gas production of both types of cells 2, 3, easily
      scalable or varied by exchange.<br>
      <br>
      It shows the display of Figure 11 is an exploded view of the
      arrangement of Figure 9 that there is a total of the first cell
      comprises two electrodes of five encircled part numbers 4, 8 and
      12, only two of which are supplied from outside with power.<br>
      <br>
      The embedded in a segment with the component name 7 electrodes can
      be easily added with upstream or downstream segments with the
      component names 9, 10, 11.<br>
      <br>
      In a significant, not shown in the drawings here training
      membranes are placed at a distance from the contacting with the
      water mixture W surfaces of the plates P.<br>
      <br>
      The use here of the membrane type, as illustrated in the figures
      of the figures 5 to 6b.<br>
      <br>
      These are now fitted in the corresponding recesses of the
      electrodes plates P thicker acrylic plates.<br>
      <br>
      This means that to achieve pure hydrogen gas generation compared
      with the arrangement shown in Figure 11 is better efficiency and
      higher purities at adjustment.<br>
      <br>
      To improve the corrosion resistance, it has been shown that
      feeding a small amount of diesel or castor oil is useful and
      effective.<br>
      <br>
      The oil covered bodies with material defects, inclusions or small
      holes, thus preventing a certain operating time their progressive
      enlargement.<br>
