          <br>
        </span></div>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> For several years a Chicago
        entrepreneur has labored quietly building a company to create an
        alternative to batteries for powering cell phones and other
        small gadgets.<br>
        <br>
        The company, Lattice Energy LLC, deliberately kept a low profile
        because its core technology, first called cold fusion 18 years
        ago, has long been ridiculed by mainstream scientists. Lewis
        Larsen, Lattice's founder, didn't want his enterprise tainted by
        the empty promises of unlimited cheap energy surrounding cold
        fusion.<br>
        <br>
        Larsen, who has had careers in investment banking and
        consulting, has worked with many scientists doing experiments
        with what now is called low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR)
        rather than cold fusion. Even with the name change, he said,
        many scientists mistakenly still believe they are creating
        nuclear fusion in a bottle when they thrust palladium or other
        metals into heavy water and add energy.<br>
        <br>
        "A lot of people are doing very good chemistry experiments, but
        they don't understand what's happening," Larsen said. "They
        write fine papers but then add foolish speculation."<br>
        <br>
        A few years ago Larsen began collaborating with a theoretical
        physicist, professor Allan Widom of Northeastern University in
        Boston, to help him understand why LENR experiments often give
        off heat and charged particles.<br>
        <br>
        Before taking on the assignment, Widom was a skeptic, but Larsen
        showed him enough experimental results from laboratories in
        Russia, China and Japan, as well as the U.S., to convince him
        that something important was happening.<br>
        <br>
        The problem soon became apparent to Widom: The experimenters
        were convinced that atoms of a form of hydrogen called deuterium
        were fusing together to form helium.<br>
        <br>
        "That kind of fusion requires very high temperatures," Widom
        said.<br>
        <br>
        Rather than look for other explanations, most experimenters
        preferred to invent new laws of physics to account for cold
        fusion, Widom said. But instead of a strong nuclear force like
        fusion at work, he concluded that <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">a weak force was at the core of the experimental
          results. Electrons were combining with protons to form
          neutrons, giving off energy in the process</span>.<br>
        <br>
        The entrepreneur and the professor have published their
        Widom-Larsen theory of low-energy nuclear reactions and have
        been meeting with business executives and government officials
        to build credibility for their ideas.<br>
        <br>
        "Our model invokes no new physics," said Widom. "Everything
        we've done conforms to the Standard Model's predictions for weak
        interactions."<br>
        <br>
        With advances in nanotechnology, Larsen predicts it will become
        practical to design devices using LENR to power cell phones that
        can last 500 hours. The technology also might be used to produce
        power in other settings, but Larsen said, "We're going for the
        best available market with lots of demand, and that's electronic
        mobile devices."<br>
        <br>
        Larsen, who has competitors domestically and abroad also working
        on the problem, predicts that within five years there will be
        power sources based on LENR technology.<br>

      2. Cite and discuss outstanding new experimental paper by Mead et
      al. (Environmental Science and Technology, Feb. 2013) in which
      they report measurements of anomalous shifts in Mercury isotopes
      found in household compact fluorescent lights (CFLs); according to
      the paper’s authors, a portion of these observed shifts are simply
      not explainable with well-known MDF or MIF mechanisms for prosaic
      chemical fractionation. Examine strong possibility that some
      indeterminate percentage of isotopic shift anomalies present in
      Mead et al.’s new data could potentially have been caused by low
      energy neutron reactions (LENRs) occurring at extremely low rates
      somewhere inside CF lights during normal operation; this would be
      an unexpected, surprising discovery. Discuss additional types of
      measurements that experimentalists could make on such CFLs (SIMS,
      solid-state NMR, etc.) to unambiguously determine: (1) whether
      LENRs are occurring therein; (2) if so, at exactly what locations
      inside the lights; (3) at what reaction rates; and (4) what
      percentage of observed shifts in Mercury isotopes might reasonably
      be attributed to LENR transmutations vs. prosaic chemical
      fractionation processes? LENRs don’t produce hard radiation or
      long-lived wastes Thus can be hidden in plain sight and occur in
      many surprising places Subtle isotopic traces of LENRs can readily
      be observed with mass spectroscopy Main points in this

      Quoting abstract directly: “The recent widespread adoption of
      compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) has increased their importance as
      a source of environmental Hg. Stable isotope analysis can identify
      the sources of environmental Hg, but the isotopic composition of
      Hg from CFL is not yet known. Results from analyses of CFL with a
      range of hours of use show that the Hg they contain is
      isotopically fractionated in a unique pattern during normal CFL
      operation. This fractionation is large by comparison to other
      known fractionating processes for Hg and has a distinctive,
      mass-independent signature, such that CFL Hg could be uniquely
      identified from other sources. The fractionation process described
      here may also explain anomalous fractionation of Hg isotopes in
      precipitation.” Direct quotes selected from body of paper:
      “Trapped Hg of used CFL show unusually large isotopic
      fractionation, the pattern of which is entirely different from
      that which has been observed in previous Hg isotope research aside
      from intentional isotope enrichment. Most notably, there is no
      straightforward relationship between extent of fractionation and
      isotope mass. Thus, while previous studies of MIF of Hg only
      observed large deviations from mass- dependence in odd mass
      isotopes, our results clearly show MIF across multiple even mass
      and odd mass isotopes.” Fig. shows large deviations from MDF and
      unused samples<br>

      9. “We have now not only traversed the region of the pure
      understanding and carefully surveyed every part of it, but we have
      also measured it, and assigned to everything therein its proper
      place. But this land is an island, and enclosed by Nature herself
      within unchangeable limits. It is the land of truth (an attractive
      word), surrounded by a wide and stormy ocean, the region of
      illusion, where many a fog-bank, many an iceberg, seems to the
      mariner, on his voyage of discovery, a new country, and, while
      constantly deluding him with vain hopes, engages him in dangerous
      adventures, from which he never can desist, and which yet he never
      can bring to a termination. But before venturing upon this sea, in
      order to explore it in its whole extent, and to arrive at a
      certainty whether anything is to be discovered there, it will not
      be without advantage if we cast our eyes upon the chart of the
      land that we are about to leave, and to ask ourselves, firstly,
      whether we cannot rest perfectly contented with what it contains,
      or whether we must not of necessity be contented with it, if we
      can find nowhere else a solid foundation to build upon; and,
      secondly, by what title we possess this land itself, and how we
      hold it secure against all hostile claims?” Immanuel Kant, “The

      10.Modern nuclear alchemy al la Widom-Larsen. Nuclear and chemical
      energy realms can interconnect in small regions&nbsp; 1. Since the
      inception of modern nuclear science in ~1940s, it has been widely
      believed that the only nuclear processes suitable for commercial
      power generation were strong interaction fission or fusion; it was
      also thought that nuclear transmutation reactions could only
      happen in certain environments, e.g., fission reactors, nuclear
      weapons, or stars. Pons &amp; Fleischmann’s 1989 discovery of
      seemingly nuclear processes operating inside what would otherwise
      be ordinary D2O electrolytic chemical cells challenged long-
      established conceptual paradigms about nuclear physics. Initially,
      P&amp;F rashly speculated that their observed radiation-free
      “excess heat” resulted from some sort of a D+D “cold fusion”
      process. That totally erroneous theoretical idea, coupled with
      then-irreproducible experimental results, resulted in deep
      skepticism about LENRs by mainstream scientists that has persisted
      to the present. Starting with release of our first arXiv preprint
      in 2005, the Widom-Larsen theory of LENRs has shown, using known
      physics, how energetic nuclear reactions can occur in ordinary
      chemical cells. Per W-L, key aspects of LENRs involve weak
      interactions that can occur in a variety of different environments
      under relatively mild physical conditions. Our theory posits that
      in condensed matter systems, many-body collective quantum effects
      allow otherwise disparate chemical and nuclear energy realms to
      briefly interconnect in special nm- to micron-scale regions on
      surfaces. 1. Rudyard Kipling, “The Battle of East and West” (1889)<br>

      11. “The neutron plays a pivotal role in manmade transmutations.
      In the words of Bronowski, ‘At twilight on the sixth day of
      Creation, so say the Hebrew commentators to the Old Testament, God
      made for man a number of tools that gave him also the gift of
      creation. If the commentators were alive today, they would write,
      ‘God made the neutron.’ Is it far-fetched to consider the neutron
      to be the Stone of the Philosophers (and atom smashers to be
      athanors – the furnaces of the Philosophic Egg)? Frankly, yes.
      But, in 1941, fast neutrons were used to transmute mercury into a
      tiny quantity of gold1.. Was the age old dream realized? Would a
      modern day version of the Roman Emperor Diocletian have to burn
      all the notebooks and journal articles and destroy the atom
      smashers in order to protect the world’s currency? Well, probably
      not. It is likely that an ounce of such gold would cost more than
      the net worth of the planet. Also, the gold so obtained is
      radioactive and lives for only a few days at most. But, we are not
      always logical when it comes to gold. In the words of Black Elk, a
      holy man of the Oglala Lakota-Sioux on the Pine Ridge Reservation
      in South Dakota, ‘Our people knew there was yellow metal in little
      chunks up there, but they did not bother with it, because it was
      not good for anything’.” 1. Sherr et al., The Physical Review 60

      well-accepted nuclear science “Alchemy, derived from the Arabic
      word ‘al-kimia’ is both a philosophy and an ancient practice
      focused on the attempt to change base metals into gold,
      investigating the preparation of the ‘elixir of longevity’, and
      achieving ultimate wisdom, involving the improvement of the
      alchemist as well as the making of several substances described as
      possessing unusual properties. The practical aspect of alchemy
      generated the basics of modern inorganic chemistry, namely
      concerning procedures, equipment and the identification and use of
      many current substances. Alchemy has been practiced in ancient
      Egypt, Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), India (modern Indian
      subcontinent), Persia (modern Iran), China, Japan, Korea, the
      classical Greco-Roman world, the medieval Islamic world, and then
      medieval Europe up to the 20th century, in a complex network of
      schools and philosophical systems spanning at least 2,500 years.”

      According to the WLT, LENRs and chemistry intersect on nm - &#956;
      length-scales in condensed matter systems under comparatively
      ‘mild’ conditions compared to interiors of stars, nuclear weapons,
      and fuel rods of operating fission reactors. Production of gold
      from lower-Z elements such as Tungsten (W) is not just some
      alchemist’s fevered delusion. It is an understandable result of
      ULM neutron-captures on W and subsequent beta decays, both of
      which are presently well-accepted in mainstream nuclear science

      17. Overview: Widom-Larsen theory of LENRs LENR-active surface
      sites in condensed matter are not permanent entities or static
      structures; in fact, they are extraordinarily dynamic, short
      lived, many-body collective organizations of matter. In
      experimental or certain natural systems with sufficient input
      energy, when conditions are just right they will form
      spontaneously, operate for as little as 10 ns up to perhaps
      several hundred nanoseconds, and then suddenly ‘die’ (they
      effectively destroy themselves with heat). Over time or the course
      of a given experiment, many cycles of ‘birth’, nuclear binding
      energy release, and ‘death’ may be repeated over and over again at
      many different, randomly scattered nm-to &#956;m-sized locations found
      on an LENR-active surface or interface; neutron-dose histories can
      vary greatly over small length-scales across an entire LENR-active
      surface. Such spatial elemental/isotopic heterogeneity has often
      been observed by LENR researchers with SIMS. While ULM neutron
      production and local capture, gamma conversion to IR by heavy
      electrons, and subsequent nuclear decays are occurring, these tiny
      patches temporarily become hot spots. Their temperatures may
      briefly reach 4,000 - 6,000o K or perhaps even higher. That value
      is roughly as high as the surface temperature of the Sun and hot
      enough to melt and/or even flash-boil essentially all metals and
      alloys, including Tungsten (b.p. 5,666o C). For a brief time, a
      tiny dense ball of very hot, nanodusty plasma is created. Such
      intense local heating events can produce various types of
      distinctive explosive melting features and/or comparatively deep
      craters that are often observed in post-experiment SEM images of
      LENR device surfaces; for example, please see Zhang &amp; Dash’s
      SEM-EDX image of such surface features on Slide #69 in <br>

      18. Unlike fission and fusion reactions, naturally occurring LENR
      transmutation processes in condensed matter are biologically
      benign because they make extensive use of and are enabled by
      many-body collective effects, quantum phenomena, and the weak
      interaction. As a result, they typically do not emit dangerous
      high-energy gamma photon or neutron radiation, nor do they produce
      large amounts of long-lived radioactive isotopes. LENRs are clean,
      green, ubiquitous, and effectively hidden in plain sight; best way
      to detect subtle effects of these processes is to analyze samples
      with very sensitive mass spectroscopy. In a 2012 Lattice
      PowerPoint presentation <br>
      <a

      On Slide #68 we stated that, “Recently, greatly increased use of
      various types of mass spectroscopy by geochemists,
      microbiologists, and environmental scientists has revealed that
      the longstanding assumption of effective natural uniformity of
      U238/U235 ratios across the earth is clearly erroneous;
      importantly, present-era abiological and/or biologically mediated
      processes appear to be responsible for such anomalous variances.”
      We concluded that key remaining questions were whether, “ ...
      anomalous variances in such isotopic ratios the result of purely
      chemical ‘fractionation’ process or processes of some sort, and/or
      could they [alternatively] be caused by low energy nuclear
      reactions (LENRs), either abiologically or somehow induced by the
      actions of bacteria through some yet to be clarified mechanism?” A
      large array of additional measurements is obviously needed.
      Absence of strong radiation signatures renders LENRs unnoticeable<br>
      <br>
      19. Metallic substrates: substantial quantities of Hydrogen
      isotopes must be brought into intimate contact with fully-loaded
      metallic hydride-forming metals; e.g., Palladium, Platinum,
      Rhodium, Nickel, Titanium , Tungsten, etc.; please note that
      collectively oscillating, very roughly 2-D surface plasmon (SP)
      electrons are intrinsically present and cover exposed surfaces of
      such metals. At full loading occupation of ionized Hydrogen at
      interstitial sites in bulk metallic lattices, many- body,
      collectively oscillating patches of protons (p+), deuterons (d+),
      or tritons (t+) will then form spontaneously at random locations
      scattered across metal hydrides’ surface interfaces; And/or
      certain types of Carbon substrates: delocalized, many-body
      collectively oscillating &#960; electron clouds that comprise outer
      covering surfaces of fullerenes, graphene, benzene, and polycyclic
      aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules behave very similarly to SPs;
      when such Carbon-based molecules are hydrogenated (i.e.,
      chemically protonated), they can create many-body, collectively
      oscillating, Q-M entangled quantum systems that, in context of the
      Widom-Larsen theory of LENRs, are functionally equivalent to and
      behave dynamically like loaded metallic hydrides; Breakdown of
      Born-Oppenheimer approximation: in both cases above, occurs in
      tiny surface patches of contiguous collections of collectively
      oscillating p+, d+, and/or t+ ions; enables E-M coupling between
      nearby SP or alternatively delocalized &#960; electrons and nearby
      hydrogenous ions; patches create their own local nuclear-strength
      electric fields; effective masses of coupled patch electrons are
      then increased to a significant multiple of an electron at rest
      (e- &#8594; e-*) that is determined by required simultaneous energy
      input(s); and Disequilibrium input energy: triggering LENRs
      requires external non-equilibrium fluxes of charged particles or
      electromagnetic (E-M) photons that transfer input energy directly
      to many-body SP or &#960; electron plasmonic surface films. Examples of
      such external energy sources include (they may be used in
      combination): electric currents (electron beams); E-M photons
      (e.g., emitted from lasers, IR radiation from resonant E-M cavity
      walls, etc.); pressure gradients of p+, d+, and/or t+ ions imposed
      across surfaces; currents of other ions crossing the SP electron
      surface film in either direction (ion beams); etc. Such sources
      provide additional input energy required to surpass certain
      minimum H-isotope-specific electron- mass thresholds that allow
      production of ULM neutron fluxes via e-* + p+, e-* + d+, or e-* +
      t+ electroweak nuclear reactions. Following required to create
      right conditions for LENR-active surfaces<br>
      <br>
      20. LENR hot spots create intense local heating and variety of
      readily noticeable surface features such as craters: over time,
      LENR-active surfaces inevitably experience major micron-scale
      changes in local nanostructures and elemental/isotopic
      compositions. On LENR-active substrate surfaces, there are a
      myriad of different complex, nanometer-to micron-scale
      electromagnetic, chemical, and nuclear processes that operate in
      conjunction with and simultaneously with each other. LENRs involve
      interactions between surface plasmon electrons, E-M fields, and
      many different types of nanostructures with varied geometries,
      surface locations relative to each other, different- strength
      local E-M fields, and varied chemical/isotopic compositions;
      chemical and nuclear realms interoperate, To varying degrees, many
      of these complex, time-varying surface interactions are
      electromagnetically coupled on many different physical
      length-scales: thus, mutual E-M resonances can be very important
      in such systems. In addition to optical frequencies, SP and &#960;
      electrons in condensed matter often also have some absorption and
      emission bands in infrared (IR) and UV portions of E-M spectrum.
      Well, walls of gas-phase metallic or glass LENR reaction vessels
      can emit various wavelengths of E-M photon energy into the
      interior space; glass tubes with inside surfaces coated with
      complex phosphors can function as resonant E-M cavities. Target
      nanostructures, nanoparticles, and/or molecules located inside
      such cavities can absorb IR, UV, or visible photons radiated from
      vessel walls if their absorption bands happen (or are engineered)
      to fall into same spectral range as E-M cavity wall radiation
      emission; complex two-way E-M interactions between targets and
      walls occurs (imagine interior of a reaction vessel as arrays of
      E-M nanoantennas with walls and targets having two-way
      send/receive channels), Wide variety of complex, interrelated E-M,
      nuclear, and chemical processes may be occurring simultaneously,
      side-by-side in adjacent nm to &#956;-scale local regions on
      LENR-active surfaces: for example, some regions on a given surface
      may be absorbing E-M energy locally, while others nearby can be
      emitting energy (e.g., as energetic electrons, photons, other
      charged particles, etc.). At the very same time, energy can be
      transferred laterally from regions of resonant absorption or
      capture to other regions in which emission or consumption is
      taking place, e.g., photon or electron emission, and/or LENRs in
      which [E-M field energy] + e- &#8594; e-* + p+ &#8594; nulm + &#957; LENR-active
      surfaces host many dynamically interacting processes<br>
      <br>
      21.&nbsp; Using conceptual insights provided by the WLT,
      experimental conditions in condensed matter systems and dusty
      plasmas can be technologically tweaked to increase rates of weak
      reaction neutron production vastly above whatever levels might
      ever be attainable in analogous systems found at random out in
      Nature or the myriad of LENR laboratory experiments that have been
      conducted to date, It is known within the field of LENRs that,
      under exactly the right conditions and in a number of different
      types of experimental systems (e.g., rare well-performing
      current-driven aqueous H2O/D2O electrolytic chemical cells), rates
      of transmutation product production (which according to WLT are
      very closely related to parallel rates of many-body, collective
      electroweak reaction ULM neutron production) can be quite
      substantial. Measured indirectly via qualitative and quantitative
      assays of LENR transmutation products, estimates of experimentally
      observed, effectively neutron production rates reported by LENR
      researchers range from ~109 - 1010 cm2/sec up to ~1012 - 1016
      cm2/sec in a small subset of very well-performing experimental
      systems. In 2007, Widom &amp; Larsen published first-principles
      calculations which show that substantial ULM neutron production
      rates via such electroweak reactions are theoretically possible in
      condensed matter systems under such mild conditions; calculated
      results for such rates in a model electrolytic chemical cell (on
      the order of 1012 to 1014 neutrons cm2/second) are thus in good
      agreement with the best available published experimental data;

      Technologically, many-body collective electroweak neutron
      production rates can be directly manipulated by: (1) controlling
      total numbers and density of e-p+ pairs on a given surface (which
      is ~equivalent to controlling the area-density and dimensions of
      many- body, collectively oscillating surface patches of protons or
      deuterons); and (2) controlling the rate and total quantity of
      appropriate form(s) of nonequilibrium energy input into
      LENR-active patches; appropriate forms of input energy can go
      directly into high electric fields that bathe SP electrons in a
      patch --- it determines the number and effective masses of e*
      electrons present in a given patch whose increased masses are at
      values somewhere above the minimum mass-renormalization threshold
      ratio, &#946;0 that is required for initiating e* + p+ or e* + d+
      electroweak neutron production reactions. The term (&#946; - &#946;0)2 in
      our published LENR rate equation reflects the degree to which mass
      renormalized e* electrons in a given patch exceed the minimum
      threshold ratio for electroweak neutron production &#946;0. Rigorous

      LENR reaction rates can be increased by controlling key parameters
      All other things being equal, the higher the density of e-p+

      23. “The delusion of transmutation” “As we peer down the vista of
      the past we find the delusion of transmutation holding the most
      prominent place in the minds of thinking men. Frenzied alchemy
      held the world in its grip for seventeen centuries and more of
      recorded history. This pseudoscience with its alluring goal and
      fascinating mysticism dominated the thoughts and actions of
      thousands. In the records of intellectual aberrations it holds a
      unique position. Even Roger Bacon of Oxford, easily the most
      learned man of his age, the monk who seven hundred years ago
      foresaw such modern scientific inventions as the steamship and the
      flying machine, believed in the possibility of solving this all-
      consuming problem … Sir Isaac Newton, one of the clearest
      scientific thinkers of all time, bought and consulted books on
      alchemy as late as the eighteenth century … The power and the
      influence of many of the alchemists can hardly be exaggerated …
      While among the alchemists there were some genuine enthusiasts
      like Bernard Trevisan, the annals of this queer practice are
      filled with accounts of charlatans and spurious adepts who, with a

      in 1901; Rutherford subsequently received Nobel prize in chemistry
      in 1908 “In 1901, twenty-four year-old chemist Frederick Soddy and
      Ernest Rutherford were attempting to identify a mysterious gas
      that wafted from samples of radioactive thorium oxide. They
      suspected that this gas - they called it an ‘emanation’ - held a
      key to the recently discovered phenomenon of radioactivity. Soddy
      had passed the puzzling gas over a series of powerful chemical
      reagents, heated white-hot. When no reactions took place, he came
      to a startling realization. As he told his biographer many years
      later, ´I remember quite well standing there transfixed as though
      stunned by the colossal import of the thing and blurting out-or so
      it seemed at the time, ‘Rutherford, this is transmutation: the
      thorium is disintegrating and transmuting itself into argon gas.’

      25. Historical perspective: over 100 years of data 1920:
      Rutherford predicts neutron and its creation via electric
      discharges “On present views, the neutral hydrogen atom is
      regarded as a nucleus of unit charge with an electron attached at
      a distance, and the spectrum of hydrogen is ascribed to the
      movements of this distant electron. Under some conditions however,
      it may be possible for an electron to combine much more closely
      with the H nucleus, forming a kind of neutral doublet [neutron].
      Such an atom would have very novel properties. Its external field
      would be practically zero, except very close to the nucleus, and
      in consequence it should be able to move freely through matter.
      Its presence would be difficult to detect by the spectroscope, and
      it may be impossible to contain in in a sealed vessel. On the
      other hand, it should enter readily the structure of atoms, and
      may either unite with the nucleus [now called neutron capture] or
      be disintegrated by its intense field, resulting in possibly the
      escape of a charged H atom [now called proton emission] or an
      electron [now called beta particle emission] or both.” 2nd
      Bakerian lecture was given in London on June 20, 1920 “Nuclear
      constitution of atoms” Ernest Rutherford Proc. Roy. Soc. pp. 577 -
      585 (1920)
      http://web.ihep.su/dbserv/compas/src/rutherford20/eng.pdf Quoting
      further (his next statement is utterly astounding): “If the
      existence of such atoms [he is referring to neutrons here] be
      possible, it is to be expected that they may be produced, but
      probably in only very small numbers, in the electric discharge
      through hydrogen, where both electrons and H nuclei are present in
      considerable numbers. It is the intention of this writer to make
      experiments to test whether any indication of the production of
      such atoms [read ‘neutrons’] can be obtained under these
      conditions.” Comment: Rutherford is saying that neutrons could be
      produced by intense electric discharges in Hydrogen.<br>

      26. Historical perspective: over 100 years of data 1922: Wendt
      &amp; Irion see Helium spectroscopically in exploding W wire
      “Experimental attempts to decompose Tungsten at high temperatures”
      “This has become possible through the work of Anderson whose
      method of exploding wires at temperatures above 20,000o, well
      above that attributed to the hottest stars, has become valuable in
      spectroscopy. In our application of this method the [Tungsten]
      wires were exploded within strong glass bulbs so that the gaseous
      products of the explosions could be collected for analysis. The
      method thus includes factors, both of cause and of error,
      analogous to those operative in the voluminous and inconclusive
      controversy on the evolution of helium in various types of low
      pressure discharge tubes, extending from 1903 to 1915.” American
      Chemical Society 44 pp. 1887 - 1894 (1922) Quoting further: “The
      bulb was then connected to the leads from the condenser through
      the spark gap and the wire was exploded by closing the primary
      circuit of the transformer. There was a delay of a fraction of a
      second before the condenser was fully charged to the voltage used,
      about 30,000, but thereafter the wire disappeared in a brilliant
      flash … [conclusion] When fine Tungsten wires are exploded in a
      vacuum at such temperatures, the spectrum of Helium appears in the
      gases produced.” Comment: Wendt &amp; Irion’s results were
      discredited by an attack that Rutherford published in Nature. This
      stopped their work and effectively ended their careers. In 2006,
      we reanalyzed their data in light of the Widom-Larsen theory and
      discovered that their experimental results were most likely
      correct and Rutherford’s criticisms were wrong. Please see our

      winning Nobel prize, Millikan excited about transmutations “As

      that we were knocking hydrogen out of aluminum and other metals by
      very powerful electric discharges in vacuo … How much farther can
      we go in this artificial transmutation of elements? This is one of
      the supremely interesting problems of modern physics upon which we
      are all assiduously working.” Comment made on pp. 584 by Robert
      Millikan, then at Caltech, as written in his Scribner’s magazine

      Quoting further: “… Has nature a way of making these
      transmutations in her laboratories? She is doing it under our eyes

      directions, heavier atoms being continually formed, as well as

      Hantaro’s “Saturn model” of the atom was only competing model
      cited by Rutherford in his seminal 1911 paper on atomic nuclei.
      Given the very international character of science even at that

      Abstract: "The experiment on the transmutation of mercury was
      begun in September 1924, with the assistance of Messrs. Y.
      Sugiura, T. Asada and T. Machida. The main object was to ascertain
      if the view which we expressed in NATURE of March 29, 1924, can be
      realised by applying an intense electric field to mercury atoms.
      Another object was to find if the radio- active changes can be
      accelerated by artificial means. From the outset it was clear that
      a field of many million volts/cm. is necessary for the purpose.
      From our observation on the Stark effect in arcs of different
      metals (Jap. Journ. Phys., vol. 3, pp. 45 “73) we found that with
      silver globules the field in a narrow space very near the metal
      was nearly 2 Ã -105 volts/cm. with terminal voltage of about 140.
      The presence of such an intense field indicated the possibility of
      obtaining the desired strength of the field for transmutation, if
      sufficient terminal voltage be applied. Though the above ratio of
      magnification would be diminished with high voltage, the
      experiment was thought worth trying, even if we could not effect
      the transmutation with the apparatus at hand." Historical
      perspective: over 100 years of data 1925: Nagaoka sees Gold from
      Tungsten electrodes w. electric arcs in oil<br>
      <br>
      32. Essence of Prof. Nagaoka’s experiments: In the simplest terms:
      Prof. Nagaoka created a powerful electric arc discharge between a
      spark gap comprising two metallic, Thorium-oxide-free Tungsten (W)
      electrodes (supplied by Tokyo Electric Company) bathed in a
      dielectric liquid “paraffin” (today referred to as transformer
      oil; general formula CnH2n+2) that was interlaced with liquid
      native Mercury (Hg). Depending on experiment, arcing between
      Tungsten electrodes in oil was continued for 4 - 15 hours until,
      quoting, “ … the oil and mercury were mixed into a black pasty
      mass.” Please note that Mercury readily forms amalgams with many
      different metals, including Gold (Au) and Tungsten (W). Small
      flecks of Gold were sometimes quite visible to the naked eye in
      “black masses” produced at the end of a given experiment. They
      also noted that, “The Gold obtained from Mercury seems to be
      mostly adsorbed to Carbon.”. Microscopic assays were conducted by,
      “heating small pieces of glass with the Carbon,” to form a
      so-called “Ruby glass” that can be used to infer the presence of
      gold colloids from visual cues very apparent under a microscope.
      Critics complained about the possibility that the Gold observed
      was some sort of “contamination.” Responding to critics, Nagaoka
      et al. further purified literally everything they could think of
      and also made certain that the lab environs were squeaky clean;
      they still kept seeing anomalous Gold. Also, in some experiments
      they also observed, “a minute quantity of white metal.” Two years
      later in 1926, Nagaoka reported to Scientific American that they
      had finally been able to identify the “white metal” --- it was
      Platinum (Pt) Fig. 1 – Apparatus for the electric discharge H.

      electric arcs in oil<br>
      <br>
      33. All of the ingredients for LENRs to occur were in fact
      present: hydride-forming metal found therein was Tungsten (sadly,
      Nagaoka was unaware that Mercury was more-or-less a red herring);
      which was in contact with abundant Hydrogen (protons) in
      transformer oil (CnH2n+2); the Born-Oppenheimer approximation
      broke-down on surfaces of electrodes; and finally, there were
      large non-equilibrium fluxes of charged particles --- electrons in
      the high-current arc discharges. Unbeknownst to Nagaoka, his
      high-current arcs probably also produced small amounts of
      fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and perhaps even a little graphene.
      ULM neutron production rates via W-L weak interaction could have
      been quite substantial in his high-electric-current-driven
      experimental system because of very large inputs of electrical
      energy. What could have happened in Nagaoka’s experiments was that
      Tungsten-seed, ULM neutron-catalyzed nucleosynthetic networks
      spontaneously formed. What follows is but one example of an
      energetically favorable network pathway that could produce
      detectable amounts of the only stable Gold isotope, 197Au, within
      ~4 hours (shortest arc discharge period after which Au was
      observed). Other alternative viable LENR pathways can produce
      unstable Gold isotopes, e.g., 198Au with half-life = 2.7 days and
      199Au with HL = 3.1 days (both would be around for a time at end
      of a successful experiment). One possible 74W180-target LENR
      network pathway that could produce Pt and Au in as little time as
      4-5 hrs follows: 74W-186 Stable 28.4% 76Os-192 Stable 41% 79Au-197

      Platinum, Palladium, and Gold in pine needles of Pinus pinea from
      the city of Palermo (Italy)” G. Dongarra, D. Varrica, and G.
      Sabatino Applied Geochemistry 18 pp. 109-116 (2003) Quoting:
      “Preliminary data on the presence of Pt, Pd and Au in airborne
      particulate matter from the urban area of Palermo (Sicily, Italy)
      are presented. They were obtained by analysing 40 samples of pine
      needles (Pinus pinea L.) collected in and around the city.
      Observed concentrations range from 1 to 102 &#956;g/kg for Pt, 1 to 45
      &#956;g/kg for Pd and 22 to 776 &#956;g/kg for Au. Platinum and Pd
      concentrations in pine needles are up to two orders of magnitude
      higher than their crustal abundances. They exhibit a high
      statistical correlation (R2=0.74) which suggests a common origin.”
      “Precious metal concentrations measured within the city centre are
      much higher than those occurring outside the town. The
      distribution patterns of Pt and Pd in the study area are compared
      to the distributions of Au and Pb. Gold is enriched at the same
      sites where Pt and Pd are enriched, while Pb shows some
      discrepancies. The most probable local source of all of these
      elements is traffic. Average Pt and Pd emissions in the city area
      are estimated to be about 136 and 273 g/a, respectively.”

      Nagaoka’s reported results were probably correct; Gold (Au) and
      Platinum (Pt) could have been produced by LENRs per W-L theory:
      Plausible LENR nucleosynthetic pathway shown in a previous Slide
      suggests that Nagaoka et al.’s claimed observations of
      macroscopically visible particles of Gold in their ca. 1920s
      electric arc experiments in transformer oil could very well have
      been correct observations. Note that stable Gold can also be
      produced via neutron capture on stable 80Hg196 which creates
      unstable 80Hg197 that has a half-life of 2.7 days and decays via
      electron capture into stable 79Au197. However, the natural
      abundance (0.15%) of 80Hg19 initially present in Nagaoka's
      mid-1920s experiments was so low that this alternative LENR
      pathway cannot plausibly account for observed production of
      macroscopic flecks of metallic of Au and Pt that are readily
      visible to the naked human eye. Please take note of the quotation
      from Prof. Nagaoka reproduced on earlier Slide. In saying what he
      said, Hantaro clearly believed that some sort of commercial
      transmutation technology would eventually be developed at some
      point in the future. Thus, in our opinion not only was he a
      humble, brilliant scientist; he was also a rather bold visionary
      thinker --- truly a man far ahead of his own time. In the present
      era it is very possible that minute quantities of Gold are
      actually being produced in automobile catalytic converters via the
      transmutation of some Platinum present in the converters: at

      36. 1932: Chadwick confirms existence of Rutherford’s predicted
      neutron “It is evident that we must either relinquish the
      application of the conservation of energy and momentum in these
      collisions or adopt another hypothesis about the nature of the
      radiation. If we suppose that the radiation is not a quantum
      radiation, but consists of particles of mass very nearly equal to
      that of the proton, all the difficulties connected with the
      collisions disappear, both with regard to their frequency and to
      the energy transfer to different masses. In order to explain the
      great penetrating power of the radiation we must further assume
      that the particle has no net charge. We may suppose it to consist
      of a proton and an electron in close combination, the ‘neutron’ as
      discussed by Rutherford in his Bakerian Lecture of 1920.” Above

      Quoting further: “The properties of penetrating radiation emitted
      from Beryllium (and Boron) when bombarded by the &#945;-particles of
      Polonium have been examined. It is concluded that the radiation
      consists, not of quanta as hitherto supposed, but of neutrons,
      particles of mass 1, and charge 0. Evidence is given to show that
      the mass of the neutron is probably between 1.005 and 1.008 …
      Although there is certain evidence for the emission of neutrons
      only in two cases of nuclear transformations, we must nevertheless
      suppose that the neutron is a common constituent of atomic nuclei
      … It is … possible to suppose that the neutron is an elementary
      particle. This view has little to recommend it at present …”
      Neutral nuclear particle had been boldly conjectured by Rutherford
      back in 1920<br>
      <br>
      37. 1933: at his pinnacle, Rutherford dismisses commercial
      transmutation “Anyone who expects a source of power from the
      transformation of the atom is talking moonshine.” Variations of
      this comment made many times by Rutherford during 1930s; died
      suddenly in 1937 at age 66 Epilogue: fission discovered (1939);
      first use of atomic weapons (1945); first commercial reactor
      (1955) “We might in these processes obtain very much more energy
      than the proton supplied, but on the average we could not expect
      to obtain energy in this way. It was a very poor and inefficient
      way of producing energy, and anyone who looked for a source of
      power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine.
      But the subject was scientifically interesting because it gave
      insight into the atoms.” The London Times, Sept. 12, 1933, quoted
      from talk given by Rutherford at a meeting of the British
      Association for the Advancement of Science<br>
      <br>
      38. Historical perspective: over 100 years of data 1934: Fermi
      published beta decay theory in which neutrinos are invoked
      “Versuch einer theorie der &#946;-strahlen. I“ Googlish translation of
      German abstract: “A quantitative theory of &#946;-decay is proposed, in
      which one assumes the existence of the neutrino, and treated the
      emission of electrons and neutrinos from a core in &#946;-decay with a
      similar method as in the emission of a photon from an excited atom
      of radiation theory. Formulas for the service life and for the
      shape of the emitted &#946;-continuous radiation spectrum can be
      derived and compared with observations.” Epilogue: Salam, Glashow,
      and Weinberg published electroweak theory (1960s); eventually
      confirmed experimentally (1980s) “Versuch einer Theorie der
      &#946;-Strahlen. I“ Enrico Fermi Zeitschrift für Physik 88 pp. 161-177
      (1934) In 1938, he received Nobel prize in physics for work on
      induced radioactivity &amp; discovery of transuranic elements
      Comment: in Fermi’s theory, the neutron conceptually became an
      elementary particle (instead of an electron tightly-bound to a
      proton located inside a nucleus proper). The idea of an inverse
      beta decay electron capture e + p &#61664; n + &#957; process occurring
      outside of a nucleus in Nature was first discussed by Fred Hoyle
      (MNRAS 106 pp. 343 - 383, 1946) in connection with theoretical
      work on collapsing stars. Fast forward to 1990s: several LENR
      researchers (e.g., Mizuno) speculated that e + p neutron
      production could be occurring in electrolytic chemical cells. In a
      2005 arXiv preprint, Widom &amp; Larsen published LENR theory that
      integrated many-body collective effects with modern electroweak
      theory under umbrella of the Standard Model<br>
      <br>
      39. 1935 to 1980s: most experimental work on LENR transmutations
      stops ? What happened during this time? Why did electric arc
      transmutation research just stop? Was it problems with
      reproducibility? Comment: it is very puzzling why this seemingly
      fruitful line of inquiry involving electric-arc- driven
      transmutations seems to have more-or-less died-out worldwide by
      the time Chadwick experimentally verified the Rutherford neutron’s
      existence in 1932. After that date, only a handful of researchers
      such as Fritz Paneth continued the work. Oddly, it also does not
      appear that anyone else ever tried to exactly duplicate Nagaoka’s
      astounding experiments. However, at around that time there were
      very well-publicized failures to replicate Miethe &amp;
      Stammreich’s Gold experiments that were extensively chronicled in
      Scientific American. Interestingly, Miethe’s experimental
      apparatus consisted of Mercury arc lamps with Tungsten electrodes
      inside well-evacuated quartz tubes; no transformer oil was present
      in those electric arc experiments. In hindsight, perhaps Nagaoka’s
      decision to use oil was exceedingly fortuitous: by arcing in
      transformer oil, he inadvertently guaranteed that his experimental
      apparatus contained huge quantities of hydrogen (protons) for
      making neutrons via LENRs.<br>
      <br>
      40. 1989: Pons &amp; Fleischmann claim “cold fusion” occurs in
      chemical cells D+D fusion theory was wrong; excess heat results
      were irreproducible back then Tragic outcome was very similar to
      Wendt &amp; Irion’s controversy with Rutherford back in 1922 - 23
      Comment: unfortunately for Pons &amp; Fleischmann, their claimed
      excess heat production effects were very poorly reproducible in
      1989-1990 because they were completely wrong about their D+D
      fusion hypothesis and had no knowledge whatsoever of what are now
      called the fields of nanotechnology and plasmonics. Indeed,
      certain recent technical knowledge derived from nanotechnology,
      plasmonics, and advanced materials science that is crucial to
      being able to fabricate reproducible, well-performing LENR devices
      did not even exist in 1989, or even in the mid- to late 1990s. In
      our opinion, there is no way condensed matter LENRs could have
      been truly experimentally reproducible prior to the past several
      years. Commercialization of technology should now be feasible with
      the help of new Widom-Larsen theory and nanotech.

      41. Skepticism is reminiscent of Rutherford’s dismissal of nuclear
      power in 1930s “Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose.” Epigram
      by Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr in the January 1849 issue of his
      journal “Les Guêpes” (The Wasps) “The idea of producing useful
      energy from room temperature nuclear reactions is an aberration.”
      Prof. John Huizenga, well-respected chemist and physicist,
      referring to “cold fusion” in his 1993 book, “Cold fusion --- The
      scientific fiasco of the century” Oxford University Press (2007)
      Wiley – Interscience (2007) Historical perspective: over 100 years
      of data 1990s: Huizenga personally believed that LENRs were very
      dubious.<a

      43. Region of neutron-catalyzed transmutation pathways discussed
      herein LENR transmutation processes typically proceed from left to
      right along rows in the Periodic Table of elements
      Neutron-catalyzed LENR networks Map of all presently known stable
      and unstable isotopes of elements In this presentation, we will be
      discussing a theoretical LENR neutron-catalyzed nucleosynthetic
      network (yellow arrow) that can begin in the region of Tungsten
      (W) targets and, depending on the size and duration of neutron
      fluxes per Widom-Larsen theory, can potentially extend to heavier,
      higher-Z elements as far as Lead (Pb) and Bismuth (83Bi209) March
      7, 2013 &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      44. Starting with Tungsten targets can reach Lead (Pb) and Bismuth
      (83Bi209) Neutron-catalyzed LENR networks Periodic table of
      elements: LENR transmutation processes traverse rows LENR
      transmutation network pathway<br>
      <br>
      45. Neutron-catalyzed LENR networks Example: network makes
      Platinum, Gold, Mercury, Lead, and Bismuth. We will now examine a
      hypothetical LENR transmutation network that can begin with
      neutron captures on Tungsten (W) as well as other intermediate
      targets. Explanatory legend for network diagrams appears on the
      next slide 74W180-seed network includes Mercury (Hg); if
      sufficiently high neutron fluxes are maintained for enough time,
      can even reach Bismuth (Bi) under optimal conditions. While
      unstable intermediate network products undergo nuclear decays,
      their half- lives are generally short (especially those that are
      more neutron-rich); this network does not produce significant
      amounts of dangerous long-lived radioactive isotopes. According to
      the WLT, in condensed matter systems LENRs occur in many tiny nm-
      to micron-scale surface sites or patches that only exist for
      several hundred nanoseconds before they ‘die’; such sites can form
      and re-form spontaneously. Need input energy to make ultra cold
      neutrons that catalyze LENR transmutations. Herein, we will
      discuss new Hg isotopic data of Mead et al. indicating that
      portions of this nucleosynthetic network may be occurring inside
      compact fluorescent lights<br>
      <br>
      46. Example: network makes Platinum, Gold, Mercury, Lead, and
      Bismuth Neutron capture and nuclear decay processes: ULM neutron
      captures proceed from left to right except for upper-left corner;
      Q-value of capture reaction (MeV) in green either above or below
      horizontal arrow. Beta- (&#946;-) decays proceed from top to bottom;
      denoted with bright blue vertical arrow pointing down with Q-value
      (MeV) in blue either to left or right; beta+ (&#946;+) decays are
      denoted with yellow arrow pointing upward to row above Alpha
      decays, indicated with orange arrows, proceed mostly from right to
      left at an angle with Q-value (MeV) shown in orange located on
      either side of the process arrow. Electron captures (e.c.)
      indicated by purple vertical arrow; Q-value (MeV) to left or
      right. Note: to reduce visual clutter in the network diagram,
      gamma emissions (converted to infrared photons by heavy e-*
      electrons) are not shown; similarly, except where specifically
      listed because a given branch cross-section is significant,
      beta-delayed decays also generally not shown; BR means “branching
      ratio” if &gt;1 decay alternative Color coded half-lives: When
      known, half-lives shown as “HL = xx”. Stable and quasi-stable
      isotopes (i.e., those with half-lives &gt; or equal to 107 years)
      indicated by green boxes; isotopes with half-lives &lt; 107 but
      &gt; than or equal to 103 years indicated by light blue; those
      with half-lives &lt; than 103 years but &gt; or equal to 1 day are
      denoted by purplish boxes; half-lives of &lt; 1 day in yellow;
      with regard to half-life, notation “? nm” means isotope has been
      verified by HL has not been measured Measured natural terrestrial
      abundances for stable isotopes: Indicated with % symbol; note that
      83Bi209 = 100% (essentially ~stable with half-life = 1.9 x 1019
      yrs); 82Pb-205 ~stable with HL= 1.5 x107 yrs Legend:<br>
      <br>
      47.&nbsp; Please note: once created, the process of capturing an
      LENR ULM neutron on a nearby atom occurs very quickly; on the
      order of picoseconds, i.e., 0.000000000001 sec., i.e., 10-12 sec,
      which is much faster than any of the various nuclear decays found
      in this particular LENR network. Moreover, in case of condensed
      matter LENRs, while their neutron production rates are probably
      significantly lower than the r-process, LENR neutron capture
      cross-sections are vastly higher than those in stellar
      environments; on balance it’s essentially ‘a wash’, so LENRs can
      effectively mimic the r-process. Thus, isotopes in LENRs can
      potentially capture additional neutrons (i.e., become more
      neutron-rich isotopes of the same element) before beta decay
      transmutes them into other higher-Z elements found in the Periodic
      Table. This is why the ‘hot’ astrophysical r-process can make
      heavier elements than the s-process (i.e., go beyond Bismuth):
      with much higher produced neutron fluxes, the r-process can
      successfully traverse and bridge key regions of very short-lived
      isotopes that are found in ultra-neutron-rich, high-Z reaches of
      vast nuclear isotopic landscape Network may potentially continue
      upward to even higher values of A; This depends on ULM neutron

      Start with stable Tungsten targets of pure W metal Alternatively,
      one could start with 73Ta181 target Tungsten It should also be
      noted that all of the many atoms located within a 3-D region of
      space that encompasses a given ULM neutron’s spatially extended
      DeBroglie wave function (whose dimensions can range from 2 nm to
      100 microns) will compete with each other to capture such
      neutrons. ULM neutron capture is thus a decidedly many-body
      scattering process, not few- body scattering such as that which
      characterizes capture of neutrons at thermal energies in condensed
      matter in which the DeBroglie wave function of a thermal neutron
      is on the order of ~ 2 Angstroms. This explains why vast majority
      of produced neutrons are captured locally and are only rarely
      detected at any energies during course of LENR experiments; it
      also clearly explains why human-lethal MeV-energy neutron fluxes
      are characteristically not produced in condensed matter LENR
      systems.<br>

      Electric current-driven LENR ULM neutron production and capture
      processes can occur at much faster rates than decay rates of
      beta-/e.c.-unstable isotopes in this network. Thus, if local ULM
      neutron production rates in given LENR patch are high enough,
      large differences in rates of beta decay vs. neutron capture
      processes means that largish populations of unstable, very
      neutron-rich isotopes can accumulate locally during 300 nanosec
      lifetime of an LENR-active patch, prior to its being destroyed.<br>

      capture on a given beta-unstable isotope is often larger than the
      Q-value for the alternative &#946;- decay pathway, so in addition to
      being a faster process than beta decay it can also be
      energetically more favorable. This can also contribute to creating
      fleeting yet substantial local populations of short-lived,
      neutron-rich isotopes. There is indirect experimental evidence
      that such neutron-rich isotopes can be produced in complex ULM

      Fluorescent lamp tube: “Is filled with a gas containing low
      pressure mercury vapor and argon, xenon, neon, or krypton. The
      pressure inside the lamp is around 0.3% of atmospheric pressure.
      The inner surface of the lamp is coated with a fluorescent (and
      often slightly phosphorescent) coating made of varying blends of
      metallic and rare-earth phosphor salts. The lamp's electrodes are
      typically made of coiled tungsten and usually referred to as
      cathodes because of their prime function of emitting electrons.
      For this, they are coated with a mixture of barium, strontium and
      calcium oxides chosen to have a low thermionic emission
      temperature.” “Fluorescent lamp tubes are typically straight and
      range in length from about 100 millimeters (3.9 in) for miniature
      lamps, to 2.43 meters (8.0 ft) for high-output lamps. Some lamps
      have the tube bent into a circle, used for table lamps or other
      places where a more compact light source is desired. Larger
      U-shaped lamps are used to provide the same amount of light in a
      more compact area, and are used for special architectural
      purposes.” “Light-emitting phosphors are applied as a paint-like
      coating to the inside of the tube. The organic solvents are
      allowed to evaporate, and then the tube is heated to nearly the
      melting point of glass to drive off remaining organic compounds
      and fuse the coating to the lamp tube. Careful control of the
      grain size of the suspended phosphors is necessary; large grains,
      35 micrometers or larger, lead to weak grainy coatings, whereas
      too many small particles 1 or 2 micrometers or smaller leads to
      poor light maintenance and efficiency. Most phosphors perform best
      with a particle size around 10 micrometers. The coating must be
      thick enough to capture all the ultraviolet light produced by the
      mercury arc, but not so thick that the phosphor coating absorbs
      too much visible light. The first phosphors were synthetic
      versions of naturally occurring fluorescent minerals, with small
      amounts of metals added as activators. Later other compounds were
      discovered, allowing differing colors of lamps to be made.”
      Compact fluorescent lights (CFLs): “Have several small-diameter
      tubes joined in a bundle of two, four, or six, or a small diameter
      tube coiled into a spiral, to provide a high amount of light
      output in little volume.”<br>

      61. LENRs can mimic chemical fractionation W-L posit chemical and
      nuclear processes coexist in many systems LENRs versus chemical
      fractionation explanations for anomalous isotopic shifts Before
      proceeding further, let it be crystal clear to readers exactly
      what we are and are not saying here: We are not asserting that the
      existing chemical fractionation paradigm fails to adequately
      explain most reported isotope anomalies with respect to
      statistically significant deviations from natural abundances ---
      indeed, it may well effectively and accurately explain the vast
      majority of them. We are saying that presently published
      literature does contain a significant subset comprising many cases
      such as Mead et al. (2013) in which a chemical fractionation
      paradigm must be pushed very, very hard (which includes use of
      various ad hoc constructs) to explain certain otherwise
      inexplicable isotope anomalies; paradigm is being overly stretched
      to be able to comfortably accommodate anomalous data. We are
      suggesting that when confronted with otherwise totally
      inexplicable isotopic or elemental data, it may be fruitful for
      researchers to reexamine such data through the conceptual lens of
      the LENR paradigm to see if invoking nuclear transmutation leads
      to a deeper, better understanding of otherwise perplexing results.
      In some instances, LENRs may illuminate; in others not --- but we
      should examine anyway.<br>
      <br>
      62. Chemical fractionation paradigm assumes that no nuclear
      processes are present. For ~ 60 years, a body of theory has been
      developed and articulated to explain progressively increasing
      numbers of stable isotope anomalies observed in a vast array of
      mass spectroscopic data obtained from many different types of
      natural and experimental, abiological and biological, systems.
      Central ideas in chemical “fractionation” theory embody
      equilibrium and irreversible, mass-dependent and mass-independent,
      chemical processes that are claimed to separate isotopes, thus
      explaining the reported anomalies. Although not explicitly
      acknowledged by fractionation theorists, an intrinsic fundamental
      assumption underlying all of this theory and interpretation of
      data is that no nucleosynthetic processes are occurring anywhere
      in any of these systems, at any time, that are capable of altering
      isotope ratios and/or producing new mixtures of different elements
      over time; ergo, chemistry explains everything. However, if
      Widom-Larsen theory is correct, for some of this data the above
      fundamental assumption may be wrong.<br>
      <br>
      63. Modern isotopic analysis using mass spectroscopy began back in
      the 1920s. Modern isotopic chemical analysis using mass
      spectrometry initially began in the early 1920s as scientists
      started designing and building progressively better, more
      sensitive types of instruments; the scientific community gradually
      began to systematically measure and publish abundances of stable
      and unstable isotopes found on earth as well as in meteoritic
      materials that reached the earth’s surface from outer space, i.e.,
      most likely from elsewhere in the solar system. Extensive
      compilations of varied isotopic data eventually lead to the idea
      of the “natural abundances”: natural abundance (NA) refers to the
      isotopic composition of a given chemical element as it is
      naturally found on a particular planet, e.g., earth. For a given
      element composed of one or more isotopes, a weighted average of
      the naturally occurring composition of these isotopes (natural
      abundance) is the specific value for atomic weight that is listed
      for that element in the periodic table. Note that although the
      ‘natural’ isotopic composition of a given chemical element can
      vary from planet to planet, in theory it should remain essentially
      constant over geological time (except in the case of elements
      having one or more radioactive isotopes). On a given planet, the
      characteristic isotopic composition of a given element, i.e., its
      natural abundance, should be essentially identical everywhere. For
      example, in the case of the element Copper on earth, it is
      comprised of two stable isotopes that typically occur in ~
      following proportions: 69% Cu-63 and 31% Cu-65. With many
      terrestrial elements, one out of several stable isotopes
      frequently predominates; others may be present only in minor
      traces, e.g., in the case of natural Oxygen one would in principle
      measure ~ 99.759% O-16; 0.0374% O-17; and 0.2039% O-18.<br>
      <br>
      64. By 1947 chemical fractionation theorists assumed absence of
      nuclear processes. Statistically significant deviations from
      natural abundances began to appear in some early isotopic data
      collected by scientists; such anomalies were observed in many
      different types of experimental chemical reaction systems and in
      the natural environment, as well as in meteoritic materials. Given
      that the observed isotopic anomalies in question obviously did not
      involve material freshly processed in stars, fission reactors, or
      nuclear explosions, it was readily assumed that significant
      deviations from natural isotopic abundances had to be the result
      of chemical processes. In the 1940-50s, early theories of
      “chemical fractionation” were published in an effort to explain
      significant anomalies from natural abundances found in some
      experimental data. These early theories mainly involved
      equilibrium isotope effects in reversible chemical systems and
      kinetic effects of isotopes on reaction rates in irreversible
      chemical systems (details will explained shortly in subsequent
      slides) One example of a classic paper on abundances is: White, J.
      R. and Cameron, A. E., “The Natural Abundance of Isotopes of
      Stable Elements,” Physical Review 74 pp. 991-1000 (1948) Two
      widely cited early papers on chemical isotopic fractionation are
      as follows: Bigeleisen, J. and Mayer, M. J., “Calculation of
      equilibrium constant for isotope exchange reaction,” Chem. Phys.
      15 pp. 261-267 (1947) Urey, H.C., “The thermodynamic properties of
      isotopic substances,” J. Chem. Soc. pp. 562-581 (1947)<br>
      <br>
      65. Mass-independent fractionation ‘explains’ isotope shifts seen
      in heavier elements. Since the 1950s, development of an increasing
      variety of progressively improved, much less expensive, and
      substantially more accurate mass spectroscopy techniques has
      enabled M-S to be utilized in many different fields. A vast
      quantity of reliable isotopic data has thus accumulated &#61692;Since
      early theories of chemical isotopic fractionation were directly
      tied to mass differences between isotopes, their applicability was
      generally limited to lighter elements in the Periodic Table (from
      Hydrogen out through roughly Sulfur) where % differences in
      relative masses are large enough to have a plausibly significant
      impact on isotopic separation via some form of mass-sensitive
      physico-kinetic process. Today’s fractionation theories include
      equilibrium and kinetic effects and mass-independent: nuclear
      field shift, photochemical, and Q-M symmetry effects that attempt
      to extend such concepts to accommodate much higher-mass
      elements-isotopes in the Periodic Table --- even Uranium The first
      reliable report of an of an isotopic anomaly that could not
      plausibly be explained by simple physical processes such as
      condensation or evaporation --- phase changes --- (i.e., it was
      mass- independent ) was published by Clayton, R., Grossman, L.,
      and Mayeda, T., “A component of primitive nuclear composition in
      carbonaceous meteorites,” Science 182 pp. 485 - 488 (1973)
      Mass-independent fractionation now utilized to explain a growing
      body of anomalous, perhaps otherwise chemically inexplicable
      isotopic data. For Oxygen, see Michalski, G. and Bhattacharya, S.,
      “Role of symmetry in the mass-independent isotope effect in
      ozone,” PNAS 106 pp. S493-S496 (2009)<br>
      <br>
      66. Definition of key term: isotopic fractionation factor = f
      Isotope fractionation: “… is the physical phenomenon which causes
      changes in the relative abundance of isotopes due to their
      differences in mass. There are two categories of isotope effects:
      equilibrium and kinetic.” “An equilibrium isotope effect will
      cause one isotope to concentrate in one component of a reversible
      system that is in equilibrium. If it is the heavier isotope that
      concentrates in the component of interest, then that component is
      commonly referred to as enriched or heavy. If it is the light
      isotope that concentrates then the component is referred to as
      depleted or light. In most circumstances the heavy isotope
      concentrates in the component in which the element is bound more
      strongly and thus equilibrium isotope effects usually reflect
      relative differences in the bond strengths of the isotopes in the
      various components of the system. A kinetic isotope effect occurs
      when one isotope reacts more rapidly than the other in an
      irreversible system or a system in which the products are swept
      away from the reactants before they have an opportunity to come to
      equilibrium. Normally, the lighter isotope will react more rapidly
      than the heavy isotope and thus the product will be lighter than
      the reactant.” “It should be noted that isotope fractionation will
      only occur in systems in which there is both an isotope effect and
      a reaction that does not proceed to completion. Thus, even in the
      presence of an isotope effect, there will be no isotope
      fractionation if all the reactant goes to a single product because
      all the atoms have reacted and thus the ratio of the heavy to
      light isotope must be the same in the product as it was in the
      reactant. The magnitude of an isotope effect is expressed as a
      fractionation factor. This f is defined as the ratio of the heavy
      to light isotope in the product divided by the ratio of the heavy
      to light isotope in the reactant. Stated mathematically:” “When f
      is greater than 1, the product is heavy or enriched. When it is
      less than 1, the product is light or depleted. Most fractionation
      factors lie between 0.9 and 1.1, but deuterium isotope effects can
      result in much smaller or larger fractionation factors. A
      fractionation factor of 1.050 is often referred to as a 5% isotope
      effect.” Source of definitions: D. Schoeller and A. Coward at : <br>
