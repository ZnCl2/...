      <div align="center"><big><b>Researchers create novel water
            purifying filter</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <b>&nbsp;</b><br>
      [CAPE TOWN] A team of researchers have developed a membrane-based
      water filter that can provide up to 300 litres of clean drinking
      water.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The WHO says about 780 million people worldwide, especially those
      in Sub-Saharan Africa, lack access to improved water source.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in
      Zurich (ETHZ) in Switzerland announced last month (22 July) that
      DrinkPure filter, which they have developed, is based on a simple
      screw-top design that fits onto any plastic bottle.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Wendelin Stark, a professor of functional materials engineering at
      ETHZ, who helped create the innovation, says: “It requires no
      manual, no electricity, and no additional tools or training needs.
      You simply screw it on, and you drink [the water].”<br>
      <br>
      “One DrinkPure water filter provides enough drinking water for one
      person for one year, after which the membrane and activated carbon
      can be replaced over and over again.”<br>
      <br>
      Jeremy Nussbaumer, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich
      (ETHZ)<br>
      <br>
      The researchers say they used a novel porous polymer membrane
      developed though&nbsp; nanotechnology, thus making&nbsp; DrinkPure
      allow the filtration of particles as small as 90 nanometres,
      including bacteria and protozoa, at rate of up to one litre
      a&nbsp; minute.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      They add that the innovation which weighs less than 100 grams,
      with a target cost of less than US$20 a filter, has two
      pre-filtration components — a capture filter that separates large
      particles and an activated charcoal layer that removes odour and
      chemical contaminants.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      In order to fund the tools to manufacture the filters, the
      researchers launched a crowdfunding campaign last month (17 July)
      with a goal of raising US$40,000 by this week (26 August), but
      have as of today raised more than US$71,000.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Nussbaumer says they plan to have the first filters completed and
      sent to project supporters for distribution by January 2015 in
      Sub-Saharan Africa.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Nussbaumer adds that Water &amp; pH soluces, a Swiss NGO that
      works to provide sustainable, affordable access to safe water and
      sanitation to communities in Sub-Saharan Africa, plans to
      distribute DrinkPure for testing in five villages in Mali.&nbsp;
      &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Stark tells SciDev.Net: “The aim is to develop partnerships with
      partners and local companies who can develop the membranes
      themselves”.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The researchers say DrinkPure water filter could be used as part
      of relief efforts following natural disasters, such as tsunamis.
      “We would like to see these membranes and filters used …in places
      experiencing environmental issues,” says Christop Kellenberger, a
      member of the DrinkPure research team.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Nonhlanhla Kalebaila, a research manager of drinking water
      treatment and quality at the South Africa-based Water Research
      Commission, says the use of small-scale water purification systems
      in Africa is increasing rapidly. “Water quality and supply in
      Africa as a whole is a very touchy subject and has been the topic
      of strikes and protests in South Africa in the last few years,”
      she says.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      But Kalebaila adds that independent research is needed to ensure
      the accuracy of water filtration devices and the safety of water
      that flows from such tools.<br>

      [0001] This application is a continuation in part of International
      Application No. PCT/EP2012/000142, filed Jan. 13, 2012, and
      published in the English language which claims priority to EP
      11000311.8 filed Jan. 17, 2011.<br>
      <br>
      TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The invention relates to manufacturing processes for porous
      polymer membranes; to intermediates suitable to obtain such
      membranes; to polymer membranes as defined herein; to shaped
      articles containing such membranes; to the use of such membranes,
      shaped articles and intermediates.<br>
      <br>
      BACKGROUND<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Nano-porous polymer membranes and corresponding
      manufacturing methods are already known. Typically, such membranes
      are obtained by a phase separation process, by stretching specific
      polymer foils or by a template based process. The known processes
      show certain disadvantages. While the first process is difficult
      to control, the second process is only applicable to specific
      starting materials. The third process is not yet in industrial
      application.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Johnson et al (Science 1999, vol. 283, p. 963 ff) disclose
      a template-based process; in this process, a pressed and sintered
      silica template is used to obtain a shaped polymeric article with
      pores in the range of 15-35 nm. This process is suited to obtain
      pellets, but not membranes.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Mikos et al (U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,378) disclose a template
      based process to obtain biocompatible membranes. The disclosed
      process requires long production times, making it unsuitable for
      industrial applications and/or continuous processes. Further, the
      pore size of the membranes obtained by this process may be varied
      only in a limited range, between 450 nm and 930 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Eisen et al (WO 2009/024973) disclose a number of phase
      separation processes for manufacturing specific polysulfone
      membranes. In one embodiment, a multi-step process is disclosed in
      which-in a first step-in a solution containing solvent and
      polysulfone, a low amount of Fe2O3 nanoparticles is introduced
      into the polymer matrix by the use of a magnetic field. Phase
      separation is then induced by immersion precipitation to create a
      porous membrane. In a last step Fe2O3- nanoparticles are removed
      out of the porous structure to increase flux and pore
      accessibility of the membrane. This process requires specific
      equipment and is applicable to specific combinations of starting
      materials only.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Consequently, there is a need for providing
      additional/improved manufacturing processes for nano-porous
      polymer membranes; there is also a need for new polymer membranes
      having beneficial properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0008] Thus, it is an object of the present invention to mitigate
      at least some of these drawbacks of the prior art. In particular,
      it is an aim of the present invention to provide improved
      manufacturing processes for porous polymer membranes. It is a
      further aim to provide nano-porous polymer membranes which are
      suitable for advanced applications, such as in breathable textile
      materials and filters.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The present invention will be described in more detail
      below. It is understood that the various embodiments, preferences
      and ranges as provided/disclosed in this specification may be
      combined at will. Further, depending of the specific embodiment,
      selected definitions, embodiments or ranges may not apply. It is
      further understood that all references identified herein are
      incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The above objectives are achieved by providing a
      manufacturing process as defined in claim 1. Further aspects of
      the invention are disclosed in the specification and independent
      claims, preferred embodiments are disclosed in the specification
      and the dependent claims. The manufacturing process for
      nano-porous polymer membranes, as described herein, proves to be
      very versatile, reliable, simple to control. The process is
      particularly suitable for fast and low-cost production of large
      area membranes. Polymer membranes as described herein prove to be
      useful in applications as defined below and further enable the
      manufacture of improved articles and/or facilitate manufacture of
      articles as defined below.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] As it will become apparent when reading this specification,
      the invention relates in a first aspect to a method for
      manufacturing polymer membranes; in a second aspect to
      intermediates suitable for manufacturing such polymer membranes;
      in a third aspect to novel polymer membranes; in a forth aspect to
      shaped articles comprising (i.e. containing or consisting of) such
      polymer membranes; and in a fifth aspect to uses of such
      membranes, shaped articles and intermediates.<br>
      <br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0013] Unless otherwise stated, the following definitions shall
      apply in this specification:<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The term "nanoparticle" is known in the field and includes
      crystalline, semicrystalline or amorphous materials. Nanoparticles
      are particles having a diameter in the submicron size range.
      Primary particle sizes are preferably between 5-400 nm. Suitable
      methods for the determination of primary particle size can be
      found by Limbach et al. (Environmental Science &amp; Technology,
      2005. 39(23): p. 9370-9376). Nanoparticles may be obtained from a
      range of preparation methods, including high temperature-gas phase
      processes (such as flame synthesis, laser processes and plasma
      processes), and liquid phase chemical methods (such as
      precipitation and sol-gel processes). Nanoparticles particularly
      suitable in the context of the present invention may be obtained
      by a flame spray synthesis (FSP) process.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The term "salt" is known in the field. A salt is defined as
      the product formed from the neutralisation reaction of acids and
      bases. Salts are ionic compounds composed of cations and anions so
      that the product is electrically neutral. Examples of salt classes
      are halogenides (chlorides, fluorides, bromides, iodides),
      sulfates, phosphates, carbonates, nitrates, particularly
      phosphates, carbonates and halogenides. In inorganic salts, the
      cation is a metal ion and the anion is a non-metal ion; specific
      examples of inorganic salts include calcium phosphate, calcium
      carbonate, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride. In the context of
      the present invention, metal oxides are not considered salts.
      Further, salts are preferably manufactured by a dry process, such
      as FSP.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The term "polymer" is known in the field. The term refers
      to a material of repeating structural units ("monomers"),
      particularly to synthetic polymers (comprising synthetic
      monomers). The term thus includes homo-polymers, co-polymers and
      blends thereof. The term further includes oligomers. Polymers may
      be cross-linked. Typically, amorphous polymers are soluble, while
      crystalline polymers are not.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The "specific surface area" of a material as described
      herein is the total airpolymer interface area per amount of
      polymer mass. This may be determined by nitrogen adsorption using
      the BET method (according to: Janssen et al, Journal of Applied
      Polymer Science 52, 1913, 1994). The BET method is widely used in
      surface science for the calculation of surface areas of solids by
      physical adsorption of gas molecules (e.g. Nitrogen molecules).
      The basic principle of the measurement is that a material with a
      high surface area can adsorb more molecular nitrogen on its
      surface (assuming a molecular monolayer).<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The "porosity" of a material as described herein is the
      volumetric percentage of pores of the total material. Porosity can
      be determined by porosimetry, by measuring the apparent material
      density, BET analysis or by microscope images.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The "permeability" of a material as described herein is
      defined as the flux of a fluid (i.e. a liquid medium or a gaseous
      medium) through interconnected pores of the material. Permeability
      can be determined by measuring the liquid or gas volume which
      passes a defined membrane area in a defined time at an applied
      pressure. A typical measure of this flux is millilitre per square
      centimetre, per bar and minute ([ml/(cm&lt;2&gt;*bar*min)]).<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In general terms, the present invention relates in a first
      aspect to a method of manufacturing a porous polymer membrane (1)
      comprising the steps of (a) providing a dispersion (5) containing
      (i) one or more diluents, (ii) one or more polymers dissolved
      therein, (iii) one or more metal salt nanoparticles dispersed
      therein; (iv) optionally one or more additives dissolved therein;
      (b) coating a substrate (6) with said dispersion; (c) optionally
      subjecting the obtained material (4) to a drying step; (d)
      optionally subjecting the thus obtained material to a
      polymerisation or cross-linking step; (e) removing said one or
      more metal salt particles by a dissolution step; (f) optionally
      removing the obtained polymer membrane from said supporting
      material (6). This process is illustrated in FIG. 1, left hand
      side.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] It is believed that the dissolution step (e) is a key
      element of the manufacturing process and also a key element to
      obtain the inventive polymer membranes. While the prior art uses
      as a starting material a combination of a polymer, a solvent and a
      non-solvent, the present invention uses as a starting material
      polymer(s), a solvent(s) and metal salt nanoparticles and
      selectively removes the metal salt to obtain the porous polymer
      membrane. This is considered advantageous, as chemical properties
      of metal salts and polymer significantly differ enabling a wide
      choice of combinations and process steps.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The manufacturing processes as described herein are
      considered advantageous, as the individual steps a) to f) are
      known in industry and already in commercial use. Further, the
      process described is very fast and may be implemented in a
      continuous process.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] It was surprisingly found, that the use of nanoparticulate
      metal salts provides an improved process which, on the one hand,
      provides suitable pores in the membrane and on the other hand,
      provides an improved manufacturing rate. This is unexpected, as
      the skilled person (i) would not expect the dissolution of
      nanoparticulate material from a polymer film because nanoparticles
      are expected to be individually coated by polymer and thus
      protected from dissolution.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] This aspect of the invention shall be explained in further
      detail below, whereby the process steps are described first and
      suitable materials are described afterwards:<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Step a: A dispersion (5) containing a mixture of metal
      salt(s) nanoparticles, diluent(s), polymer(s) and optionally
      additives is provided first. Typically, the amount of diluent is
      at least 50 wt. %, preferably at least 80 wt. %, most preferably
      at least 90 wt. % of the dispersion. Such comparatively high
      amount of solvent ensures low viscosity and thereby thin film
      formation during the coating step. Typically, the ratio of
      polymer:nanoparticles (wt. %) is in the range of 2:1 to 0.2:1,
      preferably 1.25:1 to 0.25:1, most preferably 1.1:1 to 0.7:1. Such
      comparatively high amount of nanoparticles ensures proper pore
      formation within the manufactured membranes. Without being bound
      to theory, it is believed that a lower amount will not provide
      interconnecting necks, while a higher amount will cause the
      coating to collapse.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] It was surprisingly found that the inventive process
      provides very good results without the addition of additives
      (particularly without the addition of surfactants) to the
      dispersion (5). Thus, in an advantageous embodiment, no additives
      (particularly no surfactants) are added to dispersion 5. In one
      embodiment, dispersion (5) consists of metal salt(s)
      nanoparticles, diluent(s) and polymer(s).<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Step b: The dispersion of step a) is applied to a
      substrate, e.g. by using conventional printing or coating methods.
      This results in a metal salt/polymer nanocomposite film (4) on
      said substrate (6). Suitable methods are known in the field and
      include spraying, roll-to-roll processes, dip-coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Step c: Afterwards, e.g. for faster solvent evaporation,
      the nanocomposite films may be subjected to a heat treatment (e.g.
      drying) to obtain a polymer film containing nanoparticles. The
      temperatures and treatment times may vary, depending on the
      starting materials (particularly the diluent) and are typically
      below 200[deg.] C. and preferably below the melting point of the
      polymer.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Step d: The coated material of step b) may be subjected to
      a polymerisation and/or cross-linking step. This step is optional
      and may be applied when appropriate starting materials are used.
      Particularly in case the polymer comprises oligomers and/or
      monomers that may be polymerised, optionally in the presences of
      an initiator (polymerisation); or in case the polymer comprises
      groups that may be crosslinked, optionally in the presence of a
      cross-linking agent (cross-linking step). Step d) and step c) may
      take place simultaneously or in subsequent steps.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Step e: The continuous salt phase in such nanocomposite
      membranes is dissolved which results in a nano-porous polymer film
      (the porous polymer membrane) on a substrate. Suitable are
      particularly aqueous solvents, such as water or acidic aqueous
      solutions. The choice of solvent particularly depends on the type
      of metal salt used. The solvent in step e) is selected to ensure
      dissolution of the metal salt nanoparticles without dissolving the
      polymer.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Step f: The substrate may be easily removed from the porous
      material, e.g. by pealing off (to obtain (1)) or by transfer to
      another substrate (to obtain (1)). This removal step may take
      place after to the washing step (e) (as outlined above) or prior
      to the washing step (e) (as outlined below). Step (f) may be
      performed using processes known per se. The removal step f), aims
      to remove substrate (6) to obtain an unsupported porous material
      (1) or to transfer the porous material to another supporting
      material to obtain a coated article.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In an alternative embodiment the invention provides a
      method as described herein, wherein said step (f) is performed
      prior to step (e), as illustrated in FIG. 1, right hand side.
      Consequently, the invention also relates to a method of
      manufacturing a polymer membrane (1) comprising the steps of (a)
      providing a dispersion (5) as described herein; (b) coating a
      substrate (6) with said dispersion; (c) optionally subjecting the
      obtained material (4) to a drying step; (d) optionally subjecting
      the thus obtained material to a polymerisation or cross-linking
      step; (f) removing the obtained material (4) from said supporting
      material (6) (e) removing said one or more metal salt particles by
      a dissolution step thereby obtaining the polymer membrane (1).<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Suitable solvents may be selected from a broad range of
      known solvents and combinations thereof. Examples include organic
      solvents selected from the group consisting of alcohols, ethers,
      ketones, esters, halogenalkanes, alkanes, cycloalkanes,
      sulfoxides, amides, pyrrolidones, and lactams.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Suitable polymers may be selected from a broad range of
      known polymers and combinations thereof. In an advantageous
      embodiment, the polymers are selected from the group of amorphous
      polymers and semicrystalline polymers. Suitable polymers thus
      include polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polycarbonates,
      polystyrenes, polyacrylates, polysiloxanes, polyarylates,
      polyurethanes, halogenated polyolefins, such as polyvinylidene
      fluoride (PVDF), polyethylenes, polyimides, polyamides, liquid
      crystal polymers, cellulose acetates and polyether ketones, such
      as polyetherether ketone (PEEK). The invention also includes the
      use of co-polymers and mixtures of polymers ("blends"). The
      invention further includes chemically modified polymers thereof,
      such as polymers, co-polymers or blends modified by sulfonation,
      amination and hydroxylation.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Suitable metal salt nanoparticles may be selected from a
      broad range of known metal salts and combinations thereof.
      Preferably, the metal salt particles are selected from the group
      consisting of carbonates (including hydrogencarbonates),
      sulphates, halogenides, nitrates and phosphates, preferably
      carbonates. Examples include CaCO3, BaCO3, SrCO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3,
      NaCl. In one embodiment, the metal salt particles have a particle
      size in the range of 1-4000 nm, or in the range of greater than
      400 to 4000 nm. Preferably, the metal salt particles have a
      particle size of 5-400 nm, preferably 15-200 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Preferably, the metal salt particles are made by a dry
      process, particularly by an FSP process.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Preferably, the metal salts are prepared prior to step a)
      in a separate process. The invention thus also relates to a method
      as described herein, wherein the nanoparticles are not prepared in
      situ.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Preferably, the metal salt particles are selected from the
      group consisting of Carbonates (including Hydrogencarbonates) and
      the process is a continuous process (as described below). It was
      surprisingly found that a continuous manufacturing process of
      porous membranes may be realized when using such Carbonates as the
      starting material. This may be attributed to the particularly fast
      dissolution and complete removal of carbonates in aqueous (or
      acidic) solutions<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Suitable additives may be selected from a broad range of
      known additives and mixtures thereof and are known in the field.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Suitable substrates may be selected from a broad range of
      known substrates. The substrate may be any support compatible with
      the manufacturing process; particularly, it needs to be inert
      towards the solvents used. It is further beneficial, if the
      coating adheres to the substrate during manufacturing and can be
      removed after manufacturing. Suitable materials for a substrate
      include polymer materials (preferably semi-crystalline or
      crystalline), glasses, metals and ceramics (in each case coated or
      uncoated).<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Suitable dispersions may be prepared from the above
      starting materials using known techniques. Preferred dispersions
      contain from 50 to 99 wt.-% diluents and/or from 1 to 20 wt.-%
      polymers and/or from 0.5 to 40 wt.-% metal salt particles and/or
      from 0 to 5 wt.-% additives as defined herein. It was found
      suitable to combine the starting materials by vigorously stirring
      the components and/or subjecting the components to ultrasonic
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In a further embodiment, inventive method provides a
      process for manufacturing polymer membranes without using a phase
      separation process/phase separation step. Such phase separation is
      limited to specific polymers and the corresponding pore formation
      is highly sensitive to various process parameters (e.g.
      temperature, humidity, time) which need to be carefully controlled
      simultaneously. It is apparent that such process is
      disadvantageous for fast and large-scale commercial manufacturing.
      Thus, the invention also provides a method as described herein,
      which does not involve a phase separation step. In the context of
      this invention, a phase separation step is considered a separate
      step in a manufacturing process that requires specific equipment.
      It is also noted that phase inversion is only observed for a
      limited number of polymers/combination of polymers. The present
      invention is not limited to such specific polymers or combinations
      thereof and thus considered much more versatile.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In a further embodiment, inventive method provides a
      process for manufacturing polymer membranes without using a
      stretching process/stretching step. Such stretching is limited to
      specific polymers and typically applied to a foil to obtain a
      membrane. Such additional step is difficult to control and thus
      disadvantageous for commercial manufacturing. Thus, the invention
      also provides a method as described herein, which does not involve
      a stretching step.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In a further embodiment, the invention provides a method of
      manufacturing a polymer membrane (1) as described herein
      comprising the step of subjecting a shaped article (containing
      substrate (6) and coating) to a dissolution step (e) and
      optionally removing from the thus obtained shaped article said
      support (step f). The dissolution step (e), as outlined above,
      aims to remove all or essentially all salt material from said
      article. The removal step (f), as outlined above, aims to remove
      substrate (6) to obtain an unsupported porous material (1) or to
      transfer the porous material to another supporting material to
      obtain a coated article.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In a further embodiment, the invention provides a method of
      manufacturing a polymer membrane (1) as described herein,
      consisting of the steps (a) providing a dispersion (5) as
      described herein; (b) coating a substrate (6) with said
      dispersion; (c) subjecting the obtained material (4) to a drying
      step (to remove the diluent); (e) subjecting the obtained material
      to a dissolution step (to remove the one or more metal salt
      particles); (f) removing the obtained polymer membrane from said
      supporting material (6) (to obtain the porous polymer membrane
      (1)).<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In a further embodiment, the invention provides a process
      as described herein, wherein one or more, preferably all steps a)
      to f) are adapted to a continuous process, such as a
      Roll-To-Roll-process (R2R process).<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In a further embodiment the process step e), may be
      repeated. This measure ensures a complete removal of metal salt
      nanoparticles. Thus, step e) also includes multiple washings and
      dryings. When using a multi-step protocol, either the same or
      different solvents may be used, for example a diluted aqueous acid
      first, followed by water.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The manufacturing process described provides porous
      materials in virtually unlimited size. As the manufacturing steps
      a) to e) do not provide a limitation regarding the size of the
      material (except for the equipment used) large sheet materials, in
      terms of length and width, are obtainable. Thus, the invention
      also provides a process as disclosed herein, wherein the polymer
      membrane has an area of more than 100 cm&lt;2&gt;, preferably more
      than 400 cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] By suitable selection of metal salt particles (size and
      amount) and by the selection of process parameters (such as
      coating thickness, drying time) porosity and pore size
      distribution may be varied over a broad range. Thus, the invention
      also provides a process as disclosed herein, wherein the polymer
      membrane has a porosity of 10-90%, preferably above 25% such as
      28%. Thus, the invention also provides a process as disclosed
      herein, wherein the polymer membrane has a pore size of 1-4000 nm,
      preferably 1-1000 nm, more preferably 1-400 nm. In one embodiment,
      the invention provides a process as disclosed herein, wherein the
      polymer membrane has a pore size of greater than 400 nm to 4000
      nm. In another embodiment, the invention provides a process as
      disclosed herein, wherein the polymer membrane has a pore size of
      5-400 nm, preferably 15-200 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The present invention relates in a second aspect to
      intermediates or starting materials which are useful in a
      manufacturing process as described herein. This aspect of the
      invention shall be explained in further detail below:<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In one embodiment, the invention relates to a dispersion
      (5) comprising (i.e. containing or consisting of) 40-99 wt %
      diluent; 1-20 wt % polymer; 0.5-40 wt % metal salt nanoparticles;
      and 0-5 wt % of additives. Such dispersions are suitable starting
      materials for the inventive process as described below. The
      individual components of the inventive dispersions are known per
      se, suitable components are identified above, in the context of
      the "first aspect". Particularly suitable components are
      identified below:<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Diluent: Any liquid carrier suitable for dispersing the
      nanoparticles and dissolving the polymer may be used; preferred
      are the diluents identified above. The amount of diluent may vary
      over a broad range, depending on the intended following
      manufacturing step (such as spraying, coating or printing).<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Polymers: Suitable polymers include polymers that are
      soluble in the diluent identified above, such as amorphous
      polymers as described herein, semicrystalline polymers, polymers
      that may be cross-linked, oligomers that may be polymerized.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Metal salt nanoparticles: In a broad sense, any metal salt
      nanoparticles may be used in the inventive dispersion. It was
      found advantageous to use premanufactured nanoparticles, while in
      situ formation of nanoparticles is less preferred. The manufacture
      of suitable nanoparticles is known in the field. It was found that
      nanoparticles made by a dry process, such as an FSP process, are
      particularly suitable.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Additives: Additives may be selected from the group
      consisting of surfactants, polymerisation initiators, stabilizers,
      cross-linking agents, wetting agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In certain embodiments, it was found the dispersion (5) has
      a shelf life of less than one day; particularly, as the
      nanoparticles separate from the diluent. The dispersions are
      nevertheless suitable for the inventive process but may be
      pretreated prior to use (e.g. by sonication). The invention thus
      relates to both, a dispersion as defined herein and a kit of
      parts, wherein a first part comprises (i.e. contains or consists
      of) metal salt nanoparticles as described herein and said second
      part comprises (i.e. contains or consists of) diluent, polymer and
      additives as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In a further embodiment, the invention relates to a
      material (4) comprising a substrate (6) and a coating, wherein
      said coating (i) contains metal salt nanoparticles, polymer(s),
      diluent(s) and optionally additive(s), each as defined herein;
      (ii) said nanoparticles are randomly distributed within said
      coating; (iii) and said coating has a thickness (d) between
      0.05-50 [mu]m. The material (4) may be obtained by
      coating/printing a suspension (5) on a substrate (6), optionally
      followed by removing the above mentioned dispersing medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The present invention relates in a third aspect to novel
      polymer membranes and to shaped articles comprising such polymer
      membranes; this aspect of the invention shall be explained in
      further detail below.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In one embodiment, the invention relates to a polymer
      membrane, said polymer (i) is selected from the group consisting
      of polymers soluble in organic solvents and cross-linked polymers
      thereof; (ii) has pores with a diameter between 5-400 nm; (iii)
      has a thickness of 0.05-50 [mu]m. Due to the unique manufacturing
      process, as outlined herein, the present invention provides
      nanoporous membranes combining specific porosity and thickness for
      organic polymers.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Advantageous polymers and characteristics of the inventive
      membranes are outlined below.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Polymers: As outlined above, a wide variety of polymers may
      be used for the inventive membranes. This is considered
      advantageous, as the presently known polymer membranes are limited
      in view of the materials suitable and/or the characteristics of
      its pores. Suitable polymers may be selected from the group of
      polymers soluble in organic solvents and include polyesters;
      polyethers, such as polyetherether ketone (PEEK); polysulfones
      (PSU); polyethersulfones; polyphenylene sulfone (PPSU);
      polycarbonates (PC); polyacrylates, such as polymethylmethacrylate
      (PMMA); polystyrenes (PS); polysiloxanes, such as polydimethyl
      siloxane (PDMS); polyimides; polyamides; polyethylenes (PE);
      halogenated polyolefins, such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF);
      cellulose acetate (CA) and liquid crystal polymers.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Pores: As outlined above, the inventive material is porous.
      The inventive material is characterized by the size, type and
      amount of pores present. The size and type and amount of pores may
      be influenced by the starting materials, the ratio metal salt
      nanoparticles:polymer, the manufacturing process.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Size: The size of the pores of the inventive membranes
      (defined by the diameter of the salt nanoparticles) is in the
      nanoscale or microscale range, typically between 1-4000 nm,
      preferably 1-1000 nm, more preferably 1-400 nm. In one embodiment,
      the size of the pores of the inventive membrane is greater than
      400 nm to 4000 nm. In another embodiment, the size of the pores of
      the inventive membranes is in the nanoscale range, typically
      between 5-400 nm, preferably 15-200 nm. The size of the pores may
      be determined by microscopy. Further, the pore size distribution
      may be precisely adjusted, due to the starting materials used.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Amount: The porosity, i.e. the volume of pores in relation
      to the volume of the membrane in total, may be varied in a broad
      range. Inventive materials show porosity in the range of 10-90
      vol. %, preferably 20-90 vol. %, much preferred above 25 vol. %,
      such as 28 vol. %. The porosity may be determined by BET.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Type: The pores of the material may be arranged in a way
      that the material is permeable, partly permeable or impermeable.
      If essentially all pores of the material have dead ends, the
      material is impermeable. In the contrary, if essentially all pores
      of the material have open ends, the material is considered
      permeable. Consequently, if a fraction of the pores has dead ends,
      the material is considered partly permeable. In an advantageous
      embodiment, the present invention provides polymer membranes,
      wherein at least 90% of said pores are interconnected.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Thickness: The thickness of the inventive membranes may be
      varied over a broad range. Inventive membranes show a thickness
      between 50 nm-50,000 nm, preferably 300 nm-10,000 nm, such as 1000
      nm. Such membranes may also be termed "sheet material" or "porous
      foils"; these terms indicate that the material has a length and
      width which is at least one magnitude larger (preferably two
      magnitudes larger) than the thickness of the material.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In a further embodiment, the invention relates to a polymer
      membrane as described herein which is impermeable to biologic
      material, including bacteria, viruses, cells, and/or impermeable
      to inorganic material, including nanoparticles. In a further
      embodiment, the invention relates to a polymer membrane as
      described herein which permeable to liquids, (including water),
      gases (including air), and dissolved material (including metal
      ions and proteins). Typically, the cut-off of the inventive
      membranes is in the range of 5-400 nm, such as 20 nm. Typically,
      the flow of the inventive polymer membranes is in the range of
      0.01-100 ml/min/cm&lt;2 &gt;at 1 bar, such as 0.2 ml/min/cm&lt;2
      &gt;at 1 bar.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In a further embodiment, the invention relates to a polymer
      membrane, particularly as described herein, obtainable by a
      process as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In a further embodiment, the invention relates to a polymer
      membrane, particularly as described herein, obtained by a process
      as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The present invention relates in a forth aspect to a shaped
      article comprising a polymer membrane as described herein. A wide
      variety of articles may be equipped with the inventive porous
      material. This aspect of the invention shall be explained in
      further detail below:<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In one embodiment, the invention relates to a shaped
      article as described herein selected from the group consisting of
      (i) filters (preferably wherein said membrane is supported or
      unsupported); (ii) woven or non-woven textiles (wherein said
      membrane is laminated on said textile).<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In a further embodiment, the shaped article comprises a
      support and a coating, preferably a top coating, wherein said
      coating consists of a porous material as defined herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In a further embodiment the invention relates to an article
      obtainable by or obtained by a method as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The present invention relates in a fifth aspect to
      uses/methods of use of the membranes, shaped articles and
      intermediates as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Membranes:</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0075] In one embodiment, the present invention relates to the use
      of a membrane as described herein in a filter device or as part of
      a woven or non-woven textile. The inventive membranes prove to be
      useful in a number of applications, including filter materials and
      textile materials. This aspect of the invention shall be explained
      in further detail below. The inventive membranes are
      self-supporting ("free standing"). Therefore, they distinguish
      from known membranes of similar thickness and porosity on a
      support. However, the inventive material is suitable for coating
      an appropriate support. The possibility of manufacturing such
      membrane independent from a specific support makes it very
      versatile.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The inventive membranes may be used in micro-filtration,
      ultrafiltration and/or nanofiltration, e.g. by using known
      methods. Microfiltration is used to separate particles of 100-1000
      nm, such as bacteria; ultrafiltration is used to separate
      particles of 10-100 nm, such as viruses, proteins and colloids;
      nanofiltration is used to separate particles of 1-10 nm, such as
      salts, pesticides, sugars.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Shaped Articles:</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0077] In general, the inventive shaped articles retain the
      beneficial properties of the polymer membranes as defined herein
      and are thus suitable for all uses that are applicable to such
      membranes; this particularly includes the uses as disclosed
      herein, such as microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration
      (e.g., sterile filtration or viral filtration or concentration of
      biological molecules (e.g. proteins)).<br>
      <br>
      [0000] In a further embodiment, the present invention relates to
      the use of an article, as defined herein (i) in a filter; (ii) in
      a textile material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Intermediates/Starting Materials:</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0078] The inventive intermediates may be used in a process for
      manufacturing a membrane as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] To further illustrate the invention, the following examples
      are provided. These examples are provided with no intent to limit
      the scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>I. Preparation of Starting Materials</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0080] The preparation of the salt nanoparticles is described in
      WO2005/087660. The synthesis of calcium carbonate (denoted as
      CaCO3), barium carbonate (denoted as BaCO3), strontium carbonate
      (denoted as SrCO3), potassium carbonate (denoted as K2CO3) and
      sodium carbonate (denoted as Na2CO3) nanoparticles is shortly
      described below; an FSP apparatus as described in WO2005/087660 is
      used.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] a) Preparation of CaCO3 nanoparticles: Ca-2-Ethylhexanoate
      in 2-ethylhexanoic acid (Molekula) was diluted with
      tetrahydrofurane (THF) to a final Ca content of 3.9 wt %. This
      precursor is fed (9 ml/min, HNP Mikrosysteme, micro annular gear
      pump mzr-2900) to a spray nozzle, dispersed by oxygen (9 l/min,
      PanGas Tech.) and ignited by a premixed methane-oxygen flame (CH4,
      1.2 l/min; O2, 2.2 l/min). The off-gas is filtered through a glass
      fiber filter (Whatman Ltd., USA) by a vacuum pump (Busch S.A.,
      Switzerland). The resulting powder is collected on the glass fiber
      filter and removed by a spatula.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] b) Preparation of BaCO3 nanoparticles: Ba-2-Ethylhexanoate
      in 2-ethylhexanoic acid (AlfaAesar) was diluted with

      <b>II. Preparation of Polymer Membranes.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0086] Polymer membranes are generally produced in a multiple step
      process (see FIG. 1):<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Step a) A dispersion is prepared consisting of a soluble
      polymer (pre-dissolved in an appropriate solvent) and metal salt
      nanoparticles. This dispersion is achieved by manual mixing of the
      components and further ultra-sonication in order to obtain well
      dispersed salt nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Step b) The dispersion is applied on a substrate (e.g.
      glass) using spin coating or roll coating and dried afterwards.
      Optionally, a heating step can be applied for faster drying of the
      applied films (evaporation of the solvent; step c)).<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Step e) The template salt nanoparticles are removed
      (dissolved) from the polymer matrix using a suitable acid to
      reveal the porous structure. The film is then washed in de-ionized
      water and ethanol and dried on air.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Specific preparation procedures for polymer membranes using
      different polymers, salts and solvents are given below and
      summarized in table 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] a) Porous polysulfone membranes (porous PSU membranes)<br>
      <br>
      a1) PSU dissolved in dichloromethane (denoted as DM)<br>
      PSU (Dolder AG, Udel P-1700) dissolved in DM (J. T. Baker, N L) is
      mixed with either CaCO3, K2CO3 or Na2CO3 nanoparticles. The weight
      ratio of polymer to salt is 52.5% to 47.5%. The weight ratio of
      polymer/salt to solvent is 6% to 94%. This mixture is sonicated
      (Hielscher ultrasonics, UP400s) for 1 minute at 400 W to disperse
      the nanoparticles. The dispersion is then applied on a glass
      substrate using spin-coating (Laurell Technologies Corp.,
      WS-650SZ) or roll-coating (Zehntner GmbH, ZAA 2300) to achieve
      films of uniform thickness. For spin-coating, a drop of
      approximately 500 [mu]l is pipetted on the substrate and then
      spinned for 10 seconds at 1000 rpm and acceleration of 1000 rpm/s.
      For roll-coating, the coating knife has 50 [mu]m slots, forward
      speed is set to 18 mm/s. 1 ml of dispersion was used to create a
      film of approximately 10*10 cm&lt;2 &gt;area. Finally, the salt
      nanoparticles are dissolved in 1M hydrochloric acid (denoted as
      HCl) for 3 minutes to reveal the porous structure. The film is
      then washed in de-ionized water (Millipore, electrical resistivity
      &gt;18M[Omega]cm) and ethanol and dried on air for 2 hours.<br>
      a2) PSU dissolved in dimethylacetamide (denoted as DMAC)<br>
      <br>
      PSU (Dolder AG, Udel P-1700) dissolved in DMAC (Fluka, CH) is
      mixed with SrCO3 nanoparticles. The weight ratio of polymer to
      salt is 40.0% to 60.0%. The weight ratio of polymer/salt to
      solvent is 20.0% to 80.0%. This mixture is sonicated (Hielscher
      ultrasonics, UP400s) for 1 minute at 400 W to disperse the
      nanoparticles. The dispersion is then applied on a glass substrate
      using spin-coating (Laurell Technologies Corp., WS-650SZ) or
      roll-coating (Zehntner GmbH, ZAA 2300) to achieve films of uniform
      thickness. For spin-coating, a drop of approximately 500 [mu]l is
      pipetted on the substrate and then spinned for 30 seconds at 1000
      rpm and acceleration of 1000 rpm/s. For roll-coating, the coating
      knife has 50 [mu]m slots, forward speed is set to 18 mm/s. 1 ml of
      dispersion was used to create a film of approximately 10*10
      cm&lt;2 &gt;area. Subsequent heating for 1 minute at 120[deg.] C.
      in an ordinary lab oven (Memmert GmbH) is necessary for the quick
      evaporation of remaining solvent. Finally, the salt nanoparticles
      are dissolved in 1M hydrochloric acid (denoted as HCl) for 3
      minutes to reveal the porous structure. The film is then washed
      thoroughly in de-ionized water (Millipore, electrical resistivity
      &gt;18M[Omega]cm) and ethanol and dried on air for 2 hours.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      PES (Dolder AG, Veradel A-201) dissolved in DMAC (Fluka, CH) is
      mixed with either BaCO3 or SrCO3 nanoparticles. The weight ratio
      of polymer to BaCO3 is 20.0% to 80.0%. The weight ratio of
      polymer/BaCO3 to solvent is 40% to 60%. The weight ratio of
      polymer to SrCO3 is 40.0% to 60.0%. The weight ratio of
      polymer/SrCO3 to solvent is 20% to 80%. These mixtures are
      sonicated (Hielscher ultrasonics, UP400s) for 1 minute at 400 W to
      disperse the nanoparticles. The dispersions are then applied on
      glass substrates using spin-coating (Laurell Technologies Corp.,
      WS-650SZ) or roll-coating (Zehntner GmbH, ZAA 2300) to achieve
      films of uniform thickness. For spin-coating, a drop of
      approximately 500 [mu]l is pipetted on the substrate and then

      and dried on air for 2 hours.<br>
      <br>
      b2) PES dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (denoted as DMSO)<br>
      <br>
      PES (Dolder AG, Veradel A-201) dissolved in DMSO (Fluka, CH) is
      mixed with CaCO3 nanoparticles. The weight ratio of polymer to
      salt is 52.5% to 47.5%. The weight ratio of polymer/salt to
      solvent is 6.0% to 94.0%. This mixture is sonicated (Hielscher
      ultrasonics, UP400s) for 1 minute at 400 W to disperse the
      nanoparticles. The dispersion is then applied on a glass substrate

      [0097] c) Porous polycarbonate membrane (porous PC membranes)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] PC (Bayer Material Science, Makrolon OD2015) dissolved in
      DM (J. T. Baker, N L) is mixed with CaCO3 nanoparticles. The
      weight ratio of polymer to salt is 52.5% to 47.5%. The weight

      <b>III. Dextran Rejection Profile Test.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0099] The practicability of the hereby described membranes for
      filtration purposes has been tested on the PSU membrane (example a
      1, CaCO3 as template nanoparticles). For this purpose, a dextran
      rejection test has been implemented to determine the molecular
      weight cut-off (denoted as MWCO, for details see: G. Tkacik, S.
      Michaels, Nature Biotechnology. 9:941-946, 1991). For example, a
      membrane capable of rejecting at least 90% of a macromolecule of
      1000 kDa can be classified to have a MWCO of 1000 kDA. A 0.1 wt %
      mixture of different dextran standards (5 kDa, 25 kDa, 80 kDa, 150
      kDa, 270 kDa, 410 kDa, 670 kDa, 1400 kDa) (Fluka, CH) was prepared
      in 0.1M sodium nitrate (denoted as NaNO3) buffer solution. The
      individual standards were mixed in equal amounts. The mixture was
      filtered (direct flow) through the membrane using a high vacuum
      pump (Edwards Vacuum Ltd). The permeate and the mixture were
      compared using gel permeation chromatography.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The PSU membrane of ex a1 (table 1) based on CaCO3 showed a
      minimal rejection of 95% for the 1400 kDa dextran standard
      molecules. The MWCO for the tested membrane can therefore be
      classified as 1400 kDa. This MWCO was proven several times which
      indicates that the membrane fabrication process is stable and
      reproducible.<br>

      </b><b>FLAME SYNTHESIS OF METAL SALT NANOPARTICLES, IN PARTICULAR
        CALCIUM AND PHOSPHATE COMPRISING NANOPARTICLES </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Described is a method for the production of metal salts, wherein
      the cationic metal is preferably selected from Group I to IV
      metals and mixtures thereof and the anionic group is selected from
      phosphates, silicates, sulfates, carbonates, hydroxides, fluorides
      and mixtures thereof, and wherein said method comprises forming a
      mixture of at least one metal source that is a metal carboxylate
      with a mean carbon value per carboxylate group of at least 3 and
      at least one anion source into droplets and oxiding said droplets
      in a high temperature environment, preferably a flame. This method
      is especially suited for the production of calcium phosphate
      biomaterials such as hydroxyapatite (HAp, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) and
      tricalcium phosphate (TCP, Ca3(PO4)2) that exhibit excellent
      biocompatibility and osteoconductivity and therefore are widely
      used for reparation of bony or periodontal defects, coating of
      metallic implants and bone space fillers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This application relates to fine metal salt particles and a method
      for producing same by means of flame spray pyrolysis, in
      particular calcium and phosphate containing particles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Flame spray pyrolysis &lt;13 &gt;currently established itself as a
      suitable method for the preparation of nano-particles, most
      notably, oxides containing main group and transition metals
      &lt;41&gt;. It has rapidly evolved into a scalable process to
      oxide nanoparticles for catalyst preparation &lt;14,15 &gt;and
      industrial-scale flame-aerosol synthesis today produces megaton
      quantities of carbon, silica and titania. Experimentally, the
      flame spray reactors consist of a capillary surrounded by a narrow
      adjustable orifice (see FIG. 1). The precursor liquid is dispersed
      at the tip resulting in a well-defined spray. The surrounding
      methane/oxygen supporting flame ignites the spray and the flame
      converts the precursor to the corresponding materials.<br>
      <br>
      For many applications nanoparticulate materials are desired. Such
      materials comprise calcium phosphates such as tricalciumphosphates
      but also apatites. Calcium phosphate biomaterials have attracted a
      tremendous interest in clinical medicine. Both hydroxyapatite (HAp
      or OHAp, Ca 10(PO 4) 6(OH) 2) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP, Ca
      3(PO 4) 2) exhibit excellent biocompatibility and
      osteoconductivity &lt;1,2&gt;. They are widely used for reparation
      of bony or periodontal defects, coating of metallic implants and
      bone space fillers. However, traditional methods (precipitation,
      sol-gel synthesis, hydrothermal method or solid-state reactions)
      &lt;1,3-5 &gt;suffer from a limited range of accessible materials
      and morphology. Wet-phase preparation generally requires time and
      cost intensive post treatments such as washing and drying.
      Solid-state reaction involves prolonged sintering and therefore
      results in low specific surface area powder. The rather dense
      materials display a lack of microporosity, reduce contact to the
      body fluid and hinder resorption in vivo.<br>
      <br>
      Recently reported preparation methods comprise, plasma spraying6
      and pulsed laser deposition &lt;7,8&gt;. They have resulted in
      advantageous coatings on implant surfaces. Moreover, amorphous
      calcium phosphates have shown to result in improved resorption
      properties &lt;9-11 &gt;and are promising materials for
      self-setting cements &lt;12 &gt;making them a most valuable
      target.<br>
      <br>
      All these methods, however, have several drawbacks. They either
      lead to mixtures that can not be separated or only with
      considerable effort, and/or they lead to a too dense material,
      and/or they cannot be applied for bulk synthesis, and/or they are
      not usable in large scale production. Thus there is still a need
      for an improved production method allowing the production of pure
      materials, preferably also in large scale production, and an
      improved material obtainable by such method.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Hence, it is a general object of the invention to provide a method
      for the production of metal salts, wherein the anionic group is
      selected from phosphates, borates, silicates, sulfates,
      carbonates, hydroxides, fluorides and mixtures thereof, in
      particular nanoparticulate metal salts, preferably metal salts
      wherein the metal is selected from groups I, II, III, IV metals,
      the 3d transition metals, the lanthanoids (rare earth group)
      predominantly occurring in oxidation states II and III, but
      optionally also in oxidation state I or IV, and mixtures of the
      mentioned metals. Since all the above mentioned metals usually
      have oxidation states I to IV, they are further on considered to
      be encompassed by the term "group I to IV metals". Other metals
      can be present depending on the type of salt and area of
      application. In some cases, doped salts or mixtures or different
      salts are preferred.<br>

      Another object of the present invention was to provide
      nanoparticulate, optionally percolating metal salts.<br>
      <br>
      Yet another object of the present invention was to provide uses
      for such metal salts.<br>
      <br>
      Now, in order to implement these and still further objects of the
      invention, which will become more readily apparent as the
      description proceeds, the method is manifested by the features
      that a mixture of at least one metal source that is a metal
      carboxylate with a mean carbon value per carboxylate group of at
      least 3 and at least one anion source is formed into droplets and
      that said droplets are oxidized in a high temperature environment.<br>
      <br>
      In preferred metal salts the metal comprises calcium. Much
      preferred are metal salts with a high calcium content of at least
      80 atom-% calcium (sum of all cations is 100 atom-%), preferably
      at least 90%, most preferably at least 95%.<br>
      <br>
      The sum of cationic metals may comprise further Group I-IV metals,
      preferably metals selected from the group consisting of sodium,
      potassium, magnesium, zinc, strontium and barium, rare earth
      metals, in particular gadolinium, and mixtures of two or more of
      said metals.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the sum of anionic groups comprises anionic groups
      selected from phosphates, sulfates, borates, hydroxides,
      carbonates, fluorides and mixtures thereof in amounts of at least
      80 mole-% of the theoretically calculated necessary amount of
      anions if electron neutrality in the salt is assumed, preferably
      at least 90%, more preferred at least 95%. Most preferred are pure
      materials wherein more than 98% or even 99% of all negative
      charges in the salt are covered by one of the above anions. In
      much preferred compounds at least part of the anionic groups are
      phosphates, whereby compounds with a metal:phosphate molar ratio
      of 3:1 (e.g. Na 3PO 4) to 1:1 (e.g. AlPO 4, enamel) are preferred.<br>
      <br>
      The method of the present invention is especially suited to
      produce a metal salt selected from the group consisting of
      amorphous tricalciumphosphate, alpha-tricalciumphosphate,
      beta-tricalciumphosphate, apatites and mixtures thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred apatites that are producible by the above method in high
      purity have the formula Ca 10(PO 4) 6(OH) 2xF 2y(CO 3) z whereby
      x, y and z each range from 0 to 1 and the sum of x+y+Z is 1.
      Although z can vary from 0 to 1, dependent on the application
      specific ranges may be preferred. For e.g. medical applications,
      carbonate can be advantageous. The carbonate content in apatites
      can e.g. be 3-8 wt % carbonate measured by thermographimetric
      analysis. The CO 2 detection can be done by a differential
      scanning calorimeter coupled to a mass spectrometer.<br>
      <br>
      The method of the present invention has been found suitable for
      the production of very pure products, such as phase pure amorphous
      tricalciumphosphate, alpha-tricalciumphosphate or
      beta-tricalciumphosphate, or tricalciumposphate poor or even
      tricalciumposphate free apatites. The purity of the compound
      formed that can be achieved is in the range of at least 96% by
      weight, preferably at least 98% by weight, most preferred at least
      99% by weight. Preferred products that can be obtained in high
      purity comprise amorphous tricalciumphosphate,
      alpha-tricalciumphosphate or beta-tricalciumphosphate or
      hydroxyapatite or fluorapatite or hydroxyfluorapatite.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, the metal source is a metal carboxylate with a
      mean carbon value per carboxylate group of at least 3, preferably
      at least 4, much preferably at least 5, and most preferred between
      5 and 8. Preferably, the metal carboxylate is selected from the
      group consisting of C1 to C18 carboxylates and mixtures thereof,
      more preferably C4 to C12 carboxylates and mixtures thereof, much
      preferably C5 to C8 carboxylates and mixtures thereof, in
      particular octoates such as 2-ethylhexanoic acid salts.<br>
      <br>
      The metal carboxylate(s) and the one or more anion source(s), i.e.
      the phosphate and/or one or more other anion(s) or anions
      precursor(s) comprising droplets are preferably oxidized in a
      flame.<br>
      <br>
      Prior to being formed into droplets, the metal carboxylate usually
      has a viscosity of at most 100 mPas, preferably at most 40 mPas,
      more preferably at most 20 mPas. If the metal carboxylate does not
      have such viscosity, such viscosity may be obtained by heating
      and/or by providing a mix of the at least one metal carboxylate
      and at least one viscosity reducing solvent.<br>
      <br>
      Suitable viscosity reducing solvents may comprise one or more
      acids. While viscosity reducing solvents may consist of one or
      more acids, often 50% w/w total acid(s) or less may be used and in
      some cases acids are neither needed nor desired. Preferred acids
      are C1 to C10 carboxylic acids.<br>
      <br>
      The solvent may comprise at least one low molecular weight and/or
      low viscosity apolar solvent, in particular an aromatic or
      aliphatic, unsubstituted, linear or branched hydrocarbon,
      preferably a solvent selected from the group consisting of
      toluene, xylene, lower aliphatic hydrocarbons and mixtures
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The anion source is selected in view of sufficient solubility in
      the above defined solvent. Suitable anion sources comprise<br>
      a phosphate source selected from inorganic phosphorous compounds
      and/or organophosphorous compounds soluble in solvents or solvent
      mixtures having a combustion enthalpy of at least 13 kJ/g,
      preferably at least 22.5 kJ/g, most preferred at least 25.5 kJ/g,
      in particular phosphoric acid and/or organic esters of phosphoric
      acid and/or phosphines, in particular phosphorous compounds
      constituting solvents or leading to solvent mixtures with the
      above-mentioned properties, and/or<br>
      a fluoride source being a fluoride derivative of an organic
      compound, said fluoride derivative being soluble in the above
      defined solvent or solvent mixture, in particular trifluoroacetic
      acid, and/or<br>
      a silicate source selected from organic silicates and/or
      organosilicon compounds soluble in the above defined solvent or
      solvent mixture, in particular tetraethyl silicate, and/or<br>
      a sulfate source selected from organic sulfur containing compounds
      and/or sulfuric acid said sulfate source being soluble in the
      above defined solvent or solvent mixture, in particular dimethyl
      sulfoxide (DMSO)<br>
      a carbonate source selected from any organic carbon source, such
      as hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids, alcohols, metal carboxylates
      and mixtures thereof.<br>
      <br>
      If metal carbonates shall be produced, the metal carboxylate used
      as metal source can simultaneously act as anion source, whereby
      the cool-down process (residence time of the particle containing
      off-gas at specific temperatures) is relevant for the purity.<br>
      <br>
      Suitable apparatus for performing the flame oxidation are spray
      burners &lt;42,43&gt;, or in particular oil burners.<br>
      <br>
      Usually the oxidation is performed at a temperature of at least
      600[deg.] C., preferably at least 800[deg.] C., more preferably at
      least 1000[deg.] C. and most preferably in a range of 1200 to
      2600[deg.] C., in particular at about 1600[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      A suitable method for preparing the metal carboxylate starts from
      a metal oxide, a metal hydroxide, a metal carbonate, a metal
      halide, such as a chloride or bromide, or a metal lower alkyl
      oxide, in particular a C1 to C4 alkyl oxide. For good results the
      enthalpy of the metal carboxylate or the metal carboxylate
      comprising solution should be at least 13 kJ/g, preferably at
      least 18 kJ/g, more preferred at least 22.5 kJ/g and most
      preferred at least 25.5 kJ/g.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to get a high production rate if the solution
      comprises metal carboxylate(s) in an amount corresponding to at
      least 0.15 moles metal per liter, and anion source(s) in an amount
      corresponding to at least 0.05 moles anionic groups per liter. It
      is, however, also possible to make the solution up to 10 times
      more concentrated, whereby concentrations of about 0.8 to 2 moles
      metal and corresponding amounts of anionic groups/anion precursors
      are presently preferred. Since the conversion of the metal source
      to the metal salt is almost free of any loss, a high production
      rate, only dependent on the solubility of the starting materials,
      the viscosity of the solution to be sprayed and the nozzle/burner
      capacity is obtained. By adding at least 1 anionic group per 3
      metal atoms/ions, the conversion to a metal salt of the present
      invention and not a metal oxide is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      In order to bring the nanoparticle manufacture from the
      pilot-scale production to an industrial scale synthesis (kg to ton
      quantities), some additional problems are to be faced. The most
      prominent is the choice of readily accessible metal precursors
      that allow sufficiently high production rates. The present
      invention links the manufacture of nanoparticles to specific metal
      containing products and anion sources, as well as optionally
      specific solvents. Besides of the specific selection of starting
      materials, production rate is also influenced by the burner. Using
      multiple arrays as described in WO 02/061163 entails problems with
      maintenance, nozzle clogging, space, reproducibility and others.
      Thus it is much preferred to use few burners to make the same
      quantity of powder, preferably common oil burners. Oil burners
      with well above 100 kg oil/h are available and thus they are well
      suited for high production rates. As it will become apparent
      within this invention, such a burner can (without any scale-up)
      achieve amounts of 8 kg Ca 3(PO 4) 2 or 9 kg hydroxyapatite
      particles per hour (for 100 kg feed/hour). with scale-up amounts
      of about 12 or 13 kg, respectively, are expected. Commercially
      available oil-burners suitable to convert the here described
      liquid into corresponding metal salts are-to only mention a
      few-available from Vescal AG, Heizsysteme, Industries-trasse 461,
      CH-4703 Kestenholz under the designation of OEN-151LEV, or
      OEN-143LEV, or OEN-331LZ to OEN-334LZ.<br>
      <br>
      The method of the present invention can also be applied for the
      production of substoichiometric metal salts. In such production
      the flame comprises insufficient oxygen for full combustion or
      conversion of the reactants. Thus, substoichiometric means that
      e.g. a metal is present in different oxidation states.<br>
      <br>
      The metal salt as-prepared (as-prepared designates a product
      directly after high temperature production, in particular directly
      after the burner/flame) may comprise some carbonate. In case that
      less or no carbonate is desired, a heat treatment, optionally in
      the presence of humidity may be performed. In the case of apatite
      such treatment allows to reduce the CO 2 content to close to zero.
      Suitably such treatment is performed at temperatures of from
      500[deg.] C. to 900[deg.] C. and a water partial pressure of 0.1
      to 100 mbar.<br>
      <br>
      Dependent on the CO 2 removal conditions, this step may
      simultaneously act as tempering/sintering procedure, or a separate
      tempering/sintering procedure may be provided. By such temperature
      treatment, the crystal structure may be influenced and/or a
      percolating product with specific features may be obtained.
      Suitable sintering methods can be found by applying the analytical
      methods described below in connection with calcium phosphate
      (Ca/P) samples. Such methods comprise mercury porosimetry and
      nitrogen adsorption (BET) such as outlined in Rigby et al. (2004)
      &lt;40 &gt;for determining the specific surface area and pore size
      and pore structure analysis. Further methods are transmission
      electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
      for morphological studies, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
      spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction for product characterization,
      as well as differential thermal analysis (DTA) for monitoring
      temperature dependent changes.<br>
      <br>
      A further aspect of the present invention is a metal salt, in
      particular a metal salt obtainable by the above described method.<br>
      <br>
      Metal salts of the present invention comprise the following
      features:<br>
      <br>
      They have a BET equivalent diameter as-prepared in the range of 5
      to 200 nm, preferably of about 20 nm. In specific cases, larger
      than 20 nm diameters such as 50 nm or 100 nm are obtained,
      especially if the melting point of the corresponding salt is below
      1000[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the salts of the present invention are characterized
      in that they usually do not release more than 7.5 wt % water upon
      heating to 900[deg.] C. at a heating rate of 10[deg.] C. per
      minute. Preferably, they have less than 5 wt % water release, most
      preferred less than 4.5 wt % water release.<br>
      <br>
      The salts of the present invention usually release more than 90 wt
      % of all water upon heating to 500[deg.] C. at a heating rate of
      10[deg.] C. per minute. Preferably, upon heating to 400[deg.] C.,
      most preferably upon heating to 350[deg.] C. The water release
      curve (see e.g. FIG. 5) supports the assumption that water is only
      present adsorbed on the surface.<br>
      <br>
      The water release criteria markedly distinguish the material of
      the present invention from wet phase material. Such material
      slowly releases water in a large temperature range of several
      hundreds [deg.] C. The release curve of wet phase product supports
      the assumption that water is incorporated within the crystal
      lattice such that it is kept much stronger.<br>
      <br>
      Dependent on the preparation method final, sintered products with
      different morphology and bulk density (measured according to DIN
      ISO 697 (1984-01)) are obtained. The bulk density of e.g.
      wet-phase prepared amorphous tricalciumphosphate is often higher
      than 500 kg/m &lt;3&gt;, whereas the product produced by the
      method of the present invention is in the range of 100 to 300 kg/m
      &lt;3&gt;. The bulk density of alpha-tricalciumphosphate or
      beta-tricalciumphosphate produced by state of the art high
      temperature solid state reaction is in the range of 1000 to 2000
      kg/m &lt;3 &gt;whereas respective products produced by the method
      of the present invention have bulk densities of below 800 kg/m
      &lt;3 &gt;for beta-tricalciumphosphate and below 500 kg/m &lt;3
      &gt;for alpha-tricalciumphosphate.<br>
      <br>
      The specific surface area (measured by nitrogen adsorption at
      -196[deg.] C. according to the BET-method) of state of the art
      alpha-tricalciumphosphate is below 2 m &lt;2&gt;/g, whereas
      alpha-tricalciumphosphate produced according to the present
      invention has more than 3 m &lt;2&gt;/g, often and preferably more
      than 5 m &lt;2&gt;/g and more preferably more than 8 m
      &lt;2&gt;/g. The specific surface area of state of the art
      beta-tricalciumphosphate is below 0.8 m &lt;2&gt;/g, whereas
      beta-tricalciumphosphate of the present invention has more than 1
      m &lt;2&gt;/g, often and preferably more than 1.5 m &lt;2&gt;/g
      and more preferably more than 2 m &lt;2&gt;/g.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred metal salts of the present invention are biomaterials.<br>
      <br>
      Such metal salts may be used in medical applications, e.g. as bone
      cement and/or resorbable material for implants, as additive to
      tooth pastes, e.g. as fluoride source and/or abrasive aid, as
      fluoride source in foodstuffs, e.g. chewing gums, sweets and table
      salt, as catalyst support, as molecular sieve, as filler for
      polymers, as UV stabilizer and/or degradation activator in
      biodegradable or bioresorbable materials.<br>

      <b>MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention is now further described for calcium phosphates, in
      particular calcium phosphates that are suitable as biomaterials.<br>
      <br>
      In the scope of the present invention it has been found that flame
      synthesis offers a most versatile tool to materials that due to
      the resulting morphology, the high purity and the obtainable high
      crystal phase content are applicable as biomaterials. Furthermore,
      the direct gas-phase process allows facile substitution of both
      cations and anions.<br>
      <br>
      Reproducible preparation of tricalcium phosphate (Ca/P=1.5) and
      different apatites (Ca/P=1.67) offers a challenge to conventional
      methods. By the inventive method materials with an accurately
      defined calcium to phosphorous molar ratio Ca/P ranging from 1.425
      to 1.67 are obtainable. Such materials optionally may be doped
      with other anions or cations such as magnesium, zinc, barium,
      gadolinium, silicate, sulfate or fluoride. Tricalcium phosphate
      samples with an excess of either calcium or phosphorous are
      designated with their additional atomic fraction in respect of the
      stoichiometric sample (stoichiometric sample Ca/P=1.5). Tricalcium
      phosphate with an excess of calcium (Ca/P&gt;1.5) is marked e.g.
      "+2.5at % Ca", and tricalcium phosphate with an excess phosphorous
      (Ca/P&lt;1.5) is marked e.g. "+2.5at % p". A comparison of the
      Ca/P ratio and the respective at % is shown in Table 1.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      The desired composition, i.e. fluorapatite (FAp),
      hydroxyfluoapatite (OHFAp/HFAp) and/or any doping can be obtained
      by admixing the respective anions or cations to the initial
      solution. By e.g. admixing magnesium octoate, zinc naphthenate,
      trifluoracetic acid or mixtures thereof to the calcium and
      phosphate precursor solution, magnesium and/or zinc doped
      materials and/or fluorapatite Ca 10(PO 4) 6F 2) or
      hydroxyfluorapatite (Ca 10(PO 4) 6(OH)F)can be manufactured in a
      single step. Beyond doped calcium phosphate, also pure metal salts
      of other metals than calcium can be obtained by the same method.
      Similarly, metal salts with an anion other can phosphate can be
      made. Examples of other materials are calcium carbonate
      (limestone) nanoparticles or anhydrite nanoparticles (CaSO 4)
      which are described in the experimental section.<br>
      <br>
      Spherical, highly agglomerated particles of 10-30 nm diameters (
      FIG. 2A) can be collected after synthesis. Thermal stability and
      evolution of different crystal phases can be monitored by nitrogen
      adsorption (BET) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Samples typically
      start with 90 m &lt;2&gt;g &lt;-1 &gt;(BET equivalent diameter 20
      nm) and calcination results in a steep decrease of specific
      surface area around 600[deg.] C. showing the onset of strong
      sintering and crystallization. While a slight excess of
      phosphorous (+1 at % P) has no significant influence on the
      thermal stability of tricalcium phosphate (Ca/P=1.5),
      hydroxyapatite (Ca/P=1.67) is considerably more stable and
      maintains above 15 m &lt;2&gt;g &lt;-1 &gt;at 900[deg.] C. Half
      (Ca 10(PO 4) 6(OH)F) and fully (Ca 10(PO 4) 6F 2) substituted
      fluorapatite were more resistant to sintering than unsubstituted
      hydroxyapatite.<br>
      <br>
      In vivo histological behavior of biomaterials can be determined by
      morphology and phase composition. Macropores (diameter &gt;100
      [mu]m) have been found to provide a scaffold for bone cell
      colonization &lt;16 &gt;and therefore favour bone ingrowth
      &lt;17,18&gt;. The content of micropores (diameter &lt;10 [mu]m)
      is given by the preparation method and the temperature and
      duration of sintering. Interconnective microporosity guarantees
      body fluid circulation and is even believed to be responsible for
      the observed osteoinductive properties of certain bioceramics
      &lt;19-24&gt;. Electron microscopy images of Ca/P=1.5 prepared by
      the inventive method after calcination at 700[deg.] C. ( FIG. 3,
      pictures a and b) revealed that the material had fused together
      building clearly visible sinter necks. This sintered product
      preserves a high porosity with a primary particle size of about
      100 nm. Sintering at 900[deg.] C. ( FIG. 3, pictures c and d)
      results in much larger primary particles of approximately 0.5
      [mu]m in diameter. The highly regular structure with
      interconnecting micropores provides both sintered products with
      excellent resorption properties and furthers the induction of bone
      formation in vivo. Such structures are also described as
      percolating phases.<br>
      <br>
      As-prepared calcium phosphate consists of amorphous nanoparticles
      indicating that the fast cooling after the formation in the flame
      did not allow the material to crystallize. In the scope of the
      present invention, it has now also been found that such amorphous
      calcium phosphate can be heat treated at different temperatures to
      crystallize in a selected crystallinic phase in high
      selectivity/purity. The presence of a glassy structure of the
      product as-prepared has been confirmed by differential thermal
      analysis. A coupled mass spectroscopy (DTA-MS) apparatus allowed
      simultaneous detection of desorbing water and carbon dioxide. The
      combination of DTA and XRD patterns ( FIG. 4) allows to confirm
      crystallization and phase transformations. The exothermic peak
      around 600[deg.] C. correlates to the crystallization of the
      amorphous material. The sample +1% at Ca, amorphous at 500[deg.]
      C. ( FIG. 4, label 1), crystallizes to meta-stable [alpha]-TCP
      &lt;25&gt;, often referred to as [alpha]'-TCP ( FIG. 4, label 2).
      At 915[deg.] C. [alpha]'-TCP transforms into the thermodynamically
      favoured [beta]-TCP ( FIG. 4, label 3). At 1190[deg.] C.,
      [beta]-TCP transforms back into the high-temperature polymorph
      [alpha]-TCP. Adding excess phosphorous to the Ca 3(PO 4) 2
      stoichiometry (Ca/P=1.5) provokes the formation of pyrophosphate
      Ca 2P 2O 7. Crystallization of [alpha]-dicalcium pyrophosphate
      results in a second peak at 690[deg.] C. slightly above the
      crystallization of tricalcium phosphate ( FIG. 4 label 4). The
      ratio of pyrophosphate to TCP follows the stoichiometry. Minute
      amounts of pyrophosphate are present in the stoichiometric sample
      (Ca/P=1.5), they fully vanish with a slight calcium excess (+1at %
      Ca). For all samples a change in weight due to absorbed water on
      the high-surface materials was detected by thermo-gravimetry (TG)
      below 520[deg.] C. Unlike calcium phosphates prepared by wet-phase
      chemistry, the weight loss of flame-made Ca/P ceramics does not
      exceed 4%. The Ca/P=1.67 sample crystallizes above 600[deg.] C. (
      FIG. 5 top) to hydroxyapatite (XRD pattern, FIG. 8). No further
      phase transformation or decomposition was detected up to
      1250[deg.] C. A second weight loss (2%) occurred between 500[deg.]
      C. and 950[deg.] C. ( FIG. 5 top). This weight loss correlates to
      the release of CO2 ( FIG. 5 bottom) and was already previously
      attributed to the decomposition of carbonate in apatite
      &lt;26,27&gt;. The presence of carbonate results in absorption
      peaks between 1490 cm &lt;-1 &gt;and 1420 cm &lt;-1 &gt;and around
      870 cm &lt;-1 &gt;in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra
      &lt;28,29 &gt;( FIG. 6). The as-prepared Ca/P=1.5 sample does not
      show any of these carbonate absorptions. Broad unresolved
      absorption bands of phosphate around 1060 cm &lt;-1 &gt;and 580 cm
      &lt;-1 &gt;verify the amorphous structure of the materials after
      preparation ( FIG. 6). Clear absorption peaks are obtained after
      crystallization and correspond to hydroxyapatite &lt;30 &gt;for
      Ca/P=1.67 and to [alpha]'-TCP &lt;31 &gt;for +1 at % Ca. Weak
      water absorption bands are found around 3400 cm &lt;-1 &gt;and
      1660 cm &lt;-1 &gt;with varying intensity. The crystallized
      hydroxyapatite still shows minor absorption bands between 1550 cm
      &lt;-1 &gt;and 1400 cm &lt;-1 &gt;due to residual carbonate
      &lt;28,29&gt;. From the TG curves the carbonate content can be
      calculated and was found to be 6.6 wt % CaCO 3 which is similar to
      the carbonate content (3-8 wt %) in human bone &lt;32,33&gt;.
      Carbonate increases the solubility of hydroxyapatite and results
      in enhanced biodegradation &lt;9,34,35&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      The evidence of calcium pyrophosphate in biomaterials is routinely
      done by FTIR spectroscopy. Spectra of the samples calcined at
      900[deg.] C. ( FIG. 7) indicating the presence of Ca 2P 2O 7 from
      DTA/XRD measurements show very sharp peaks underlining the high
      crystallinity of the material. The peak group in the range of 1215
      cm &lt;-1 &gt;to 1140 cm &lt;-1 &gt;and two clear peaks at 727 cm
      &lt;-1 &gt;and 496 cm &lt;-1&gt;, to be best seen in the sample
      +2.5at % P, correspond to [beta]-calcium pyrophosphate ([beta]-Ca
      2P 2O 7) absorption bands and are consistent with literature
      &lt;36-38&gt;. A continuous decrease of absorption for these bands
      is seen by decreasing the phosphorous content. In agreement with
      DTA measurements the pyrophosphate present in the sample is
      determined by an excess of phosphorous in the precursor.
      Consequently, the suppression or promotion of the formation of
      calcium pyrophosphate can be accessed by varying the Ca/P ratio in
      the precursor. No Calcium pyrophosphate was detected in the sample
      +1 at % Ca by DTA and FTIR, where the infrared spectrum matches
      well with the one of [beta]-TCP &lt;31,39&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      The formation of a specific product is dependent on the Ca/P ratio
      as well as of the calcinations temperature (see FIGS. 10 and 11).
      Almost pure alphatricalcium phosphate is obtained at a Ca/P ratio
      slightly above 1.5 but below 1.55 and 30 minutes calcination at
      700[deg.] C. ( FIG. 10). Almost pure hydroxyapatite is obtained at
      a Ca/P ratio of about 1.67 and 30 minutes calcinations at
      700[deg.] C. ( FIG. 10). For the production of almost pure
      beta-tricalcium phosphate the same Ca/P ratio can be chosen as for
      the production of alpha-tricalcium phosphate, but the calcination
      temperature has to be enhanced to 900[deg.] C. ( FIG. 11).<br>

      The application of calcium phosphate biomaterials is not
      restricted to hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate. Recent
      studies about alternative calcium phosphate materials have focused
      on fluoride substituted hydroxyapatite. As shown above r fluoride
      substituted apatites can easily be obtained by the method of the
      present invention. Differentiation of fluorapatite and
      hydroxyfluorapatite from hydroxyapatite can be done by FTIR
      spectroscopy. Spectra of the three apatites after calcination at
      700[deg.] C. are shown in FIG. 9. Fluoride comprising apatites,
      due to them being neutral with regard to calcium content in the
      animal body can not only be used as substitutes for fluorapatite
      but also as a non-toxic fluoride source.<br>
      <br>
      By adding a magnesium source such as magnesium octoate in desired
      amounts (e.g. 1 at-%) to the precursor mixture for the preparation
      of tricalciumphosphate the corresponding doped calcium phosphate
      polymorph phases can be prepared without phase segregation such as
      the segregation of MgO rich phases. Thus, by the method of the
      present invention phase pure magnesium doped metal salts, such as
      amorphous tricalciumpholphate, alpha-tricalciumpholphate,
      beta-tricalciumpholphate, or apatites, can be produced (see FIG.
      12 and FIG. 13). Similar results are obtained using a zinc source
      such as zinc naphthenates or zinc octoates (see FIG. 14 and FIG.
      15).<br>
      <br>
      Other metal salts can be obtained as described above for calcium
      and phosphate comprising salts. By e.g. using a calcium source
      such as calcium octoate and a carbonate source such as a
      hydrocarbon or the calcium octoate itself, calciumcarbonate is
      obtained (see FIG. 16) and by using the above described calcium
      source together with a sulfate source, e.g. dimethylsulfoxide
      (DMSO), calcium sulfate is obtained (see FIG. 17).<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Powder Preparation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Calcium phosphate biomaterials were prepared by flame spray
      pyrolysis using calcium oxide (99.9%, Aldrich) dissolved in
      2-ethylhexanoic acid (purum., &gt;=98%, Fluka) and tributyl
      phosphate (puriss., &gt;=99%, Fluka) as precursors. The calcium
      content of the Ca precursor was determined by complexometry with
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate (ref.)
      (&gt;=99%, Fluka) to be 0.768 mol kg &lt;-1&gt;. Starting from a
      parent solution (38 ml per run) with a calcium to phosphorous
      molar ratio (Ca/P) of 1.5, the various mixtures ranging from
      1.425&lt;=Ca/P&lt;=1.667 have been obtained by adding
      corresponding amounts of either calcium 2-ethylhexanoate or
      tributyl phosphate. For the half (Ca 10(PO 4) 6OH F) and fully (Ca
      10(PO 4) 6F 2) fluorine substituted hydroxyapatites,
      tri-fluoroacetic acid (&gt;99%, Riedel deHaen) has been
      correspondingly mixed with precursors having a molar ratio of
      Ca/P=1.67. Throughout all the experiments the concentration of the
      precursor solutions was kept constant (0.667 mol L &lt;-1&gt;) by
      adding xylene (96%, Riedel deHaen). The liquid mixtures were fed
      through a capillary (diameter 0.4 mm) into a methane/oxygen flame
      at a rate of 5 ml min &lt;-1&gt;. Oxygen (5 L min &lt;-1&gt;,
      99.8%, Pan Gas) was used to disperse the liquid leaving the
      capillary. The pressure drop at the capillary tip (1.5 bar) was
      kept constant by adjusting the orifice gap area at the nozzle. A
      stable combustion was achieved by applying a sheath gas (oxygen,
      230 L h &lt;-1&gt;, 99.8%, Pan Gas) through a concentric sinter
      metal ring (see FIG. 1A, 1B). Calibrated mass flow controllers
      (Bronkhorst) were used to monitor all gas flows. The as formed
      particles were collected on a glass fibre filter (Whatmann GF/A,
      15 cm in diameter) which was placed on a cylinder mounted above
      the flame by the aid of a vacuum pump (Vaccubrand). Thermal
      treatment (30 min at specified temperature) was conducted in a
      preheated laboratory furnace (Thermolyne Type 48000) followed by
      quenching in air at ambient conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Powder Characterization</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The specific surface area of the powders was analyzed on a Tristar
      (Micromeritics Instruments) by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K using
      Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. All samples were outgassed at
      150[deg.] C. for 1 hour. The X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD)
      data were collected on a Burker D 8 Advance diffractometer from
      20[deg.] to 40[deg.] at a step size of 0.12[deg.] and a scan speed
      of 2.4[deg.] min &lt;-1 &gt;at ambient condition. For Fourier
      transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pellets of 200 mg KBr
      (&gt;=99.5%, Fluka) and 0.5-0.7 mg sample were prepared and
      dehydrated in a drying furnace (VT 6025, Gerber Instruments) at
      80[deg.] C./&lt;10 mbar for at least 8h before examination (400 cm
      &lt;-1&gt;&lt;[lambda]&lt;4000 cm &lt;-1&gt;) on a Perkin Elmer
      Spectrum BX (4 scans) with 4 cm &lt;-1 &gt;resolution. Elemental
      analysis was performed by laser ablation ion-coupled plasma mass
      spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS). Samples were pressed into plates and
      irradiated with an excimer laser (Lambda Phisyk Compex 110 I; ArF,
      193 nm, pulse energy 150 mJ, frequency 10 Hz). The vaporized
      material was carried by a helium stream to an ICP mass
      spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Elan 6100) and analyzed for calcium and
      phosphorous. As an internal standard a fluorapatite (Durango) was
      used. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) pictures were
      recorded on a CM30 ST (Philips, LaB6 cathode, operated at 300 kV,
      point resolution ~2 {acute over (Å)}). Particles were deposited
      onto a carbon foil supported on a copper grid. Scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM) investigations were performed with a Leo 1530
      Gemini (Zeiss).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Detailed Preparation Example</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      111 g calcium oxide (Aldrich, &gt;99%) are dissolved in 1980 g
      2-Ethylhexanoic acid (Fluka, 99%) and 20 ml of acetic anhydride
      (Fluka, &gt;99%) by heating the mixture to 140[deg.] C. under
      reflux. After cooling some remaining calcium acetate is removed by
      decanting the clear solution. After adding toluene, a 0.768 M
      solution is obtained as determined by titration using
      Ethylendiamine-tetraacetate-disodium salt (Fluka, 99%) and
      Eriochromschwarz-T as an indicator (Fluka, &gt;95%).<br>
      <br>
      0.685 kg of the above solution (stable at room temperature for at
      least 3 month) are mixed with 93.44 g Tributyl-phosphate (Fluka,
      puriss, &gt;99%) and toluene added to a total volume of 1 liter at
      room temperature (298 K). For a single run, 38 ml of this solution
      are mixed with 2 ml toluene and flame sprayed. Combustion enthalpy
      of such a precursor liquid is above 25 kJ/g and the viscosity
      below 10 mPas.<br>
      All materials described herein have been prepared at a liquid flow
      rate of 5 ml/min using a dispersion gas (oxygen, Pan Gas,
      &gt;99.8%) flow of 5 liters/min.<br>
      <br>
      While all products obtainable by the method of the present
      invention have a lot of applications, e.g. as catalyst support, as
      molecular sieve, as filler for polymers and/or as UV stabilizers,
      due to their natural occurrence in human and non human animals, in
      particular mammals, the calcium phosphates described above, are
      much preferred for some applications, e.g.<br>
      <br>
      in dental and medical applications, alone or together with other
      substances such as preferably biopolymers, such applications
      comprising the application as bone cement and/or resorbable
      material for implants, as implant coatings, in the repair of bony
      defects or peridontal defects, as bone space filler etc.,<br>
      as additive to tooth pastes, e.g. as fluoride source and/or
      abrasive aid,<br>
      as fluoride source in foodstuffs, e.g. chewing gums, sweets and
      table salt,<br>
      as degradation activator in biodegradable or bioresorbable
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      In medical applications such as implants and bone cement, the
      product produced according to the present invention is favorable
      since it can easily be obtained in high purity, and since it can
      be sintered to form a product with desired percolating phases
      (interconnected pores), probably due to the extremely light and
      open structure of the aerogel that is used as a starting material.
      Combined with low amounts of water, few sintering and a reduced
      volume loss compared to conventionally prepared powder assure a
      maximum degree of interconnected porosity. Another great advantage
      of the materials produced by the method of the present invention
      is that they can be doped with e.g. barium and/or gadolinium such
      that the degradation of a bioresorbable material can be controlled
      by non-invasive methods such as X-ray imaging or nuclear magnetic

      As ingredient to tooth pastes in particular fluorapatite is
      preferred. It is known that hydroxidefluoride-exchange in apatite
      is very fast such that fluorapatite can replace the hitherto used
      fluoride source in tooth pastes. Since, however, fluorapatite is
      "calcium neutral", i.e. does not affect the calcium content of the
      body, in particular the teeth and the bones, the amount of it is
      uncritical such that it can be added in much higher amounts than
      other fluoride sources and simultaneously act as e.g. abrasion aid
      to improve the plaque removal.<br>
      <br>
      The above addressed benefit of fluorapatite also applies with
      regard to foodstuffs. With hitherto available fluoride sources
      only very specific foodstuffs such as table salt and water, the
      maximal intake of which by a person can be estimated, could be
      fluoride enriched. By using fluorapatite, in view of its being non
      toxic even in large amounts and its fluoride release properties
      exclusively making up for a fluoride deficiency in body apatite, a
      lot of foodstuffs can be supplemented such as e.g. chewing gums,
      candies, sweets but also the already hitherto fluoride enriched
      table salt and drinking water. The supplementation of such
      foodstuffs as chewing gums, candies, sweets (including snacks,
      cakes, chocolate etc.) and salted snacks, yogurts, and other
      foodstuffs that are largely consumed during the day when tooth
      cleaning may be impossible, is much desirable in view of tooth
      health.<br>
      <br>
      Microorganisms necessary for biodegradation of e.g. biodegradable
      polymeric materials often need a large amount of specific ions
      such as calcium and phosphate. Due to the inventive production
      method not only large amounts of nanoparticulate calcium and
      phosphates comprising compounds can be obtained, but also doped
      materials that can be adapted with regard to solubility (e.g. by
      some CO 2 in an apatite) and content of further desirable metals
      other than calcium.<br>
      <br>
      The products of the present invention in general do not segregate
      and they improve the flowability/pourability. Thus, they have
      similar fields of applications as the product AEROSIL(R) of
      Degussa.<br>
      <br>
      The products of the present invention can e.g. be used to improve
      the pourability of e.g. table salt, but also to improve the
      flowability of tooth pastes or of a solid component in a
      manufacturing process e.g. an additive in the polymer
      manufacturing or a spice mixture in the snack production etc.
      Other applications are as rheology or thixotropy improving agents,
      as mechanical stability, UV resistance or other features improving
      additives, as admixtures or fillers not only in biodegradable but
      also in common plastics.<br>
      <br>
      If suitably doped (for example by adding silver ions into the
      material), the products of the present invention can also be
      provided with antibacterial features making them suitable for
      antibacterially equipped polymers or polymers comprising products
      such as coatings paints adhesives etc.<br>
      <br>
      While there are shown and described presently preferred
      embodiments of the invention, it is to be distinctly understood
      that the invention is not limited thereto but may be otherwise
      variously embodied and practiced within the scope of the following
      claims.<br>
