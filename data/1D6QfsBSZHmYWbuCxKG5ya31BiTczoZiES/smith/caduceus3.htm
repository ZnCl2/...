        <p><b>CADUCEUS WOUND COIL EXPERIMENTS</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>( Courtesy of David Brenneman. ) </p>
      <p>Certain experiments, not&nbsp; as carefully controlled as the
        above, were carried out by independent researchers with
        caduceus-wound coils (1). This was also called a "Tensor" coil
        by its main&nbsp; proponent, Wilbert Smith. </p>
      <p>The caduceus coil,&nbsp; illustrated&nbsp; in fig.&nbsp; #1,
        basically consists of ordinary insulated copper wire wound in a
        double-helix around a ferrite core. THIS COIL HAS REPEATEDLY
        BEEN FOUND TO&nbsp; VIOLATE ESTABLISHED LAWS OF ELECTROMAGNETICS
        AND HERTZIAN WAVE THEORY WHEN A HIGH FREQUENCY CURRENT IS
        INJECTED INTO IT. </p>
      <p>First, this apparatus has zero impedance - unlike an ordinary
        coil. When fed electrical energy the wire in the Tensor coil
        does not get hot. </p>
      <p>Secondly, it has infinite resonance&nbsp; - unlike an ordinary
        coil which will resonate chiefly at its natural&nbsp;
        fundamental&nbsp; frequency and weakly on the 2nd or 3rd&nbsp;
        harmonic, the Tensor coil is capable of resonating strongly on
        any number of frequencies randomly spaced in the spectrum. The
        signal pumped into such a coil strangely enough cannot be
        quantified&nbsp; (detected) by standard RF (radio&nbsp;
        frequency) detection apparatus. Many "Ham" radio operators
        and&nbsp; electronic technicians who have used these coils, are
        completely baffled by them. One radio amateur found that with
        two such coils,&nbsp; one used as a transmitter and the other as
        a receiver, the second would not pick up the signal from the
        first unless they were precisely aligned. </p>
      <p>For the signal to be transmitted the alignment had to be as
        critical as that of a laser beam. </p>
      <p><i>CADUCEUS COIL LEVITATES</i> </p>
      <p>A few investigators have also reported unexpected bizarre
        inertial effects in conjunction with these coils. One researcher
        activated his caduceus coil with pulsed bursts of microwave
        frequency whereupon it appeared to lift itself up by its own
        bootstraps executing a periodic series of little hops off the
        ground. Why the coil would jump like this or exhibit the other
        weird effects noted above, has no explanation under standard
        electromagnetic theory, and must be attributed&nbsp; to&nbsp;
        the field effect produced by the unique coil winding. </p>
      <p><i>CADUCEUS COIL CHARACTERISTICS</i> </p>
      <p>Looking at this coil configuration carefully we see that the
        oppositely wound wires of the double&nbsp; helix will cross each
        other on the opposite sides of the core's diameter with each
        complete turn. Hence, the coil&nbsp; will&nbsp; have&nbsp;
        two&nbsp; rows of bumps formed where the two wires cross, the
        rows placed diametrically&nbsp; opposite&nbsp; one another on
        the core. </p>
      <p>Researchers claim that it is important for these crossover
        bumps to lie in a&nbsp; straight&nbsp; line. Now, when the high
        frequency current flows in opposite directions through the two
        wires, the magnetic fields essentially cancel on the sides of
        the coil but on the top and bottom where the crossovers are, the
        fields overlap forming on the top magnetic vectors orientated in
        one direction parallel to the coil axis, and on the bottom
        vectors of the same magnitude oriented oppositely to those on
        top. If we observe the coil from the side we then see that the
        consecutive vectors along the coil axis would form several
        closed toroidal loops circulating into the ferrite core. As we
        stated elsewhere, Wilbert Smith himself while experimenting with
        the Tensor coil,&nbsp; claimed to have recorded time
        differential effects between the coil field and the outer
        environment.&nbsp; This phenomenon, as well as non-coupling of
        signal between coils, may&nbsp; arise from the unique trapped
        toroidal magnetic field described above. </p>

        <b>CADUFAZE.ASC</b> <br>
        by Joel McClain </p>
      <p>In looking at the presumed design of the Sweet VTA, (presumed
        as a result of the lack of detailed information available)&nbsp;
        I have coined the term "alternate depletion" to describe its
        method of attaining ZP energy. </p>
      <p>We know from conventional transformer theory that a transformer
        will reverse the phase of the primary signal in the secondary
        winding. This is caused by the inverse relationship of EMF and
        CEMF in&nbsp; the core of the transformer. Typically, the core
        is made of iron laminates, or some other ferrous material. The
        Sweet VTA uses this principle in a manner which uses the phase
        reversal to cause a cascase of energies. </p>
      <p>The dual caduceus&nbsp; coils&nbsp; are&nbsp; seen&nbsp;
        as&nbsp; next&nbsp; to each other, which permits inductive
        coupling, and within the field of opposing magnetic fields,
        which creates a stress within the cores of the caduceus
        coils.&nbsp; At the crossover points of each coil, the flux
        collapse is "assisted" by the stress field of the core. The
        stress field, similar to a conventional electric generator,
        oscillates the lattice structure of&nbsp; the copper wire,
        causing movement of electrons. </p>
      <p>Energy "stored" in the stress field is added to the energy of
        the original flux collapse, because it is "pushed" in by the
        opposing energy of the other caduceus coil. That is the effect
        of reversed phasing, as mentioned earlier. While one crossover
        field is collapsing, the corresponding coil is expanding, which
        adds more stress field energy than that which was originally
        "displaced". </p>
      <p>This continues to occur at each crossover point. The
        displacement caused by the "push"&nbsp; results in am imbalance
        in the stress field.&nbsp; As the process reverses, and the
        alternate coil's field&nbsp; collapses,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp;
        aided&nbsp; by the "push" from the expanding field of the first
        coil. The current&nbsp; induced in the second coil is greater
        than the current in the first coil, because the "push" of the
        first coil is composed of its original energy, plus the "push"
        of the first coil. </p>
      <p>This continues to increase the energy at each crossover point,
        yielding far greater energy at the output of the coils than that
        which was used to begin the process. The energy is amplified
        through each winding in a cascade effect. </p>
      <p>Core saturation, normally undesirable in a power transformer,
        is required in the Sweet VTA design. The power attained will
        depend upon the strength of the cores. Power will&nbsp; increase
        until the core is saturated, and no longer able to expand energy
        into the magnetic field. </p>
      <p>Why does the field collapse at each winding? This is at the
        heart of every caduceus coil. When wires are laid over each
        other, a capacitance is formed, and the capacitance cancels the
        inductance of the windings before the crossover point. This
        causes field collapse into the core, and then into the next
        winding. </p>
      <p>A Tesla coil&nbsp; uses the same principle, in that a frequency
        is applied which is resonant at the value of LC, causing the
        series impedance to consist of wire resistance only. </p>
      <p>From this, we can see that the current which is used to excite
        a caduceus coil must also be resonant relative to the length of
        the windings and the amount of crossover capacitance. To
        determine the appropriate frequency, the volume of the core as
        well as a resonating chamber must also be taken into account.
        The core is essentially a resonant cavity, and you need to apply
        a frequency which will cause it to resonate. </p>
      <p>Think of the core as a hollow cylinder, to which you will apply
        a musical note until it resonates. The core density is
        irrelevant to resonance, and applies only when considering
        saturation. Try using an ordinary "tin can", opened on one end,
        and apply acoustic energy until you reach resonance, and hear
        the energy "ringing" back at you. </p>
      <p>Having determined the resonant frequency of the core, then add
        the windings as if they were the holes in a flute, with a
        crossover at&nbsp; each "hole". In other words, even spacing is
        not going to work.&nbsp; Each crossover needs to be preceded by
        a length of wire which is calculated based&nbsp; upon the PHI
        relationship to resonance. </p>
      <p>The caduceus coil has to attain aggregate resonance before it
        can produce an over-unity effect, so each of the seven
        crossovers is a whole note on the diatonic scale. In other
        words, use alternate cube and square roots of PHI (1.618) times
        the length of the previous winding to determine the length of
        the next winding. </p>
      <p>In this way, every winding is both a note as well as a harmonic
        of another winding. </p>
      <p>Both coils of the Sweet VTA must be wound identically, placed
        side by side, and centered in the magnetic stress field. The
        primary for each coil should apply a low level signal at the
        resonant frequency,&nbsp; and the primaries should be 180
        degrees out of&nbsp; phase with each other to aid in the
        expansion and collapse of the flux fields. </p>
      <p>Much has been speculated about the necessity of "tuning" the
        magnets, using various methods which have been known to cause
        the magnets to explode. I don't think that&nbsp; this&nbsp;
        is&nbsp; relevant&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; design.&nbsp; The
        stress field is merely reactive to the electromagnetic energy of
        the coils. However, the size of the magnets and their strength
        is important. </p>
      <p>The size is&nbsp; necessary so as to keep the flux fields
        contained within the stress field, and the strength is a factor
        of the power which is to be derived from the coils. </p>
      <p>Think of the magnetically created stress field as if it were a
        guitar string, first plucked, and then tightened to the
        next&nbsp; higher note. A strong enough "string" will be able to
        "play" the entire octave without "snapping". </p>
      <p>Given these design parameters, the alternate depletion mode can
        be more easily visualized. The primary coil applies the first
        note at the resonant frequency of the core. This is picked up by
        the tuned windings as primary and harmonic frequencies. </p>
      <p>The flux field expands into the alternate coil as well as into
        the stress field. The phase reversal of the second coil "pushes"
        energy from the stress field into the core and windings of the
        first coil, whose&nbsp; flux collapse "pulls" out the field of
        the alternate coil as it is being energized by its primary. </p>
      <p>Each cycle of primary current will increase the potential of
        energy at the outputs of the coils. As one caduceus "inhales"
        the other "exhales", with the addition of stress field energy
        from the opposing magnetic fields. </p>
      <p>This will only happen at resonance, which follows strict
        mathematical rules. The input signal at the primary must be kept
        small to avoid overdriving the VTA,&nbsp; which&nbsp; if&nbsp;
        the core density and magnetic strength are adequate, will cause
        the circuit to lose dimensional stability. </p>
      <p>Gravity IS time IN OUR universe, and as the VTA energies
        cancel&nbsp; the quadrupole effects of&nbsp; particle&nbsp; spin
        energy in the electromagnetic&nbsp; field, the VTA will begin to
        lose relative "weight". </p>
      <p>It becomes caught in its own "warp field", and will start to
        rise. Further power applied at the primary may cause the VTA to
        "leave" our subjective temporal reality, and seem to disappear.
      </p>
      <p>Although it is "lost", it continues to create temporal
        distortions which are detrimental to the dimensional stability
        and therefore to the biological health of persons who are within
        the distortion field. </p>
      <p>With only a&nbsp; rudimentary understanding of the principles
        of electricity and music, virtually anyone can create a
        "time&nbsp; machine" or "anti-g" device in this manner, but the
        costs can be high if the machine loses stability. The universe,
        for its immense and vast amounts of matter and&nbsp; energy,
        is&nbsp; in a delicate balanced state. </p>
      <p>One VTA lost in hyperspace can set up a chain reaction of
        events which will cause the vortical&nbsp; "waves&nbsp; of
        creation" to become unbalanced, resulting in the destruction of
        a galaxy. Locally, we would begin to see this manifesting itself
        in polar&nbsp; instability, as the magnetic energy of&nbsp; the
        earth itself begins to "feed" the VTA. </p>
      <p>To avoid creating&nbsp; this&nbsp; chain&nbsp; reaction of
        events, the primary signal must NOT be a function of secondary
        output power. The amplitude of the primary excitation current
        must be fixed in such a manner as to avoid overdriving the VTA.
