      <p>July 6, 1959 </p>
      <p>Dear Dr Hooper:<a name="hooper1"></a> </p>
      <p>Your telegram was phoned to me just as I was getting ready to
        go on a field trip to determine the electrical conductivity of
        Lake Ontario, so I grabbed a handful of essays, put them in an
        envelope and sent them off to you although I didn’t have time to
        write. I hope there were sufficient copies, if not I have a few
        more and you are welcome to them. You certainly may make of them
        whatever use you can of this material. </p>
      <p>We have rebuilt our machine and are now about to look for some
        of the answers to some questions. This unit has about 14 ceramic
        magnets mounted in a groove cut in a ¼ inch thick 6 inch
        diameter disc. We haven’t yet run it up to full speed as we are
        very cautious after the other exploding. We don’t expect much
        from this machine except maybe answers to a couple of pointed
        questions. </p>
      <p>Our major design effort now is looking towards making a
        magnetic field move without having to move the magnets. It
        should be possible, since we found that the converse was true.
        Also, there are some rules concerning fields, which are not in
        the literature which might be exploited to attain this end. We
        refer in particular to the rule that field s can and will remain
        as separate entities if such arrangement has a lower energy
        level than that of the corresponding field structure. Also, we
        found that magnetic fields move only at right angles to their
        vectorial directions, and in strict correspondence with
        Maxwell’s equations. They refuse stubbornly to move in their
        vectorial direction, and apparent motion in this direction is
        actually a folding in or out of the field, always at right
        angles. </p>
      <p>We have drawn up quite a few designs to make the field move,
        but have discarded most of them either because the present
        technology was inadequate to do the job, or there was too much
        uncertainty as to what actually would be going on. We have one
        design which looks promising, namely notching a circular DC
        field with a (1 - cos O) function which is rotating and
        confining the whole in a shield so that the lower energy level
        is attained if the field structure rotates. We haven’t tried it
        yet, and it will probably fall before we can test this
        principle. However, it looks promising. </p>
      <p>With best regards, <br>
        W.B. Smith </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p>July 21, 1959 </p>
      <p>Dear Dr Hooper,<a name="hooper2"></a> </p>
      <p>I want to thank you for your kind interest in our gravity work,
        and to give you an insight into our current thinking. I am
        enclosing a couple of sketches of our "gubbine" and what we
        think is going on around it. </p>
      <p>We visualize the magnetic field to have somewhat the
        configuration of the red lines, with somewhat more field outside
        of the ring than inside it. There are discontinuities in the
        magnet structure due to the fact that the individual vectors are
        square, but this seems to be an asset rather than a liability as
        it ensures that the field turns with the magnets, since a higher
        energy level will be required to bridge the gap between the [
        magnets ? illegible word] if it did not turn. </p>
      <p>Rotation of the magnet-carrying disc causes the field to
        acquire a velocity throughout its structure, said velocity being
        directly proportional to the radius. The v x b will in all cases
        be at right angles to the velocity and the field vector and will
        be proportional to the magnetic field strength and the velocity.
        We hold that this condition will apply within the magnets and
        outside of them, since the magnetic field exists there also. </p>
      <p>Following the above reasoning, it is apparent that a virtual
        gravitron will form on the outer edge of the magnetic ring and
        another of opposite polarity on the inner edge. The outer
        gravitron will be somewhat stronger than the inner one, and the
        field configuration will be determined by the antecedents of the
        field (magnitude and direction of the magnetic and charge
        fields, reducing the gravitron field). </p>
      <p>However, since the entire structure is immersed in the earth’s
        gravitational field, the antecedents of which may or may not be
        compatible with the locally generated field, two complexes are
        possible, within a field structure or a field aggregate.
        Experiment must give the answer. </p>
      <p>We have considered the use of a conventional gravimeter, but we
        do not think that it would be as good as the precision balance.
        The sensing element in the gravimeter is several inches from the
        bottom of the instrument, and since a table of sorts is
        necessary, it would not be possible to get the sensing element
        within a foot of the magnets. </p>

      <p>November 10, 1959<a name="hooper3"></a> </p>
      <p>Dear Dr Hooper: </p>
      <p>I am very slow in replying to your letter of Oct. 6, but I have
        really been quite busy. I am sorry that I can't seem to explain
        my views on gravitational polarization lucidly, but the trouble
        is probably with me. I shall try to get something worked up to
        send you but I don't quite know where to start. </p>
      <p>Our work here has been progressing slowly because of silly
        little mechanical troubles. We have built 5 commutators to swich
        the currents to produce a rotating field and there has been a
        serious difficulty with each. We are now working on a rolling
        mercury design which looks promising. </p>
      <p>We did try to use the rotating field from the ceramic magnets
        to drag around a field produced by a coil and current, but there
        seems to be a problem with the compatibility of the antecedents
        of the fields, because the limits within which it will spin are
        apparently narrow and we have not yet been able to determine
        their magnitude or the rules governing this action. </p>
      <p>Because of the commutator difficulties we have not yet been
        able to try the big rotating field, but we have it all built and
        if and when we get this last bug licked we should be able to
        look for a few answers... </p>
      <p>Sincerely, <br>
        Wilbert B. Smith </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p>Mr Rideout,<a name="rideout"></a> </p>
      <p>I read your letter of October 23 with appreciation and some
        amusement. It is quite apparent that my comments on time as a
        field function did not ring a bell. I am well aware that
        regarding time as a variable places modern science in the
        untenable position of trying to lift itself by its bootstraps;
        but I can only say that these are not my ideas but originates
        with those to whom our science resembles medieval superstition.
        I do not understand them fully and I have much to learn, but I
        have mastered a few basic principles and of these I am sure. </p>
      <p>Time as a field function is NOT the same function as registered
        by our clocks, which record the changing entropy of a system,
        but is the function which makes this happen. </p>
      <p>There is only ONE reality in our universe, and that is the
        concept of SPIN, and from this derive twelve dimensions. Twelve
        dimensions are necessary and sufficient to express our universe
        in its entirety. </p>
      <p>Dimensions must include, as well as their vector direction, the
        component of reality in that direction for without the reality
        there would be no dimension. </p>
      <p>Dimensions are arranged in four fabrics of three each, linked
        by a "quadrature concept". This is the structure that Relativity
        strives for by introducing the [square root of -2] between the
        space and time axis. </p>
      <p>The concept of force is a fiction which we invented to stultify
        our thinking. It is merely a coverup for our lack of
        understanding of the interaction of reality. </p>
      <p>The foregoing will probably sound most sacreligious to the ears
        of orthodoxy, but I don’t mind in the least if these ideas are
        not immediately subscribed to. Science has a long and lurid
        history of reluctance to accept ideas which subsequently proved
        to be of great value. </p>
      <p>We are progressing quite well in our gravity research, and ran
        our unit for the first time on October 26. The effect was
        measured on a precision chemical balance, when a brass weight
        increased from 24.4623 grams to 24.4628 grams when active
        material ( cubic inch of aluminum) was 10 inches directly under
        the weight. Needless to say we have much yet to do and as soon
        as we have some relationships established we will prepare a
        suitable paper, a copy of which I will send you if you are
        interested. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, don’t be upset about the above unorthodox ideas;
        they either click or don’t click, and I am quite satisfied that
        we will come to them sooner or later. </p>
      <p>Best regards, </p>
      <p>Wilbur B. Smith </p>

      <p>Dear George [Williamson],<a name="williamson"></a> </p>
      <p>I am glad that the coil arrived OK, but I am sorry that I can
        tell you very little about it. All I know is how to build it and
        that it worked. Apparently the hole down the center of the core
        is necessary for its proper functioning, as is an adequate power
        input. It will take a kilowatt comfortably, without heating at
        all, and we know that it will work on 100 watts, but it won’t
        work for us on 30 watts. It just gets hot on the lower power! I
        don’t know what the lower cutoff power is, nor do I know what
        the boys topside told me; "Play with it and learn". </p>
      <p>Don Steadman built a simplified gravimeter which I have
        installed on a solid footing at home. It is quite interesting as
        there have been a couple of time field surges during the last
        month. Also when the Russians let off the Big Blast, there was a
        gravity wave which was so strong that it broke the quartz spring
        in the instrument! If the Yanks set off some bigger ones I fear
        for the consequences. People just don’t know about these things.
        In the words of Jesus, "Father forgive them, for they know not
        what they do"... </p>
      <p>I understand that plans are under way for a number of trips to
        pick up earth people for visits top-side during this coming few
        months. You might check with any of your contacts to see if they
        are involved... </p>
      <p>As ever, </p>
      <p>Wilbur B. Smith </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p>January 2, 1955 </p>
      <p>Dear Mr Middleton,<a name="middleton"></a> </p>
      <p>Many thanks for your Dec. 4 letter... </p>
      <p>In attempting to establish communication with the saucers, I
        can offer very little except to use frequencies which will
        penetrate the ionosphere. We have used the call M4 AFFA at
        frequencies around 20 megacycles. In this business we are all in
        the kindergarten and all I can say is to try anything and
        everything until something works. </p>
      <p>We were told about a system which uses a radio transmitter as
        an energy source but a special antenna converter, which radiates
        doughnut-shaped waves, which are not time functions. We built a
        couple and find they have the most extraordinary properties. If
        you wish you could build a unit and try to establish a circuit
        to our group here in Ottawa. Following are the construction
        instructions. </p>
      <p>One ferrite core, material with the highest permeability and
        dielectric constant, about 8 inches to a foot long, and about 1
        inch in diameter. About 20 feet of plastic insulated #14
        electric house wire. Starting at the center of the wire and at
        one end of the core wind on the wire as closely as possible,
        with the first turn under and then over, so that the winding
        will be exactly symmetrical. It will start at one end of the
        core and finish at the other end and will resemble a solenoid
        with a bifilar winding. It is important that the winding be
        exactly symmetrical. </p>
      <p>When connected to a transmitter, treat it as any normal antenna
        for loading and tuning. There will be a few points of magnetic
        domain resonance which will be lossy but anywhere else the
        device will generate the required waves. It will not matter
        whether or not the antenna converter is shielded as the doughnut
        waves go through anything. The most remarkable property of this
        system is that the waves can be directly MENTALLY... </p>
      <p>Yours truly, </p>
      <p>Wilbur Smith </p>

      <p>...The coil is said to be a single winding of insulated copper
        wire, about #16 or #18 gauge, wound on a ferrite core of 1" to
        1-1/2" diameter, and about 9" long. The coil is caduceus wound,
        that is, one begins the winding in the middle of the wire’s
        length, winding the wire in opposite directions around the core
        and crossing the wires on the same opposite diameter points each
        time around. </p>
      <p>The coil is said to be an energy sink --- that is, current fed
        into it just disappears, causing no radiation, even of heat.
        When operating and placed near a grid dip meter, the coil is
        said to show a large number of resonance points across the
        spectrum from 200 to 2.0 Mc. This coil is further said to have
        zero impedance. Further, two or more coils cannot be coupled
        together. </p>

        <b>( Date &amp; Publication unknown )</b></center>
      <p>...According to the theory of relativity, if I climb into a
        spacecraft and I set out from the earth at a velocity very
        nearly the velocity of light, and I go out to say, Alpha
        Proxima, and then I turn around and comeback, people on earth
        say that I’ve been gone something like 10 years. According to my
        clock, I’ve only been gone a year. </p>
      <p>Now that is a result, apparently, of time dilation in the
        theory of relativity, in that the spacecraft in which I travel
        was moving relative to the earth at a velocity nearly equal to
        the velocity of light. The paradox arises when you consider that
        relative to the spacecraft, the earth was traveling away at
        exactly the same velocity. Therefore, to the people on the
        spacecraft, who are relatively stationary, 10 years should have
        passed, and by the time the earth comes back to them, it should
        have only been away a year. So you can see right away that the
        very premise upon which the theory of relativity is predicated
        --- namely, that if A is relative to B, then B must be relative
        to A --- leads you to an impossible paradox. This paradox is
        resolved completely if you recognize the variable nature of
        time, and as you move round from one part of the Universe to
        another you’ll encounter all sorts of values of time in certain
        given intervals. We become slaves to the clock to the extent
        that we believe that the intervals ticked out by the clock are
        time itself, so we find it very difficult in readjust. Now I
        don’t propose to say any more about this particular aspect, but
        I would like to say something on the subject of the craft
        themselves. </p>
      <p>We asked them how they were supported, and they said they were
        supported on the earth’s gravitational field. Further studies on
        our own, with occasional references to these people from
        elsewhere, and we figured out that we were able to go into the
        laboratory and conduct a series of experiments which proved
        beyond doubt that this is true. </p>
      <p>Our laboratory experiments have allowed us to make about a 1%
        change in the weight of objects --- we can make them about 1%
        heavier or 1% lighter. Now that is a long way from holding a
        spacecraft up, because we have to go over 100% to do that. But
        the fact that we can do it --- the fact that the principles
        which these people from outside gave us and guided us to finding
        out for ourselves are valid --- certainly indicate that, first,
        these people are what they say they are, and, secondly, that
        their technology is that they say it is, that it is superior to
        ours and that ours is inadequate in many respects [Quite a
        lengthy description on the blackboard followed at this point]. </p>
      <p>Now we understand that these bells (Mr Smith is referring to
        the bell-shaped spacecraft said to come from Venus, which have
        been photographed by Adamski and others) operate on this
        principle. Underneath the bells are three things that people
        have referred to as landing gear. They are not landing gear at
        all --- they are spheres within which a charged sphere is
        rotating. It is spinning on magnetic bearings. Magnetic bearing
        is something else the people from outside gave us the design of.
        It is very simple in section, and this is the north pole and
        this is south, and in it they have a thing that looks like this,
        with a south and this is a north [Here obviously Mr Smith is
        again demonstrating on the blackboard]. They are simply ferrite
        bearings permanently magnetized. We built them ourselves and
        checked them in the lab, and they worked perfectly. They are
        very simple things. The spheres carry an electric charge and
        they spin on this type of bearings down inside these big balls.
        We are told that the tilt is simply produced by rotating the
        sphere a little it, which bends the field. The process is much
        more complicated than would appear from what I am telling you,
        but these are the first steps and the end results --- even hough
        there are other steps in between. </p>
      <p>Now one other thing I would like to mention --- as far as I
        know, our group in Ottawa is the only group that has actually
        taken the information which was given to us by the people from
        outside and translated it into hardware that works. Much
        information has been given to us through various channels, but
        people just talk about it. They don’t do anything about it. I
        think that is deplorable. I think that when they give us
        information, the least we can do is to show our good faith by
        trying at least to convert that information into hardware. </p>
      <p>We have built two items of hardware on their instructions,
        which I’m rather proud of. One of these pieces of hardware is a
        coil. It has a ferrite core, and a trick winding on it. To look
        at it, it looks rather like an oddly wound inductor. When
        measured on a radio frequency bridge, however, it shows very
        peculiar properties. There are certain frequencies at which it
        is impossible to balance the RF bridge, and that is a direct
        contradiction to what any electrical engineer will tell you
        should happen with a coil wound on a ferrite core. </p>
      <p>The other item that I’m rather proud of resulted from a series
        of questions that we asked regarding accidental destruction or
        damage to our aircraft by flying into the vicinity of flying
        saucers. And we were informed that, although a few of our
        aircraft had come to an unfortunate end by what they considered
        the colossal stupidity of our pilots in flying into a region
        where the aircraft was bound to get into trouble, they said that
        they are now taking corrective measures and whenever they see
        one of our aircraft about to commit suicide, they just get out
        of the way and give him a wide berth. But I asked, if an
        aircraft was damaged or destroyed, what happened? They said the
        field surrounds the saucers in order to hold them up. In order
        to produce the gravity differentials, time field differentials
        are necessary to operate the ships. These sometimes produced
        field combinations which reduced the strength of materials to
        the point where they were no longer strong enough to carry the
        loads that the materials were expected to carry. Now as we know,
        aircraft --- particularly the military type aircraft --- are
        built with a rather small factor of safety, and if they fly into
        a region of reduced binding, the material is no longer strong
        enough to carry the load, and the craft simply comes apart. </p>
      <p>Now we asked a series of questions about --- was it possible
        for our craft to detect these regions so that we would not fly
        into them, and they said that it certainly was, and they would
        do this very thing. They also told us that we ourselves were
        creating regions which were much more dangerous than the regions
        they established in their vicinity, because we could detect the
        presence of their craft and give them a wide berth, but we could
        not detect without instruments the presence of these vortices
        which we ourselves had produced. They gave us the design of the
        instrument (See Flying Saucer Review, march-April 1951) which
        was fundamentally this --- they said to select two materials,
        one stronger than the other, and to arrange so that these
        material pulled against each other in such a manner that the
        weaker material was very near its breaking point, and the strong
        material was a long way from its breaking point. On that basis
        we devised instruments, and we built a number of them in the
        shop and sent them around to various people that we know did
        quite a lot of traveling. We asked them if they would
        investigate the regions the regions through which aircraft must
        have passed just prior to breaking up in mid-air, and we have
        unfortunately large reports of our airplanes having done just
        this. </p>
      <p>One of these unexplained crashes occurred at a place called
        Esandon, which is about 20 miles southwest of Quebec City. We
        investigated the region through which this BOAC aircraft must
        have passed just prior to its crash, and sure enough, --- big as
        life and twice as natural --- we found a very large and very
        strong vortex. Our instruments showed it beyond a doubt. It was
        about a thousand feet in diameter and roughly circular, with a
        rather sharp line of demarcation at the edge of it. </p>
      <p>You will recall also that about two or three years ago,
        possibly a little longer, a jet aircraft crashed into a nunnery
        at Orleans, just out from Ottawa, killed a number of people and
        did a great deal of damage. In fact, the jet engine was finally
        dug out of the ground about 30 feet below the foundations of
        this convent. Once again we found a very strong vortex of
        reduced binding. We had a number of reports come in from people
        in the field who found exactly the same thing. I wrote a very
        stiff <b><a href="magnet.htm" ">memorandum</a></b>
        to the appropriate people in my own department, pointing out
        some of these facts. I did not state where we got the
        information, but simply stated that we had instruments which
        showed the existence of these regions of reduced binding, and
        suggested that something be done about. The letter wound up in
        the "crank" file. I’m afraid that is the fate of most of these
        things --- they wind up in the "crank" file. However, that does
        not in any way change the fact that these regions of reduced
        binding exist. People from outside told us that they existed,
        they gave us the design of instruments, we built the instruments
        and we have confirmed the fact. </p>
      <p>Question: Could you explain why they have curtailed the
        explosions of nuclear bombs? </p>
      <p>I can only guess at why the nuclear explosions have been
        curtailed. I saw a picture which I know was never released to
        the public, showing a very large explosion in the Bikini series.
        This picture showed the enormous fireball which I think must
        have been well over a hundred miles in diameter, and shooting
        out from it were what looked like solar prominences --- in other
        words, they were great tongues of activity of some kind. Now
        these tongues looked to me, from the scale of this picture, to
        be around 25-50 miles. They were quite comparable in size to the
        fireball. Now, my guess is that these tongues or prominences
        were in fact chain reactions...&nbsp; [&amp;c...] </p>

      The other item that I’m rather proud of resulted from a series of
      questions that we asked regarding accidental destruction or damage
      to our aircraft by flying into the vicinity of a flying saucer. We
      were informed that although a few of our aircraft had come to an
      unfortunate end by what they considered the colossal stupidity of
      our pilots for flying into a region where the aircraft was bound
      to get into trouble, they said that they are now taking corrective
      measures, and whenever they see one of our aircraft about to
      commit suicide, they just get out of the way and give him a wide
      berth. I asked them what happened, and they said, well, there are
      fields around the saucers in order to hold them up, in order to
      produce the gravity differential, the time field differentials,
      which were necessary to operate the ships. These sometimes
      produced field combinations which reduced the strength of
      materials to the point where they were no longer strong enough to
      carry the loads that the materials were expected to carry. Now as
      we know, aircraft, particularly the military type aircraft, are
      built with a rather small factor of safety, and if they fly into a
      region of reduced binding, the materials are no longer strong
      enough to carry the load and the craft simply comes apart.
      <p>We asked a series of questions about whether it were possible
        for our craft to detect these regions so that we would not fly
        into them, and they said it certainly was and they would give us
        the design of an instrument which would do this very thing. They
        told us also that we, ourselves, were creating regions which
        were much more dangerous than the regions which they established
        because we could detect the presence of their craft and give
        them a wide berth, but we could not detect without instruments
        the presence of these vortices which we ourselves have produced.
        They gave us the design of the instrument which was
        fundamentally this: they said to select two materials, one
        stronger than the other, and they said to arrange so that these
        two materials pull against each other in such a manner that the
        weaker material was very near its breaking point and the strong
        material was a long way from its breaking point. On that basis,
        we devised an instrument and we built quite a number of them and
        sent them around to various people that we knew did quite a bit
        of traveling. We asked them if they would investigate the
        regions through which aircraft must have passed just prior to
        breaking up in mid-air. We have, unfortunately, a large record
        of our aeroplanes having done just this. </p>
      <p>One of these unexplained crashes occurred at a place called
        Issoudon which is about 20 miles south and west of Quebec City,
        and we investigated the region through which this BOAC aircraft
        must have passed just prior to the crash. Sure enough, big as
        life and twice as natural, we found a very large and very strong
        vortex. Our instruments showed it beyond a doubt. It was about a
        thousand feet in diameter and roughly circular with a rather
        sharp line of demarcation at the edge of it. </p>
      <p>You will recall also that about two years, three years ago,
        possibly a little longer, a jet aircraft crashed into a nunnery
        at Orleans, just out from Ottawa. It killed a number of people
        and did a great deal of damage. The jet engine itself was
        finally dug out of the subsoil about 30 feet below the
        foundation of the convent. We investigated that one — again we
        found a very strong vortex of reduced binding. We had a number
        of reports come in from people in the field who found exactly
        the same thing. I wrote a very stiff memorandum to the
        appropriate people in my own department pointing out some of
        these facts. I did not state where we got the information. We
        told them we had instruments which showed the existence of these
        regions of reduced binding, and suggested that something be done
        about it. The letter wound up on the crank file. I’m afraid that
        is the fate of most of these things, they wind up on the crank
        file. However, that does not in any way change the fact that
        these regions of reduced binding exist. People topside told us
        they existed, they gave us the design of instruments, we built
        the instruments, we have confirmed the facts. </p>
      <p>There’s one other little point that I would like to make in
        connection with these regions of reduced binding. That is, that
        the people from elsewhere told us that we make them when we set
        off a nuclear explosion. We make two of them. We make one of
        them in the vicinity of the nuclear explosion and one on the
        opposite side of the planet. Any of you who have ever seen
        pictures or facsimiles of a nuclear explosion have probably
        noticed that there is a column which is approximately uniform in
        diameter extending upwards from the region of the explosion, and
        that is capped by a big mushroom-shaped cloud. That shape, that
        fact itself should have been sufficient warning to us that we
        were producing a very serious gravitational disturbance. I’ll
        show you what happens. (Draws on board.) That circle represents
        the earth. Out from the earth there is emanating, for the sake
        of simplicity, lets call it a gravitational field. We have a
        nuclear explosion take place at some point. A nuclear explosion
        means that there is a sudden change of matter to energy. In
        other words, we have a dMdT (mass-loss rate - Ed.) which is
        large, very much greater than unity. Now it is not difficult to
        show that if you have such a disturbance occurring in a
        gravitational field, there will be projected outwards a gravity
        wave which will be projected in the direction of the gravity
        field and with a velocity which is inversely proportional to the
        strength of the gravitational field. Therefore, if the explosion
        itself, if the conversion of mass to energy, lasts over a period
        of time which would permit the expanding material to move out
        say, a hundred feet this way and a hundred feet this way, we
        would have a region 200 feet in diameter in which mass was being
        converted to energy and which would be a virtual source of a
        gravity wave that would travel straight up, thereby producing
        the column that we see supporting the mushroom cloud. What we
        don’t see is that penetrating downwards through the centre of
        the planet there is a similar gravity wave which comes to a
        focal point down here. And in this region, from approximately
        here on down, we have approximately the same mass all the way
        around so that the gravitational field in here is very low. So
        the velocity becomes very high and flares out this way, so that
        it comes out on the far side of the earth as a diverging cone.
        Now these things don’t go away. We literally punch a hole in the
        field structure of the earth; we punch a little round
        cylindrical hole on this side and a big conical-shaped hole on
        the other side. They stay there for a long time. They’re
        vortices and it takes them quite a while to dissipate. We don’t
        know how long, but we have gone back to places such as Issoudon
        three months later, and we have found that the vortex has gone.
        Now maybe it has moved away, we believe that that is what
        happens because we actually caught one of them moving, or maybe
        it dissipates, or maybe both. But we did find one out over the
        North Atlantic that drifted, that was picked up first by a
        friend of mine who is an RCAF pilot who had the instrument with
        him. They located it on a reconnaissance flight just to the
        south and west of Iceland, and then again on a flight out about
        a week later. It was about half way between Iceland and
        Newfoundland and considerably weaker. At least that is the
        impression they got from the instrument indication. So
        apparently they do move around and I presume they do fade out.
        We haven’t, incidentally, located any in the last year or so, I
        presume because we have not been exploding any bombs lately. </p>
      <p>We believe that, as long as the elastic limit of the material
        is not overstressed, the effect is temporary, but if it is
        overstressed, the effect is permanent. Now we found a very
        peculiar thing. Things in the northern latitudes generally
        appear to be somewhat stronger than they are in the southern
        latitudes. We have one instrument which we took from The Pas,
        Manitoba, through Ottawa, Washington, D.C., and out to Oklahoma
        City. And since none of our instruments are calibrated in any
        kind of an absolute unit, simply because we don’t know how to
        calibrate them in absolute units, they are merely scale
        indications. The scale goes around to 10. And we set them
        ordinarily about mid-scale, somewhere around five or six. At The
        Pas, it went up to about 7 ½, assuming it was set at 5. When it
        got down to Oklahoma City it was down to 2. And when we took it
        back to Ottawa it came back to the 5. We had set it at 5 in
        Ottawa. Now that meant that there was not a permanent set in the
        nylon fiber, which was the weaker of the two opposing pulls.
        However, every time we take one of these instruments into
        Toronto, we find that it promptly goes from 5 down to 2. We have
        actually had several of the nylon fibers break when we've taken
        the instruments to Toronto. We came to the conclusion that
        Toronto was maybe good all right but it wasn’t very strong
        (laughter). Incidentally, they have had an abnormal number of
        structural steel failures in Toronto when buildings have been
        undergoing construction. The steel has given way, bolts have
        given way. We believe that this is maybe a semi-permanent
        condition for Toronto because we find that we encounter it just
        as we hit the outskirts of the city, and as we proceed through
        the city and towards Hamilton, we lose it again about Port
        Credit. So this is a very large region and it seems to be
        permanent. I know it's been there for the four or five years now
        that we've been investigating. </p>

      <h3>( Verbatim extracts from the Smith archive )</h3>
      I am very disturbed by the current series of nuclear tests because
      sooner or later energies will be reached which can initiate the
      Vril reaction, which is the driving together of positive and
      negative charges to the anihilation of both. An electron driven
      into a proton will produce an overloaded neutron which will
      shatter into a long series of violently unstable mesons, until the
      whole is converted into energy, the majority of the quanta of
      which are more than sufficient to drive more electrons into
      protons, and so on. Furthermore,we do not know at what point the
      reaction will spread to matter other than hydrogen. Maldek.
      <p>You ask me why there is no official story about the reality of
        saucers. I think it is a combination of circumstances, the most
        important one being that it is not in the present sequence that
        we should be told. The present order with its distributed
        responsibility does not lend itself to readjustment in thinking
        or action, and any change must start at the bottom and work its
        way up. </p>
      <p>Apparently, there are quite a few groups of space people
        operating in the vicinity of this planet, and while they have
        knowledge of each other they do not engage in extensive
        interchange of ideas. Some of them are working for the benefit
        of the human race, others to fulfil a "plan", and still others
        are merely "tourists". Something drastic is due to happen here
        shortly and I suppose it is natural that people would flock here
        to observe it. </p>
      <p>I believe that there is something going to happen in the not
        too distant future and I am trying to figure it all out from the
        rather sketchy data which I have been able to gather. </p>
      <p>Apparently, the time for us is very short and there are several
        groups who have an interest in the outcome. Most of them are
        friendly, but there is at least one bad lot who are bent on
        exploitation. </p>
      <p>From the best information I can gather the space people are
        planning big events which should materialize shortly. I am not
        too clear on what they are up to and I would sure like to find
        out. </p>
      <p>Something is about to happen which will be quite serious for
        the human race of the earth, and probably will have serious
        repercussions throughout the solar system. The space people
        intend to minimize the damage and ensure that our race does not
        perish. That we are rather primitive compared with other races,
        and under normal circumstances would be left to our own devices
        to grow up as best we could, but because of some impending
        crisis, they must now interfere in our affairs, but they intend
        to keep such interference to an absolute minimum. </p>
      <p>There is one factor regarding saucers which Bender and several
        others knew, and which may not be stated at this present time,
        and extreme action may be taken to prevent such disclosure.
        Enough said. (Ed. - This is probably a reference to Albert
        Bender who was the first to be silenced by the so-called "men in
        black".) </p>
      <p>There are many earth people who have each been entrusted with a
        portion of the new knowledge, but until certain events have
        taken place this information may not be assembled into the
        whole. </p>
      <p>I suppose you know about the anticipated sunspot maximum? A
        statement was issued by Dr. Van der Pol of the C.C.I.R. in which
        he predicted, based on observations to date that there would be
        an unprecedented sunspot activity this year and next. ... I
        presume your friends have already told you much of this,
        although one group with which I have had contact is specially
        interested in this aspect. </p>
      <p>I noticed several places in Dick Miller's story where words
        have rather obviously been carelessly used. Of course, I do not
        know where in the circuit the distortion entered but I strongly
        suspect the space people in their use of an alien means of
        communication. I refer particularly to the reference to cosmic
        rays. I do not think that was what was meant at all, but that
        the earth is moving into a region where strong electric,
        magnetic and time fields exist. A purely secondary consequence
        would be an apparent increase in cosmic ray count. </p>
      <p>Affa tells us that many things are due to happen in the not too
        distant future, and a lot of them none too pleasant. </p>

        <h2>Gravity Control Apparatus</h2>
      </center>
      The following photos taken by Wilbert Smith shows the construction
      of an experimental apparatus for demonstrating weight changes due
      to rotating magnetic fields. Click on the images to show a larger
      version.
      <p><b>Figure 1:</b> This photo shows clearly an overlapping
        structure of the magnets around the circumference of the rotor.
        We know that the rotor is six inches in diameter, so we can
        estimate the size of the magnet wafers. Unfortunately, we do not
        have information on how the magnet poles are oriented. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 2:</b> This photo shows the connection to the motor
        driving the rotor. The red disk-shaped object on the ground
        might have been used to cover the rotor, perhaps for safety
        and/or to hold an object to be levitated. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 3: </b>This photo shows the precision balance scale
        supporting an object suspended above the rotor. Note that the
        indicator is calibrated to its center position. The implication
        is that the rotor is not spinning. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 4:</b> Here we see the same scale and suspended
        object, but with the indicator deflected to one side. The scale
        deviation implies that the rotor is spinning, thus causing a
        weight change. Note that the suspended mass appears to be inside
        a glass tube to prevent air currents from affecting the
        measurement. </p>
