          <p><b><font size="+1">Newman's Gyroscopic Theory</font></b></p>
        </center>
        <p>The theoretical basis of Joe Newmans' Revolutionary Energy
          Machine challenges many accepted laws of physics. </p>
        <p>The starting point for understanding Newman's ideas is his
          assertion that the fundamental building block of all matter is
          the gyroscopic particle, an infinitesimal unit of matter that
          spins like a gyroscope. </p>
        <p>Newman claims that the mechanics of magnetism and
          electricity, which have never been fully explained, can be
          described in terms of how gyroscopic particles react and
          interact. </p>
        <p>The idea that a single type of particle is responsible for
          the forces at work in the universe is an old one, yet some of
          the latest research in physics involves the investigation of
          particles. </p>
        <p>New and smaller particles with previously unknown properties
          are being discovered on a regular basis. </p>
        <p>Newman's theories also depend heavily on the idea that all
          matter is concentrated energy, which can be released if one
          has a mechanism for unlocking it. </p>
        <p>That notion is at the heart of Einstein's work and the
          equation E = mc^2, then the argument that he is trying to
          patent a perpetual motion machine has no merit. </p>
        <p>Theoretically, Newman's machine could run indefinitely, but
          --- according to him --- not because it is CREATING energy to
          run itself, but because it is converting matter to energy. </p>
        <p>In radically oversimplified terms, this is what happens when
          Joe Newman throws the switch on the Revolutionary Energy
          Machine: </p>
        <p>1) An electrical current is sent through a long (miles long)
          coil of copper wire, magnetizing it and creating a strong
          magnetic field. </p>
        <p>2) Newman describes the mechanics of the magnetic field as
          "shells of force" composed of gyroscopic particles that move
          in a spiral pattern around the wire. <br>
          Originally IN the wire, the particles expand outward and thus
          create the magnetic field. </p>
        <p>3) When the particles form a magnetic field, Newman says,
          they are traveling at the speed of light in two directions ---
          in the spiral pattern around the wire, and in their own normal
          gyroscopic spin. </p>
        <p>This gives him the right side of the E = mc^2 equation; the
          particles (mass) multiplied by the speed of light squared. </p>
        <p>4) The machine operates in pulses; that is, the electrical
          current is continually turned on and off. This causes the
          magnetic field --- in other words, the gyroscopic particles
          --- to expand and collapse. </p>
        <p>5) When the trillions of gyroscopic particles that have been
          released collapse back into the wire, some of them collide
          with other gyroscopic particles. </p>
        <p>Because of the nature of the gyroscopic spin, the collisions
          cause the loose particles to bounce off at right angles; those
          particles emerge at one end of the wire as electrical energy.

        <p>LUCEDALE, Miss. - In the piney woods southwest of this
          southwest Mississippi town, off the broken blacktop and two
          miles down a rutted sand and dirt road, through three gates,
          past the "Keep Out" and "Beware of the Dogs" signs, smack in
          the middle of nowhere, sits Joseph Westley Newman, a man who
          says he can change the world. </p>
        <p>In this land where heat devils beat from the ground in waves,
          Newman says he can bring water to the desert places of the
          world, eliminate poverty, and improve the quality of
          everyone's life. If only Newman's enemies will let him. Newman
          does not look the part of a savior. He sports hair waved
          across his head in the style of a Baptist deacon. </p>
        <p>In the heat Newman is calm, cool and certain. He carries a
          gaze direct as a laser. He says, "What I have done will
          revolutionize the world." What has Joe Newman done? </p>
        <p>He has built the Revolutionary Energy Machine. His
          government, Newman's proclaimed enemy, says his machines are
          frauds. Not so, says Newman. Instead they are the bootstraps
          by which mankind can pull itself up. Across the tidy,
          tile-floored workshop from Newman sits a copper-sheathed
          canister the height and diameter of a fire hydrant. </p>
        <p>At the far end of the workshop, swaddled in miles of copper
          wire, is another machine, a 9,000-pound version the size of a
          five-person hot tub, its circular rim topped with a circle of
          light bulbs. </p>
        <p>These are two of Newman's Revolutionary Energy Machines,
          which he knows will free the world from drudgery and make the
          First, Second, and Third World as one. </p>
        <p>It is these machines and others like them, using Newman's
          same revolutionary theory, that Newman claims produce more
          energy than they consume. That would allow men to light cities
          for pennies, power cars without pollution or gasoline, drive
          machines to make salt water fresh. But it is his own
          government, represented by the National Bureau of Standards
          and the U.S. Patent Office, that Newman says is his and
          mankind's foe. </p>
        <p>It is his own government that Newman claims has waged a
          seven-year war to keep his invention from improving the world.
          "All I am doing is opening doors," Newman says. </p>
        <p>The government, through its unwillingness to grant him a
          patent, says Newman's machine, which he has invested about
          $700,000 in developing and defending, does not do what he
          claims. </p>
        <p>"The NBS results show that the device behaves in a manner
          which is entirely consistent with the well-established laws of
          physics," says the report, released June 26. </p>
        <p>The "well-established" laws of physics say a machine cannot
          put out more energy than it consumes. </p>
        <p><b>Government report `a mockery of justice' ---</b> </p>
        <p>Newman says he knew what the NBS report would show. As a
          matter of fact, so certain was Newman that he issued a press
          release before the report became public saying it was a
          "mockery of justice." </p>
        <p>The inventor says he is certain his machine works, can
          demonstrate that it works, and is willing to defend his
          machine in public debate against anyone from the NBS or the
          U.S. Patent Office or any university or anyone who claims to
          know what he is talking about. </p>
        <p>Newman has taken his Revolutionary Energy Machine on the
          road, demonstrating it in the Louisiana Superdome and in
          Atlanta. </p>
        <p>In each place he challenged an expert on physics to debate
          his theories in public. Nobody showed up. Newman, who was
          raised in Mobile, dropped out of high school and left home at
          15, went in the armed services, roughnecked in the oil fields,
          got a degree in accounting and economics, and decided - in his
          early 20s, after casting around through several jobs - that he
          wanted to be an inventor. </p>
        <p>Over the course of the next two decades he registered patents
          for several inventions --- a machine to pick oranges, plastic
          barbells, a new type of knife --- and pursued his self-taught
          odyssey into electromagnetics. </p>
        <p>Etched in the concrete of Newman's workshop walkway is
          "Question + Thinking = Truth." Newman says that because he is
          not burdened by conventional teachings, his mind is free to
          challenge questions without the constraints conventional
          physicists place on themselves. Newman already has won over a
          number of physicists, electrical <br>
          engineers and chemists who have seen his Revolutionary Energy
          Machine and heard his explanation. </p>
        <p>Dr. Roger Hastings, a physicist with Sperry-Univac Corp., has
          conducted hundreds of tests on Newman's machine. His opinion?
          "The future of the human race may be drastically uplifted by
          the large-scale commercial development of this invention," he
          says. </p>
        <p>And Nicholaos Tsoupas, a physicist who works at Brookhaven
          Laboratory in New York and once taught at Yale University,
          said, "I know for a fact that many scientists consider his
          invention unorthodox and unacceptable, possibly because his
          theories do not fully comport with today's university
          teachings. </p>
        <p>However, Mr. Newman has demonstrated that his invention works
          the way it claims. The Patent Office should not have denied
          him a patent." But the Patent Office did. </p>
        <p>Newman applied for a patent for his machine March 22, 1979.
          In January 1982 the Patent Office denied him the patent,
          claiming his invention "smacked of perpetual motion." Newman
          appealed the ruling and in 1983 filed suit against the Patent
          Office. </p>
        <p>Federal District Judge Thomas Jackson, who was hearing the
          case, appointed a special master to evaluate Newman's machine.
          The special master, William Schuyler Jr., a former
          commissioner of the U.S. Patent Office, concluded that the
          machine did what Newman claimed and recommended that a patent
          be granted. </p>
        <p>Jackson, in an action that many people familiar with similar
          patent cases claim was almost unheard of, refused to accept
          the recommendation of Schuyler and sent the issue back to the
          Patent Office for more study. </p>
        <p>In October 1985, Jackson ordered Newman to turn his machine
          over to the NBS for testing. Jackson's order also prevented
          Newman or any of his representatives from attending the tests.
          But when the 30-day period passed and the machine had not been
          tested, Newman's attorney, John Flannery, attempted to
          retrieve the machine. Jackson ordered it impounded. </p>
        <p>After finally testing it, the Patent Office on June 26 issued
          a report claiming that the machine does not do what Newman
          says it will. "The Bureau of Standards is coming into this
          tainted," Newman says, noting that he still has not recovered
          the machine the NBS has had since 1985. "I have spent 21 years
          working on this machine and seven trying to get it patented. I
          am devoted to this." </p>
        <p>Why give away a billion-dollar theory? </p>
        <p>So devoted is he that he has written a book outlining the
          secret of his machine. The red-covered, hard-bound book is
          titled in gold: "Joseph Newman's Revolutionary Energy
          Machine." </p>
        <p>Inside, the pages are packed with diagrams, equations,
          theories and philosophies on the power of electromagnetics.
          "Anyone with any knowledge of electromagnetic energy can read
          this book and build a machine," Newman says. </p>
        <p>They also can study Newman's theories about how the weather
          can be controlled by directing electromagnetic energy and how
          Newman believes the present educational system trains
          originality out of children. </p>
        <p>Why would someone develop a theory that he claims will change
          the world, a theory worth billions of dollars, and then give
          it away in a book? "Because the technical process is 10,000
          times more important than the machine itself," Newman says. </p>
        <p>He points to his head. "If I keep the knowledge up here, what
          will happen to it if something happens to me? If you
          understand the technical process, then you don't just copy
          what I have done, you can apply it in many different ways." </p>
        <p>Newman's machine, if it works, truly could change the face of
          the world. Energy would be dirt cheap and non-centralized.
          Multinational oil cartels would be restructured or collapse.
          Utility companies that have invested billions in nuclear
          energy would see the plants as costly millstones, dragging
          them into bankruptcy. </p>
        <p>Great stockpiles of coal, as well as the companies that mine
          it, would lie almost useless. So it is little wonder that
          Newman, who says he has gotten mysterious, anonymous
          threatening telephone calls lately, thinks there is a
          tremendous conspiracy, worldwide in scope, to prevent his
          invention from coming into widespread usage. </p>
        <p>"My machine is a threat in terms of changing the financial
          structure and the power structure of the world," he says
          calmly. "I believe this conspiracy goes all the way to the
          president." </p>
        <p>Newman has written every president since Lyndon Johnson
          stating that this new energy technology was on the horizon.
          Most of his letters went unanswered, presumably ignored. </p>
        <p>However, in 1983 Newman sent Reagan a package of material
          about his machine. In a letter he asked the administration's
          help "for the people of the world." </p>
        <p>Included in the package was a videotape of the machine that
          had aired on a New Orleans television news show. Newman got
          the package back with a form letter indicating that it had not
          been opened. </p>
        <p>But when he opened the package to file the material, Newman
          found something he had not included. "There was a video review
          sheet from an office in the White House," Newman says, showing
          the sheet. "It indicated that not only had the package been
          looked at, but it had been looked at rather closely." </p>
        <p>The review sheet states, among other things: "Some scientists
          believe this invention could change the world." </p>
        <p>"When I called to find out what the review sheet was all
          about, the fellow at the White House was furious that I had
          seen it," Newman says. "They wanted to know how I had gotten
          hold of a copy of that sheet." </p>
        <p>A White House spokesman said hundreds of videos are received
          by the White House annually and that many of them are reviewed
          by volunteers. </p>
        <p>"What is on the review sheet is not the opinion of anyone on
          the White House staff," the spokesman said. "It is merely a
          review of whatever is on the tape." </p>
        <p><b>`People are trained not to accept change' ---</b> </p>
        <p>But Newman is sure that a conspiracy exists. He leans back in
          a chair in his workshop and ruminates. "It's strange that they
          are capping all these oil wells now," he says. "The reasons
          they are giving, the dropping prices and such, are the same
          ones you've heard for three, four years. I don't see one
          factual piece of evidence for this to be happening. </p>
        <p>"I'll bet in the last two years, if you could find out who's
          buying the copper mines, who's buying material for magnets. .
          . I'd bet you anything that when the wash is out, the oil
          companies have bought them." </p>
        <p>Newman says his machine is not a perpetual motion machine and
          that it does not create energy, two claims that have hurt its
          image. </p>
        <p>Instead, it is a new way of tapping the electromagnetic
          energy field that is already there. Very simply put, the
          machine works like this: </p>
        <p>Power is used to rotate two magnets wrapped in copper wire. </p>
        <p>The rotating magnets and the atoms that align within the
          copper wire create an electromagnetic field that can be
          tapped. </p>
        <p>The revolutionary aspect of the machine is that the amount of
          energy needed to align the atoms and rotate the magnets
          creating the energy field is less than the energy created. So
          there is a net gain in power created. </p>
        <p>Theoretically, with Newman's technology you could produce an
          unlimited, self-perpetuating source of pollution-free energy.
        </p>
        <p>"I expect to have one of these machines running a car within
          six months," Newman says matter-of-factly. The fight for a
          patent for the Revolutionary Energy Machine has become more
          than a fight to get an invention patented. </p>
        <p>Newman says the battle with the government has given him a
          new insight into the way people are taught to think in this
          country. </p>
        <p>The battle has defined for Newman a philosophy. "People have
          been trained, are being trained, not to accept change," he
          says. "My powers of reason are greater than many people's
          because my feet are not bound by traditional thought. </p>
        <p>Newman sits back and looks out the window of his workshop,
          past his Revolutionary Energy Machine, out into the pine
          trees. "To be a good scientist, you have to be a humble
          person. You have to believe that you don't know everything,"
          he says. </p>

        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government engineers say a backwoods
          inventor's amazing energy machine has a number of unique
          features but lacks a critical one -- it doesn't work. </p>
        <p>The National Bureau of Standards said Thursday that more than
          two months of court-ordered testing has failed to prove Joseph
          W. Newman's claims that his controversial machine produces
          more energy than it consumes. </p>
        <p>"At all conditions tested, the input power exceeded the
          output power," the government's standards-setting agency said
          in a report. "That is, the device did not deliver more energy
          than it used." </p>
        <p>Newman, who terms himself a self-educated, backwoods inventor
          from Lucedale, Miss., who used common sense to come up with
          his machine, immediately rejected the test results as biased
          and meaningless. </p>
        <p>The agency by its own admission used unconventional
          instruments and methods to reach its conclusions, said Newman,
          whose quest for a government patent has attracted national
          attention. </p>
        <p>"I do not accept these results at all," Newman said in a
          telephone interview. "I predicted this decision. It's just
          another example of the injustice I'm fighting against." </p>
        <p>The bureau's report said that because of unusual electrical
          characteristics of the machine, it had to design a test plan
          and combination of instruments specifically for Newman's
          non-standard device. But it said it carefully checked the
          instruments to assure the accuracy of the tests. </p>
        <p>Newman said he would not accept results coming from
          unconventional testing that could not be repeated by others. </p>
        <p>"If I built my own test equipment and said that it proves my
          machine worked, no one would give me much credit, no one would
          believe me," Newman said. "But that's what the Bureau of
          Standards has done and they expect people to believe them." </p>
        <p>The inventor has been trying for six years to get the U.S.
          Office of Patents and Trademarks to issue a patent on an
          energy machine that defies accepted laws of physics. </p>
        <p>Patent examiners say the invention looks like yet another
          proposal for a perpetual motion machine, one that would
          produce more energy than it uses so that, theoretically, it
          could run forever. </p>
        <p>This has been the goal of inventors for centuries, but
          conventional science says it is impossible. </p>
        <p>Newman contends his device is not a perpetual motion machine,
          but a revolutionary energy source that uses the previously
          unknown magnetic properties of copper coils to release more
          energy than it consumes. </p>
        <p>U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Jackson, presiding over
          Newman's suit against the patent office, ordered a new trial
          date after getting results of the tests he ordered from the
          bureau. </p>
        <p>John P. Flannery, Newman's lawyer, said Jackson set Dec. 8 as
          the date for a non-jury trial to determine if the inventor
          will be awarded the patent. </p>
        <p>Flannery said he asked the judge to permit Newman to examine
          the special equipment used to test the energy machine, but
          that Jackson refused to order it. If the Patent Office does
          not allow examination of the test devices, Flannery said, he
          would seek another court order to do so. </p>
        <p>The Bureau of Standards said that during the testing, it
          found that Newman's device "behaves in a manner which is
          entirely consistent with well-established laws of physics." </p>
        <p>A device would be called 100 percent energy efficient if it
          simply transmitted all the energy coming into it back to the
          outside, the report said, and it would have to show an
          efficiency of greater than 100 percent to make more power than
          it consumed. </p>
        <p>The bureau said the efficiency of Newman's machine ranged
          between 27 percent and 67 percent, depending upon the test
          being run. </p>
        <p>Never did the energy coming out of the machine exceed the
          battery power going into the device to get it running, the
          report said. </p>

        <p>This document is intended to provide information regarding
          the energy device invented by Mr. Joseph Newman of Lucedale,
          Mississippi. I have prepared the material in response to
          numerous requests for information. The number of these
          requests has increased dramatically since Newman's public
          demonstration of his motor at Washington, D.C., in May, 1985.
          This paper provides a personal history to date of my
          involvement with Newman, presents data which was taken at the
          Washington demonstration, provides an analysis of the data,
          and presents my current thoughts regarding a mathmatical
          description of Newman's motor. </p>
        <p>HISTORY </p>
        <p>I first met Mr. Newman in September, 1981. Newman is an
          inventor, and he had travelled to Minnesota to present a toy
          invention to Tonka Toys Corp. My brother, John, was at the
          time in charge of new products for Tonka, and he interviewed
          Newman. John and Joe wound up discussing their respective
          theories of matter and energy, and Joe's motor. At that time,
          Joe was looking for people to verify the operation of his
          motor for the patent office. He invited John to Lucedale, but
          John said that his brother (me) had a Ph.D. in physics, and
          therefore better credentials to offer for the testing of a
          motor. </p>
        <p>My first reaction to the news of Newman's energy producing
          motor was quite negative. I had been a professor for four
          years, and had encountered several people with "world saving"
          energy devices which they wanted evaluated by the University.
          In all cases such devices had proven to be inoperative as net
          energy producers. Newman offered to fly me to Lucedale to test
          his motor, and I responded that he would be wasting his money
          and our time because I would certainly prove him wrong. He
          insisted, and I complied. </p>
        <p>The motor that I saw on that first visit was a monument to
          Rube Goldberg, and to an incredible personal effort at
          building such a large device. It consisted of five thousand
          pounds of #5 gauge wire wound as a solenoid. Within the
          solenoid, a 600 pound ceramic magnet rotated on questionable
          bearings. The bearings were mounted in a wooden structure. On
          the shaft of the rotor was a mechanical commutator consisting
          of three home made wheels, and brushes whose tension was
          adjusted with rubber bands. The commutator received its power
          from a bank of six volt lantern batteries. As the huge magnet
          rotated, the whole structure creaked and groaned. At that
          time, Newman was taking energy output from a secondary coil
          wrapped around the motor primary solenoid. I measured the
          voltage and current input simultaneously on an oscilloscope.
          The output load was a resistor, and I similarly measured the
          output voltage and current. Multiplying voltage and current to
          find power, I determined that the motor was about 90%
          efficient. </p>
        <p>Newman claimed that his motor was not performing up to par on
          that day, and said that he would ask me back when he had the
          device tuned up properly. Although I had proven that the motor
          at that time was not producing a net energy gain, several
          aspects of Newman and his motor were fascinating. First, the
          motor was not designed efficiently. Large mechanical losses
          were evident, and a 90% efficiency seemed highly unusual.
          Second, the huge magnet was rotating at some 60 RPM with an
          input power of only a few watts. Finally, Newman himself,
          while unconventional, seemed highly intelligent, definately a
          creative thinker, and intensely dedicated to his scientific
          work. He informed me that he had evolved his theory and filed
          for a patent before he had built a prototype motor. (I will
          discuss his theory later.) </p>
        <p>I travelled again to Lucedale and indeed Newman had tuned up
          his motor. From that point foreward I consistantly measured
          efficiencies in excess of 100%. At this point I began an
          effort to attract scientific interest in Newman's motor, and
          to aid him in obtaining a patent. I wrote several affidavits
          and documents describing my measurements and generally
          supporting Newman's efforts. I have spent countless hours of
          my spare time over the past four years on this effort, withour
          renumeration. It takes little immagination to understand the
          benefit to the human race which would result from an
          economical device which generates energy with no external
          input. In my opinion, Newman's motor has performed well enough
          that the scientific community should be showing great
          interest. </p>
        <p>Over the years, a number of generic questions have repeatedly
          been asked. Is there a hidden energy source? The device can be
          viewed from all sides, and there are no external connections.
          The motor has been transported across country, and works
          equally well at all locations. The motor has been duplicated
          by at least one other person, who claims that it works. Newman
          would not be acting in his own self interest to simultaneously
          invite publicity and commit fraud. It is generally known that
          Newman is sincere and honest. </p>
        <p>Why isn't the motor running itself without the need for
          batteries? While in concept the motor should be capable of
          running itself without batteries, the technological problems
          have <br>
          not been solved which would allow such operation. In a sense,
          however, the motor does run itself. The motor has shown the
          capacity to charge up the batteries which provide voltage to
          the motor. Tests have been run in which up to 15 amp-hours of
          output have been drawn from the motor, and in which the six
          volt lantern batteries powering the motor have shown no
          evidence of an energy loss (the battery condition was verified
          in the labs of Ray-O-Vac Battery Co.). Tests have been run in
          which apparently dead batteries have been connected to the
          motor. The motor has charged up these batteries to the point
          where they can power other devices. The same batteries can be
          drained down (e.g. through a resistor), then be re-connected
          to the Newman motor and be charged up while they run the
          motor. </p>
        <p>Why isn't Newman's motor powering a home or auto? In my
          opinion such a demonstration would convince all skeptics, and
          create a great demand for the motor. Newman has proceeded in
          this direction. He has built at least four prototype motors to
          study the effect of varying motor parameters. He has steadily
          improved upon his large prototype, and has succeded in
          generating up to about 200 watts of power. By contrast, an
          average home requires one to three thousand watts on the
          average, with peak demands of up to 20 thousand watts. In this
          regard, it would be extremely helpful for establishments with
          high tech capabilities to aid Joe in scaling up the motor
          output. His approach has been to reduce the physical size of
          the motor to make it economical, and the output power. His
          greatest technical problem has been high voltage switching. </p>
        <p>Why does Newman keep his technical process a secret? This
          question was answered at Washington in May, when Newman
          revealed the construction details of his motor to the public.
          He has published a book ("The Energy Machine of Joseph
          Newman", available from Newman Publishing, Rt. 1, Box 52,
          Lucedale Mississippi 39452), in which he describes his theory
          and his motor. Joe had kept the process secret to avoid patent
          infringement. Although his patent is still pending in the
          U.S., it has issued in other countries. Presumably his patent
          rights will be protected in the U.S., although it should be
          noted that his motor is being copied by others, so that
          issuance of his patent in the U.S. is of immediate importance.
          Garland Robinnett of CBS news in New Orleans has run a number
          of reports on Newman's struggle with the U.S. Patent office. </p>
        <p>I do not fully understand why the scientific community in
          this country has not shown more interest in Newman's motor. He
          has had support from about 30 independent scientists and
          engineers, most of whom own their own engineering or
          consulting firms. He has also received some financial support
          from investors, who represent a range of interests, including
          oil and electrical power interests. I know of no one who has
          observed Newman's motor and taken measurements who has been
          able to show that his claims are invalid. On the contrary,
          most observers come in as skeptics, and leave as believers.
          Over the years my colleagues have consistantly provided me
          with arguments questioning the validity of my measurements. I
          have responded to these questions by modifying the measurement
          proceedures and creating new tests. In all cases the Newman
          device has passed the tests to my satisfaction. In my opinion,
          Newman has at least discovered some interesting and unusual
          new phenomena, and at most has discovered a process which will
          end man's dependence upon limited and polluting energy
          resources. </p>

        <p>I do not intend to recapitulate the theory presented in
          Newman's book, but rather to briefly provide my interpretation
          of his ideas. Newman began studying electricity and magnetism
          in the mid-1960's. He has a mechanical background, and was
          looking for a mechanical description of electromagnetic
          fields. That is, he assumed that there must be a mechanical
          interaction between, for example, two magnets. He could not
          find such a description in any book, and decided that he would
          have to provide his own explanation. He came to the conclusion
          that if electromagnetic fields consisted of tiny spinning
          particles moving at the speed of light along the field lines,
          then he could explain all standard electromagnetic phenomena
          through the interaction of spinning particles. Since the
          spinning particles interact in the same way as gyroscopes, he
          called the particles gyroscopic particles. In my opinion, such
          spinning particles do provide a qualitative description of
          electromagnetic phenomena, and his model is useful in
          understanding complex electrical situations (note that without
          a pictoral model one must rely solely upon mathematical
          equations which can become extremely complex). </p>
        <p>Given that electromagnetic fields consist of matter in
          motion, or kinetic energy, Joe decided that it should be
          possible to tap this kinetic energy. He likes to say "How long
          did man sit next to a stream before he invented the paddle
          wheel?". Joe built a variety of unusual devices to tap the
          kinetic energy in electromagnetic fields before he arrived at
          his present motor <br>
          design. He likes to point out that both Maxwell and Faraday,
          the pioneers of electromagnitism, believed that the fields
          consisted of matter in motion. This is stated in no uncertain
          terms in Maxwell's book "A Dynamical Theory of the
          Electromagnetic Field". In fact, Maxwell used a dynamical
          model to derive his famous equations. This fact has all but
          been lost in current books on electromagnetic theory. The
          quantity which Maxwell called "electromagnetic momentum" is
          now refered to as the "vector potential". </p>
        <p>Going further, Joe realized that when a magnetic field is
          created, its gyroscopic particles must come from the atoms of
          the materials which created the field. Thus he decided that
          all <br>
          matter must consist of the same gyroscopic particles. For
          example, when a voltage is applied to a wire, Newman pictures
          gyroscopic particles (which I will call gyrotons for short)
          moving down the wire at the speed of light. These gyrotons
          line up the electrons in the wire. The electrons themselves
          consist of a swirling mass of gyrotrons, and their matter
          fields combine when lined up to form the magnetic lines of
          force circulating around the wire. In this process, the wire
          has literally lost some of its mass to the magnetic field, and
          this is accounted for by Einstein's equation of energy equals
          mass times the square of the speed of light. According to
          Einstein, every conversion of energy involves a corresponding
          conversion of matter. According to Newman, this may be
          interpreted as an exchange of gyrotrons. For example, if two
          atoms combine to give off light, the atoms would weight
          slightly less after the reaction than before. According to
          Newman, the atoms have combined and given off some of their
          gyrotrons in the form of light. Thus Einstein's equation is
          interpreted as a matter of counting gyrotrons. These particles
          cannot be created or destroyed in Newman's theory, and they
          always move at the speed of light. </p>
        <p>My interpretation of Newman's original idea for his motor is
          as follows. As a thought experiment, suppose one made a coil
          consisting of 186,000 miles of wire. An electrical field would
          require one second to travel the length of the wire, or in
          Newman's language, it would take one second for gyrotons
          inserted at one end of the wire to reach the other end. Now
          suppose that the polarity of the applied voltage was switched
          before the one second has elapsed, and this polarity switching
          was repeated with a period less than one second. Gyrotons
          would become trapped in the wire, as their number increased,
          so would the alignment of electrons and the number of gyrotons
          in the magnetic field increase. The intensified magnetic field
          could be used to do work on an external magnet, while the
          input current to the coil would be small or non-existant.
          Newman's motors contain up to 55 miles of wire, and the
          voltage is rapidly switched as the magnet rotates. He
          elaborates upon his theory in his book, and uses it to
          interpret a variety of physical phenomena. </p>
        <p>RECENT DATA ON THE NEWMAN MOTOR </p>
        <p>In May of 1985 Joe Newman demonstrated his most recent motor
          prototype in Washington, D.C.. The motor consisted of a large
          coil wound as a solenoid, with a large magnet rotating within
          the bore of the solenoid. Power was supplied by a bank of six
          volt lantern batteries. The battery voltage was switched to
          the coil through a commutator mounted on the shaft of the
          rotating magnet. The commutator switched the polarity of the
          voltage across the coil each half cycle to keep a positive
          torque on the rotating magnet. In addition, the commutator was
          designed to break and remake the voltage contact about 30
          times per cycle. Thus the voltage to the coil was pulsed. The
          speed of the magnet rotation was adjusted by covering up
          portions of the commutator so that pulsed voltage was applied
          for a fraction of a cycle. Two speeds were demonstrated: 12
          R.P.M. for which 12 pulses occured each revolution; and 120
          rpm for which all commutator segments were firing. The slower
          speed was used to provide clear oscilloscope pictures of
          currents and voltages. The fast speed was used to demonstrate
          the potential power of the motor. Energy outputs consisted of
          incandescent bulbs in series with the batteries, flourescent
          tubes across the coil, and a fan powered by a belt attached to
          the shaft of the rotor. Revelent motor parameters are given
          below: </p>
        <p>Coil weight : 9000 lbs. <br>
          Coil length : 55 miles of copper wire <br>

          Battery Type : Six volt Ray-O-Vac lantern batteries connected
          in series </p>
        <p>A brief description of the measurements taken and distributed
          at the press conference follows. When the motor was rotating
          at 12 rpm, the average D.C. input current from the batteries
          was about 2 milli-amps, and the average battery input was then
          1.2 watts. The back current (flowing against the direction of
          battery current) was about -55 milli-amps, for an average
          charging power of -32 watts. The forward and reverse current
          were clearly observable on the oscilloscope. It was noted that
          when the reverse current flowed, the battery voltage rose
          above its ambient value, varifying that the batteries were
          charging. The magnitude of the charging current was verified
          by heating water with a resistor connected in series with the
          batteries. A net charging power was the primary evidence used
          to show that the motor was generating energy internally,
          however output power was also observed. The 55 m-amp current
          flowing in the 770 ohm coil generates 2.3 watts of heat, which
          is in excess of the input power. In addition, the lights were
          blinking brightly as the coil was switched. </p>
        <p>The back current from the coil switched from zero to negative
          several amps in about 1 milli-second, and then decayed to zero
          in about 0.1 second. Given the coil inductance of 1100
          henries, the switching voltages were several million volts.
          Curiously, the back current did not switch on smoothly, but
          increased in a staircase. Each step in the staircase
          corresponded to an extremely fast switching of current, with
          each increase in the current larger than the previous
          increase. The width of the stairs was about 100 micro-seconds,
          which for reference is about one third of the travel time of
          light through the 55 mile coil. </p>
        <p>Mechanical losses in the rotor were measured as follows: The
          rotor was spun up by hand with the coil open circuited. An
          inductive pick-up loop was attached to a chart recorder to
          measure the rate of decay of the rotor. The energy stored in
          the rotor (one half the moment of inertia times the square of
          the angular velocity) was plotted as a function of time. The
          slope of this curve was measured at various times and gave the
          power loss in the rotor as a function of rotor speed. The
          result of these measurements is given in the following table:
        </p>
        <p>Rotor Speed Power Dissipation Power/(Speed Squared) <br>
          radian/sec --- watts --- watts/(rad/sec)^2 <br>
          4.0 --- 6.3 --- 0.39 <br>
          3.7 --- 5.8 --- 0.42 <br>
          3.3 --- 5.0 --- 0.46 <br>
          3.0 --- 3.5 --- 0.39 <br>
          2.1 --- 2.0 --- 0.45 <br>
          1.7 --- 1.2 --- 0.42 <br>
          1.2 --- 0.7 --- 0.47 </p>
        <p>The data is consistant with power loss proportional to the
          square of the angular speed, as would be expected at low
          speeds. When the rotor moves fast enough so that air
          resistance is important, the losses would begin to increase as
          the cube of the angular speed. Using power = 0.43 times the
          square of the angular speed will give a lower bound on
          mechanical power dissipation at all speeds. When the rotor is
          moving at 12 rpm, or 1.3 rad/sec, the mechanical loss is 0.7
          watts. </p>
        <p>When the rotor was sped up to 120 rpm by allowing the
          commutator to fire on all segments, the results were quite
          dramatic. The lights were blinking rapidly and brightly, and
          the fan was turning rapidly. The back current spikes were
          about ten amps, and still increased in a staircase, with the
          width of the stairs still about 100 micro-seconds. Accurate
          measurements of the input current were not obtained at that
          time, however I will report measurements communicated to me by
          Mr. Newman. At a rotation rate of 200 rpm (corresponding to
          mechanical losses of at least 190 watts), the input power was
          about 6 watts. The back current in this test was about 0.5
          amps, corresponding to heating in the coil of 190 watts. As a
          final point of interest, note that the Q of his coil at 200
          rpm is about 30. If his battery plus commutator is considered
          as an A.C. power source, then the impedance of the coil at 200
          rpm is 23,000 henries, and the power factor is 0.03. In this
          light, the predicted input power at 700 volts is less than one
          watt! </p>
        <p>MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION OF NEWMAN'S MOTOR </p>
        <p>Since I am preparing this document on my home computer, it
          will be convenient to use the Basic computer language to write
          down formulas. The notation is * for multiply, / for divide, ^
          for raising to a power, and I will use -dot to represent a
          derivative. Newton's second law of motion applied to Newman's
          rotor yields the following equation: </p>
        <p>MI*TH-dot-dot + G*TH-dot = K*I*SIN(TH) (1) </p>
        <p>where MI = rotor moment of inertia <br>
          TH = rotor angular position (radians) <br>
          G = rotor decay constant <br>
          K = torque coupling constant <br>
          I = coil current </p>
        <p>In general the constant G may depend upon rotor speed, as
          when air resistance becomes important. The term on the right
          hand side of the equation represents the torque delivered to
          the rotor when current flows through the coil. A constant
          friction term was found through measurement to be small
          compared to the TH-dot term at reasonable speeds, but can be
          included in the "constant" G. The equation for the current in
          the coil is given by: </p>
        <p>L*I-dot + R*I = V(TH) - K*(TH-dot)*SIN(TH) (2) </p>
        <p>where L = coil inductance <br>
          I = coil current <br>
          R = coil resistance <br>
          V(TH) = voltage applied to coil by the commutator which is a
          function of the angle TH <br>
          K = rotor induction constant </p>
        <p>In general, the resistance R is a function of voltage,
          particularly during commutator switching when the air
          resistance breaks down creating a spark. Note that the
          constant K is the same in equations (1) and (2). This is
          required by energy conservation as discussed below. To examine
          energy considerations, multiply Equation (1) by TH-dot, and
          Equation (2) by I. Note that the last term in each equation is
          then identical if the K's are the same. Eliminating the last
          term between the two equations yields the instantaneous
          conservation law: </p>
        <p>I*V=R*I^2 + G*(T,-dot)^2 + .5*L*(I^2)-dot
          =.5*MI*((TH-dot)^2)-dot </p>
        <p>If this equation is averaged over one cycle of the rotor,
          then the last two terms vanish when steady state conditions
          are reached (i.e. when the current and speed repeat their
          values at angular positions which are separated by 360
          degrees). Denoting averages by &lt; &gt;, the above equation
          becomes: </p>
        <p>&lt;IV&gt; = &lt;R*I^2&gt; + &lt;G*(TH-dot)^2&gt; (3) </p>
        <p>This result is entirely general, independent of any
          dependences of R and G on other quantities. The term on the
          left represents the input power. The first term on the right
          is the power dissipated in the coil, and the second term is
          the power delivered to the rotor. The efficiency, defined as
          power delivered to the rotor divided by input power is thus
          always less than one by Equation (3). This result does
          require, however, that the constants K in equation (1) and
          equation (2) are identical. If the constant K in equation (2)
          is smaller than the constant K appearing in equation (1), then
          it may be varified that the efficiency can mathmatecally be
          larger than unity. </p>
        <p>What do the constants, K, mean? In the first equation, we
          have the torque delivered to the magnet, while in the second
          equation we have the back inductance or reaction of the magnet
          upon the coil. The equality of the constants is an expression
          of Newton's third law. How could the constants be unequal?
          Consider the sequence of events which occur during the firing
          of the commutator. First the contact breaks, and the magnetic
          field in the coil collapses, creating a huge forward spike of
          current through the coil and battery. This current spike
          provides an impulsive torque to the rotor. The rotor
          accelerates, and the acceleration produces a changing magnetic
          field which propagates through the coil, creating the back
          emf. Suppose that the commutator contacts have separated
          sufficiently when the last event occurs to prevent the back
          current from flowing to the battery. Then the back reaction is
          effectively smaller than the forward impulsive torque on the
          rotor. This suggestion invokes the finite propagation time of
          the electromagnetic fields, which has not been included in
          Equations (1) and (2). </p>
        <p>A continued mathmatical modeling of the Newman motor should
          include the effects of finite propagation time, particularly
          in his extraordinary long coil of wire. I have solved
          Equations (1) and (2) numerically, and note that the solutions
          require finer and finer step size as the inductance, moment of
          inertia, and magnet strength are increased to large values.
          The solutions break down such that the motor "takes off" in
          the computer, and this may indicate instabilities, which could
          be mediated in practise by external pertubations. I am
          confident that Maxwell's equations , with the proper
          electro-mechanical coupling, can provide an explanation to the
          phenomena observed in the Newman device. The
          electro-mechanical coupling may be embedded in the Maxwell
          equations if a unified picture (such as Newman's picture of
          gyroscopic particles) is adopted. </p>

        <p>At least one physicist in Louisiana swears that the CBS News
          anchorman Dan Rather was smiling on 9 January when he reported
          that an inventor near New Orleans has built a generator that
          defies the second law of thermodynamics. Others did not see
          any smile. What they did see, to their surprise, was an
          earnest but fantastic news story that has been running on New
          Orleans' biggest television channel being repeated over the
          network news. </p>
        <p>The story is about an inventor, a self-educated Missisippian
          named Joseph Wesley Newman. He was pleased with the CBS
          broadcast because it make help him in a fight with the U.S.
          Patent and Trademark Office, which has denied him a patent on
          the grounds of his latest invention, "smacks of a perpetual
          motion machine", meaning by definition it cannot do what it
          claimed. On 25 June, the U.S District Court for the District
          of Columbia will hear a suit Newman has brought against the
          patant office arguing that his device does not aim at
          perpetual motion but converts mass to energy in a finite but
          very efficient manner. He simply wants a patent. </p>
        <p>Newman's invention is hard to describe, partly because its
          behavior seems to be at odds with the laws of physics and
          partly because the details are being kept secret while the
          ligation goes on. Newman says his own theory of magnetism is
          "10,000 times more important" than the invention itself, which
          be built to demonstrate the concept. He claims to have
          discovered the mechanical principles of a gyroscopic particle
          of matter that orbits in a magnetic field much as an electron
          orbits in an atomic shell. Several readers of his theory say
          it is incomprehensible and would not get attention were it not
          for the illustrative devices. The patent Newman seeks is for
          an "Energy Generation System Having Larger Output than Input".
          Those who have seen it say it is a crude direct current motor
          powered by a bank of lantern batteries with a heavy, rotating
          magnet at its center. </p>
        <p>Readings of the machine's performance, like those of Dan
          Rather's expression, depend on the reader. As a result of the
          TV coverage, the people of New Orleans may be convinced that
          Newman has invented a simple device that produces more energy
          than it consumes and could end the world's energy sqabbles if
          only an arrogant scientific community would pay attention.
          That is Newman's message. It has been taken up and broadcasted
          in a sort of crusade by Garland Robinette, the evening news
          anchorman at the CBS affiliate in New Orleans, WWL-TV. </p>
        <p>Last autumn Robinette aired an eight-part series on Newman's
          device, charging that jealous academics and frightened
          executives tried to stifle information about it. Robinette
          concedes that his intense coverage of Newman's began on a slow
          news day when he was looking for a cute show-closer. He claims
          he was skeptical at first and saw Newman's invention as a
          curiosity. But the story soon grew into a "monster that I
          couldn't let go" when New Orleans viewers, facing a 200
          percent increase in utility rates, demanded to know more.
          Furthermore, a Missisippi state energy offical and a credible
          scientist had recently vouched for Newman's claims. Robinette
          says that since he began reporting on the invention, no one
          has come forward to rebut Newman. He challenges people to come
          to "get this story off my back". </p>
        <p>Newman has benefited from the television coverage and from
          several weighty endorsements. For example, the television
          engineers watched him. Last year, Robinette dragged two
          reluctant engineers on WWL-TV staff to Newman's garage in
          Lucedale, Missisippi., about 2 1/2 hours from New Orleans.
          They werde sceptics at first, but, after looking at
          oscilloscope readings and watching the machine recharge
          batteries, they agreed with their anchorman that the claims
          seemed valid. </p>
        <p>Engineer Ralph Hartwell described the tests he ran. When he
          arrived at Newman's House, he connected some weak penlight
          batteries he had brought along to a small conventional motor
          in Newman's back yard. It was allowed to run until the
          batteries were drained of power, taking about 1 minute. He
          then moved the dead batteries over to the smallest of Newman's
          demonstration motors, connected them as a power source, and
          started this motor spinning. It ran until it was time for the
          camera crew to leave, for something between 1 ans 2 hours.
          Finally, the batteries were taken fram Newman's machine back
          to the conventional motor and reconnected. This time the motor
          ran for about 3 minutes. Hartwell ran annother experiment on a
          large device and concluded that it also appeared to generate
          more power than it used. Other measurements were taken with
          oscilloscopes and current meters, but these readings have been
          questioned. After signing a confidential pledge, Hartwell was
          allowed to examine the machine's inner wiring. He is certain
          that there is no hidden source of energy. Although he feels
          uncomfortable about it, he says he could not disprove Newman's
          claim and would like to see a universtity run a controlled
          test. </p>
        <p>Newman's key endorsement comes from Roger Hastings, a
          solid-state physicist for the Sperry Univac Company in
          Minneapolis. A colleague who knew him as a postdoc fellow at
          the University of Virginia says Hastings was regarded as an
          adventurous and excellent theorist. Hasting's brother, a
          screener for new ideas for Tonka Toys, met Newman when he <br>
          submitted an invention to Tonka. Although sceptical, Hastings
          (the physician) was persuaded to make a trip to Lucedale. "I
          used to teach physics at North Dakota University", says
          Hastings, "and we would get three or four people a year who
          had some kind of device that was going to save the world. I
          assumed it was the same." Newman talked Hastings into fly down
          for a visit anyway. He returned five times, testing and
          retesting the motors, until he was satisfied that he had made
          no mistake. He eventually signed an affidatvit describing the
          invention in detail and stating unequivocally that it runs at
          greater than 100 percent efficency, producing more power than
          it consumes. "I'm sticking my neck out," he says, "because
          this is an important issue that should be resolved." </p>
        <p>Endorsements such as this are essential for the credibility
          of the patent application. Although Newman has read the works
          of the great electrical thinkers Michael Faraday and James
          Clerk Maxwell, he is not proficent in math or physics. </p>
        <p>Newman is collecting seval more endorsements. He claims to
          have won the backing recently of, a Geman aerospace engineer
          and a liaison officer between the National Aeronautics and
          Space Administration (NASA) and the European space consortium.
          Gerald Miller, a mechanical engineer, student of advanced
          physics, and electical industiy consultant in California, has
          inspected the devices and says, "I saw things that I cannot
          explain in conventional terms." He found that the device
          produced more energy than it used, adding, "I am absolutely
          certain that there is no hidden energy source. Milton Everett,
          a mechanical Engineer and director of the biomass program for
          the Missisippi Department of Energy and Transportation, says,
          "I think Joe has discovered something that the world is going
          to benefit from. It's nor a perpetual motion machine; it
          converts mass to energy." Excluding inverstors, Newman claims
          to have about 27 such endorsers. </p>
        <p>But there have been and continue to be prominent doubters.
          Oddly, TV anchorman Robinette has given little attention or
          credence to the only thorough analysis ever performed on
          Newman's device. It was aranged by Everett (before he became a
          full convert to Newman's cause) and was paid for by the
          Missisippi energy department. Two electrical engineers from
          Missisippi State University (MSU), --- Karl Carlson and Donald
          Fitzgerald --- tested one of the Newman's devices last March.
          The conditions were unfavourable, because the motor kept
          breaking down every "couple of minutes," says Carlson, as a
          huge spark from the induction coil shorted out a switch on the
          commutator. Thus, while it war fairly easy to measure the
          power going in, it was not easy to tell what was coming out.
          Newman has built a smaller, less quirky motor since then. </p>
        <p>The pattern on the oscilloscope at the output end of a cycle
          was difficult to read because as one observer says, the
          discharge spark appeared as "a bright flash" or "a mess" on
          the face of the screen. Newman sweeps this point aside as a
          quibble, saying it merely indicates his machine's tremendous
          power. The efficiency claimed for this device is anywhere from
          <br>
          the impossible (slightly over 100 percent) to the fantastic
          (800 percent and up). A normal electric motor may be 80
          percent efficient, Carlson says, and transformers are
          generally in the 90's. Carlson and Fitzgerald found that
          Newman's machine was between 55 and 76 percent efficient,
          based on their reading of the most favourable oscillograms. </p>
        <p>They wrote that they found "an output which is definitely
          less than the input." However, they hedged by saying it was
          impossible to measure the mechanical energy lost in the
          machine, which could affect the rating. They declined to call
          Newman's invention a breakthrough but reported that it was
          remakably efficient given its "obvious crude configuration."
          In a standard tag line, they wrote that "further investigation
          is in order." Newman reads this qualified rejection as a
          qualified endorsement, explaining when it comes to praising
          new discoveries, academisc are mean. He speaks of Carlson and
          Fitzgerald with harsher adjectives. </p>
        <p>The physics faculties of Loyola and Tulane Universities, both
          in New Orleans, have protested Robinette's reports. Daniel
          Purrington, Tulane's physics chairman, says: "We all dispute
          it. A number of us have told him [Robinette] we think what
          he's doing is irresponsible. I talked to him for about 2 hours
          about the principles involved." Carl Brans, a theorist at
          Loyola, wrote Robinette a two-page letter of protest. "It's
          just sensational journalism. In our opinion, it's not worth
          the cost," to try to take the measurements that would end the
          discussion. </p>
        <p>David Keiffer, an experimental physicist at Loyola, along
          with other faculty member, offered to check Newman's device if
          he would bring it to the laboratory. (Newman's patent attorney
          is a physics graduate of Loyola.) But in the preliminary
          talks, Keiffer says, Newman insisted that he be present during
          the entire procedure. Then he and Keiffer got into an
          argument. Newman packed up and left, never to return. The
          Loyola physicist also sought to advise WWL-TV's engineers on
          testing the device, but this proved to be a touchy
          proposition, because WWL is owned by Loyola and was originally
          founded by Loyola's physics department. No one wanted the
          advice to be interpreted as pressure. </p>
        <p>"I have a fairly good reputation here," Robinette says of his
          science reporting, "and this thing just has the potential to
          make me look like an absolute ignoranmus. So I've tried
          desperately to disprove this and all I've done so far is get
          more and more people who are convinced." </p>
        <p>What about the negative conclusion reached by the MSU
          engineers? Robinette maintains (like Newman and Everett) that
          while the engineers were testing the machine, they agreed that
          it was producing more energy than it used. But "when they went
          back, they wrote an ambigous response that didn't say it
          didn't work and didn't say it did." Robinette mentions that
          the MSU engineers are retired, as though to diminish their
          reliability. He finds it "very surprising that they never
          called to challenge his report, which gave the Newman-Everett
          version of events. </p>
        <p>Some who might otherwis voice scepticism seem to sypathize
          with Newman because of the way the patent office rebuffed him.
          In court filings, the patent office concedes that Newman is
          correct that it rejected his claims without fully reading the
          documents he submitted; that his application was handled by an
          examiner --- Donovan Duggan --- who seems to specialize in
          rejecting perpetual machines; that Duggan said he would not
          allow a patent on Newman's device, no matter how much
          supportive evidence was submited; that the office officials
          never tested the Newman device for efficacy and refused to
          observe oscilloscope readings of its input and output; and
          finally,&nbsp; that the office issued a patent 1979 to a man
          named Howard Johnson for a perpetual motion machine that
          Johnson since then agreed is inoperable. </p>
        <p>If there were an association of militant patent rejectees,
          Newman's battle with the patent office could be its rallying
          cause. But there is no such association. However, Newman has
          done reasonably well attracting attention by himself,
          especially in New Orleans. In a few months, he will get his
          day in court. </p>

        </p>
        <p>In the modern world of commerce, the U.S. patent and
          trademark office is a street-corner cop with the power to
          arrest the development of any product that promises the
          impossible. Its book of statutes contains the basic laws of
          physics, the axioms of mathematics, the fundamental principles
          of mechanical engineering. With particular enthusiasm, its
          employees serve as guardians of the public in a never-ending
          battle against mechanical devices allegedly capable of
          perpetual motion. </p>
        <p>This, at least, is how they see themselves. Inventors such as
          Joseph Newman are more apt to view them as "a bunch of
          narrow-minded people who have conducted themselves outside the
          federal law and the human race". For more than 5 years,
          Newman, 48, has been frustrated in his efforts to obtain a
          patent for an "Energy System Having Higher Output Than Input".
          In 1982, the patent office told him that because such a device
          is simply infeasible, his application was denied after
          something less than a comprehensive, time-consuming review (<i>Science</i>,
          10 February 1984, p. 571). </p>
        <p>Recently, however, with the help of some unexpected
          scientific endorsements, Newman persuaded the U.S. District
          Court in Washington, D.C., to order that his application be
          granted a full review by an examiner --- in short, a second
          chance. Newman believes that the decision is a slap in the
          face for the patant office and a partial vindication of his
          claims. Actually, the dispute reveals how easy it can be for
          inventors to jerk the patent office around. The ruling, made
          by Judge Thomas Jackson on 31 October, places the office in
          the difficult position of determining whether Newman's "energy
          generation system" -- a powerful electric motor -- is
          adequately described in his application, and whether it is
          similar or identical to motors with existing patants. Neither
          topic was given serious consideration on the first go-around,
          for reasons the patent office believes obvious. </p>
        <p>The decision resulted from an unusual hearing in which a
          phalanx of attorneys in Newman's employ repeatedly cited
          patent case law, while Jere Sears, deputy solicitor in the
          patent office, repeatedly invoked the second law of
          thermodynamics. In its essence, that law states that the
          energy produced by a mechanical device such as Newman's will
          always be less than the energy needed to operate it. In
          addition to basing the case on "all of recorded science", as
          Sears put it, he relied heavily on an affidavit from Jacod
          Rainbow, a former chief research engineer at the National
          Bureau of Standards and well-known debunker of perpetual
          motion machines. Rainbow has several objections to the patent
          application, but his primary claim is that the motor's output
          of energy has been measured incorrectly. Although he has not
          seen the device or tested himself, he is willing to bet "any
          money" that it operates at well under 100 percent efiicency. </p>
        <p>As strong as the gouverment's argument was, it was sharply
          undercut by two affidavits. One was written by Mort Zimmerman,
          the president of Commercial Technology, Inc., in Dallas.
          Zimmerman said his 400-person firm "has independently ...
          constructed, operated, and tested several crude prototype
          devices based on the Newman invention, and has confirmed for
          itself that these prototype devices which embody the Newman
          invention operate and produce power as claimed by Newman" at
          more than 111 percent efficiency. Zimmerman was enthusiastic
          enough to purchase an option for the right to manufacture and
          sell Newman's motor in north Texas. (Recently, he told <i>Science</i>
          that the motor "needs further development for practical
          utilization, and we're not completely convinced that we can
          get there.") </p>
        <p>The second affidavit was prepared from Lawrence E. Wharton, a
          physicist in the Laboratory For Atmospheric Sciences at the
          Goddart Flight Space Center in Maryland. Initially, Wharton,
          who volunteered his services to the patent office as a sceptic
          of Newman's claims, vigorously attacked Zimmerman's statement.
          Shortly before the court hearing, however, he recanted some of
          his arguments, and declared that the motor's efficiency "is in
          substantial excess of 100 percent" and perhaps as high as 600
          percent, if Newman's measurements are correct. The change of
          heart came, he said, after Newman argued with him in a long
          telephone conversation. </p>
        <p>Both of these statements apparently made a strong impression
          on William Schuyler, an attorney and one-time commissioner of
          U.S. patents who was appointed by the judge as a "special
          master" to help resolve some of the technical disputes. In his
          report, Schuyler agreed that the operation of Newman's motor
          "seems clearly to conflict with recognized scientific
          principles relating to thermodynamics and conservation of
          energy." But he insisted ther was an "overwhelming" evidence
          that the motor's output energy exceeded the external input
          energy, adding that "there is no contradictory factual
          evidence." He went so far as to state that Newman was entitled
          to a patent as long as it did not conflict with any existing
          patents. </p>
        <p>All of this came as a great shock to Sears. It was he, not
          Newman, who nominated Schuyler. "We felt reasonably safe with
          a person of his background," he explains. In a final pleading
          to the judge, Sears asked, "Why are we still paying power
          bills if Newman has actually achieved his claims? The Court
          should exercise some common sense and refrain from joining
          those who apparently believe in the tooth fairy... Manifestly,
          this court has no power to abrogate a natural law." </p>
        <p>In his ruling, Judge Jackson accepted the major points of
          Schuyler's report, but said he was unwilling to conclude as
          yet that Newman has produced a "truly pioneering invention."
          That decision awaits aanother hearing, now set for January.
          Sears denies that this decision has any implications for the
          general patent review process. But one effect may be to bar
          the office from dealing summarily whith such unusual claims in
          the future -- a development that could sharply increase the
          examination delays experienced by inventors with more
          plausible claims. </p>
        <p>To Newman, the dispute has become a crusade. Having spent
          thousands of dollars already in lawyer's fees, consulting
          fees, and court costs, he will soon pay to publish a book
          describing both his invention and the patent fight. He says
          that "the world is fortunate that I'm not afraid of a ruckus,
          I intend to fight this untill hell freezes over." </p>

        <p>What's a device with a battery pack, a magnet, and a coil
          wired together? </p>
        <p>For the past 6 years, Joseph Newman, an inventor from
          Mississippi, has been loudly proclaiming that it's a
          revolutionary machine which produces more power than it uses.
          The National Bureau of Standards recently issued its own
          verdict after analyzing Newman's machine: "In none of tests
          did the device's approach 100%.... Our results are clear and
          unequivocal," the bureau said. </p>
        <p>Newman has gone to great lengths to try to win a patent on
          his energy output machine. When the U.S. Patent and Trademark
          Office indicated in 1984 that the device did not work, Newman
          sued the agency. He hired a publicist, and the media often
          portrayed him as an underdog pitted against the scientific
          establishment. Then the court ordered Newman to submit the
          machine to the National Bureau of Standards for testing.
          Newman reluctantly complied. </p>
        <p>A physicist and two electrical engineers from the bureau
          tested the machine in a variety of ways to measure its energy
          input and output and used instrumentation that is common in
          research engineering laboratories. The sole power source of
          the device was 116 9-volt batteries. According to the test
          results, the device's efficiency ranged from 27 to 67%,
          depending on the voltage, the power drawn from the device, and
          the condition of insulating tape on one of the parts. (The
          tape kept burning from sparks generated by the machine, which
          caused the efficiency to drop and had to be replaced
          frequently.) </p>
        <p>According to John Lyons, director of the bureau's National
          Engineering Laboratory, the device basically converted direct
          current to alternating current. He noted that there are
          several machines already on the market that do the same thing,
          but they run at 90% efficiency or higher. </p>
        <p>Newman had court permission to observe the bureau's tests,
          but never appeared for any of the experiments, which were
          conducted between March and June. His spokesman Evan Soule
          said Newman will ask the court to order the testing of the
          test equipment. Newman said in an interview, "I have no
          respect for the National Bureau of Standards. This is a
          conspiracy against me." </p>
        <p>The testing cost the bureau $75,000, which it hopes to recoup
          from the patent office. The patent office will submit the
          results to U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia,
          which will try the case in December. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
        <p>The author has made numerous measurements on the Energy
          Machines developed by Joseph Newman of Lucedale, Mississippi.
          The machines are large, air core, permanent magnet motors. The
          most important design rule specified by the inventor is that
          the length of wire in the motor coil be very long; preferably
          long enough so that the switching time between current
          reversals is shorter than the time required for propagation of
          the current wavefront through the coil. Various models contain
          up to 55 miles of wire, with air core coil inductances of up
          to 20,000 Henries. The permanent magnet armatures have very
          large magnetic moments. Thus the motors exhibit high torque
          with low current inputs. The motors generate large back
          current spikes consisting of pulsed rf in the 10-20 MHz
          frequency range. These spikes provide large mechanical
          impulses to the rotor, energize fluorescent tubes placed
          across the motor, and tend to charge the dry cell battery
          pack. The total generated energy --- consisting of mechanical
          work, mechanical friction, ohmic heating, and light --- is
          many times larger than the battery input energy. </p>
        <p>Newman's theories and machines will be described.
          Measurements indicating net energy gain from the devices will
          be presented. A phenomenological mathematical description of
          the motor will also be presented. Finally, the author will
          present his personal impressions of Newman's work. </p>
        <p><b>Newman's Theory ---</b> </p>
        <p>Joseph Newman is an inventor who lives and works at his home
          in Lucedale, MS. He became interested in electromagnetic
          energy some 25 years ago, and began a self-study program.
          After searching standard texts for a mechanical description of
          electromagnetic interactions, he concluded that no such
          description existed. Newman decided that he would have to
          generate his own mechanical theory of electromagnetism, and
          over the following several years he evolved his gyroscopic
          particle theory. This theory, or model states that all matter
          and energy is composed of a single elementary spinning
          particle which always moves at the speed of light. The
          gyroscopic particle has mass, and it can neither be created or
          destroyed. All energy conversions, in this theory, involve an
          exchange of gyroscopic particles. E = mc^2 is the expression
          of this concept, and simply represents an accounting of
          gyroscopic particles during an energy conversion. </p>
        <p>Electric and magnetic fields consist of gyroscopic particles
          flowing at the speed of light along the field lines. When an
          electric or magnetic field is created, the particles initially
          come from the materials which energized the field. For
          example, when a battery is connected to a wire, gyroscopic
          particles flow at the speed of light down the wire, and they
          tend to align the gyroscopic particle flow fields of the
          electrons in the wire. The electric gyroscopic particle flow
          field extends outside the wire creating the circumferential
          magnetic field of the wire. The energy in the magnetic field
          is Nmc^2, where N is the number of particles in the field, and
          m is the mass of an individual particle. This energy, or these
          particles, came from the electrons of the copper. </p>
        <p>Thus, Newman considers the current flowing in the wire to be
          a catalyst which energy to emanate from the atoms of the wire.
          He claims that he has developed a mechanism whereby field
          energy can be pumped out of the copper atoms in the wire,
          thereby reducing their mass without consuming the voltage
          source which has supplied the catalytic current flow. Since
          the mass is consumed totally, there is no pollution in this
          process. One gram mass, if totally consumed,could supply
          enough energy to power a home for one thousand years. Newman
          describes his theory and its applications in his book, THE
          ENERGY MACHINE OF JOSEPH NEWMAN [1]. </p>
        <p><b>Description of Newman Motors ---</b> </p>
        <p>Newman's motors may be described as two-pole, single phase,
          permanent magnet armature, DC motors. That is, the armature
          consists of a single permanent magnet which either rotates or
          reciprocates within a single coil of copper wire. The coil is
          energized with a bank of dry cell, carbon zinc batteries. In
          the rotating models, which will be emphasized in this paper,
          the battery voltage to the coil is reversed each half cycle of
          rotation by a mechanical commutator attached to the shaft of
          the rotating armature. Motor operation is sensitive to the
          angle at which the voltage is switched, and this is optimized
          experimentally. On some models, the commutator also interrupts
          the voltage several times per cycle, creating a pulsed input
          to the coil. </p>
        <p>The coils are constructed with a very large number of turns
          of copper wire. In all models, the coil inductive reactance is
          much larger than the coil resistance at operating speed.
          However, the coil resistance is large enough so that even in
          the locked rotor condition, very little current flows through
          the coil. The motors typically draw less than ten milliampere
          so that small capacity batteries (e.g., 9 volt transistor
          batteries) can be used in series for the power supply. Self
          resonant frequencies (frequency at which the coil inductive
          reactance equals the coil distributed capacitive reactance)
          are typically on the order of the armature rotation frequency.
          The permanent magnet armature is very strong, and TIGHT
          COUPLING TO THE COIL is emphasized in Newman's later models
          [emphasis added]. His early models used up to 700 pounds of
          ceramic magnets, while later models used smaller armatures
          made with powerful neodymium-boron-iron magnets. The
          commutator is protected by fluorescent tubes placed across the
          motor. Enough tubes are placed in series so that the battery
          voltage will not break them down. When the coil is switched,
          the tubes are lit by the resulting high voltage, minimizing
          arcing across the commutator. </p>
        <p>Newman's motors exhibit the following extraordinary
          characteristics: </p>
        <p>1) High torque is realized with very little input current and
          very little input power. The battery input power is typically
          several times smaller than the measured frictional power
          losses occurring when the armature rotates at its operating
          speed. His motors are at least ten times more efficient than
          commercial electric motors (perform the same work with one
          tenth the input power.) </p>
        <p>2) The batteries last much longer than would be expected for
          the current input. It has been demonstrated that "dead" dry
          cell batteries will charge up while operating a Newman Motor,
          and subsequently be able to deliver significant power to
          normal loads (e.g., lights). The batteries fail by internal
          shorting rather than be depletion of their internal energy. </p>
        <p>3) Significant rf power is generated by the motor (primarily
          in the ten to twenty megahertz range). The rf is a high
          voltage relative to ground, and will light fluorescent or neon
          tubes placed between the motor and ground in addition to
          lighting the tubes placed across the motor coil. The rf
          current flows through the entire system, and has been measured
          calorimetrically to have an rms value many times larger than
          the battery input current. </p>
        <p>EXPERIMENTAL DATA </p>
        <p>A large amount of data has been collected by many individuals
          on the various Newman Motors. While Newman's most recent
          prototypes are perhaps the most interesting because of their
          reduced volume, I will present data on his original prototype
          large machine which has been more extensively investigated.
          Measured motor parameters are listed below: </p>
        <p>COIL PARAMETERS: </p>
        <p>Weight ........................... 9,000 pounds <br>
          Copper Wire Length ...... 55 miles <br>
          Coil Inductance ............. 1,100 Henries <br>
          Coil Resistance .............. 770 Ohms <br>
          Coil Inside Diameter ...... 4 feet <br>
          Coil Height .................... 4 feet </p>
        <p>ROTOR PARAMETERS: </p>
        <p>Rotor Weight ..................... 700 lbs. ceramic magnets <br>
          Rotor Length ..................... 4 feet <br>
          Moment of Inertia .............. 40 Kg-sq.m. <br>
          Magnetic Moment ............. 100 Tesla-cu.in </p>
        <p>BATTERY PARAMETERS: </p>
        <p>Battery Type ..................... 6 Volt Ray-O-Vac Lantern <br>
          Total Series Voltage .......... 590 Volts </p>
        <p>DYNAMIC PARAMETERS: </p>
        <p>Torque Constant ................ 15,400 oz. in./amp <br>
          Drag Coefficient ................. 0.005 Watts/sq.rpm. <br>
          Q at 200 rpm ..................... 30 <br>
          Power Factor, 200 rpm ...... 0.03 </p>
        <p>The torque constant was measured at DC and agrees with
          calculations. The drag coefficient was measured by plotting
          the motor speed versus time after disconnecting the batteries.
          It was found that the decay is exponential with the drag
          torque being proportional to the angular speed. With the motor
          operating at 200 rpm, the following measurements and
          calculations were obtained: </p>
        <p>RESULTS: 200 RPM at 590 VOLTS </p>
        <p>Battery Input Current ............ 10 milliampere <br>
          Battery Input Power .............. 6 Watts <br>
          Rotor Frictional Losses .......... 200 Watts <br>
          RF Current (rms) ................. 500 milliampere <br>
          RF Ohmic Losses in Coil .......... 190 Watts <br>
          Additional Loads ................. Fluorescent Tubes <br>
          Incandescent Bulbs <br>
          Fan (belt driven) </p>
        <p>The frictional losses are computed from the measured drag
          coefficient. The ohmic losses are computed from the coil
          resistance. Without considering the additional loads, it is
          seen that the output energy of the machine exceeded the input
          by a factor of 65! </p>
        <p>Oscillograph photos show that the current waveform is
          dominated by the very large spike which occurs when the
          magnetic field of the coil collapses. The leading edge of this
          spike is shown in Figure 1. The staircase current rise is
          typical of the Newman Motors, with the width of the stairs in
          all cases being approximately equal to the length of the coil
          winding divided by the speed of light. Although the average
          current in the spike is at DC, the actual current waveform
          under the stairs is pulsing at a frequency of about 13
          megahertz. The time average current in the waveform agrees
          with the calorimeter measurement of the rf current. </p>

          showing Newman Motor switching current spike. Spike leading
          edge is shown with the magnified time base in second and third
          oscillograph. Rotor speed was 120 rpm. </p>
        <p>PHENOMENOLOGICAL THEORY </p>
        <p>A phenomenological theory of operation is suggested here,
          which involves the following sequence of events: </p>
        <p>1) The battery is switched across the coil and a current
          wavefront (gyroscopic particles) propagates into the coil at a
          speed determined by the coil's propagation time constant. </p>
        <p>2) Before the wavefront completes its journey through the
          coil, the battery voltage is switched open. At this point the
          coil contains a charge equal to the current times the on-time.
        </p>
        <p>3) When the switch is opened, all of this charge leaves the
          coil in a very short time, creating a very large current pulse
          in the coil. </p>
        <p>4) The magnetic field generated by this current pulse
          (gyroscopic particle flow) propagates out to the permanent
          magnet armature, and gives it an impulsive torque. </p>
        <p>5) The magnet accelerates, and the resulting magnetic field
          disturbance of the permanent magnet is propagated back to the
          coil, creating a back-emf. However, by the time this occurs,
          the switch is open so that the back emf does not impede the
          current flowing in the battery circuit. </p>
        <p>These notions agree qualitatively with the measured
          waveforms. After one-half cycle of rotation, a charge on the
          order of 0.01 Coulombs will be contained within the coil. From
          the oscillograph this is seen to be dumped in a few
          milliseconds, creating a current of several amps. This current
          continues to flow for some ten milliseconds before decaying to
          zero. </p>
        <p>Newman's Motor can be described by the following set of
          equations: </p>
        <p>(1) J? + F(?) = K(sub t)I sin (?) </p>
        <p>(2) LI = RI = V(?) - K(sub i)? sin (?) </p>
        <p>where: <br>
          J = Rotor Moment of Inertia <br>
          F = Friction and Load Torque <br>
          K(sub t) = Torque Constant <br>
          I = Coil Current <br>
          L = Coil Inductance <br>
          V = Applied Voltage <br>
          K(sub i) = Induction Constant <br>
          ? = Rotation Angle </p>
        <p>The first equation is Newton's second law applied to the
          rotating magnet, the second is the coil current circuit
          equation. The voltage is the value applied to the coil within
          the commutator. If the first equation is multiplied by ? and
          the second equation is multiplied by I, and both equations are
          averaged over one cycle, the sum of the resulting equations
          gives: </p>
        <p>(3) &lt;IV&gt; = &lt;?F&gt; + &lt;I^2R&gt; + (K(sub i) -
          K(sub t) &lt;?Isin ?) </p>
        <p>where the brackets indicate a time average over one cycle of
          rotation. </p>
        <p>The term on the left is the power input. The first two terms
          on the right represent the mechanical power output (combined
          frictional losses and load power), and the ohmic heating in
          the coil windings. The last term is zero if the torque
          constant is equal to the induction constant, as would be the
          case in a conventional motor. However, as postulated above, if
          the induction constant is smaller than the torque constant,
          the last term supplies the negative power. </p>
        <p>To view this another way, assume that the input voltage,
          through the commutator action varies as V = V(sub o)sin (?).
          If we also assume that the rotor angular <br>
          speed, ?, is nearly a constant, w, the following expression
          applies for the motor efficiency: </p>
        <p>&lt;wF&gt; K(sub t)w&lt;Isin ?&gt; K(sub t)w <br>
          (4) E = ______ = __________________ = ___________ <br>
          &lt;IV&gt; V(sub o)&lt;Isin ?&gt; V (sub o) </p>
        <p>The following two equations can now be solved for the
          presumed constant motor speed: </p>
        <p>(5) LI + RI = (V(sub o) - K(sub i)w)sin(wt) </p>
        <p>(6) &lt;F(w)&gt; = K(sub t)&lt;I sin(wt)&gt; </p>
        <p>The solution depends upon the details of the mechanical load
          function, F(w). If, however, the torque constant and voltage
          are both very large (as they are in Newman's Motor), then the
          angular speed is approximately [2]: </p>
        <p>V(sub o) <br>
          w apr.= __________ <br>
          K(sub i) </p>
        <p>and the expression for the efficiency becomes: </p>
        <p>K(sub t) <br>
          E apr.= __________ <br>
          K(sub i) </p>
        <p>If the torque and induction constants are equal, the motor is
          nearly one hundred percent efficient. If the torque constant
          exceeds the induction constant, the efficiency* exceeds 100%.
        </p>
        <p>[*Note: the PRODUCTION efficiency can exceed 100% the
          CONVERSION efficiency cannot exceed 100%] </p>
        <p>CONCLUSIONS: </p>
        <p>Joseph Newman has demonstrated that his Theory is a useful
          tool by which predictions of circuit function can be made
          without mathematics. For example, his gyroscopic particles
          interact as spinning particles (through the cross product of
          their spins), and this qualitatively describes magnetic
          induction. In complicated electromagnetic systems, exact
          solutions to Maxwell's equations may be difficult or
          impossible to obtain, while a phenomenological mechanical
          picture can be visualized to give qualitatively correct
          results. Mechanical models of electromagnetic interactions
          were considered essential by scientists of the 19th century.
          Maxwell originally derived his famous equations by using a
          mechanical model of the electromagnetic field, and stated the
          following [3]: </p>
        <p>"The theory I propose may therefore be called a theory of the
          electromagnetic field because it has to do with the space in
          the neighborhood of the electric or magnetic bodies, and it
          may be called a dynamical theory because it assumes that in
          that space there is MATTER IN MOTION, by which the observed
          electro-magnetic phenomena are produced .... In speaking of
          the energy of the field, I wish to be understood literally:
          ALL ENERGY IS THE SAME AS MECHANICAL ENERGY.." [Emphasis
          added.] </p>
        <p>Regarding Joseph Newman's Motor, I have no doubt about its
          performance or about the profound importance of its future
          applications. </p>
        <p>**AT THIS TIME IT APPEARS THAT THE FIRST APPLICATIONS WILL BE
          REPLACEMENTS FOR EXISTING ELECTRIC MOTORS. [Editor: Emphasis
          added.] </p>
        <p>Regarding a rigorous mathematical description of the
          underlying phenomena, it is clear that much effort, both
          theoretical and experimental, will be required to achieve this
          end. </p>

        <p>[2] The precise condition for this approximation to be valid
          is that the locked rotor torque be much larger than the
          applied mechanical torque at speed multiplied by one plus the
          square of the ratio of inductive reactance and resistance.
          This condition applied to some of Newman's Motors, and in
          particular to the most recent small volume devices. In the
          larger motors the voltage is applied with a phase shift chosen
          to optimize efficiency, and it can be shown that Equation 8

        <p>Dr. Roger Hastings has a Ph.D. in Physics, University of
          Minnesota, 1975; MS in Physics, University of Denver, 1971; BS
          in Physics, University of Denver, 1969. </p>
        <p>Dr. Hastings was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of
          Virginia, 1975-77 with research in organic superconductors and
          the physical properties of solutions of macro-ions and
          viruses. Currently, Dr. Hastings is a Principal Physicist with
          the UNISYS Corporation. As a consultant, Dr. Hastings also
          designs electric motors for other corporations. </p>
        <p>*The latest commutator design enables higher voltages to be
          utilized. </p>
        <p><i>Note:</i> The above article was written several years ago.
          The principles described above are generally applicable
          "across the breadth of the technology." However, considerable
          improvements to the commutator design have been made in the
          recent past. These improvements are intended to actually
          reduce the intensity of the sparking by distributing the
          physical connections over a wider area. The reader should bear
          in mind that there are TWO totally different design systems
          (but many sub-configurations within each basic design): there
          is one commutator design when the energy machine is intended
          to function as a GENERATOR and a totally different commutator
          design when the energy machine is intended to function as a
          MOTOR. The latest design improvements to the commutator system
          apply to the machine operating as a MOTOR. Subsequent torque
          can be utilized for mechanical systems or can be used in
          conjunction with a conventional generator. </p>

              Invention ~</font></b> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention
            relates generally to devices or systems (including methods
            for generating useable energy such as for example electrical
            energy from electromagnetic fields, electrical energy or
            electromagnetic fields from matter, and more particularly to
            devices or systems (including methods) for producing
            electrical current flow for use as electrical power, and
            magnetic fields of force which cause motion (obvious work),
            or electrical current flow or for increasing electromagnetic
            potential energy available for use or mechanical energy
            available for use.</font> </p>
        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. Prior Art ~</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There have been many
            devices proposed over the years for producing electrical
            energy, with mechanical friction, thermo-electricity,
            photoelectricity, piezoelectricity, electrochemistry and
            electromagnetic induction being the chief forms of primary
            energy capable of producing electricity. Of these, the only
            significant source of commercial electrical power has been
            the mechanical actions of electric generators, and for
            mobile power the chemical action of batteries has been
            important. Useable motion has resulted from the interactions
            between the input of electrical energy and the magnetic
            and/or electromagnetic fields of force (electric motors) and
            heat or light as a result of input of electrical energy
            through conventional mechanical systems, heaters,
            lightbulbs, etc.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All of the prior art
            systems are designed according to rigid mathematical laws
            taught both in physics and electrical engineering that
            coincide with the hypotheses rigidly accepted by the
            industrial and scientific communities concerning the Second
            Law of Thermodynamics (1850).</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the foregoing
            generally accepted hypothesis it has also been generally
            accepted and rigidly taught in physics and electrical
            engineering that the electric current flowing in a closed
            circuit from a battery, electrical generator, etc., is used
            up in the mechanical device being operated by this flow of
            electric current, and that all such electric current
            producing systems would only put out at most work equal to
            the work initially put into the system, or in accordance
            with generally accepted laws stating that a particular
            electrical system was only capable of a given output of
            energy and no ore.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These beliefs have till
            this date remained rigid in both the industrial and
            scientific communities in spite of proof of Einsteins
            equation of E = MC<sup>2</sup>. Nuclear reactors convert
            matter into useable electromagnetic energy in the form of
            heat, which converts water into steam to turn conventional
            turbines for production of electric current by conventional
            electrical generating means. This system is extremely
            inefficient, using less than 1% of the energy of the atom
            and producing a deluge of contaminated materials that have
            caused a serious problem of safe disposal.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Additionally, the basic
            electrical generators in use throughout the world today
            utilize the principle of causing relative movement between
            an electrical conductor (for example a rotor) and a magnetic
            field produced by a magnet or an electromagnet (for example
            a stator), all using the generally accepted hypothesis that
            the greater the electrical conductivity of the material
            being moved through the field, the more efficient will be
            the electrical generation.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the foregoing
            generally accepted hypotheses, it also has been generally
            accepted that there should always be movement between, for
            example, the rotor and stator elements, and that only
            generally accepted electrical conductors, that is materials
            with high electrical conductivity, will effectively serve in
            an electrical generation system.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, in one of the
            systems (<b><a href="#new3">Figure 3</a></b>) of the present
            invention, electrical generation can occur with the
            relatively static elements and with materials that are not
            generally considered to be of high electrical conductivity,
            although of course the present invention likewise can
            utilize relatively moving elements as well as materials of
            generally accepted high electrical conductivity, if so
            desired, as occurs in the systems of the present invention

        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="-0">Basic
                Principles &amp; Guidelines ~</font></font></b> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In accordance with the
            principles of the present invention and as generally
            illustrated in <b><a href="#new3">Figure 3</a></b>, an
            electromagnetic field 10 comprises flows of quanta or
            particles 20, 30 of electrical energy flowing from each of
            the poles 21, 31 of a magnet (or electromagnet) 40 to the
            other pole, following the "lines of force" 11 of the
            electromagnetic field. These particles 20, 30, believed to
            be traveling at the speed of light, are always coming out of
            one end 21, 31, respectively, flowing from a relatively
            high-energy source to a low-energy source.</font> </p>
        <p>These particles 20, 30 are, it is believed, negative and
          positive charges and have a spin producing a gyroscopic motion
          and follow the mechanical laws of gyroscopic action. The mass
          of each of the particles 20, 30 equals the energy of the
          particles divided by the speed of light squared. The
          peripheral speed of the gyroscopic particles is believed to be
          the speed of light. </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For purposes of
            illustration only and as a matter of nomenclature, the
            positive charge particle 20 is going in one direction (N to
            S) with a clockwise spin, and the negative particle 30 is
            going in the opposite direction with a counter-clockwise
            spin. Of course, if a particle such as 20 or 30 is flipped
            around 180 degrees, it becomes the opposite charge or type
            of particle.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electromagnetic field
            10 is thus the orderly flow of the positive and negative
            charges 20, 30, moving at the speed of light from the north
            and south poles 21, 31, to the south and north poles 31, 21,
            respectively, and follow the paths of what is termed in the
            art as the lines of force 11 of the electromagnetic field
            10.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As is known from the laws
            of gyroscopes, a gyroscopic particle or body moves at right
            angles to the direction of an applied force. Therefore, when
            a force is applied to the electrical energy particles 20,30,
            they will move at right angles to that force.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It should also be noted
            from known gyroscopic laws that the electrical energy
            particles 20, 30, when they move with their gyroscopic axis
            straight into an object, tend to knock that object straight,
            but if that object hits the particles at an angle to the
            axis other than at zero or 180 degrees, the particles are
            moved off at an angle from the straight.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Additionally, it is noted
            that a magnetic field caused by a current flowing through a
            wire comes from negative and positive particles, such as 20,
            30, with a net flow of such particles going in the same
            direction but with opposite spin.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the system and method
            of the present invention, the foregoing principles serve as
            guidelines in the present invention.</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One possible, exemplary
            embodiment using the principles of the system of the present
            invention is schematically shown in the generalized
            illustration of <b><a href="#new1">Figure 1</a></b>.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As illustrated in <b><a
                href="#new1">Figure 1</a></b>, there is provided an
            electrical current generator 100 comprising an outer keeper
            housing 115 and an inner, pressure-containing, closed
            housing 116 supported therein by insulated supports 105. A
            vacuum exists in the area 106 between the two housings 115,
            116, which vacuum is regulated and induced by means of the
            vacuum line 104 with its gauge 107 and its control valve
            108. The outer housing 115 acts as a keeper for magnetic
            fields of force, and can be made for example of soft iron,
            while the vacuum in area 106 prevents the leakage or
            discharge of static electrical charges that might build up
            on the exterior of the inner housing 116.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A gas or gas-liquid
            mixture 117 which may also include solid particles such as
            for example lead or brass filings, is included within the
            inner housing 116 surrounding a series of aligned magnets
            120 carried by insulating braces or supports 121 and
            producing a high, combined electromagnetic field. The
            magnets 120, which can for example be cryogenic magnets,
            have their "north" and "south" poles aligned (as illustrated
            by the "Nn" and "Ss") so that their magnetic fields
            reinforce one another.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The level of the gas or
            gas-liquid mixture 117 in the housing 116 is regulated by
            means of the line 122 with its gauge 123 and control valve
            124. Electric current output wires 119 are provided and
            extend down to electrically connect with a wire pick-up
            system 118 (shown in close-up in <b><a href="#new2">Figure
                2</a></b>), which can for example be in the form if very
            small wires forming a closely spaced network or mesh or of a
            porous conducting metal body or sheet, located in and
            extended throughout the fluid 117 in the housing 116.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is noted that a
            thimbleful of gas contains a fantastically large number of
            extremely tiny bodies that are in continuous, random motion
            moving at extremely high speeds. Hence, the fluid 117
            continuously applies a force to the gyroscopic particles
            (analogous to particles 20, 30 of <b><a href="#new3">Figure
                3</a></b>) moving at the speed of light in the high
            electromagnetic field (produced by the magnets 120) as they
            continuously collide with each other, which results in the
            fluid 117 becoming electrically charged. The charged fluid
            117 discharges its electrical charge to the pick-up wire
            network 118 positioned in the fluid, and the electric
            current so produced and generated is taken off for use via
            the electrical output wires 119.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As an alternative to
            having internally contained magnets 120, the electromagnetic
            field needed in the fluid 117 could be produced by a source
            located outside of the confines of the fluid 117 as long as
            the significant field was produced within the fluid 117.</font>

        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further exemplary,
            generalized embodiment utilizing the principles of the
            system of the present invention is shown in schematic form
            in <b><a href="#new3">Figure 3</a></b>.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electrical current
            generator 200 of <b><a href="#new3">Figure 3</a></b>
            comprises an extended member 201 of a special material
            having its atoms especially aligned to produce electric
            current when positioned in an electromagnetic field but
            which does not on its own exhibit any substantial magnetic
            field outside of its boundary surfaces but substantially
            contains the filed within itself. This is in contrast to
            "magnetic" materials which likewise have atom alignment but
            which also exhibit or produce a substantial magnetic field
            in the area surrounding it.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The generator 200 further
            comprises for example two magnets 202, 203, with their north
            and south poles facing each other, with the member 201
            positioned between them, and with the three elements 201-203
            held static with respect to each other. Because of the
            special nature of the material of the member 201 and its
            special atom alignment, it will produce a direct current
            through output line 204 as a result of the gyroscopic
            actions of the particles of the electromagnetic field 205
            produced by the facing magnets 202, 203, on the specially
            aligned atoms in member 201, which phenomenon occurs even
            when and even though the member 201 is completely static
            with respect to the magnets 212, 203. It may be desirable in
            some applications, however, to allow or produce some
            relative movement between the generator elements 201-203.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The output line 204
            extends to an appropriate "load" 206 for using the
            electrical current generated by the generator 200. A return
            line 207 completes the circuit back to the member 201.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Based on experiments to
            date, it is believed that brass and lead are materials that
            can have their atoms especially aligned to interact with the
            gyroscopic particles (analogous to particles 20, 30) flowing
            between the magnets 202, 203 and will substantially contain
            within their surface boundaries the magnetic field produced
            by the aligned atoms or molecules.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With respect to producing
            the proper material with atom alignment for the member 201,
            it is noted that most materials seem to align their atoms in
            random directions when formed by conventional methods of
            production. It can be observed, however, that certain
            materials can be made magnetic by putting the material in an
            electromagnetic field while cooling from a temperature of
            around 1000 degrees C. The magnetism is the result of atom
            alignment of the material in a given direction (See pages
            DD19 through DD21 of the Disclosure Document). All materials
            are affected so as to align parallel or across lines of
            force when in a powerful electromagnetic field. Accordingly,
            if a material while being formed is cooled in an extremely
            powerful electromagnetic field, the atoms of the material
            will take on a particular alignment. The atom alignment
            direction could be varied depending on whether the
            electromagnetic field was aligned with the material or at a
            90 degree angle to the material. This would result in the
            atoms of a material having their particular electromagnetic
            spin direction primarily along the same axis.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Merely having atom
            alignment, however, is not sufficient. Additionally the
            material for the invention should be such that it exhibits
            very little if any magnetic field in the area surrounding
            it. Thus it should be noted that the exterior
            electromagnetic field that occurs from the atom alignment of
            the conventional magnet is not duplicated in the material of
            the invention, because the electromagnetic energy resulting
            from atom alignment in the material of the invention will be
            primarily contained within the boundaries of the material.
            It is believed that lead, made super-conductive by immersion
            in a bath of liquid helium, for example, is such a special
            material and cold serve as the material for member 201.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This then results in
            having a material that would place a force at the proper
            angle on the gyroscopic type particles moving in the
            electromagnetic field so as to cause an EMF to be produced
            even when the material was sitting still (See also the first
            paragraph of page DD23 and paragraphs 4, A through E, of
            page DD19 in the Disclosure Documents).</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is believed that high,
            contained pressures, as well as other methods, can also
            probably produce atom alignment as the atoms of a conductor
            or any material will react to sufficient external force (See
            the first paragraph of page DD35 of the Disclosure
            Document). This possibility also is indicated by the fact
            that hard knocks or impacts will demagnetize a magnet.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The proper procedure of
            material production in achieving atom alignment with
            internally contained fields of force will cause the
            controlled release of electrical energy in electromagnetic
            fields of force when the material of the invention is placed
            in the lines of force of the electromagnetic field.</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) Numerous scientific
            tests and experiments made by the inventor indicate that the
            magnetic field resulting from an electrical current flowing
            through a conductor is the result of atom alignment within
            that conductor at an extremely fast speed with an ability to
            reverse atom alignment just as rapidly without the magnetic
            hysteresis associated with conventional materials considered
            "magnetic". Prior to this time it has been believed and
            taught by the scientific community that the magnetic field
            associated with an electric current carrying conductor was
            the result of the electric current itself and not of the
            conductor material, for example copper, which was considered
            to be "non-magnetic".</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Even the inventor was
            influenced and misled by these teachings and attempted to
            mechanically explain and justify the prior teachings, as is
            seen on page DD27 of the Disclosure Document, which is an
            important part of this patent application.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As taught in the present
            invention, however, what mechanically happens is that the
            gyroscopic particles making up the electric current moving
            in a conductor interact with the electromagnetic makeup of
            the atoms of the conductor, causing them to align extremely
            rapidly, thereby then releasing some of their
            electromagnetic makeup in the form of a magnetic field
            exactly as explained in great detail for conventional
            magnetic materials in the Disclosure Document.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is easily proven and
            understood by taking for example a size 14 gauge conductor
            one foot long, winding it into a coil, and connecting the
            coil to a meter and a 1.5 volt battery. The total current
            registered on the meter will be 1.5 volts and the strength
            of the magnetic field created from the short conductor will
            be extremely small. Next, the same type of test is run again
            but with the length of the conductor increased to 2000 feet,
            for example. The total current registered on the meter will
            now be considerably less, but the strength of the magnetic
            field given off from the conductor will now be extremely
            large!</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This shows that the
            magnetic field is not from the electric current flow, but is
            the result of the interaction of the gyroscopic particles
            that make up the electric current interacting with the atoms
            of the conductor! This causes the gyroscopic particles of
            the electric current not to be able to make the circuit back
            to the battery so quickly, and therefore the meter shows
            less current used.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The magnetic field is the
            result of the atom alignment of the conductor. The more
            atoms in a conductor (up to a point), the stronger the
            magnetic field produced from a given amount of electric
            current input. Again, this is proven by changing the
            diameter of the conducting wires and, with the lengths being
            the same, the strongest magnetic field will result from the
            conductor with the largest diameter. The reason for this is
            that there are more conducting atoms to interact with the
            gyroscopic particles of the electric current moving through
            the conductor, which results in a greater number of
            conducting atoms being aligned, thereby then releasing some
            of their electromagnetic makeup, exactly as has been
            explained in great detail in the Disclosure Document as
            being possible for all matter.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the magnetic field
            produced was strictly based on the amount of current going
            through a conductor, as taught in the prior art, then the
            strongest magnetic field would result when current went
            through a large diameter and short length conductor, because
            the current flow through the entire circuit is greatest at
            that time. However, experiments prove that the shorter a
            conductor is made, the greater the current flow through the
            entire circuit and the less strength of the magnetic field
            surrounding that conductor. The longer that same conductor
            is made (up to a point), the greater the magnetic field
            surrounding the total mass of the conductor and the less
            current that makes the complete circuit of the entire
            system. Reason: more atoms!</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) Numerous scientific
            tests and experiments made by the inventor also indicate
            that the magnetic field created when an electric current
            moves in a conductor does not use up measurable energy when
            performing obvious or unobvious work, force or power. This
            is true no matter how strong or how immense the power of the
            motor or electromagnets is. Reason: the magnetic field
            coming from the conductor is the result of extremely quick
            atom alignment within that conductor. Therefore the energy
            in the magnetic field is the energy that makes up the atom
            of the conductor! This energy is literally Einsteins
            equation of E + MC<sup>2</sup>, and therefore the energy is
            believed to be moving at the speed of light. This energy use
            cannot be measured by todays measuring instruments. This
            has been explained in great detail in the Disclosure
            Document and is believed to be true of all matter.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) The same is true for
            the electric current that comes from a conventional battery.
            The electromagnetic energy coming from the battery is the
            energy that makes up the atoms of the material of the
            battery. Again, this energy use is not measurable by todays
            measuring instruments. Electric meters of all types are
            simply mechanical devices that measure the amount of
            electric current that comes into that instrument. They do
            not measure the amount of mass that has been converted into
            electromagnetic energy.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Present technique in
            science states that the electric energy flowing from a
            battery is used up in the device operated by that flow of
            electric current. This is not true at all! The
            electromagnetic energy released from the atom makeup of a
            battery has a relatively infinite capacity to do obvious
            work, force, or power.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is easily proven even
            with a small motor and a 1.5-volt battery. With a battery
            connected to the motor to operate it and with a meter to
            take readings, the motor is then physically stopped from
            turning by holding or restraining the shaft. At that moment
            the motor is performing no obvious work, force or power, but
            the meter will register a greater flow of current. The
            magnets of the motor can be taken out and the reading will
            be the same. If the electricity was being used to operate
            the motor, the meter would register more current when the
            motor was running.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electric current not
            only will operate the motor but, once it flows through the
            complete circuit back to the battery, it also does
            additional work based on Faradays Laws of Electrolysis
            within the battery itself. What has happened is that the
            electromagnetic energy released from the atoms of the
            material of the battery, once they have completed the
            circuit, then take a "short cut" and move large pieces of
            the mass of one material of the battery over to the other
            material of the battery. The inventor has stated and shown
            throughout the Disclosure Document that the effect of
            gravity was the unobvious effect of electromagnetic energy.
            Once the materials of the battery have combined, the extreme
            desire for the two materials to merge is physically reduced.
            These materials will attempt this merger in any way possible
            and, if the electric current initially released from a
            battery is not allowed by mechanical means to complete the
            circuit back within itself, the electromagnetic energy then
            in the mechanical means will perpetually (in a relative,
            theoretical sense) perform obvious work, force or power. The
            reason: the force that initiated this flow of current
            (electromagnetic makeup of atoms of material) is constant,
            similar to hydraulic pressure, with the noticeable exception
            that it is moving (it is believed) at the speed of light and
            will interact with the electromagnetic makeup of the atoms
            of other materials, causing them to release some of their
            electromagnetic makeup in the form of a magnetic field. This
            then multiplies the capacity for doing obvious or unobvious
            work, force or power, which can then react with another
            conducting coil or with the electromagnetic energy within
            the magnetic field or a conventional magnet and multiply
            this effect even further, on and on for a relatively
            unlimited source of energy.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The same is true in not
            letting the current get back to a conventional generator. If
            a mechanical means is set up so that the electric current is
            "trapped" without completing a circuit, the gyroscopic
            particles of the current have a capacity for continuous work
            without increasing the power input into the generator
            system. If, however, the circuit is complete and the
            electric current moving in the system does absolutely no
            obvious work, power or force, the gyroscopic particles
            making up the current and retuning to the generator will
            then increase the need for more power input into the system.
            The reason is in the opposing effect of magnetic fields as
            defined in Lenzs Law. This law is simply an observation of
            this effect, which before now has never been fully
            understood.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4. Numerous scientific
            tests and experiments made by the inventor also indicate
            that there is a correlation between the electromagnetic spin
            orientation of the atoms of non-conductors, semi-conductors,
            and conductors, and the varying results achieved with an
            electric current in attempting to move through these
            materials, or when moving these materials through a magnetic
            field attempting to induce electric current.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The gyroscopic particles
            in a moving electric current interact with the atoms of the
            material through which the current is moving. Each atom can
            efficiently interact with only an exact amount of electric
            current, and if exceeded, there is an interruption of
            orderly movement. Then the angle of release of the
            gyroscopic particles from the atoms are such that the
            electromagnetic release of the gyroscopic particles are such
            that the electromagnetic release from these atoms are in the
            form of heat, exactly as explained in great detail in the
            Disclosure Document. This effect is easily observed by the
            fact that the resistance decreases relative to an increase
            of the cross-section of the material. Reason: more atoms are
            within that given area, and for a fixed input of electric
            current there are more atoms to receive and interact
            efficiently with the gyro-particles making up the electric
            current.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Again, the same is true
            for resistors designed for deliberately producing heat. Such
            resistors are not materials that are considered to be good
            conductors of electric current. It is stated and shown in
            great detail in the Disclosure Document that the
            electromagnetic spin orientation of the atoms of a
            non-conductor are different from that of conductor atoms,
            and therefore different results will occur from the same
            inputs of electromagnetic energy.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is easily seen by the
            fact that, in a resistor, for a given amount of electric
            current input, the heat release increases as the diameter
            increases. What that means is that the property of
            resistance has decreased. On a conductor it is just the
            opposite. If the diameter is increased the resistance is
            decreased, but so is heat release. Again, this is an
            indication that the gyro-particles in the electric current
            movement interact with each atom of the material.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This same effect shows up
            again in conventional electrical induction from a conductor
            interacting with a magnetic field.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Experiments by the
            inventor have indicated that the property of conventional
            induction is the result of the same property of resistance.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If one increases the
            diameter of a conductor, lengths staying the same, one
            decreases the amount of electric current relative to the
            total number of atoms within the conductors under
            consideration. Or, if one takes a given number of wires of
            the same diameter and length and moves a magnet across them,
            the current produced will be considerably less than if one
            takes the same diameter wire, but only one wire, and
            increases its length considerably and then forms it into a
            coil forming the same number of wires on any one side and
            then moves the same magnet across only one side of that
            coil; the electric current generated will then be
            considerably greater. Reason: the property of resistance.
            This is a mechanical effect within the gyroscopic
            electromagnetic makeup and orientation of the atoms of all
            materials that have the mechanical ability to perform a
            given task efficiently up to a point concerning input of
            additional electromagnetic energy and then mechanically
            causes varying results once this threshold is exceeded.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This and all other
            thoughts and innovations in this and the previous
            disclosures of the previous application and the Disclosure
            Document previously put forth show that there are many
            different mechanical ways to release a relatively unlimited
            source of energy from electromagnetic energy that makes up
            all matter and which results from this invention.</font> </p>

                Working Prototypes ~</font></font></b> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><a href="#new5">Figure
                5</a></b> and <b><a href="#new6">Figure 6</a></b>
            illustrate rough working prototypes of this aspect of the
            invention. These embodiments are only relatively inefficient
            prototypes built by hand for the purpose of demonstrating
            the invention. It should be self-evident that the prototypes
            by various mechanical means and designs can easily be made
            extremely efficient, and the illustrated embodiments are
            being presented only for general representational purposes.</font>
        </p>
        <p>As is illustrated in <b><a href="#new5">Figure 5</a></b>,
          there is provided a combined electrical current generator and
          an electromagnetic motor comprising a rotatable mounted
          permanent magnet 200, a battery 201, brushes and commutator
          202, bearings 203 and power, mounting shaft 204, and a first,
          primary magnetic producing coil 205 and a secondary electrical
          producing coil 206. The two coils 205 and 206 are juxtaposed
          together in parallel disposition with concurrent core center
          lines, with the magnet 200 positioned alongside of coil 205 at
          or near its core center line with the rotational axis of the
          shaft 204 positioned orthogonally to the center line. </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the prototypes a very
            small battery 201, for example size "N" of 1.5 volts is
            used.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the circuit is
            completed, the battery 20 converts an immeasurable amount of
            its mass into electrical current (gyroscopic particles
            moving at the speed of light) which goes through the
            commutator and brushes 202, and then enters magnetic
            producing coil 205 made for example from insulated #14 or
            #15 gauge copper wire with the total weight of the coil 205
            being for example 70 to 90 pounds. This causes the atoms of
            coil 205 to align extremely fast and then release some of
            their electromagnetic makeup (gyroscopic particles) in the
            form of a magnetic field. This field then interacts with the
            gyroscopic particles making up the magnetic field coming
            from the atoms of the material of the permanent magnet 200.
            This causes magnet 200 to attempt to align its magnetic
            field movement with the magnetic field movement coming from
            the atoms of coil 205, resulting in the rotation of magnet
            200 and the shaft 204 to which it is attached. This then
            changes the position of the commutator and brushes 202
            relative to each others initial positions, which then
            causes the electric current coming from battery 201 to be
            going in the opposite direction into coil 205, causing the
            atoms of coil 205 to extremely quickly reverse their
            alignment and the polarity of their magnetic field that they
            are emitting. The reversed field then interacts again with
            the magnetic field of permanent magnet 200, causing it to
            rotate further.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This process is then
            continuously repeated, producing continuous rotation of the
            shaft 204 which can be used as a source of motive power in
            many different ways. A power belt wheel 207, for example,
            using a continuous V-belt is illustrated as a general
            representation of this motive power source for producing
            useful, obvious work. In a prototype test run with a small
            1.5- volt type "N" battery, the shaft 204 and the magnet 200
            rotated at a high speed for approximately 12 hours before
            running down. By improving the particular design features of
            the prototype and by using longer lasting batteries, the
            rotation time of the shaft 204 can be greatly increased to a
            theoretical point approaching "perpetual" for all practical
            purposes. At the same time, the alternating magnetic field
            produced by coil 205 induces into coil 206 electrical
            induction which then causes coil 206 to produce an
            alternating current across its "load", which current can be
            made to exceed the conventional output of battery 201. The
            battery source 201 can be replaced as needed.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is very important to
            understand that the longer the length of the conducting wire
            in coil205, the stronger will be the magnetic field and the
            less electric current that will complete the circuit and get
            back into the battery and destroy the mechanical source of
            the electrical current. This effect can be increased further
            by increasing the diameter of the conducting wire in coil
            205 and then greatly increasing its length still further in
            the coil.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Reason: the gyroscopic
            particles making up the electric current interact with the
            atoms of coil 205. The more atoms in coil 205, relative to
            length, the longer it takes the gyro-particles of the
            electric current to influence them and get out the other end
            of the coil. It is then easily seen that if the direction of
            the current into coil 205 is then reversed, this then
            further increases this lag time. Reason: The gyroscopic
            particles have inertia and are believed to be moving at the
            speed of light and are interacting with the gyroscopic
            particles making up the atoms of conducting coil 205. These
            atoms also have inertia, and when the direction of current
            is reversed into coil 205, the incoming current then
            collides with the current already in coil 206 going in
            opposite directions.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This causes a brief
            hesitation during the time the current already in the coil
            is being forced to reverse its direction of the atoms within
            coil 205 that have already been influenced to become
            aligned. This causes a constant force throughout the
            circuit, but does not allow very much current to get back
            into the battery 201 to destroy the mechanical means that
            initiated the release of electric current in the first
            place.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therefore, it should be
            further understood that the faster the current direction
            reverses into the coil 205, the more efficiently the matter
            of battery 201 is converted into pure electrical energy (E =
            MC<sup>2</sup>) without the destruction of the mechanical
            situation that initiates the electrical current release.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is also important to
            understand that the stronger the magnetic field coming from
            the mass of magnet 200, the greater will be its rotational
            speed. Additionally, the greater the magnetic field coming
            from the mass of coil 205, the greater will be the
            rotational speed of magnet 200 and, up to a point, the
            greater the electric current input from battery 201, the
            greater will be the percentage of the atoms making up coil
            205 that are aligned. This probably has the same
            relationship as does achieving atom alignment in
            conventional magnetic materials. Once complete atom
            alignment is reached in coil 205, no amount of current will
            cause those atoms to increase the strength of the magnetic
            field emitting from those atoms.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therefore, it should be
            clear that for a given input of electric current from
            battery 201, the most efficient design is one in which most
            of the atoms of coil 205 are influenced to atom alignment by
            that given electric current, which means increasing the
            diameter and the length of the conducting wire of coil 205
            to the point that the strength of the magnetic field
            produced is sufficient to cause rotation of the magnet 200
            to a speed that allows none or at least very little of the
            electric current that initially comes from the battery 201
            to complete the circuit and get back into battery 201 and
            destroy or reduce the mechanical effect that induced the
            conversion of the matter of the battery 201 in electric
            current in the first place.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Again this desired effect
            can be increased by increasing the strength of the magnetic
            field given off by the atoms of the permanent magnet 200.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the second embodiment
            of Figure 6, the structure and operation of the prototype is
            substantially identical to that of <b><a href="#new5">Figure




                5</a></b> with the major exception being that the magnet
            300 and shaft 304 elements (and related sub-elements 302,
            303, and 307) are positioned inside of and within the core
            of the primary coil 305, as compared to the placement of the
            magnet 200 and shaft 204 elements next to and along side of
            the coil 205 of <b><a href="#new5">Figure 5</a></b>.
            Therefore, for purposes of brevity, a detailed description
            of the elements of <b><a href="#new6">Figure 6</a></b> will
            not be repeated, but it is noted that the corresponding and

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is also important to
            again stress the fact that the prototype designs shown are
            presented simply to prove the correctness of the invention,
            and it should be clear that the invention can be made
            extremely more efficient by utilizing all of the magnetic
            field produced by coil 205 and designing the magnet 200 of a
            shape and strength that efficiently interacts wit the
            majority of the magnetic fields from coil 205. The
            illustrated prototypes are relatively highly inefficient in
            this regard, but even so, the results of the invention
            itself greatly exceed the prior art as to the use of
            electric current from whatever source and interaction with
            an electric motor or whatever work was conventionally
            performed.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The applicant feels it is
            very important to again stress that, in building many
            varying designs of this invention, consideration must be
            given to the fact that the energy in the field of force of
            any type of magnet is the energy that makes up the atoms of
            the material from which it comes! This energy is a real
            entity with (it is believed) a gyroscopic action. It is
            literally Einsteins equation of E = MC<sup>2</sup>. And it
            is believed that this energy moves at the speed of light and
            makes up all matter, and that this energy has a constant
            pressure effect back to the atoms of the material from which
            it came, similar to hydraulic pressure.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This effect is
            additionally more fully understood by stating the following
            results obtained from experimentation by the applicant in
            the process of this invention.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(a) When the system is
            initially attached to a 1.5 volt size N battery 201 or 301
            and the magnet 200 or 300 and related rotation entities are
            placed close to or in the center of coil 205 or 305, the
            following results are observed:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the electric current
            produced in coil 206 (306) is then fed back into coil 205
            (305) in accordance with proper polarity, the rotation speed
            of magnet 200 (300) will then accelerate. If fed back into
            coil 205 (305) in wrong polarity, the rotation speed of
            magnet 200 (300) will slow down.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This proves that the total
            force from coil 205 (305) interacting with the magnet 200
            (300) is greater when the electrical energy from coil 206
            (306) is fed back into coil 205 (305) than when only the
            initial electrical energy from battery 201 (301) is fed into
            coil 205 (305).</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When two or three
            batteries are electrically connected together in series so
            as to create for example three or four and one-half volts of
            electrical input, this effect is multiplied. Remember that,
            up to a point, the greater the electrical input, the greater
            the percentage of atom alignment within the coil 205 (305).</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This further proves that
            the electric current produced in coil 206 (306) is a result
            of the gyroscopic particles of energy released from the
            magnetic fields that came from the electromagnetic makeup of
            the atoms of coil 205 (305), and is not part of the initial
            electrical energy released from the atoms making up the
            materials of battery 201 (301)! The coil 206 (306) can be
            taken out of the system, or its electrical current fed away
            from the system, and the rotational speed of the magnet 200
            (300) will not observably change. The rotational speed of
            the magnet 200 (300) will noticeably change, however, when
            the electric current from coil 206 (306) is fed back into
            coil 205 (305)!</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now a different result:</font>
        </p>
        <p>(b) When the electric current from battery 201 (301) becomes
          weaker to the point that the magnetic field coming from coil
          205 (305) has weakened and shrunk allowing the magnetic field
          of the rotating magnet 200 (300) to expand and then noticeably
          induce electric current into coil 206 (306) and into coil 205
          (305), then reverse results are observed. When the magnetic
          field from coil 205 (305) is large, then the magnetic field
          from magnet 200 (300) is retained! </p>
        <p>If coil 206 (306) is then short-circuited, the rotation of
          magnet 200 (300) will noticeably slow down. </p>
        <p>If the electric current from coil 206 (306) is fed back into
          coil 205 (305) in wrong polarity, the rotation of the magnet
          200 (300) will stop. If fed back into coil 205 (305) in
          correct polarity, the rotation of the magnet 200 (300) will
          slow down. At that point, the rotation of the magnet 200 (300)
          will not accelerate, no matter how connected! </p>
        <p>These results show that, at this time, the magnetic field
          from magnet 200 (300) noticeably induces a current in coils
          206 (306) and 205 (305) that opposes the rotation of the
          magnet 200 (300). This effect has already been mechanically
          explained, and it has been shown that Lenzs Law was simply an
          observation of that mechanical explanation. </p>
        <p>These results further demonstrate that the expanding and
          collapsing magnetic fields from coil 205 (305) and 206 (306)
          do not noticeably affect each other detrimentally because the
          resulting magnetic fields from all the coils are the results
          of fluctuating atom alignment within the coils! Remember, the
          gyroscopic energy particles making up the magnetic fields have
          a hydraulic pressure effect back to the atoms from which they
          came. Also remember that the atoms making up the material of
          the permanent magnet 200 (300) are stationary as to atom
          alignment direction! Therefore, the pressure effect resulting
          from an opposing field that the magnet 200 (300) induced is
          immediate, as is hydraulic pressure. </p>
        <p>The magnetic field emitted from the atoms of coil 205 (305),
          relative to induction into the atoms of coil 206 (306),
          however, are fluctuating and out of step, so to speak, and
          therefore in harmony with each other. The pressure effect from
          the induction of coil 205 (305) into coil 206 (306) is an
          action of the atoms of coil 205 (305) and back into the atoms
          of coil 206 (306). </p>
        <p>This action is seen again when the invention is hooked into
          115 volt AC, and battery 201 (301) is not used. </p>
        <p>The magnet 200 (300) will not rotate even though the magnetic
          field from coil 205 (305) is strong and is alternating.
          Reason: The fluctuating magnetic field is so fast that the
          inertia mass of magnet 200 (300) cannot get started in one
          direction before the magnetic field from coil 205 (305) has
          reversed, thereby causing magnet 200 (300) to vibrate only
          microscopically at 60 cycles per second. </p>
        <p>And, if a 60-watt bulb is connected to the system of coil 205
          (305), it will light only dimly, and there is a lag time of
          two or three seconds before it lights. </p>
        <p>If then coil 206 (306) is connected to a meter, there is a
          reading of 49 volts, and if the meter is replaced by another
          60-watt bulb, it will light only extremely dimly. The 60-watt
          bulb connected to coil 205 (305), however, will now become
          noticeably brighter! This again shows that the action and
          reaction results of the atoms of the coils are not noticeably
          detrimental to each other because of the lag time (out of
          step, so to speak) resulting in reinforcing the flipping atom
          alignment of the coils. </p>
        <p>From this further explanation of the invention it is seen
          that desirable results may be obtained by the following: </p>
        <p>For example, in <b><a href="#new6">Figure 6</a></b> the
          magnet 300 may be of a design and/or be located at a distance
          from the inside diameter of coil 305 and coil 306, whereby the
          majority of the magnetic field from the magnet 300 do not cut
          the conducting loops of coil 305 or 306. Yet the alternating
          magnetic field produced by coil 305 should efficiently have
          the majority of its gyroscopic particles interacting with the
          majority of the gyroscopic particles making up the magnetic
          field of the permanent magnet 300, but not directly reacting
          with the atoms making up coil 305, or magnet 300! </p>
        <p>When the magnetic lines of force of the magnet 200 (300)
          cross at right angles with the conducting wires of coil 205
          (305), 206 (306), a braking action is incurred. It should be
          noted that, as the inner diameter of coil 205 (305) increases,
          the percentage of time of braking effect decreases. </p>
        <p>Along this same line of instruction, the commutator segments
          202 (302) can be made of a large diameter and the area of
          brushes made small, whereby, when the brushes cross over the
          gaps in the commutator segments, there will be no short
          circuit at any tie directly back to the battery 201 (301). </p>
        <p>By combining the slip rings and brushes (the slip rings can
          be made of a small diameter) to the side or sides of the
          brushes and commutator segments 202 (302), then battery 201
          (301) does not have to rotate with magnet 200 (300). </p>
        <p>The no. 14 and No. 15 gauge copper insulated wire of 70 and
          90 pounds (31.5 and 40.5 kilograms) used for the motor coil
          205 (305) and the generator coil 206 (306) respectively in the
          first hand-made prototypes of the embodiments of <b><a
              href="#new5">Figure 5</a></b> and <b><a href="#new6">Figure




              6</a></b> for demonstration purposes only, come in
          standard buckets of varying weights from wholesale outlets. It
          was then wound in coils as shown and, as taught, the more
          conducting wire sued, the better the results. The magnets 200
          and 300 were each initially about a 2-1/2 inches (6.25 cm)
          cube and can be any size and strength desired. </p>
        <p>In a further, rough, hand built demonstration, working
          prototype of the invention of the type illustrated in <b><a
              href="#new6">Figure 6</a></b>, the primary motor coil 305
          was made of No. 5 gauge copper wire in a single, continuous
          wire form weighing approximately 4,100 pounds (1,845 kg.) with
          a coil lop diameter of 4-1/2 feet (135 cm), while the
          secondary or generator coil 306 was made of No. 24 gauge
          copper wire in a single, continuous wire form weighing
          approximately 300 pounds (145 kg) with the same, approximate
          loop diameter of 4-1/2 feet (135 cm) with both coils 305, 306
          coincidently forming a cylinder of approximately 30 inches (75
          cm) in length. The coils 305, 306 were built around a
          cylindrical fiberglass core body of approximately 200 pounds
          (90 kg) having a vertical longitudinal center-line axis. </p>
        <p>The rotating magnet 300 was made up of six separate parallel
          cylindrical magnetic columns spaced and disposed about the
          periphery of a hollow cylindrical fiberglass surface of
          approximately 20 inches (50 cm) diameter. Each column was 30
          inches (75 cm) long and was composed of a stack of 70
          individual ceramic ring magnets in disc form as made by
          Jobmaster Magnets (Randallstown, MD 21133 USA). Each disc had
          a thickness of 7/16 inch (1.09375 cm), an inner diameter of
          one inch (2.5 cm) and an outer diameter of 4 inches (10 cm).
          The discs were stacked and secured together in 4-inch (10 cm)
          diameter fiberglass tubes longitudinally mounted on the inner
          surface of the 20-inch (50 cm) diameter fiberglass cylinder.
          The composite magnet 300 had a total weight of approximately
          400 pounds (180 kg) and a total length of 30 inches (75 cm)
          and an approximate diameter of 20 inches (50 cm). </p>
        <p>The magnet 300 was mounted for rotation on a horizontal shaft
          304 extending across the hollow core of the coils 305, 306
          crossing through the center point of the longitudinal
          center-line of the cylinder and orthogonal to the longitudinal
          center-line of the magnet 300 for rotation within the open
          center area of the cylindrically disposed coils 305 and 306
          with the longitudinal center-lines of the coils being
          vertically disposed. </p>
        <p>With a DC battery source 301 of two 12-volt lantern batteries
          and seventeen 6-volt lantern batteries all ins series
          (totaling 126 volts), a measured voltage of 126 volts and a
          measured current of 99 milliamps was noted in the primary coil
          305. Concurrently a voltage reading of 640 volts and an
          amperage measurement in excess of 20 milliamps were noted in
          the secondary or generating coil 306, with the magnet 300
          rotating at a speed of 120 rpm. Thus the system was outputting
          and producing in the generating coil 306 useable electricity
          in excess of 102 % of that being input in the motor coil 305!
          This excess useful electrical energy of course is in addition
          to the further useful mechanical energy available at the
          exemplary drive takeoff 307 on the rotating shaft 304, on
          which the 400-pound, 30-inch long magnet 300 was rotating at
          120 rpm! </p>
        <p>Thus the invention, by utilizing the energy of the gyroscopic
          particles in the magnetic field, produces a greater energy
          output than the energy input to the system, thus producing
          results beyond presently accepted scientific teachings of the
          world. </p>
        <p>This prototype achieves exactly what has already been
          described in great detail in applicants prior patent
          applications. In this prototype there was simply used a
          stronger magnet and a larger diameter conducting wire of great
          length that has a considerably greater number of atoms aligned
          when current is put into the system, and used a greater number
          of atoms in the generator coil of fine diameter conducting
          wire. </p>
        <p>While the results of the energy released from this particular
          prototype is highly impressive to others, applicant still has
          only scratched the surface of the energy that can be released
          using the principles of the present invention. </p>
        <p>Again, as has already been stressed, the most efficient
          design is one in which the least amount of input of current
          causes the greatest amount of atom alignment. </p>
        <p>This data does not constitute any departure from the
          applicants previous work, but is only to further document
          that which has already been stressed in the prior patent
          applications. </p>
        <p>Varying the DC voltage for the battery source 301 shows that
          obvious efficiency will continue will continue to rise as the
          voltage input goes up! </p>
        <p>Also, the leverage factor advantage of the invention,
          combined with the inertia of the 400-pound magnet 300 rotating
          at 120 rpm (even while causing the electrical generator to put
          out over 100% of energy input) proves the invention to be
          greatly over 100% efficient even at this slow rpm. </p>
        <p>It is contemplated that the next prototype will use
          super-conducting type material for the coil 305 with a magnet
          300 having a magnetic material comparable to that of
          cryogenic-type magnet relative to percentage of atom alignment
          or size. </p>
        <p>This will result in the size of the invention being much
          smaller and yet with the available work output being much
          greater than the prototype just described. Reason: The most
          efficient type design is one whereby the least amount of
          current input into the motor coil produces the greatest atom
          alignment of said motor coil and having rotatable magnet also
          comparable in strength, relative to size. </p>
        <p>The invention can be made without using the coil 206 (306)
          and producing just useful mechanical energy. </p>
        <p>Coil 206 (306) can be merged or wound with coil 205 (305). </p>
        <p>The magnet 200 (300) can be an electromagnet, a permanent
          magnet, a cryogenic magnet, or any magnet. </p>
        <p>The design of magnet 200 (300) can create a strong but
          retained magnetic field. </p>
        <p>The design of coil 205 (305) can be used to further retain
          the magnetic field of magnet 200 (300). </p>
        <p>Alternating current can be used in place of the DC battery
          201 (301), if the magnet 200 (300) is designed accordingly. </p>
        <p>The coils 205 (305) and 206 (306) may be made up of several
          coils rather than a single coil. </p>
        <p>The magnet 200 (300) may be made up of several individual
          magnets rather than from just a single magnet. </p>
        <p>From the foregoing it should be understood that, unlike the
          teachings of the prior art, the following is desired in the
          design of the coil 205 (305) under the principles of the
          present invention: </p>
