      <p><b>The AquaPro WaterBoxx</b> </p>
      <p>In the WaterBoxx the condensation and rain is collected. By
        means of adequate storage the evaporation of this water is
        prevented. The exactly right angle and the low frictional
        coefficient of the collecting piece guarantee that the water
        keeps falling into the reservoir. The WaterBoxx distributes
        exactly the right quantity to the roots of the young tree. </p>
      <p>How can the roots penetrate the hard soil? </p>
      <p>The young tree is placed in the middle of the AquaPro WaterBoxx
        – almost – on top of the hard soil. The minimum quantity of
        water moisturizes the soil under the reservoir without the
        danger of evaporation. The water restores the natural
        capillarity of the soil. In the minute canals which are created
        in this way the root finds its way without any problem, even
        around stones and rocks. Trees have been doing this for millions
        of years. This phenomenon of restored capillarity is also found
        when you turn a tile, even if it has been lying in the sun for
        quite some time. Under it you will find moist soil... </p>
      <p><b>Using the WaterBoxx</b> </p>
      <p>The WaterBoxx can be used to plant trees (or for example corn).
        The instrument is an ‘aid’ at the beginning of this process. In
        many places on earth there is sufficient water in the ground and
        there even is sufficient water in rocks: many mountains are
        covered with forests. In most cases the problem a tree
        encounters has nothing to do with the lack of capillary water
        when it has roots, but with the lack of water during the
        post-planting period. </p>
      <p>When you have a dry spot or dig a hole to plant a tree during a
        dry spell and afterwards no rain fails to fall, the ground turns
        into dust – because the capillary does not yet work, no water is
        transported upwards – and the recently planted tree dies because
        the root-hairs do not find any water. When the soil has turned
        into dust, there is a big chance it either blows or washes away.
      </p>
      <p>With the aid of the WaterBoxx we plant the tree ON the soil and
        so we do not dig a planting hole. The WaterBoxx daily
        distributes a very small quantity of water to the roots of the
        tree that are ON the ground – so where the capillary has stayed
        intact – so that the tree does not die after planting. Now the
        tree has sufficient strength to look for water itself and the
        roots slowly penetrate the soil. As the capillary has not been
        destroyed because no planting hole has been dug, the young tree
        already finds sufficient water after 1 to 2 years to be able to
        survive independently. </p>
      <p>When the tree is strong enough to survive, the WaterBoxx can
        simply be removed by lifting it in order to be used for the
        planting of the next tree. In this way you can plant trees with
        a WaterBoxx time and again. So it is also a very easy way to
        plant your garden if you live in a dry area or a good solution
        if you cannot water your garden during your holidays. <br>

        <p><i><font size="+1">New Dutch Invention Wins Prestigious
              Innovation Technology Award</font></i></p>
      </center>
      <p>A new Dutch breakthrough invention makes it possible to
        reforest large desert and rocky areas on the planet in the
        coming years. Experiments in the Sahara desert have shown that
        the WaterBoxx allows trees to grow under harsh conditions and
        can provide them with sufficient water. </p>
      <p>The invention of the Dutch businessman and inventor Pieter Hoff
        has won the prestigious Beta Dragons Award during the annual
        Flying Dutchman 2008, Science &amp; Technology Summit in
        Amsterdam. A board of scientists and captains of industry
        proclaimed his design to be the most promising and innovative
        project. Philips CEO Gerard Kleisterlee handed him the
        corresponding amount of 10.000 euro. </p>
      <p>The WaterBoxx looks like a plastic, rectangular bucket, with a
        hole in the centre, allowing the tree to be planted in the soil.
        The sophistically designed top catches water from condensation
        at night. Together with the rainwater from rare showers, it is
        distributed in small doses to the tree inside. Additionally the
        WaterBoxx prevents water in the top soil layers from evaporating
        and protects the roots against sun, wind, weeds or rodents.
        After a year the tree is strong enough to grow by itself and the
        WaterBoxx can be removed. </p>
      <p>"Trees can grow in arid areas but are not able to germinate.
        The WaterBoxx gives them a head start", Hoff explains. </p>
      <p>Recently, he successfully tested his invention in de Moroccan
        Sahara. 90 Percent of the trees planted with a WaterBoxx were
        alive and green after a few months in the extreme hot summer. 90
        Percent of the trees planted without the WaterBoxx died however,
        although they had been watered every week. </p>
      <p>Hoff is convinced that, if the right species are planted, large
        parts of the earth can be reforested, without sacrificing
        agricultural land. He is seeking investors to apply his
        invention in the Middle East, India, Africa and other arid
        territories. Hoff: "If we can reforest 2 billion hectares, the
        trees consume more CO2 than men produces and the whole CO2
        problem will be solved." His WaterBoxx will be available from
        July 1, 2009. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] The invention relates to a plant aid for protecting a
        young plant, comprising a tube at least partly sideways
        surrounding a young plant placeable in the plant aid. </p>
      <p>[0002] Such a plant aid is, for instance, known from
        international patent publication WO 0000015 for protecting young
        plants during afforestation. </p>
      <p>[0003] After planting young plants, losses often occur due to
        lack of moisture. This is because the young plant has no or
        hardly any root structures which are able to absorb water from
        the subsoil, while the plant does lose moisture due to
        evaporation. In addition, by digging a planting hole, the
        capillary action of the soil is broken, so that no upward water
        transport from the subsoil takes place. Of course, the losses
        after planting the young plants entail extra work, like removing
        dead plant material and placing new plants. </p>
      <p>[0004] The invention contemplates obtaining a plant aid
        according to the opening paragraph whereby above-mentioned
        drawbacks are obviated while maintaining the advantages. In
        particular, the invention contemplates obtaining a plant aid
        whereby loss of the young plant due to lack of moisture is
        prevented. To this end, the plant aid further comprises a water
        collection sheet for collecting moisture present in the
        atmosphere, the water collection sheet being provided with a
        water collection surface comprising a receiving surface, which
        receiving surface operatively makes a first angle with respect
        to the orientation of gravity, and a collecting surface
        adjoining a lower edge of the receiving surface, which
        collecting surface operatively makes a second angle with respect
        to the orientation of gravity, the first angle being smaller
        than the second angle. </p>
      <p>[0005] By use of the water collection sheet, moisture present
        in the atmosphere, such as rain, hail and/or snow, but also
        water vapor, can be collected relatively simply. The collected
        moisture can then be used to make up the moisture shortage of
        the plant. </p>
      <p>[0006] Since the water collection sheet can extend further
        sidewards than the tube of the plant aid, the effective surface
        for receiving the moisture is increased. As a result, more water
        becomes available for the young plant than the inner space of
        the tube as it is could collect from precipitation. </p>
      <p>[0007] The water collection sheet collects moisture present in
        the atmosphere in liquid form via the receiving surface and the
        collecting surface of the water collection surface. Under the
        influence of gravity, the moisture flows to lower parts of the
        water collection surface. Frozen moisture, such as hail and/or
        snow, also finds its way to the lower parts of the water
        collection surface in such a manner. </p>
      <p>[0008] Further, the water collection sheet according to the
        invention is also arranged for collecting moisture present in
        the atmosphere in gaseous phase, i.e. water vapor. In suitable
        environmental conditions, such as a temperature of the water
        collection surface below the dew point and a sufficiently high
        humidity of the air, water vapor condenses on the receiving
        surface of the water collection surface. The water vapor
        precipitates on the receiving surface in the form of moisture
        drops. Under the influence of gravity, the moisture drops slide
        down along the receiving surface until they arrive at the lower
        edge of the receiving surface at the collecting surface. During
        the sliding down of the moisture drops, their size increases,
        since the condensed drops flow together due to cohesion. When
        they have arrived at the collecting surface, the larger drops
        slide to the lower part of the water collection surface. Since
        the first angle is smaller than the second angle, the component
        of gravity along the incline of the receiving surface is larger
        than the component of gravity along the incline of the
        collecting surface. As a result, gravity can relatively easily
        overcome the adhesion between the condensed drops and the
        receiving surface, so that the drops move downwards. Further,
        gravity can also relatively easily overcome the adhesion between
        the relatively large drops and the collecting surface in spite
        of the smaller incline, because the ratio of the magnitude of
        the adhesive force with respect to gravity decreases due to the
        larger volume of the drops. Due to the structure of the water
        collection sheet according to the invention, thus, small
        condensed drops can also gather at lower parts of the water
        collection sheet. Since, in this manner, relatively much
        moisture can be collected from the atmosphere, also, relatively
        much moisture can be supplied to the young plant to make up the
        shortage of moisture, so that loss of the young plant will
        decrease. In the collection of moisture present in the
        atmosphere, only passive structures are used which do not
        consume any external energy during use and do not comprise any
        moving parts. </p>
      <p>[0009] In addition, by use of a receiving surface with a
        relatively small angle with respect to the orientation of
        gravity, further, the effective surface for condensation of
        moisture drops is relatively high, which is favorable to the
        amount of collected moisture. </p>
      <p>[0010] The collection of water from the atmosphere by means of
        condensation also enables planting relatively dry and/or rocky
        areas. Soils containing salt or brackish water are also eligible
        for planting, since, due to the increased available moisture
        amount, segments in the subsoil can be formed with fresh water.
        In addition, plants and trees can be planted in an earlier
        stage, since the organism is better sheltered and taken care of
        by the plant aid according to the invention than in the case of
        the known plant aid. Of course, this has the advantage that
        fewer costs are involved for obtaining the younger plants. In
        addition, transport costs are lower. As a result of the constant
        water supply, the young plant can be planted on the soil instead
        of in a planting hole to be dug. Thus, the capillary of the soil
        is not disturbed and planting can also be done on rocky soils. </p>
      <p>[0011] It is noted that a young plant is understood to mean a
        young plant in an early stage, such as a cultivated plant, young
        tree or shrub, but also just germinated plant material, a seed
        or a spore. </p>
      <p>[0012] It is further noted that the tube surrounds the young
        plant at least partly sideways. Of course, it is also possible
        for the tube to be designed to be closed all round, so that the
        tube completely surrounds the plant. However, it is also
        possible to leave an opening or crack clear, for instance for
        providing germ material in the tube, after the plant aid has
        been positioned on the subsoil. Preferably, the young plant is
        provided such that the tube at least partly surrounds the root
        structure or root structure to be formed. The stalk, stem,
        branches and/or leaves are then substantially above the upper
        edge of the tube, so that sufficient air flowing along is
        available for the plant. Of course, it is also possible to
        position the young plant differently, for instance with the
        leaves at least partly below the upper edge of the tube, so that
        a better mechanical protection of the young plant is obtained. </p>
      <p>[0013] In addition, it is noted that the number of receiving
        and/or collecting surfaces of the water collection surface can
        be chosen freely, but is not limited to one. Thus, the water
        collection surface may comprise, for instance, ten to twenty
        receiving and collecting surfaces. Of course, other numbers are
        also possible, for instance hundred. Further, one or a multiple
        number of water collection sheets can be used. </p>
      <p>[0014] Thus, the plant aid according to the invention does not
        only act as protection from physical influences from outside,
        but also for supporting the plant and for stimulating growth of
        the young plant. </p>
      <p>[0015] Preferably, the first angle, i.e. the angle which the
        receiving surface makes with respect to the orientation of
        gravity, is smaller than approximately 45.degree., more
        preferably smaller than approximately 30.degree., so that
        condensed drops relatively easily move downwards. </p>
      <p>[0016] The second angle, i.e. the angle which the collecting
        surface makes with respect to the orientation of gravity, is
        preferably larger than approximately 45.degree., more preferably
        larger than approximately 60.degree., so that, with a constant
        width of the water collection sheet, still relatively much
        daylight and/or sunlight and/or ventilation remains available
        which can reach the young plant. Of course, the receiving and/or
        collecting surface may also be oriented differently with respect
        to gravity, for instance approximately 60.degree. and
        70.degree., respectively. </p>
      <p>[0017] A receiving surface and/or collecting surface may have a
        substantially flat design. However, it is also possible for the
        receiving and/or collecting surface to have a curved design.
        Thus, the receiving surface and the collecting surface can merge
        into each other without a bend. In the framework of this
        application, `the angle made by a surface` is understood to mean
        `the angle made by a tangent of at least one segment of the
        surface`. </p>
      <p>[0018] In an advantageous manner, the collecting surface
        comprises a channel section, so that moisture drops can
        specifically be guided to a lower part of the water collection
        sheet. Of course, other sections are also possible, such as a
        flat or slightly curved section. Preferably, the channel section
        has a base with a minimal width of approximately 5 mm in cross
        section, so that, during sliding downwards, water drops
        experience relatively few hindering adhesive forces from the
        side walls of the channel sections. The base has, for instance,
        a width in the range of approximately 5-15 mm, depending on the
        drop size to be expected. The drop size can be estimated on the
        basis of the distance maximally covered by the drop over a
        receiving and collecting surface. Of course, other dimensions of
        the base are also possible, for instance approximately 20 mm. </p>
      <p>[0019] By designing the water collection surface to be
        substantially funnel-shaped, the collected moisture can easily
        be guided to the inside of the tube, so that the moisture
        benefits the plant. In addition, relatively much daylight and/or
        sunlight and/or ventilation is available to the young plant so
        that fungal growth is prevented and assimilation and/or
        ventilation processes are minimally influenced. However, the
        water collection surface may be designed differently, for
        instance as a cone frustum which has the largest diameter at the
        bottom side. The collected moisture can then be collected at the
        edges. </p>
      <p>[0020] Preferably, the water collection surface comprises a
        projecting structure which is operatively oriented substantially
        upwards, while the surface of the projecting structure at least
        partly forms the receiving surface. Thus, it is possible to form
        relatively many receiving surfaces with respect to the sideward
        extension of the water collection sheet, so that the amount of
        collected moisture increases with constant transverse dimensions
        of the sheet. The projecting structure comprises, for instance,
        balls, pyramids, and/or rib sections. </p>
      <p>[0021] Preferably, the plant aid further comprises a reservoir
        for storing collected moisture, so that the availability of the
        moisture can be regulated. Thus, the amount of moisture
        collected in a short time can be supplied to the plant over a
        longer period. All collected moisture can be guided into the
        reservoir. However, it is also possible to store only a part in
        the reservoir and to guide another part of the collected
        moisture directly to the plant. </p>
      <p>[0022] By providing the reservoir substantially below the water
        collection sheet, the collected water can remain relatively
        cool, so that undesired evaporation is prevented. In addition,
        this yields a relatively stable construction which falls over
        less easily during the occurrence of, for instance, whirlwinds.
        The young plant is thus better protected against external
        influences. </p>
      <p>[0023] By providing the reservoir with at least one irrigation
        point for supplying moisture present in the reservoir to a
        subsoil located therebelow, the moisture can be supplied from
        the reservoir in a dosed manner, so that the young plant is
        regularly provided with moisture. </p>
      <p>[0024] Preferably, the top side of the water collection surface
        is further provided with an adhesion-reducing cover layer, for
        instance from PET and/or Teflon, so that a water-repellent
        effect is obtained. Thus, water drops can reach lower parts of
        the water collection surface more easily, so that the amount of
        collected moisture increases. Of course, other materials are
        also possible for forming a cover layer, such as a wax or
        silicone product. </p>
      <p>[0025] By further providing the water collection sheet with
        thermal insulation material on the bottom side, heat exchange
        between the water collection sheet and the ambient air is
        limited. As a result, a temperature difference between the sheet
        and the ambient air can be maintained relatively long, for
        instance after a cool night. The water collection sheet
        maintains a relatively low temperature, also when the
        temperature of the ambient air increases, so that the
        condensation process, in which warm air flowing along cools down
        and condensation occurs, lasts relatively long, and consequently
        also the water collection process. Thus, the temperature of the
        sheet follows the variation in temperature of the ambient air in
        a delayed manner. Upon cooling down of the ambient air, for
        instance in the evening after a warm day, the dew occurring
        precipitates on the water collection sheet. In order to maintain
        temperature differences between the air and the sheet as along
        as possible, the water collection sheet may also be provided
        with material having a high specific heat. </p>

      <p>[0042] The Figures are only schematic representations of the
        invention and are exclusively given by way of non-limitative
        exemplary embodiments. </p>
      <p>[0043] FIG. 1 shows a schematic side elevational view of a
        first embodiment of a plant aid 1 according to the invention.
        The plant aid 1 comprises a tube 2 which sideways surrounds a
        young plant 3 such that the young plant 3 is completely enclosed
        sideways. The tube is open on the top side and bottom side, so
        that the plant can root downwards and can grow upwards. The
        young plant 3 is rooted in a soil block 4 which is positioned in
        the tube 2 such that the root structure 4a of the plant 3 is
        surrounded by the tube 2, while the lower side of the stalk is
        at the height of the lower edge of the water collection surface.
        Thus, the plant 3 is in the light and sufficient flowing air is
        available. The soil block 4 comprises a substance, for instance
        soil or substrate, and is provided in the opening of the tube
        wall 2 in clamped manner. The substance is optionally provided
        with symbiotic bacteria, eggs of animals, seeds, fungi, spores
        and/or organic and/or inorganic materials for nutrition of the
        plant 3, the so-called graft. If the plant aid is manufactured
        from degradable organic material, a graft may also be provided
        in this material. For an improved stability, the soil block 4
        may optionally be placed further down the tube 2. </p>
      <p>[0044] The plant aid 1 further comprises at least one graft
        shell 5 for supplying nutrients to the young plant 3. The graft
        shell 5 is preferably in the soil block 4 enclosed by the tube 2
        and comprises at least one package which is degraded under the
        influence of erosion and/or bacterial action for a prolonged
        period, for instance months or years. In the package(s),
        material is present which stimulates the growth of the plant 3
        and/or improves the condition of the plant 3, such as for
        instance nutrients and/or symbiotic bacteria. By using packages
        with different degradation periods, the substances present
        therein become available to the plant 3 in a dosed manner, so
        that, in the relatively long term, graft substances can
        autonomously be supplied to the plant 3. It will be clear to a
        skilled person that, instead of a graft shell 5, other means may
        also be used to nourish the plant, such as the above-described
        materials in the soil block 4. </p>
      <p>[0045] The tube 2 is placed on the surface 6 of a subsoil 7.
        Preferably, the subsoil 7 has not been priorly treated or only
        slightly scraped, so that the capillary 23 of the subsoil 7 has
        not been broken. This prevents the occurrence unnecessary
        evaporation of moisture present in the subsoil 7. In addition,
        this stimulates that a constant supply of moisture continues to
        take place from the subsoil upwards by means of the non-broken
        capillary. Also, less erosion occurs. In addition, the
        above-described method saves labor-intensive treatments, such as
        for instance digging a hole in the subsoil. After the plant tube
        1 has been placed, the young plant 3 roots in the subsoil 7 and
        directly comes into contact the capillary moisture 23, so that
        the plant is directly supplied with a daily constant amount of
        moisture both from the subsoil 7 and from the plant tube.
        Incidentally, it is possible to priorly treat the subsoil 7, so
        that the root structure of the plant can be provided into the
        subsoil 7. This can increase the chance of the plant 3
        successfully striking root with sufficiently present moisture
        and a still lower loss can be expected. </p>
      <p>[0046] The plant aid 1 further comprises a substantially
        funnel-shaped water collection sheet 8 with a water collection
        surface 9 comprising receiving and collecting surfaces 10, 11
        which will be discussed in more detail with reference to FIGS.
        2-5. The water collection surface 9 is provided with an
        adhesion-reducing cover layer or manufactured from
        water-repellent material or otherwise processed chemically
        and/or mechanically so that the surface is water-repellent to
        prevent adhesion of water drops to the surface 9 and to promote
        mutual cohesion between the water drops. </p>
      <p>[0047] Collecting surfaces 11 all open only partly or not at
        all into the tube 2, so that collected moisture from the
        atmosphere, such as rainwater and condensation water can
        directly benefit the young plant 3, if desired. Further, in the
        water collection surface 9, openings 12 are provided which serve
        as inlet points for letting moisture on the water collection
        surface 9 through to a reservoir 13 located below the water
        collection sheet, so that the collected moisture can be stored.
        The reservoir 13 rests on the surface 6 of the subsoil 7, so
        that a stable position of the plant aid 1 is obtained. Further,
        due to the covering of the environment of the young plant by the
        plant aid, the growth of plant material in the immediate
        proximity of the young plant 3 is prevented, so that as much
        light as possible and as many available nutrients in the subsoil
        7 as possible benefit the young plant 3. The presence of the
        reservoir 13 also limits evaporation of moisture from the
        subsoil around the plant 3. In the reservoir 13 shown, an amount
        of moisture 19 is already present. The reservoir is provided
        with one or a multiple number of irrigation points for supplying
        moisture present in the reservoir 13 to the subsoil 7 located
        therebelow. </p>
      <p>[0048] The irrigation point shown is designed as a hollow
        needle 14 which serves as a dripper. With the aid of the hollow
        needle 14, the moisture present in the reservoir can be
        introduced into the subsoil 7 in a dosed manner, so that durable
        fresh water supply is realized. The reservoir 11 with the
        irrigation point also allows relatively large amounts of
        rainwater collected in a relatively short period to still be
        supplied to the subsoil 7 for a relatively long time. The hollow
        needle 14 also serves as an anchoring for further increasing the
        stability of the plant aid 1. Of course, it is possible to
        implement the irrigation point differently, for instance as an
        opening in the bottom 16 of the reservoir 13, or as a capillary
        string. The dosage of the flow of moisture to be supplied to the
        subsoil 7 is optionally settable with the aid of extra
        regulating means. The regulating means comprise, for instance, a
        permeable film or a membrane provided in the passage of the
        hollow needle 14. </p>
      <p>[0049] The reservoir 13 comprises an outflow channel 15, also
        called overflow pipe, of which a first end 17 is operatively
        located above the bottom of the reservoir 13 and of which a
        second end 18 connects to the irrigation point, in the
        embodiment shown the hollow needle 14. By use of the overflow
        pipe 15, it is achieved that solid particles in the stored
        moisture 19, such as dirt and/or dust, which are on the bottom
        16 of the reservoir 13 up to the level of the first end 17 of
        the overflow pipe 15 do not reach the subsoil 7 via the
        irrigation points. This prevents blockage of the irrigation
        points. The overflow pipe 15 thus acts as a simply provided
        filter for settled solid particles in the stored moisture 19. </p>
      <p>[0050] The dosage of the flow of moisture to be supplied to the
        subsoil is also optionally settable with the aid of extra
        regulating means. The opening of an irrigation point, for
        instance the hollow needle 14 or an opening in the bottom of the
        reservoir, is closed by a slidable plate 26 which can be slid
        into a sliding direction D by means of a drive element designed
        as pin 27, as shown in FIG. 7. A first part 25A of the
        irrigation opening cleared by the plate 26, and a second part
        25B of the opening is closed by the plate. By sliding, the
        irrigation point becomes larger or smaller so that the dose
        becomes larger or smaller. By providing a calibration 28 on the
        pin 27, the supply can be regulated, optionally depending on the
        amount of moisture collected by the plant tube. In addition, due
        to the sliding plate 26, any blockage of the irrigation point
        can be removed. Due to the substantially triangular shape of the
        opening 25A, 25B and the substantially rectangular shape of the
        sliding plate 26, the sliding plate 26 acts as a razor so that
        blockages can be removed more easily. Of course, the geometry of
        the plate 26 and the opening 25A, 25B can also be chosen
        differently, for instance as a triangle and a rectangle,
        respectively. </p>
      <p>[0051] An alternative solution for supplying the moisture 19 to
        the subsoil in a dosed manner is shown in FIG. 11a. This Figure
        shows that the bottom 16 of the reservoir is provided with a
        push element 50 reaching inwards. The push element comprises an
        elevated bottom part 51 of which one or more side walls 52
        define an exit opening in the bottom 16. </p>
      <p>[0052] In the embodiment shown, a strip-shaped push element 50
        is provided which has a tunnel-shaped design and which is
        provided with two exit openings 53A, 53B. It will be clear that
        it is also possible to use more or fewer push elements 50, and
        to provide, for instance, one exit opening 53, or more exit
        openings 53 per push element 50. </p>
      <p>[0053] If desired, the exit openings 53 can be closed in an
        elegant manner with a slide 54 which reaches, near the exit
        openings 53, through a recess 55 in the side wall 52 of the push
        element 50. </p>
      <p>[0054] With the aid of the slide 54, the surface of the exit
        opening 53 can be set, so that the flow of moisture 19 exiting
        from the reservoir can be set. </p>
      <p>[0055] In an elegant manner, the exit openings 53 of multiple
        push elements 50 can be operated simultaneously, for instance
        with the aid of a forked slide 54. Optionally, the slide may be
        provided with a calibration 57. </p>
      <p>[0056] In an alternative embodiment, as shown in FIG. 11B, the
        slides 54 can extend through the openings 53A, 53B of the
        tunnel-shaped push elements 50. In such a variant, widenings are
        provided in the slide 54 which can close and clear the openings
        as shown in FIGS. 11B1 and 11B2, respectively. </p>
      <p>[0057] FIG. 11C shows a further embodiment, in which the push
        elements 50 are aligned. The push elements are, just like with
        the variant of FIG. 11C, each provided with openings 53A, 53B.
        In this embodiment, the slide 54 reaches through the aligned
        openings 53A, 53B, such that the slide 54 closes the openings
        53A, 53B in the push elements 50. By adjustment of the slide 54,
        more or fewer push elements can be released for discharging
        moisture via their openings 53A, 53B. In this variant, the push
        elements 50 may, for instance, also have a hemispherical or
        disc-shaped design, and holes 55 may be provided in the wall 52
        of the push elements 50. </p>
      <p>[0058] The supply systems shown in FIGS. 11A, 11B1, 11B2 and
        11C are particularly advantageous, because they can be realized
        with a minimal number of additional parts. In particular, the
        push elements can easily be provided during the manufacture of
        the reservoir, and the operating slide can simply be introduced
        later. </p>
      <p>[0059] The regulating means may, for instance, also comprise a
        permeable film, a capillary string or a membrane provided in the
        passage of the hollow needle 14. By use of the slidable plate
        26, it is advantageously possible to adjust the supply rate in
        the course of time. </p>
      <p>[0060] In addition, the reservoir 13 is provided with an
        overflow opening 21 in the tube 22 of the reservoir 13, so that
        excess moisture can flow away easily. The overflow opening 21 is
        positioned just above the level of the opening 12. </p>
      <p>[0061] On the bottom side, the water collection sheet 8 is
        provided with thermal insulation material 20, so that a
        temperature difference between the water collection surface 9
        and the surrounding atmosphere is maintained as long as possible
        to promote the dew and condensation process. The bottom side of
        the insulation material may have either a horizontal or a
        concave or convex design, the concave shape preventing the
        evaporation of the moisture stored in the reservoir 13. </p>
      <p>[0062] Further, on the outside, the plant aid is provided with
        eyes 29. Through the eyes 29, an anchoring pin 30 may be
        provided for anchoring the plant aid to the subsoil 7.
        Optionally, on the pin, at different distances, a hook 31 is
        provided which can engage an eye of the plant aid. Thus, a pin
        can carry the plant aid at a desired height. Also, the
        orientation of the plant aid can be set, so that the plant aid
        can be positioned substantially horizontally on an inclined,
        sloping subsoil, as shown in FIG. 8. Preferably, the eyes are
        evenly distributed over the perimeter of the plant aid, for
        instance at every 90.degree.. The pin is further optionally
        provided with arms extending substantially sideways, so that the
        pin can be stabilized sideways against the surface 6 of the
        subsoil 7. </p>
      <p>[0063] FIGS. 2 and 3 show a schematic side elevational view of
        a first and a second embodiment, respectively, of a water
        collection sheet 8 of the plant aid 1. The water collection
        sheet 8 has a water collection surface 9 which is oriented
        substantially upwards for collecting moisture present in the
        atmosphere. Due to a specific structure, the water collection
        surface 9 comprises at least one receiving surface 10 and at
        least one collecting surface 11 for obtaining and collecting the
        moisture, respectively. The receiving surface 10 makes a first
        angle .alpha. with respect to the orientation of gravity Z. The
        collecting surface 11 makes a second angle .beta. with respect
        to the orientation of gravity Z. The first angle .alpha. is
        smaller than the second angle .beta., so that, in principle,
        drops on the receiving surface 10 slide down faster than drops
        on the collecting surface 11. Since the collecting surface 11
        adjoins a lower edge 10a, relatively many drops will gather near
        the collecting surface 11 and form larger drops due to cohesive
        forces. Larger drops experience relatively fewer adhesive forces
        from the water collection surface 9, so that a second angle
        .beta. which is larger than the first angle .alpha. is
        sufficiently steep to make the drops slide down along the
        collecting surface 11 into the tube 2 or into an opening 12 to
        the reservoir 13. </p>
      <p>[0064] Water drops on the receiving surface 10 are obtained by
        receiving precipitation, dew and/or condensation, with the
        receiving surface 10 acting as a condensing surface. Solid
        precipitation is received and collected in the same manner as
        wet precipitation. </p>
      <p>[0065] In the first embodiment of the water collection sheet 8,
        as shown in FIG. 2, the first angle .alpha. is very small, for
        instance a few degrees; the second angle .beta. is approximately
        45.degree.. In the second embodiment of the water collection
        sheet 8, as shown in FIG. 3, the first angle .alpha. is larger,
        for instance 30.degree.. </p>
      <p>[0066] FIG. 4 shows a schematic perspective view of a third
        embodiment of a water collection sheet 8 of the plant aid 1. Due
        to the formation of ribs 25 on the water collection sheet 8,
        relatively steep receiving surfaces 10 and relatively less steep
        collecting surfaces 11 are formed with angles with respect to
        the orientation of gravity Z, as described hereinabove. The
        collecting surface 11 comprises a channel section 11a for
        guiding the water drops, via a channel to an opening 12 in the
        water collection surface 9 or to the tube 2. The channel section
        11a has a base which is minimally 2 mm wider than the diameter
        of the water drops, for instance in the range of approximately 5
        to approximately 15 mm, such as for instance 10 mm. </p>
      <p>[0067] FIG. 5 shows a schematic perspective view of a fourth
        embodiment of a water collection sheet 8 of the plant aid 1. The
        water collection sheet 8 comprises structures 10b projecting
        from the sheet 8, in the shape of blocks, so that receiving
        surfaces 10 are formed. Due to the projecting structures, in
        addition, the effective surface of the water collection sheet 8
        is increased, so that extra moisture can be collected from the
        atmosphere. Of course, the projecting structures may also be
        shaped differently, for instance as pyramids as shown in FIG. 6.
      </p>
      <p>[0068] Preferably, the tube 2 comprises two detachable wall
        parts, for instance wall parts which are arranged pivotally with
        respect to a pivot which is oriented substantially parallel to
        the longitudinal axis L of the tube 2. Thus, the plant aid can
        easily be built up around a young plant 3. Other parts of the
        plant aid 1 may also be built up separately or integrally as
        desired in order to carry out the construction of the plant aid
        1 simply and quickly. The plant aid 1 can also be dismantled
        relatively simply. Thus, the two wall parts can pivot outwards
        without causing any appreciable damage to the plant, for
        instance when the plant 3 has grown sufficiently. Optionally,
        the plant aid 1 can be reused. However, it is also possible to
        manufacture the plant aid 1 from (biologically) degradable
        materials, so that dismantling work is limited or is completely
        unnecessary. In the latter situation, the plant aid 1 can
        advantageously be provided with at least one graft shell 5. </p>
      <p>[0069] The tube 2 is, for instance, circular with a constant
        cross section. However, it is also possible to shape the tube 2
        differently, for instance elliptical or rectangular. In
        addition, the dimensions in cross section may vary, for instance
        conical for optimizing captured daylight and/or sunlight. </p>
      <p>[0070] In a preferred embodiment according to the invention, in
        top plan view, the tube 2 encloses a surface of approximately 1
        dm.sup.2. In top plan view, the water collection sheet 8 has a
        larger surface, for instance 1 m.sup.2, so that relatively much
        moisture can be collected. Due to the proportion of these
        surfaces, the apparent precipitation amount increases, so that,
        by efficient use of rainwater, successful planting is also
        possible in relatively dry areas. </p>
      <p>[0071] FIG. 9 shows a schematic perspective view of a second
        embodiment of a plant aid 1 according to the invention. For
        collecting moisture present in the atmosphere, the plant aid
        comprises not only the water collection sheet 9 as discussed on
        the basis of the first embodiment of the plant aid 1, but also a
        threadlike structure with local thickenings which are located
        substantially above the water collection surface. A frame 32
        extends upwards and supports the threadlike structure 33 of
        which an end 33a is located near the water collection surface 9.
        The threadlike structure is provided with local thickenings,
        which preferably have rounded shapes, such as thickenings with
        substantially a spherical or ellipsoid shape. With the aid of
        the threadlike structure with local thickenings, the surface on
        which condensation and/or reception of dew drops takes place is
        increased. Under the influence of gravity, the drops slide to
        the end 33a of the threadlike structure and fall on the water
        collection surface 9 where collection as described hereinabove
        takes place. Thus, relatively much moisture can be abstracted
        from the atmosphere, which is favorable in areas where little or
        no precipitation and/or condensation occurs, and where a young
        plant loses relatively much moisture due to evaporation. Due to
        the threadlike structure used, the light yield and/or
        ventilation for the young plant remains practically equal in an
        advantageous manner. By varying the number of threads, the
        amount of moisture abstracted from the atmosphere, and
        consequently the moisture flow benefiting the plant can be
        decreased or increased. The threadlike structure may have a
        relatively thin and/or flexible design. However, it is also
        possible for the threadlike structure to have a relatively stiff
        design, so that the threadlike structure comprises pin-shaped
        segments. Further, it is possible for the threadlike structure
        to be supported by the collection sheet 9 or a supporting
        structure located below the collection sheet 9. It is noted
        that, instead of thickening of the threadlike structure, other
        modules may also be used, for instance plates fixed to the
        threadlike structure. </p>
      <p>[0072] Preferably, the plant aid has a nontransparent design,
        so that formation of weeds inside the plant aid is prevented. </p>
      <p>[0073] In a further advantageous embodiment according to the
        invention, the plant aid 1 further comprises a substantially
        flat supporting structure 40 for supporting the tube 2, as shown
        in FIG. 10. The substantially flat supporting structure 40 is,
        for instance, designed as a stiff interweaving or as a flexible
        net. Optionally, the substantially flat supporting structure may
        support a multiple number of plant aids, for instance for
        manually and/or mechanically transporting the plant aids to a
        planting location. In addition, thus, the plant aids can
        relatively easily be brought to areas which are relatively
        difficult to access, for instance on steep slopes. </p>
      <p>[0074] The flexible net, also called planting net, can comprise
        one or a multiple number of layers which are preferably
        manufactured from organic and/or from inorganic materials. The
        planting net preferably comprises a soil net 41 and a top net
        42. </p>
      <p>[0075] The soil net 41 serves to support a multiple number of
        plant aids, including the young plants. The graft may be
        provided in the soil net. The young plants may be fixed to the
        soil net. After impregnation, the ground net 41 is also suitable
        as a growth soil and carrier of the graft. With use with a
        graft, the net may, optionally industrially, be rolled up and
        may, optionally automatically, be unrolled during planting. If
        the soil net is to support already germinated plants or larger
        plants, the net can be unrolled in advance after which the
        plants are fixed to the net, for instance with the aid of a
        click system. Then, the net can be supported with manpower or in
        a mechanical manner to the location where the plants are to be
        planted. </p>
      <p>[0076] The soil net 41 is dimensioned such that it is,
        depending on size and/or weight of the soil block and/or plant
        weight and/or tube weight, sufficiently strong to serve as a
        transport movable by a few persons if the total weight is
        relatively small. With a relatively large total weight,
        optionally, machines may be deployed. By use of the planting
        net, the planting rate is increased and areas which are
        difficult to access, such as mountain slopes, swamps and the
        like become accessible for planting. </p>
      <p>[0077] With use of automatic planting net laying devices and/or
        helicopters, the planting rate can be increased, in particular
        in areas which are difficult to access. </p>
      <p>[0078] The planting net including graft and/or young plants may
        also be deployed in fighting erosion. Due to the high planting
        rate, large areas can be planted in a short time, so that plants
        can be sown and planted at the right time. Also, with the aid of
        the plant aid, plants may optionally be planted outside
        conventional planting periods. </p>
      <p>[0079] The planting net also has the advantage that it can be
        adjusted to the circumstances and the shape and the condition of
        the plant environment. Optionally, with digital photography
        together with GPS, the land to be planted may be mapped. </p>
      <p>[0080] Then, for instance, locations with only water, tors,
        freestanding single trees and the like can be provided as
        recesses in the planting net. Also, the net can be designed such
        that the conical shape of a mountaintop or hilltop is taken into
        account. In addition to the adjustment to the shape and to the
        condition of the environment, due to a special design of the
        nets, plants can also be provided in a shape and/or assortment
        desired by the planter. Here, possibilities are, for instance,
        windbreaks, optionally fast-growing plants or trees to protect
        other crops to be planted. </p>
      <p>[0081] The top net 42 serves to guide and support the
        developing plant. This prevents stalks of young plants from
        falling down or snapping down, for instance as a results of
        winds with high speeds which can particularly occur at a
        relatively great height. The top net 42 may optionally be
        designed such that it grows along upwards. Thus, the top net 42
        can be provided on top of the tops of the plant or halfway up
        the stalk. </p>
      <p>[0082] In an advantageous manner, according to the invention,
        the use of expensive and complex machines is not required for
        planting, as it is indeed the case with use of sugar beet strip,
        where seeds are planted so at to be surrounded by strip, or a
        mulch pump where a layer consisting of binding agent, seeds,
        artificial fertilizers and the like is sprayed on by means of a
        high-pressure pump to obtain a growth layer for a lawn. In
        addition, areas which are difficult to access, such as for
        instance mountain slopes or swamps, which are not or hardly
        accessible to traditional machines, can be planted. In addition,
        the planting net has still more advantages over the sugar beet
        strip, viz. a better protection with high wind speeds,
        positioning of the plant aid and settable thickness of the net
        for the purpose of grafting. </p>
      <p>[0083] It is noted that the substantially flat supporting
        structure is not only suitable for supporting one or more plant
        aids according to claim 1, but that the substantially flat
        supporting structure can also be used for supporting at least
        one plant aid 1 comprising a protecting structure for protecting
        a young plant. </p>
      <p>[0084] FIG. 12 shows a schematic view of a cross section of a
        further embodiment of a plant aid 1 according to the invention.
      </p>
      <p>[0085] The reservoir 13 comprises an inlet pipe 60 which, by a
        first end 61, inwardly connects to the edge of the opening 12 in
        the water collection surface 9. By use of such an inlet pipe 60,
        loss of moisture present in the reservoir 13 due to evaporation
        is reduced considerably. This is because the amount of moisture
        which can evaporate increases when the size of the liquid
        surface which is in gas connection with the opening 12
        increases. Conversely, the amount of liquid lost by evaporation
        decreases as the size of the liquid surface which is in gas
        connection with the opening 12 decreases. Since the liquid
        surface in the inlet pipe 60 is much smaller than the rest of
        the liquid surface in the reservoir 13, the evaporation through
        the opening 12 is proportionally smaller, and accordingly also
        the loss of moisture by means of evaporation from the reservoir
        13. Thus, the liquid in the inlet pipe 60 forms a barrier for
        moisture evaporating from the rest of the liquid surface in the
        reservoir 13. </p>
      <p>[0086] Due to the inlet pipe 60 reaching, by a second end 62,
        to just above the bottom 16 of the reservoir 13, the inlet pipe
        60 also functions if only a small amount of moisture is present
        in the reservoir, because the second end 62 of the pipe 60 is
        still below the liquid surface then. </p>
      <p>[0087] Preferably, the inlet pipe 60 tapers in the direction of
        the first end 61, so that obstructions at the bottom of the
        inlet pipe are prevented in an advantageous manner. </p>
      <p>[0088] Further, the reservoir 13 comprises an overflow pipe 70
        which, in a similar manner, connects to the edge of the outflow
        opening 21 by a first end 71 and reaches to just above the
        bottom 16 of the reservoir 13 by a second end 72, so that
        evaporation of moisture through the outflow opening 21 is
        prevented. In order to prevent obstructions in the overflow pipe
        70, the pipe can be constructed such that the pipe tapers in the
        direction of the first end 61, as is the case with the inlet
        pipe 60. </p>
      <p>[0089] The invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiment
        described herein. Many variants are possible. </p>
      <p>[0090] Thus, the water collection surface may be designed in
        different colors. By providing the surface with a light color,
        the heat absorption by means of sunlight is relatively small, so
        that a condensation process for collecting water remains
        effective for a long time. </p>
      <p>[0091] Further, the water collection sheet cannot only be used
        in combination with a plant aid, but also independently for
        collecting moisture present in the atmosphere, for instance with
        the aid of fixing means for fixation on buildings, craft, such
        as sailing ships, or on other floating constructions offshore.
        The collected moisture may be processed for obtaining drinking
        water or otherwise, for instance for chemical processes and/or
        irrigation purposes. </p>
      <p>[0092] Use of a plant aid according to the invention is further
        possible by positioning it above salt or brackish water, since
        condensation of evaporated salt or brackish water results in
        fresh water production. </p>
      <p>[0093] Such variants will be clear to a skilled person and are
        understood to be within the scope of the invention as set forth
        in the following claims. </p>
