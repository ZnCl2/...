        <b>R. Wong, Ph.D., , B. Rabie, Ph.D.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><b>Summary</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Objective</b><br>
      <br>
      Puerarin is one of the major phytoestrogens isolated from Pueraria
      lobata, a Chinese medicine known as Gegen. Our laboratory compared
      the amount of new bone produced by puerarin in collagen matrix
      (carrier) to that produced by the collagen matrix alone.<br>
      Method<br>
      <br>
      Eighteen bone defects, 5 mm by 10 mm were created in the parietal
      bone of nine New Zealand White rabbits. In the experimental group,
      six defects were grafted with puerarin solution mixed with
      collagen matrix. In the control groups, six defects were grafted
      with collagen matrix alone (active control) and six were left
      empty (passive control). Animals were killed on day 14 and the
      defects were dissected and prepared for histological assessment.
      Serial sections were cut across each defect. No new bone was
      formed in the passive control group. Quantitative analysis of new
      bone formation was made on 100 sections (10 sections in each
      defect, in five defects randomly selected in each of the
      experimental group and active control group) using image analysis.<br>
      Results<br>
      <br>
      A total of <b>554% more new bone</b> was present in defects
      grafted with puerarin in collagen matrix than those grafted with
      the collagen matrix alone.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><br>
      <br>
      Puerarin in collagen matrix has the effect of increasing new bone
      formation locally and can be used for bone grafting or for bone
      induction often required in surgery…<br>
      <br>
      Puerarin (Fig. 1),
      4H-1-benzopyran-4-one,8-β-d-glueopyranosyl-7-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl),





      C12H20C9, is one of the major phytoestrogens isolated from the
      root of a wild leguminous creeper, Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi.
      This is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine known as
      Gegen and has been demonstrated to have effects on decreasing loss
      in bone density in ovariectomized mice. It also has other
      important uses on treatment of fever, liver diseases and
      cardiovascular diseases. In China, P. lobata is also used as a
      health supplement for reducing risk factors of cardiovascular
      diseases. There are wide application of P. lobata in clinical
      prescriptions and dietary supplements.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Balancing the hormones with Herbs &amp;
          Homeopathic Remedies</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      EXCERPTED FROM Dr. Mumby’s Chapter: Chemicals in the environment
      create hormonal imbalances in the body which then stimulate cancer
      development. This makes chemical clean-up around the home and
      workplace important. Hormonal imbalances are a stumbling block to
      healing from cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The medical community knows that a large number of cancers are
      hormonally-influenced, but I don’t like the hormone-blocking drugs
      that are commonly prescribed to people with these types of cancer;
      aromatase-inhibitors, and others, like Tamoxifen, because the
      science behind them isn’t very good. One of the most effective
      estrogen-blocking herbs is called puerarin, which is from
      Thailand. It’s sometimes jokingly referred to as HRT (Herbal
      Remedy from Thailand). It blocks natural estrogenic activity, and
      is three times more powerful than soy isoflavones.&nbsp; Breast
      cancer is unknown in the region of Thailand where puerarin grows,
      and studies from universities all around the world have
      demonstrated the powerful estrogenic properties of this herb. It
      functions by attaching to estrogen receptors on cancer cells, so
      that these receptors are blocked from receiving natural estrogen,
      but it doesn’t have estrogenic effects upon the body. This herb
      has more solid science behind it than any other that I know of and
      can be used in lieu of hormone-blocking drugs in people with
      hormonally-influenced cancers.<br>
      <br>
      One of the problems that men with prostate cancer face is estrogen
      excess. As part of men’s aging process, testosterone gets
      increasingly metabolized into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which
      isn’t actually testosterone, but a type of estrogen, the effects
      of which can be blocked with puerarin. I know men who take this
      herb as a prophylaxis to block the effects of male estrogen in
      their bodies.<br>
      <br>
      Looking at and addressing other hormone imbalances in the body
      with homeopathic and other remedies is likewise important. There’s
      a strong association between thyroid insufficiency and cancer.
      Thyroid insufficiency impacts the immune system, and I would
      prescribe supplements, such as homeopathic thyroid extracts, which
      stimulate the thyroid gland, to my patients with this condition.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, people with cancer also suffer from adrenal exhaustion,
      which also impacts the immune system. Their adrenal glands can’t
      cope with stress, but these glands play an important role in
      healing the body from cancer, so restoring them is important. I
      found homeopathic remedies such as phosphoric acid, argentum
      nitricum, and gelsemium, (just to name a few) to be useful for
      supporting weak adrenals.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, pancreatic shock ranks high on the list of triggering
      factors for any disease, including cancer, so I would commonly
      prescribe my patients homeopathic pancreatic formulas for this
      problem, as well.&nbsp; I would also attempt to discover what
      disease processes were impacting their pancreases. Sometimes I
      would find old diseases, such as scarlet fever, that were still
      exerting an influence, like a shadow, over their organs. I would
      then prescribe them homeopathic remedies to remove that influence.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>KUDZU Overview Information</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Kudzu is a vine. Under the right growing conditions, it spreads
      easily, covering virtually everything that doesn’t move out of its
      path. Kudzu was introduced in North America in 1876 in the
      southeastern U.S. to prevent soil erosion. But kudzu spread
      quickly and overtook farms and buildings, leading some to call to
      kudzu "the vine that ate the South.”<br>
      <br>
      Kudzu’s root, flower, and leaf are used to make medicine. It has
      been used in Chinese medicine since at least 200 BC. As early as
      600 AD, it was used to treat alcoholism.<br>
      <br>
      Today, kudzu is used to treat alcoholism and to reduce symptoms of
      alcohol hangover, including headache, upset stomach, dizziness,
      and vomiting. Kudzu is also used for heart and circulatory
      problems, including high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, and
      chest pain; for upper respiratory problems including sinus
      infections, the common cold, hay fever, flu, and swine flu; and
      for skin problems, including allergic skin rash, itchiness, and
      psoriasis.<br>
      <br>
      Some people use kudzu for menopause symptoms, muscle pain,
      measles, dysentery, stomach pain (gastritis), fever, diarrhea,
      thirst, neck stiffness, and to promote sweating. Other oral uses
      include treatment of polio myelitis, encephalitis, migraine,
      deafness, diabetes, and traumatic injuries.<br>
      <br>
      Health providers in China sometimes give puerarin, a chemical in
      kudzu, intravenously (by IV) to treat stroke due to a blood clot.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How does it work?</b><br>
      <br>
      There is information that suggests kudzu contains ingredients that
      counteract alcohol. It might also have effects like estrogen.
      Chemicals in kudzu might also increase blood circulation in the
      heart and brain.<br>

      </b><b>People Use This For:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Orally, kudzu is used for alcohol hangover, such as headache,
      upset stomach, dizziness, and vomiting, and for alcoholism and
      drunkenness. Kudzu is also used orally for menopause, myalgia,
      measles, dysentery, gastritis, fever, diarrhea, thirst, allergic
      rhinitis, cold, flu (influenza), swine flu, neck stiffness, and as
      a diaphoretic. Other oral uses include polio myelitis,
      encephalitis, hypertension, angina pectoris, arrhythmia, migraine,
      deafness, diabetes, traumatic injuries, sinusitis, urticaria,
      pruritus, and psoriasis.<br>
      Intravenously, the kudzu constituent puerarin is used for ischemic
      stroke.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Safety:</b><br>
      <br>
      POSSIBLY SAFE ...when used orally and appropriately. Kudzu appears
      to be safe for up to 4 months (10386, 11386). However, short-term,
      frequent use of kudzu root extract has been linked to liver injury
      in one report (88777). ...when used intravenously and
      appropriately. The kudzu constituent puerarin has been safely used
      in studies lasting 7-20 days (13277, 13279, 13287, 15025);
      however, puerarin has been linked to reports of some serious side
      effects such as intravascular hemolysis (13298).<br>
      <br>
      PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information
      available; avoid using.<br>
      Effectiveness:<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      INSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE to RATE<br>
      <br>
      Alcoholism. Preliminary research suggests that heavy drinkers who
      take kudzu extract for 7 days consume less beer when given an
      opportunity to drink (13085). However, kudzu does not seem to
      decrease the craving for alcohol (10386, 13085, 57948). Kudzu
      extract also does not seem to improve sobriety in chronic
      alcoholics (10386).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Angina.</b> Preliminary clinical research suggests that oral
      and intravenous forms of the kudzu derivative, puerarin, might
      improve signs and symptoms of unstable angina (13277, 13279,
      13287, 15025). Some evidence suggests that using intravenous
      puerarin in combination with conventional treatment might be more
      effective than conventional treatment alone (15025). However,
      studies on puerarin are generally of poor quality and might not be
      reliable. Puerarin injection products are not available in North
      America.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Angioplasty.</b> Clinical research suggests that administering
      200 mL of a daily intravenous injection of a kudzu constituent,
      called puerarin, beginning one week before and continuing until
      one day prior to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
      (PTCA), seems to significantly reduce the occurrence of angina
      episodes during PTCA compared to placebo (57889). Puerarin
      injection products are not available in North America.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Coronary heart disease.</b> Clinical research suggests that
      administering a kudzu constituent, called puerarin, 500 mg
      intravenously once daily for 3 weeks, in addition to conventional
      therapy, decreases fasting plasma insulin and low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increases high-density
      lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol compared to conventional therapy
      alone in patients with coronary heart disease who have high LDL
      cholesterol and fasting plasma insulin levels and low HDL
      cholesterol at baseline (57873). Conventional therapy consisted of
      metoprolol succinate 25 mg twice daily, sustained-release
      isosorbide acetate 60 mg daily, and enteric-coated aspirin 100 mg
      daily. Puerarin injection products are not available in North
      America.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Diabetes.</b> Taking a specific kudzu constituent, called
      puerarin, may reduce blood sugar in patients with diabetes.
      Clinical research suggests that taking oral puerarin 750 mg daily,
      in addition to rosiglitazone (Avandia) 4 mg daily, for 12 weeks
      significantly reduces blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin
      (HbA1c) compared to baseline in patients with type 2 diabetes
      (57951). However, intravenous infusion of puerarin 400 mg daily
      does not appear to have a significant effect on blood sugar
      (57857).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Diabetic nephropathy</b>. Taking a specific kudzu constituent,
      called puerarin, seems to improve kidney function in patients with
      diabetic nephropathy. Preliminary clinical research suggests that
      taking puerarin 750 mg daily, in addition to rosiglitazone
      (Avandia) 4 mg daily, for 12 weeks significantly improves
      laboratory measurements of kidney function including serum
      creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and urinary albumin compared to
      baseline in patients with diabetic nephropathy (57951).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Diabetic retinopathy.</b> Administering a specific kudzu
      constituent, called puerarin, does not appear to improve visual
      acuity in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Clinical research
      suggests that administering an intravenous infusion of puerarin
      400 mg daily for 3 weeks does not improve visual acuity and
      retinal hemorrhaging compared to baseline in patients with
      diabetic retinopathy (57857). Puerarin injection products are not
      available in North America.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Exercise performance.</b> Taking a combination supplement
      containing kudzu isoflavones may help improve exercise
      performance. One small clinical study suggests that taking
      capsules containing soybean peptides, taurine, kudzu isoflavone,
      and ginseng saponin for 15 days can significantly increase
      exercise time to exhaustion compared to placebo in men (57945).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Heart failure.</b> Taking a specific kudzu constituent, called
      puerarin, may improve some, but not all, aspects of heart function
      in patients with chronic heart failure. Clinical research suggests
      that taking puerarin 400 mg/day orally for 10 days, in addition to
      conventional treatment, improves left ventricular ejection
      fraction compared to conventional treatment alone in patients with
      chronic heart failure (57864).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ischemic stroke.</b> An intravenous form of the kudzu
      constituent, called puerarin, has been used in China to treat
      patients with ischemic stroke. In one study, 98 patients were
      randomized to routine therapy alone or routine therapy plus
      puerarin 200 mg intravenously once daily for 15 days, starting
      within 10 days of stroke onset. There was no significant
      difference in death rates or patients' degree of dependency at 6
      months. Other studies have reported some benefit but are of poor
      quality (16400). However, in other clinical research, puerarin
      alone or in combination with aspirin seems to improve neurologic
      function scores after 14 days of treatment in patients with acute
      ischemic stroke (57934).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Low back pain. </b>Administering injections of a specific
      kudzu constituent, called puerarin, seems to help with low back
      pain in some patients. In one clinical study, patients with lumbar
      intervertebral disc prolapse who were treated with injections of
      puerarin plus acupuncture had improved pain scores from baseline
      and compared to treatement with acupuncture alone (57931).
      Puerarin injection products are not available in North America.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Menopausal symptoms.</b> Preliminary clinical research suggests
      that kudzu taken up to 100 mg orally can improve vasomotor symptom
      scores in perimenopausal women (57890, 57926). Other clinical
      research suggests that taking kudzu 20-50 mg daily for 24 weeks
      can significantly improve vaginal dryness and pH from baseline in
      perimenopausal women (57924). However, some clinical evidence
      shows that taking up to 100 mg of kudzu daily does not affect
      menopausal changes after 3-6 months of use, including lipid
      profiles, blood pressure, sex hormone levels, or menopausal
      symptoms (11386, 57927, 57929, 57942). However, kudzu may have a
      positive effect on cognitive function and may improve bone
      turnover markers in postmenopausal women (11386, 57929). Also, in
      one clinical study, taking kudzu 20-50 mg daily for 24 weeks
      significantly decreased a specific biomarker of bone turnover,
      called bone alkaline phosphatase, compared to placebo in
      postmenopausal women (57929).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Myocardial infarction (MI)</b>. Administering a constituent of
      kudzu, called puerarin, as adjunct treatment to conventional
      therapy may help some MI patients (57906, 57917). In one clinical
      study, administering injections of puerarin 500 mg daily for 2
      weeks significantly reduced infarct size compared to the beginning
      of treatment in post-MI patients (57917). Puerarin injection
      products are not available in North America.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Weight loss.</b> Clinical research suggests that taking a kudzu
      extract 300 mg daily for 12 weeks significantly reduces visceral
      fat and body mass index (BMI) compared to placebo in obese
      patients. However, doses of 200 mg do not seem to be as effective
      (57954).<br>
      More evidence is needed to rate kudzu for these uses.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mechanism of Action:</b><br>
      <br>
      The applicable parts of kudzu are the root, flower, and leaf.
      Kudzu contains isoflavone constituents including daidzin,
      daidzein, puerarin, genistin, and genistein (11711, 13295).<br>
      <br>
      Kudzu extracts or individual isoflavones such as daidzin
      consistently suppress voluntary alcohol intake in rodent models of
      alcoholism (1523, 1524, 13289, 13290). Kudzu extract, daidzein,
      and daidzin decrease alcohol consumption and shorten
      alcohol-induced sleep in alcohol-craving animals. Preclinical
      research suggests kudzu causes later and lower peak blood alcohol
      levels and a flattened dose response curve (13297). Kudzu might
      decrease peak blood alcohol levels due to delayed gastric
      emptying, exposing alcohol to a longer time for first-pass
      metabolism in the stomach (1523, 1524). Slowed gastric emptying
      might prolong the effects of alcohol. Other research suggests
      kudzu might have antioxidant effects and speed up the metabolism
      of toxic alcohol metabolites (13294). Preliminary research
      suggests the kudzu constituent puerarin might lessen feelings of
      anxiety associated with alcohol withdrawal (13293).<br>
      <br>
      Research in animal models of stroke suggests an ethanolic extract
      of kudzu root can increase levels of norepinephrine and dopamine
      in the brain, which might improve post-stroke depression (15498).<br>
      <br>
      Isoflavone constituents have both estrogenic and antiestrogenic
      activity, similar to selective estrogen receptor modulators
      (11386, 13295). These phytoestrogens might have additive or
      synergistic effects with each other (13295).<br>
      <br>
      Kudzu might also have effects on the cardiovascular system.
      Preliminary research suggests kudzu has a protective effect
      against myocardial ischemia (13282). Puerarin seems to reduce both
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and diminish myocardial
      oxygen consumption (13279). Puerarin also might have vasorelaxant
      properties, possibly by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors
      (13283). There is also some evidence that puerarin might decrease
      plasma renin and angiotensin II activity, and platelet aggregation
      (13278, 13280, 13291). The kudzu constituent daidzein might also
      have antiarrhythmic properties (13284).<br>
      <br>
      In ischemic stroke, puerarin might reduce ischemic reperfusion
      injury by dilating cerebral vessels to improve circulation,
      reducing platelet aggregation, inhibiting free radical production,
      and increasing superoxide dismutase activity (16400).<br>
      <br>
      Kudzu or its constituents might have hypoglycemic,
      hypocholesterolemic, and antioxidant activity (13285, 13286,
      13288, 13292). Kudzu also might have antipyretic effects, possibly
      through the effect of puerarin on serotonin receptors (13281,
      13282).<br>
      <br>
      Preliminary research also suggests that kudzu and puerarin both
      inhibit and induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. However, it is
      unclear which CYP isoenzymes are affected and to what degree
      (13288).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Adverse Reactions:</b><br>
      <br>
      Orally, no side effects have been reported in clinical studies.
      There is one case report of allergic reaction following use of a
      combination herbal product containing kudzu (Kakkonto) involving a
      maculopapular eruption starting on the thighs and spreading over
      the entire body (13111).<br>
      <br>
      Intravenously, the kudzu derivative, puerarin, has been associated
      with itching and nausea (16400). It has also caused intravascular
      hemolysis (13298).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Interactions with Herbs &amp; Supplements:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS: Theoretically,
      concomitant use of kudzu with herbs that might affect platelet
      aggregation might increase the risk of bleeding in some people
      (13278, 13291). These herbs include angelica, clove, danshen,
      fenugreek, feverfew, garlic, ginger, ginkgo, Panax ginseng,
      poplar, red clover, turmeric, and others.<br>
      <br>
      HEPATOTOXIC HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS: There is some concern that
      kudzu can adversely affect the liver (88777). Theoretically,
      concomitant use with other potentially hepatotoxic herbs and
      supplements might increase the risk of developing liver damage.
      Some of these products include androstenedione, chaparral,
      comfrey, DHEA, germander, niacin, pennyroyal oil, red yeast, and
      others.<br>
      <br>
      HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS WITH HYPOGLYCEMIC POTENTIAL: Theoretically,
      kudzu might lower blood glucose levels (13285, 13292, 57868,
      57951), and have additive effects when used with other herbs and
      supplements that also lower glucose levels. This might increase
      the risk of hypoglycemia in some patients. Some herbs and
      supplements with hypoglycemic effects include alpha-lipoic acid,
      bitter melon, cassia cinnamon, chromium, devil's claw, fenugreek,
      garlic, guar gum, horse chestnut, Panax ginseng, psyllium,
      Siberian ginseng, and others.<br>
      <br>
      HERBS WITH ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY: Theoretically, kudzu might have
      additive or antagonistic effects with other herbs that have
      estrogenic activity (11386, 57874, 57877). These herbs include
      alfalfa, black cohosh, chasteberry, flaxseed, hops, ipriflavone,
      licorice, red clover, and soy.<br>

      Kudzu isoflavones are reported to have antiplatelet activity
      (13278, 13291). Theoretically, kudzu might increase the risk of
      bleeding when used concomitantly with other drugs that have
      antiplatelet or anticoagulant effects. Antiplatelet agents include
      aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), dipyridamole (Persantine),

      in patients treated with antidiabetic agents (13285, 13292, 57868,
      57951). The dose of diabetes medications might need to be
      adjusted. Some antidiabetes drugs include glimepiride (Amaryl),
      glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase PresTab, Micronase), insulin,
      metformin (Glucophage), pioglitazone (Actos), rosiglitazone

      There is some concern that kudzu can adversely affect the liver
      (88777). Theoretically, concomitant use with other potentially
      hepatotoxic drugs might increase the risk of developing liver
      damage. Some of these drugs include acarbose (Precose, Prandase),
      amiodarone (Cordarone), atorvastatin (Lipitor), azathioprine

      Severity = High • Occurrence = Possible • Level of Evidence = D<br>
      Preclinical research suggests that kudzu extract greatly reduces
      the elimination and increases the toxicity of methotrexate. Kudzu
      might inhibit organic anion transporters (OATs) that are
      responsible for hepatobiliary and renal excretion of anions,
      similar to the interaction between methotrexate and NSAIDs
      (13296).<br>

      None known.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Interactions with Lab Tests:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      LIVER FUNCTION TESTS: There is some concern that kudzu can
      significantly increase liver function tests, including aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total
      bilirubin (88777).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Interactions with Diseases or Conditions:</b><br>
      <br>
      BLEEDING DISORDERS: Kudzu isoflavones are reported to have
      antiplatelet activity (13278, 13291). Theoretically, kudzu might
      interfere with anticoagulant therapies.<br>
      <br>
      CARDIOVASCULAR CONDITIONS: Theoretically, kudzu might interfere
      with cardiovascular treatments. Kudzu extracts have vasodilatory,
      hypotensive, and antiarrhythmic effects in animals (13280, 13283,
      13284, 57910).<br>
      <br>
      DIABETES: Theoretically, kudzu might interfere with blood glucose
      control requiring dosing adjustment of diabetes drug therapy.
      Kudzu constituents have hypoglycemic activity in animals (13285,
      13292, 57868, 57951).<br>
      <br>
      HORMONE SENSITIVE CANCERS/CONDITIONS: Kudzu might have estrogenic
      effects (11386, 57874, 57877). Women with hormone sensitive
      conditions should avoid kudzu. Some of these conditions include
      breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, and
      uterine fibroids.<br>
      <br>
      LIVER DISEASE: There is some concern that kudzu can adversely
      affect the liver (88777). Theoretically, kudzu might exacerbate
      liver diseases such as hepatitis in patients with a history of
      liver disease. Tell patients with active or past liver disease to
      avoid kudzu.<br>
      <br>
      SURGERY: Kudzu might affect blood glucose levels (13285, 13292,
      57868, 57951). Theoretically, kudzu might interfere with blood
      glucose control during and after surgical procedures. Tell
      patients to discontinue kudzu at least 2 weeks before elective
      surgical procedures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dosage/Administration:</b><br>
      <br>
      ORAL: For alcoholism, kudzu root extract 1.2 grams twice daily has
      been used (10386). A specific kudzu extract (NPI-031, Natural
      Pharmacia Int.) in a dose of 500 mg three times daily has also
      been used. This extract is standardized to contain 19% puerarin,
      4% daidzin, and 2% daidzein (13085).<br>
      <br>
      For menopausal symptoms, kudzu powder containing 100 mg
      isoflavones dissolved in water once daily has been used for 3
      months (11386).<br>
      <br>
      INTRAVENOUS: For ischemic stroke, the kudzu extract puerarin has
      been used in a dose of 200 mg once daily for 15 days (16400).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Editor's Comments:</b><br>
      <br>
      Kudzu has been used medicinally in Chinese medicine since at least
      200 BC. As early as 600 AD, it was used to treat alcoholism
      (15498).<br>
      <br>
      Kudzu was introduced in North America in 1876 in the southeastern
      US. It was initially used to prevent soil erosion. Kudzu spread
      quickly and overtook several farms and buildings. Some have
      referred to kudzu as "the vine that ate the South" (13085).<br>

      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Kudzu (/ˈkʊdzuː/, also called Japanese arrowroot ) is a group of
      plants in the genus Pueraria, in the pea family Fabaceae,
      subfamily Faboideae. They are climbing, coiling, and trailing
      perennial vines native to much of eastern Asia, Southeast Asia,
      and some Pacific islands. The name comes from the Japanese name
      for the plants, kuzu, which was written "kudzu" in historical
      romanizations. Where these plants are naturalized, they can be
      invasive and are considered noxious weeds. The plant climbs over
      trees or shrubs and grows so rapidly that it kills them by heavy
      shading. The plant is edible, but often sprayed with herbicides.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Taxonomy and nomenclature</b><br>
      <br>
      The name kudzu describes one or more species in the genus Pueraria
      that are closely related, and some of them are considered to be
      varieties rather than full species. The morphological differences
      between them are subtle; they can breed with each other, and
      introduced kudzu populations in the United States apparently have
      ancestry from more than one of the species. They are:<br>
      <br>
      P. montana<br>
      P. lobata (P. montana var. lobata)<br>
      P. edulis<br>
      P. phaseoloides<br>
      P. thomsonii (P. montana var. chinensis)<br>
      P. tuberosa<br>
      <br>
      <b>Origin in the United States</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Kudzu was introduced to the United States as an ornamental bush
      and an effortless and efficient shade producer at the Philadelphia
      Continental Exposition in 1876. In the 1930s and '40s, the vine
      was rebranded as a way for farmers to stop soil erosion. Southern
      farmers were given about eight dollars an acre to sow topsoil with
      the invasive vine. The cultivation covered over one million acres
      of kudzu.[7]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Propagation</b><br>
      <br>
      Kudzu spreads by vegetative reproduction via stolons (runners)
      that root at the nodes to form new plants and by rhizomes. Kudzu
      will also spread by seeds, which are contained in pods and mature
      in the autumn, although this is rare. One or two viable seeds are
      produced per cluster of pods. The hard-coated seeds can remain
      viable for several years, and will successfully germinate only
      when soil is persistently soggy for five to seven days, with
      temperatures above 20 °C (68 °F). Once germinated, saplings must
      be kept in a well-drained medium that retains high moisture.
      During this stage of growth, it is critical for kudzu to receive
      as much sunlight as possible. Kudzu saplings are sensitive to
      mechanical disturbance, and are damaged by chemical fertilizers.
      They do not tolerate long periods of shade, or high water tables.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Uses</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
        Soil improvement and preservation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Kudzu has been used as a form of erosion control and also to
      enhance the soil. As a legume, it increases the nitrogen in the
      soil by a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.[8]
      Its deep taproots also transfer valuable minerals from the subsoil
      to the topsoil, thereby improving the topsoil. In the deforested
      section of the central Amazon Basin in Brazil, it has been used
      for improving the soil pore-space in clay latosols, thus freeing
      even more water for plants than in the soil prior to
      deforestation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Animal feed</b><br>
      <br>
      Kudzu can be used by grazing animals, as it is high in quality as
      a forage and palatable to livestock. It can be grazed until frost
      and even slightly after. Kudzu had been used in the southern
      United States specifically to feed goats on land that had limited
      resources. Kudzu hay typically has a 15–18% crude protein content
      and over 60% total digestible nutrient value. The quality of the
      leaves decreases, however, as vine content increases relative to
      the leaf content. Kudzu also has low forage yields despite its
      rate of growth, yielding around two to four tons of dry matter per
      acre annually. It is also difficult to bale due to its vining
      growth and its slowness in shedding water. This makes it necessary
      to place kudzu hay under sheltered protection after being baled.
      Kudzu is readily consumed by all types of grazing animals, yet
      frequent grazing over three to four years can ruin stands. Thus,
      kudzu only serves well as a grazing crop on a temporary basis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Basketry</b><br>
      <br>
      Kudzu fiber has long been used for fiber art and basketry. The
      long runners which propagate the kudzu fields and the larger vines
      which cover trees make excellent weaving material. Some
      basketmakers use the material green. Others use it after splitting
      it in half, allowing it to dry and then rehydrating it using hot
      water. Both traditional and contemporary basketry artists use
      kudzu.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Medicine</b><br>
      <br>
      Kudzu contains a number of useful isoflavones, including puerarin,
      about 60% of the total isoflavones, and also daidzein (an
      anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial agent) and daidzin
      (structurally related to genistein). It has shown value in
      treating migraine and cluster headaches. It is recommended for
      allergies and diarrhea.<br>
      <br>
      In traditional Chinese medicine, where it is known as gé gēn,
      kudzu is considered one of the 50 fundamental herbs. It is used to
      treat tinnitus, vertigo, and Wei syndrome (superficial heat).<br>
      <br>
      Kudzu has been used as a remedy for alcoholism and hangover. The
      root was used to prevent excessive consumption, while the flower
      was supposed to detoxify the liver and alleviate the symptoms
      afterwards. However, a 2007 study suggested that the use of the
      kudzu root is inappropriate as a hangover remedy due to increased
      acetaldehyde accumulation through mitochondrial aldehyde
      dehydrogenase inhibition. Some hangover remedies are marketed with
      kudzu as one of their active ingredients.<br>
      <br>
      It has also shown potential in animal models of Alzheimer's
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Food and beverage</b><br>
      <br>
      The roots contain starch, which has traditionally been used as a
      food ingredient in East Asia. In Vietnam, the starch called bột
      sắn dây is flavoured with pomelo oil and then used as a drink in
      the summer. In Japan, the plant is known as kuzu and the starch
      named kuzuko. Kuzuko is used in dishes including kuzumochi, mizu
      manjū, and kuzuyu. It also serves as a thickener for sauces, and
      can substitute for cornstarch.<br>
      <br>
      The flowers are used to make a jelly that tastes similar to grape
      jelly. Roots, flowers, and leaves of kudzu show antioxidant
      activity that suggests food uses. Nearby bee colonies may forage
      on kudzu nectar during droughts as a last resort, producing a
      low-viscosity red or purple honey that tastes of grape jelly or
      bubblegum.<br>
      <br>
      Kudzu has also been used for centuries in East Asia to make herbal
      teas and tinctures.[19] Kudzu powder is used in Japan to make an
      herbal tea called kuzuyu.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Other uses</b><br>
      <br>
      Kudzu fiber, known as ko-hemp, is used traditionally to make
      clothing and paper, and has also been investigated for
      industrial-scale use. The stems are traditionally used for
      basketry.<br>
      <br>
      It may become a valuable asset for the production of cellulosic
      ethanol. In the Southern United States, kudzu is used to make
      soaps, lotions, and compost.<br>
      Invasive species<br>
      Kudzu growing on trees in Georgia, United States<br>
      Kudzu plants near Canton, Georgia<br>
      Ecological damage and roles<br>
      <br>
      Kudzu's environmental and ecological damage results from acting
      through "interference competition", meaning it outcompetes other
      species for a resource. Kudzu competes with native flora for
      light, and acts to block their access to this vital resource by
      growing over them and shading them with its leaves. Native plants
      may then die as a result.<br>
      <br>
      Changes in leaf litter associated with kudzu infestation results
      in changes to decomposition processes and a 28% reduction in
      stocks of soil carbon, with potential implications for processes
      involved in climate change.<br>
      <br>
      <b>United States</b><br>
      <br>
      Kudzu was introduced from Japan into the United States at the
      Japanese pavilion in the 1876 Centennial Exposition in
      Philadelphia. It is now common along roadsides and other disturbed
      areas throughout most of the southeastern United States. Estimates
      of its rate of spreading differ wildly; it has been described as
      spreading at the rate of 150,000 acres (610 km2) annually,
      although in 2015 the United States Forest Service estimated the
      rate to be only 2,500 acres per year.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Canada</b><br>
      <br>
      Kudzu was discovered July 2009 in a patch 110 m (360 ft) wide and
      30 m (98 ft) across, on a south-facing slope on the shore of Lake
      Erie near Leamington, Ontario, about 50 km (31 mi) southeast of
      Windsor. Leamington is located in the second-warmest growing
      region of Canada after south coastal British Columbia.<br>
      <br>
      Ecologist Gerald Waldron made the Leamington find while walking
      along the beach. He recognized the kudzu instantly, having read
      about its destructive expansion in the southeastern United States.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Other countries</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      During World War II, kudzu was introduced to Vanuatu and Fiji by
      United States Armed Forces to serve as camouflage for equipment
      and has become a major weed.<br>
      <br>
      Kudzu is also becoming a problem in northeastern Australia, and
      has been seen in isolated spots in Northern Italy (Lake Maggiore).<br>
      <br>
      In New Zealand, kudzu was declared an "unwanted organism" and was
      added to the Biosecurity New Zealand register in 2002.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Control</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Crown removal</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      For successful long-term control of kudzu, it is not necessary to
      destroy the underground system, which can be extremely large and
      deep. It is only necessary to use some method to kill or remove
      the kudzu root crown[36] and all rooting runners. The root crown
      is a fibrous knob of tissue that sits on top of the roots. Crowns
      form from multiple vine nodes that root to the ground, and range
      from pea- to basketball-sized.[36] The older the crowns, the
      deeper they tend to be found in the ground. Nodes and crowns are
      the source of all kudzu vines, and roots cannot produce vines. If
      any portion of a root crown remains after attempted removal, the
      kudzu plant may grow back.<br>
      <br>
      Mechanical methods of control involve cutting off crowns from
      roots, usually just below ground level. This immediately kills the
      plant. Cutting off the above-ground vines is not sufficient for an
      immediate kill. It is necessary to destroy all removed crown
      material. Buried crowns can regenerate into healthy kudzu.
      Transporting crowns in soil removed from a kudzu infestation is
      one common way that kudzu unexpectedly spreads and shows up in
      various locations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mowing</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Close mowing every week, regular heavy grazing for many successive
      years, or repeated cultivation may be effective, as this serves to
      deplete root reserves.[36] If done in the spring, cutting off
      vines must be repeated. Regrowth appears to exhaust the plant's
      stored carbohydrate reserves. Cut kudzu can be fed to livestock,
      burned, or composted.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Grazing</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, has undertaken a trial program
      using goats and llamas to graze on the plant. As of 2007, the
      goats are grazing along the Missionary Ridge area in the east of
      the city. Similar efforts to reduce widespread nuisance kudzu
      growth have also been undertaken in the cities of Winston-Salem,
      North Carolina and Tallahassee, Florida.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fire</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Prescribed burning is also used on old extensive infestations to
      remove vegetative cover and promote seed germination for removal
      or treatment. While fire is not an effective way to kill kudzu,
      equipment, such as a skid loader, can later remove crowns and
      thereby kill kudzu with minimal disturbance of soil.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Herbicide</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A systemic herbicide, for example, glyphosate, Triclopyr, or
      Tordon, can be applied directly on cut stems, which is an
      effective means of transporting the herbicide into the kudzu's
      extensive root system.[43] Herbicides can be used after other
      methods of control, such as mowing, grazing, or burning, which can
      allow for an easier application of the chemical to the weakened
      plants. In large-scale forestry infestations, soil-active
      herbicides have been shown to be highly effective.<br>
      <br>
      After initial herbicidal treatment, follow-up treatments and
      monitoring are usually necessary, depending on how long the kudzu
      has been growing in the area. It may require up to 10 years of
      supervision after the initial chemical placement to make sure the
      plant does not return.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fungi</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Since 1998, the United States Department of Agriculture,
      Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has experimented with using
      the fungus Myrothecium verrucaria as a biologically based
      herbicide against kudzu.[30] A diacetylverrucarol spray based on
      M. verrucaria works under a variety of conditions (including the
      absence of dew), causes minimal injury to many of the other woody
      plants in kudzu-infested habitats, and takes effect quickly enough
      that kudzu treated with it in the morning starts showing evidence
      of damage by midafternoon.[30] Initial formulations of the
      herbicide produced toxic levels of other trichothecenes as
      byproducts, though the ARS discovered growing M. verrucaria in a
      fermenter on a liquid instead of a solid diet limited or
      eliminated the problem.<br>

      </b><b>Puerarin extraction process</b><br>
      The invention discloses a puerarin extraction process, relating to
      extraction of effective components in Chinese herbal medicine
      plants and belonging to the field of extraction processes. The
      puerarin extraction process is characterized by comprising the
      following steps: taking kudzu root, pulverizing at the low
      temperature of -4-0 DEG C, passing through a 30-100-mesh screen,
      adding distilled water which is 1-7 times by weight of kudzu root,
      immersing at room temperature for 5-8 hours, stirring with a
      stirrer to obtain a kudzu root slurry, adding an enzyme
      preparation to perform enzymolysis reaction while performing
      low-intensity ultrasonic treatment, carrying out solid-liquid
      separation and collecting the filtrate to obtain the kudzu root
      extract concentrated solution. The technique for extracting
      effective components of kudzu root has the advantages of high
      production efficiency, low requirements for equipment, high
      controllability, high operability and low energy consumption, is
      suitable for large-scale production of the kudzu root product, is

      <b>Method for extracting puerarin from residue of radix puerariae</b><b><br>
      </b><b>CN104844584</b><br>
      The invention discloses a method for extracting puerarin from
      residue of radix puerariae, which comprises the following steps:
      extracting kudzuvine root starch to obtain slag and drying,
      performing ultramicro crushing to obtain the particles with
      diameter being 1-20 micrometers; mixing the crushed residue of
      radix puerariae and ethanol, adding beta-cyclodextrin and
      performing ultrasonic extraction; performing heating reflux,
      performing pumping filtration for extracting puerarin; performing
      rotary evaporation on a filtrate to a stiff paste, simultaneously
      recovering ethanol, drying the obtained extract under vacuum; and
      performing supercritical carbon dioxide extraction on the extract
      to obtain the puerarin. According to the invention,
      beta-cyclodextrin can increase the puerarin solubility and
      dissolution speed from the root of kudzu vine. The method for
      performing supersonic wave extraction, separating and purifying
      puerarin has the advantages of short production period, high
      efficiency, simple equipment, little boiler heat supply and
      cooling water, saved energy consumption, reduced environment
      pollution, and low product cost. A used extractant (CO2) is gas
      which is easily removed, the obtained product has no residual
      toxicity, and is especially suitable for medicine and food
      industries.<br>
