      This agricultural growth optimizing process utilizes audible sound
      vibration in a non-audible manner. Propagation of sonic frequency
      ibrations by underground antennas through the soil provides
      optimum stimuli for healthy plant growth. The antenna are placed
      at sufficient depths so that they are not disturbed by the tilling
      of the earth.<br>
      <br>
      At the University of California, Riverside, Dr Stoddard ( sp? )
      discovered that by injecting oxygen into the soil, roots of plants
      were able to penetrate through hard ground, the so-called "hard
      pan". Our experience is similar. Providing audible sound frequency
      range to plants, their roots gravitate downward and go through
      hard pan rather easily. This observation indicates that audible
      sound helps to oxygenate roots. Oxygen has a cooling effect on the
      soil, thereby decreasing evaporation losses. Sound buffers the
      sun's drying effect.<br>
      <br>
      Earth worm activity increases with sound vibrations. Earth worms
      will produce humus equivalent to their own weight in every 24
      hours as well as loosening and thus aerating the soil. Ladybugs
      also are attracted to the plants that are grown in sound-bathed
      environment.<br>

      A method of enhancing the well being of a living organism is
      provided. An electrical signal is modulated at audible sound
      frequency. The modulated electrical signal is amplified and
      applied on the living organism in a non-audible manner. The
      modulated electrical signal can also be applied to organic
      products such as fruits, vegetables, fresh meat, dairy products,
      flowers, and the like, and perishable medical products to extend
      their shelf life and/or delay deterioration with little or no
      refrigeration.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention is related to application of signals
      modulated at audible frequencies, and particularly to application
      of audible sound frequency modulated electrical signal to enhance
      the well being of living organisms and other organic matter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] In historical applications of audible sound frequencies to
      the area of agriculture, the sounds have been applied through
      acoustical speaker systems. Starting with the work of Dr. T.C.N
      Singh at Amanalai University in Southern India in the early 1950's
      and extending to the present day, extensive work has been carried
      out by many researchers on the effects of musical sounds applied
      through acoustical speakers on various forms of plant life.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] It has been shown that application of music stimulates
      higher production of oxygen, as much as sixty (60) to a hundred
      percent. Since the plants' output of oxygen is directly
      proportional to the food manufactured by it, the stimulated plants
      are able to synthesize a larger amount of nourishment than the
      conventional plants. The beneficial effects include earlier
      sprouting, larger plants, and substantially increased yield.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] One great disadvantage of applying acoustic sound from the
      speakers to soil is the deafening noise, which is ear shattering
      to those near it. To mitigate the undesirable effect of loud
      noise, ways to apply sound to soil in a quieter manner have been
      explored. For example, attempts have been made to reduce the noise
      by burying the speakers underground to eliminate most of the
      noise. However, it is desirable to reduce the noise beyond that
      achievable through burying the speakers or other devised noise
      reduction schemes.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Therefore, it is desirable to develop a method and
      apparatus for applying audible sound frequencies to the soil
      without the undesirable effect of noise generated therefrom.<br>
      <br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0019] In an exemplary embodiment according to the present
      invention, musical compositions are applied to soil as audible
      sound frequency modulated electrical signals. In other
      embodiments, other patterns of audible frequencies may be used.
      The audible sound frequency as used herein may also be referred to
      as an audible frequency or an audible sonic frequency. These
      audible sound frequencies are applied in a non-acoustic (i.e.,
      silent) manner to soil to beneficially accelerate plant growth.
      They may also be applied to harvested fruits, vegetables, fresh
      meat, dairy products, flowers, and/or other organic products that
      are subject to spoilage, to extend their shelf life and/or delay
      deterioration without a need for refrigeration or with reduced
      refrigeration. Further, the audible sound frequencies may be
      applied to pharmaceutical products such as perishable medical
      products including penicillin and vaccines. The term
      "Agronosonics" has been coined to describe these applications of
      audible sound frequencies to the various areas of agriculture.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The "audible sound frequencies" are the frequencies that
      can be heard by a normal human ear and range from 16 to 20
      vibrations or cycles per second (Hz) for the very low sounds to
      16000 to 20000 vibrations or cycles per second for the very
      high-pitched sounds. As a matter of interest, the ranges of sound,
      radio and light frequencies are summarized below in Table 1:<br>
      <br>
      <b>TABLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Frequency range for different types of signals</b><br>
      <br>
      Infra-Sound&nbsp;&nbsp; 0-15 Hz<br>
      Audible-Sound&nbsp; 16-20,000 Hz<br>
      Ultra-Sound&nbsp; Above 20,000 Hz<br>
      AM Radio&nbsp; 550,000-1,700,000 Hz<br>
      FM Radio&nbsp; 88,000,000-108,000,000 Hz<br>
      Light&nbsp; 400 million MHz-750 million MHz<br>
      <br>
      [0021] "Infra" and "Ultra" sound frequencies, as shown in Table 1
      above, are those frequencies below and above, respectively, the
      range of hearing of the human auditory system. They are known as
      "silent" sound. Both of these sonic frequency ranges can have very
      destructive effects on organic tissue as they develop internal
      molecular friction and heat. For example, ultra sonic, which is
      used in the medical field, must be carefully controlled because of
      the heat generated. In contrast, audible sound frequencies
      typically produce no thermal temperature increases.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In contrast to the audible application of sound frequencies
      to plants as conventionally done, a method and apparatus in an
      exemplary embodiment according to the present invention applies
      sound frequencies in an inaudible manner directly to the soil. In
      other words, the system of the present invention uses a
      high-powered amplifier to inject the sound into the soil in a
      non-acoustic manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In the exemplary embodiment, molecular propagation is used
      to apply non-acoustic signal modulated at audible sound frequency
      throughout the soil. Using molecular propagation, the signal
      modulated in the audible sound frequency range is transmitted
      through molecular structure of matter (which may be solid or
      liquid) rather than through air. In the exemplary embodiment, the
      propagation of the non-acoustic signal modulated at audible sound
      frequencies may be carried out through water, moist application
      pads, or the moisture in the soil. It may be noted that speed of
      sound in water (1480 meters per second (m/s)) is more than four
      times the speed of sound in air (344 m/s at 21[deg.] C.).<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The exemplary embodiment of the present invention therefore
      produces beneficial effects similar to the acoustical system
      without the audible noise side effects. In addition, the exemplary
      embodiment provides an ability to produce these beneficial effects
      under adverse farming conditions. The non-acoustic signal
      modulated at audible sound frequency may also be referred to as an
      audible sound frequency vibration controlled energy. When the
      non-acoustic signal modulated at audible sound frequency is
      applied to human being or animals, it may also be referred to as
      bio-electricity.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In an exemplary embodiment according to the present
      invention, a repeating tape of 2 to 5 minutes in length provides
      the sonic input to an "agronosonic stimulator," which transmits
      the sonic stimulation into the soil in a continuous manner. When
      one envisions the music emanating from 100 instruments in a
      symphony orchestra each playing at different sonic frequencies, he
      can then imagine the true potential power and energy available in
      the multiple release effect of these many frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system 10 for applying
      audible sound frequency modulated electrical signal in an
      exemplary embodiment according to the present invention. The
      system 10 may also be referred to as an audible sound frequency
      stimulator or as an agronosonic stimulator. When the system 10 is
      applied to a human being or an animal, it may also be referred to
      as a biosonic stimulator.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The system 10 includes an audible energy source 12, an
      amplifier 14, output circuitry 16, a plate 1 (18) and a plate 2
      (20). Those skilled in the art would appreciate that systems for
      applying audible sound frequency modulated electrical signal in
      other embodiments may also have other components, instead of or in
      addition to the components illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The audible energy source 12 produces electrical signal
      modulated at a frequency of audible sound, which may be between
      the frequencies of 16 Hz through 20,000 Hz. The audible energy
      source 12, for example, may include, but are not limited to, a
      radio, a cassette player, an MP3 player, a CD player, a computer,
      an integrated circuit (IC) chip, or any other device that is
      capable of generating an audible sound frequency modulated
      electrical signal that can be listened to, for example, using a
      speaker. The audible sound frequency may represent music, speech,
      or any other audible sound. For example, the audible frequency
      generated by the audible energy source may repeatedly generate
      signals representing a musical piece or a portion thereof.
      Alternately, random sound patters could be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In an exemplary embodiment, a banjo music, for example, an
      instrumental music entitled "Yours" by Eddy Peabody may be used to
      generate the audible sound frequency modulated non-acoustic
      signal. This and other musical compositions or portions thereof
      may be applied to generate an audible sound frequency modulated
      signal, which may be replayed continuously in a camatic manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The audible energy source 12, for example, may be coupled
      to the amplifier 14 over a co-axial cable or any other suitable
      electrical wiring known to those skilled in the art. In other
      embodiments, the audible energy source may be remotely linked to
      the amplifier 14 using radio frequency or other suitable remote
      communication methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The audible frequency is then amplified by the amplifier 14
      and provided to the output circuitry 16. The amplified modulated
      electrical signal is then provided to the plates 1 and 2 (18, 20)
      for application in exemplary embodiments according to the present
      invention. The plates 1 and 2 may also be referred to as antennas.
      When the plates 1 and 2 are arrayed in a predetermined angle
      (e.g., 180 degrees) with respect to one another, a null between
      the signals emanating from the plates 1 and 2 may occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] When the plates 1 and 2 (18, 20) are applied to a living
      organisms, e.g., plants, human beings, animals, etc., the system
      10 enhances or promotes well being of these living organisms.
      Further, when the plates 1 and 2 (18, 20) are applied to harvested
      fruits, vegetables, fresh meat, dairy products, flowers, etc., the
      system 10 has a preserving effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] For example, the plates 1 and 2 (18, 20) may be applied to
      soil for enhanced plat growth, to a human being or an animal for
      therapeutic purposes, to a fruit or a vegetable to preserve them,
      and/or to a body of water to aerate it. The plates 1 and 2 (18,
      20) may have other beneficial applications as well. When the
      plates 1 and 2 (18, 20) are applied to the soil, they may be
      separated by a predetermined range of distances, which may be
      between 30 m and 60 m. The distance range may depend on one or
      more of desired output power, desired coverage area, type of soil
      (e.g., sandy v. clay), pH of soil, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The output of the audible energy source 12 may be in analog
      or digital format. When the audible energy source 12 outputs a
      digital audio signal, for example, the system 10 may include a
      digital amplifier and/or a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to
      generate an electrical signal modulated at audible sound
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The audible energy source 12, the amplifier 14 and the
      output circuitry 16 may be supplied with power in ac (alternating
      current) form from, for example, an electrical outlet. The power
      may also be supplied using a suitable battery. In other
      embodiments, the system 10 may include solar cells or panels that
      are capable of converting sunlight into electrical energy used by
      the system. This way, the system 10 may be self-contained during
      its operation without the need for any man-supplied energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram for exemplary output
      circuitry 100, which may be used as the output circuitry 16 of
      FIG. 1. The output circuitry 100 includes three capacitors 102,
      104 and 106, which may be blocking capacitors. The capacitors 102
      and 104 are coupled in parallel, and may be applied, for example,
      at a positive terminal of the amplifier, such as the amplifier 14
      of FIG. 1. The capacitor 160 may be applied, for example at a
      negative terminal of the amplifier, such as the amplifier 14 of
      FIG. 1. The capacitors, for example, may have a capacitance of
      0.25 micro farad ([mu]f) each. In other embodiments, the
      capacitors may have other capacitance values. In still other
      embodiments, different number of capacitors may be used. The
      energy dissipation in vacuum tubes of the amplifier 14 is
      approximately 100 watts (25 watts per tube). In other examples,
      the energy dissipation in the vacuum tubes may be more or less
      than 100 watts.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The positive and negative terminals, for example, may
      represent left and right channels of a stereo system. In other
      embodiments, the negative terminal of the amplifier may comprise
      ground. In still other embodiments, the positive and negative
      terminals may represent a pair of differential signals, each
      modulated at audible sound frequency. In other embodiments, the
      capacitors 102 and 104 may be coupled to the negative terminal
      while the capacitor 106 may be coupled to the positive terminal.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate a physical embodiment of the
      exemplary output circuitry of FIG. 2. The side view 110 of FIG. 3B
      illustrates three capacitors 112, 114 and 116. A top view 120
      illustrates that two of the capacitors are coupled together while
      the third capacitor is not coupled to them. It can be seen from
      the side view 110 and the top view 120 that the terminals of the
      capacitors 112 and 116 are coupled together in parallel. FIG. 4
      illustrates another view 130 of the three capacitors 112, 114 and
      116.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] FIG. 5 illustrates a side view 140 of the physical
      embodiment of FIG. 3 enclosed in a can 142. The can 142, for
      example, may be made of metal. The can may also provide
      capacitance. The capacitors in the can 142, for example, may be
      held in place by applying and curing epoxy 144 in the can 142. In
      other embodiments, other types of capacitors may be used. Further
      in other embodiments, material other than epoxy may be used to
      hold the capacitors in place.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram for another exemplary output
      circuitry 150 for the system of FIG. 1. Output circuitry for
      coupling to each of positive and negative terminals of the
      amplifier in this embodiment includes nine (9) capacitors. In
      other embodiments, the number of capacitors may be more or less
      than nine. The capacitors used in the output circuitry 150 may be
      blocking capacitors or any other capacitors known to those skilled
      in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] FIG. 7 is a schematic diagram for an exemplary amplifier
      200 for the system of FIG. 1. In the amplifier 200, power input
      circuitry 202 receives input power through a power cord, for
      example. Supplied power is transformer coupled to power
      distribution circuitry 204, which is used to apply power to other
      components of the amplifier 200. In other embodiments, the input
      power may be supplied by one or more batteries. In still other
      embodiments, solar energy may be converted to electrical power to
      supply the input power.<br>

      [0042] The audible sound frequency modulated electrical signal is
      applied first at a voltage amplification stage 206. The amplified
      signal is then inverted in a phase inverter/driver stage 208.
      Finally, the inverted signal is applied to an output stage 210,
      which includes a number of vacuum tubes arranged in a push-pull
      class AB configuration for driving the output circuitry, such as
      the output circuitry 16 of FIG. 1. The amplifier 200 of FIG. 1 is
      provided for illustrative purposes only. Those skilled in the art
      would appreciate that any suitable audio amplifier known to those
      skilled in the art may be used instead. Further, those skilled in
      the art would appreciate that the amplifier does not require any
      output transformers since the amplified signals are tapped
      directly, for example, at output leads 212 and 214, and coupled to
      the output circuitry.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] FIG. 8 is a solid state audio output transformer 160 in
      another embodiment according to the present invention. When the
      audible sound frequency modulated electrical signal is a digital
      signal, for example, the audio output transformer 160 may be used
      as output circuitry instead of the output circuitry including a
      number of capacitors, for example, of FIGS. 2 and 6. Further, when
      the audible sound frequency modulated electrical signal is a
      digital signal, the analog amplifier, such as the amplifier 200 of
      FIG. 7 may not be needed. Instead, a digital amplifier may be used
      to increase the signal strength. In other embodiments, digital and
      analog circuitry for generating respective signals modulated at
      audible sound frequency may be included in the same housing.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Returning now to FIG. 1, the plates 1 and 2 (18, 20) may be
      applied to soil (ground) in order to effect plant growth that may
      require less water. The inventor has also found that the
      application of these signals to the soil may also result in cooler
      temperature for the soil.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In an exemplary embodiment according to the present
      invention, the audible sound frequency stimulation may be applied
      in a controlled manner, in which a segment of musical frequencies
      of a pre-determined length of time (1 minute to 3 minutes) is
      repeatedly played continuously. <br>

      </b><br>
      [0046] Returning now to FIG. 1, the plates 1 and 2 (18, 20) may be
      applied to soil (ground) in order to effect plant growth that may
      require less water. The inventor has also found that the
      application of these signals to the soil may also result in cooler
      temperature for the soil.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In an exemplary embodiment according to the present
      invention, the audible sound frequency stimulation may be applied
      in a controlled manner, in which a segment of musical frequencies
      of a pre-determined length of time (1 minute to 3 minutes) is
      repeatedly played continuously.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] It can be demonstrated that plant life can absorb and
      transmit the audible sound energy from the system in an exemplary
      embodiment according to the present invention, which may be
      referred to as an agronosonic stimulator. This may be demonstrated
      on broad leaf plants or melons as the musical sounds, which are
      being applied in a non-acoustic (e.g., silent) manner by the
      agronosonic stimulator, may be heard by human ears when they are
      drawn out of the surface of the plant or melon. For example, the
      surface of the leaves or the melon may be stimulated (e.g., by
      "massaging" or "caressing" with hand) to draw out audible sound.
      When the audible sound frequency vibration controlled energy is
      applied non-acoustically to human beings, similar stimulation may
      be applied to the human beings (e.g., on the back) to draw out
      audible sound.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] An exemplary embodiment of the present invention may be
      applied to preservation of organic products such as fruits,
      vegetables, fresh meat, dairy products, flowers, and the like. By
      applying the output (i.e., audible sound energy) of the exemplary
      embodiment intermittently to a watermelon, for example, the
      watermelon may be preserved without deteriorating, for example,
      nine months or longer. The exemplary embodiment may also be
      applied to dried fruits such as raisins and dried figs to reduce
      mold as well as to replace refrigeration, and could be applied to
      other organic products that are subject to spoilage.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] When applied to water, an exemplary embodiment according to
      the present invention may have an effect of preventing its
      stagnation, and may also have a cooling effect on water. This may
      be applied to a fish tank to prevent stagnation of water as well
      as to do away with requirements for aeration of water to provide
      oxygen thereto.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Further, bacterial growth may be retarded in living
      organisms (e.g., human beings or animals) and/or organic matter by
      applying the stimulator of the present invention. One byproduct of
      the application of the exemplary embodiment according to the
      present invention may be hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which may be
      generated along with oxygen. The preservation effect in exemplary
      embodiments of the present invention may at least be partly
      attributable to H2O2, which may operate as a germicide. For
      example, the H2O2 may prevent deterioration of organic matter by
      killing bacteria and/or other micro organisms. By killing
      bacteria, the exemplary embodiment of the present invention may
      also enhance the immune system of human beings, plants and/or
      animals.<br>
