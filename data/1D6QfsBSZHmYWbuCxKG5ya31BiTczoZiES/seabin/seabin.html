      <b>A simple solution to our oceans pollution</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We are excited to introduce our new invention helping to solve,
      educate and prevent our oceans pollution problems.<br>
      <br>
      The Seabin is a revolution in ocean cleaning technology. It will
      help create cleaner oceans with healthier marine life. The Seabin
      project is helping create a better way of life for everyone and
      every living thing.<br>

      <br>
      How can you guys clean our oceans one marina at a time?<br>
      <br>
      By starting close to the source of the problem in a controlled
      environment. <br>
      <br>
      The marinas, ports and yacht clubs are the perfect place to start
      helping clean our oceans. There are no huge open ocean swells or
      storms inside the marinas, its a relatively controlled
      environment. The wind and currents are constantly moving the
      floating debris around in our oceans and in every port, marina or
      yacht club there is always some pollution heavy areas based on the
      predominant wind and current directions.<br>
      <br>
      By working with these marinas, ports and yacht clubs we can locate
      the seabin in the perfect place and mother nature brings us the
      rubbish to catch it. Sure we cant catch everything right now but
      its a really positive start. <br>
      <br>
      It’s a big mission, but it can be done.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, we’re doing it right now.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Existing solutions to the ocean pollution problem.</b><br>
      <br>
      The existing solutions addressing the oceans pollution problems is
      typically the “trash boats” These boats drive around harbors and
      marinas scooping up rubbish with nets built into them. They are
      very expensive to run and maintain and while they do a lot of
      good, they are not very effective according to the marinas that
      operate them says Caterina Amengual, General Director of the
      environment for the Balearic islands, Spain.<br>
      <br>
      Marina workers walk around with nets scooping the rubbish out of
      the corners where it all converges. Again while these guys they
      are doing a great job, they just cannot keep up with the pollution
      says Eli Dana, General Manager of Newport Shipyard, Rhode Island.<br>
      <br>
      Bigger scale ocean clean up concepts are also happening. The main
      one is by Boyan Slats with “The Ocean Clean Up”. But at this
      moment in time its just a concept, but a great one! &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Why is the Seabin better?</b><br>
      <br>
      Because its here now<br>
      It’s a solution<br>
      It’s a prevention<br>
      It's educative<br>
      It works<br>
      It's low cost<br>
      It's low maintenance<br>
      It's very effective<br>
      It works 24/7<br>
      <br>
      The Seabin isn’t big or bulky and can fit into the problem corners
      of marinas without being obtrusive or taking up dock space for
      boats. The waste in the Seabin is collected easily and disposed of
      responsibly in the already establish waste disposal system of the
      marina.<br>
      <br>
      We also have the option to fit an oil/water separator to the
      system. &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <b>How does Seabin work?&nbsp; &nbsp;</b><br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="diagram.jpg" height="469"
          width="620"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The Seabin is located in the water and is fixed to a floating
      dock. There is a shore based water pump on the dock running on
      shore power.<br>
      <br>
      The water pump creates a flow of water into the bin bringing with
      it all floating rubbish and debris. The rubbish/debris is caught
      in a natural fibre catch bag and the water is then sucked out the
      bottom of the bin and up to the water pump where it is then pumped
      back into the marina.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Who is the Seabin project targeted at?</b><br>
      <br>
      Marinas, ports, harbors, yacht clubs, inland waterways, rivers,
      lakes, private pontoons and even motor yachts and super
      yachts.&nbsp; Even boat or business owners that want to have
      a&nbsp; Seabin in their local yacht club or marina.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Who are you guys?</b><br>
      <br>
      Seabin Pty Ltd was founded by Australians Andrew Turton and Pete
      Ceglinski, supported by a seed investment by Australian marine
      technology development company Shark Mitigation Systems Pty Ltd
      (SMS). SMS has technology partnerships with Google and Australian
      telecommunications company Optus, and is on a pathway to IPO
      listing on the Australian Stock Exchange.<br>
      <br>
      Seabin Pty Ltd Director Andrew Turton is an Australian boat
      builder, sailor and surfer who conceived the Seabin concept after
      numerous sailing trips around the world and witnessing the amount
      of pollution that amasses in the marinas.<br>
      <br>
      Co-Director Pete Ceglinski is an Australian industrial designer
      and surfer. Commencing his industrial design career in
      injection-moulded plastic products, in 2004 Pete crossed over to
      the yachting industry, catalyzing the collaboration with Andrew on
      the Seabin venture.<br>
      <br>
      The design and development of the Seabin project is based in Palma
      Mallorca, Spain at the design center “The Sea” a factory space set
      up for creatives. The Sea has office and meetings space, an events
      gallery and a workshop area ideal for the Seabin project.<br>
      <br>
      The Palma Mallorca location is important for the Seabin project,
      being the central hub of Europe’s marine industry and also having
      quick international access.<br>
      <br>
      The Seabin project is in the final prototype phase with intensive
      product testing in the “Real Club Nautic” marina and yacht club
      based in Palma Mallorca.<br>
      <br>
      November 2015, Seabin Pty Ltd is commencing a crowd funding
      campaign seeking donations to provide additional seed capital for
      the commercialisation of Seabin.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Possible risks and challenges</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We have spent a long time perfecting&nbsp; and developing the
      Seabin protoype and have minimalized a lot of risks through hard
      work and dedication. However we also understand there will be
      design and material modifications in our quest of producing the
      most sustainable product we can afford with our budget. We have
      given ourselves a realistic delivery date being mid to late 2016
      to begin shipping. If this project goes big than the risk is maybe
      we will be slightly later as we may need to upgrade our production
      line to handle the orders.<br>
      <br>
      We aim to be completely honest of where we are with the project,
      we feel we owe it to our supporters. If we suffer a set back we
      will let you know, maybe one of our supporters has the solution!<br>
      <br>
      Our biggest challenge will be if this project goes through the
      roof with high orders placed then we need to turn to more
      sustainable methods of producing the Seabins. We have contingency
      plans and designs in place if this happens (fingers crossed)<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Manufacturing</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We have a great facility set up at “The Sea” where we make nearly
      everything in house ourselves. But for the first run of the
      Seabins we will need to outsource some components and already have
      suppliers here in Europe on standby to start producing when we
      give them the green light. We will then assemble everything local.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fulfillment</b><br>
      <br>
      We aim to start shipping mid to late 2016. If we can ship
      beforehand even better, but we want to be realistic. We anticipate
      a month or so of tweaking and refinement of the final product. We
      want to be sure you have the perfect product.<br>
      <br>
      To reach our goal we anticipate we need to supply 50 Seabins. We
      feel this is also a realistic goal in this time frame. Again, if
      the project hits the big time then we need to step up the
      manufacturing and may take a little longer. But be rest assured
      that fulfilling our supporters are our first priority<br>
      <br>
      For the other perks, it will be shipped out quickly. No dramas
      there.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Seabin development</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We have spent a lot of time, energy and money developing the
      prototype to the best we possibly could. However there is always
      room for improvements and modifications.<br>
      <br>
      We want to build the Seabins in the most sustainable and
      responsible way we can afford and to reduce our carbon footprint
      as much as possible.<br>
      <br>
      Put short, the more money we can raise the better we can build the
      Seabins and the more efficient they will be.<br>
      <br>
      Imagine building seabins from recycling our own captured plastics
      and materials to build more Seabins. Now that would be something!<br>
      <br>
      Something even bigger would be a world where we don’t need the
      Seabins.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Who buys these Seabins?<br>
      <br>
      A: The Seabins are not for the everyday person. Marinas ports and
      yacht clubs are the target market. They will purchase and maintain
      the Seabins, providing a service that benefits the everyday
      people, oceans and sealife by removing trash from our oceans and
      waterways. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Q: How do Seabins work in tidal areas?<br>
      <br>
      A: Seabins at present are designed for floating docks and
      pontoons.<br>
      <br>
      Q. How are the pumps run? Do you have any other plans to power
      them?<br>
      <br>
      A. The pumps are currently electric, costing around $20 a month to
      run. We are looking into alternative eco friendlier power sources
      for the near future!<br>
      <br>
      Q: When are the Seabins available?<br>
      <br>
      A: Seabins will be available for shipping late 2016<br>
      <br>
      Q. What are your plans for the future? Bigger ones?<br>
      <br>
      A. The possibilities of what we can do if we get some smarter
      brains involved are endless! This is just the beginning!<br>
      <br>
      Q: What do the Seabins cost and how do we get one?<br>
      <br>
      A: The Seabins are available as a pre order through Indiegogo
      only. The Indiegogo price is USD$3,825.00 for a unit. Details
      through the link above.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Do any fish get sucked into the Seabins? What about smaller
      marine life?<br>
      <br>
      A: We have never caught a fish or marine animal in 4 years of
      testing Seabins. We also have a meeting with a marine Biologist on
      the 22nd Dec to start a study into the microscopic marine life.<br>

      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;TURTON ANDREW STEPHEN<br>
      <br>
      Collection device for floating debris, which applies to be
      installed fixed shape or mobile on a pier, dock, wharf or other
      fixed element of a port or any other aquatic area, being located
      just below the surface (4) water, is characterized in that it is
      configured from a container (2) outside which is fixed jointly,
      the said fixed element of the port, with its upper edge positioned
      slightly below the surface (4) water; a floating basket (5) less
      than or equal dimensions housed inside said container, which is
      attached to the top of the container by elastic fastenings (7);
      and a motor pump (8) electric or pneumatic, which, when activated,
      suctions the water contained in the container (2) causing the
      water level (4 ') inside lower, hydraulic basket (5) falls,
      penetrating new into the container (2) and dragging objects, waste
      and garbage (9) that are floating in the vicinity of the container
      (2), towards the inside of the basket (5), water which, in turn,
      as a result of the water inlet rises again, repeating the suction
      and lifting movement. <br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention as expressed in the title of this specification,
      refers to a collection device floating debris, which contributes
      to the function for which it is intended, several advantages and
      innovative features of novelty inherent in their particular
      organization and constitution , which will be described in detail
      below and are a remarkable novelty in its application field.<br>
      <br>
      More particularly, the object of the invention is directed to a
      device, intended to be installed in water, such as sea ports or
      other, in lakes, ponds, rivers, seas and oceans under the surface
      level of the spaces water, is intended to serve as a tool for
      automatic garbage collection and waste floating in the water and
      for cleaning it of traces of oil, fuel oil, gasoline or other
      fluids, for which it is configured from a installed in a container
      basket in which a suction pump, which can go in or out of said
      container, whose action causes repeated raising and lowering of
      the basket causing the water to flow through and thus catch any
      floating object also implemented filtering it.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SCOPE OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The scope of the present invention is part of the industry
      dedicated to the manufacture and use of equipment and devices
      automatic cleaning sector, focusing particularly on the area of
      ​​intended to clean water, especially seawater seaports, but also
      the freshwater river ports and similar locations. The main purpose
      of the invention is to clean the waterways of garbage, oil, dirt,
      pollution being one of the main problems of our civilization.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As it is known, in ports water normally gets dirty oil, fuel and
      other products that inevitably follow from the engines of boats
      and ships, making the water therefrom appears very dirty. In
      addition, it is also a problem the continued existence of trash
      and floating objects falling both ships as port users or nature,
      such as leaves. Even worse, the trash in the streets washed
      through drains in the ocean / sea / river resulting in a large
      contamination problem.<br>
      <br>
      This causes a constant cleaning performance, to keep water
      conditions is necessary. This cleaning, so far, usually being done
      either manually from the springs, with nets or strainers to
      collect garbage and floating debris or specific barges, equipped
      with a sophisticated system of lateral strainers, they go walking
      through the port be cleaning the water surface.<br>
      <br>
      The aim of the present invention is to provide to the market an
      innovative system of cleaning of water in these ports and any
      water space, as a substitute or supplement to the previously
      described 30, allow for a permanent system suctioned and
      filtering, strategically located in the port and possibly with
      more than one unit, depending on the size of the port and
      automatically cleaning water.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted, moreover, that at least by the applicant, the
      existence of any other collection device floating debris is
      unknown, or any other invention of similar application, having
      technical, structural and constitutive similar to those having the
      device advocated here, as claimed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXPLANATION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Thus, the collection device floating debris proposed by the
      invention is configured as a remarkable novelty in its scope,
      since according to its implementation and exhaustively, are
      successfully achieved the above objectives, the details being
      Characterising that make it possible to distinguish and
      conveniently collected in the final claims accompanying the
      present specification thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Namely, as proposed by the invention is an automatic device
      intended to be installed in a fixed or mobile (if fixed relative
      is maintained at sea level) on the docks or the like location of a
      port, Marian or other aquatic space , maritime or river, being
      located just below the water surface and preferably positioned as
      the natural geography of the land, currents and prevailing winds.<br>
      <br>
      This device is configured essentially from an external container
      into which a floating basket, smaller is housed and which is
      attached to the top of said container by springs, flexible
      membrane, bellows or extendable means in water analogs, such that,
      although the upper edge of the container is below the surface, the
      top edge of the floating basket in its resting state, is floating
      just on the surface.<br>
      <br>
      The device also contemplates the existence of a motor pump of
      water, preferably at the lower base of the container, but can also
      be mounted externally, but always arranged so that by acting the
      pump sucks the water in the container and in the basket and push a
      hole or driving under the base of the container, making said
      basket falls within the container and, when descending, water
      penetrates into the container and basket through the top edges of
      container that they are below the surface, thereby causing
      entrainment of floating debris and any objects that may be in the
      vicinity and the water flow through a filter provided inside the
      container prior to the pump. In addition, as a result of the entry
      of water, filling the tank is repeated and in it the basket again
      float and therefore rises again preventing the trapped trash can
      back out, producing a repetitive motion and continued suction
      lifting and dragging the trash goes into the basket, where it is
      caught to be collected, while going by passing the water through
      the filter to phase out oil and other fluids that get dirty
      contained therein.<br>
      <br>
      In the event that the pump is externally positioned the container
      will be installed connected thereto by a hose or pipe fixed to the
      hole provided in the base of the container and also have a
      separator oil filter / additional water installed in such hose or
      pipe as a separate unit.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, and to facilitate removal of garbage collection,
      there is provided the existence of a removable mesh that, as a bag
      is placed inside the basket of the device, so can be easily
      emptied and washed, may be replaced whenever appropriate.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To complement the description being made and in order to aid a
      better understanding of the characteristics of the invention, the
      present specification, as an integral part thereof, a set of
      drawings is attached in which with character is illustrative and
      not limiting, it represents the following:<br>
      <br>
      Figure number 1 shows a schematic sectional view of an exemplary
      preferred embodiment of floating debris collecting device, object
      of the invention, it being appreciated in the main parts and
      elements comprising, as well as the configuration and arrangement
      of each of those parts and elements.<br>
      <br>
      Figure number 2 shows a view also a sectional view the example of
      device according to the invention shown in the preceding figure,
      shown in this case with the basket in its lowest position and the
      water level inside the container also at its lowest point, unlike
      depicted in figure 1 where the full container is shown and the
      basket floating in its highest point.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In view of the mentioned figures and according to the adopted
      numbering, we can see in them an example of preferred embodiment,
      but not limiting, of the collection device floating debris object
      of the invention, which comprises the parts and elements They
      indicated and described in detail below.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, as these figures is observed, the device (1) in question is
      configured from an outer container (2) which is fixed jointly, for
      example by supports (3) formed by anchor rods to a spring dam
      landing or the like fixed member port, so that its upper edge is
      slightly below the surface line (4) water.<br>
      <br>
      Said container (2) housed therein includes a floating basket (5),
      to ensure correct vertical positioning and improved buoyancy
      preferably incorporates floats (6), fixed at least in its lower
      part.<br>
      <br>
      In any case, said basket (5) has smaller dimensions that the
      container (2) external, or the same size and is tapered to fit
      within, and is attached to the top of said container by elastic
      fastenings ( 7), such as coil springs, flexible membrane or
      bellows or the like extendable elements, so that, although the
      upper edge of the container (2) is below the surface, as noted
      above, the upper edge of the basket (5) can fluctuate floating on
      the water surface and raise or lower the level of it.<br>
      <br>
      Also, the device (1) has a pump (8), which can be electrical,
      hydraulic, or pneumatic, which, when activated, suctions the water
      contained in the container (2) causing the water level (4 ') from
      inside down, and therefore falls within the basket container
      causing at the same time, new water from entering into the
      container and basket through the top edges of container which are
      below the surface, which determines the dragging objects, waste
      and garbage (9) that are floating in the vicinity of the container
      (2) into the basket (5).<br>
      <br>
      In addition, as a result of the water inlet and filling the tank
      (2), the basket, since fleet back up to again raise the water
      level, repeating the sucking motion and elevation is dragging the
      trash inside the basket (5).<br>
      <br>
      Note that preferably the pump (8) is located on the lower base of
      the container (2) and that, before it is incorporated in said
      container (2) under the basket (5) a filter (10) capable of
      removing traces of oil, fuel oil and other dense fluids water, for
      cleaning.<br>
      <br>
      While it has not shown in the figures, in the event that the pump
      (8) is external, will be connected to the container (2) through a
      hole of the base by a hose or pipe, and have a separating filter
      additional oil / water installed on said hose or pipe as a
      separate unit.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, and to facilitate removal of garbage (9) that builds
      up in the basket (5), there is provided the existence of a mesh
      (11) removable.<br>
