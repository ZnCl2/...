      Various physical properties of water with IE structures are
      measured. Compared with oridinary water, there is an approximate
      20% decrease in dielectric constant for IE water at MHz as an
      increase of emf generated by IE water between two identical
      stainless steel electrodes, and an increase in resistivity to AC
      current. Fluorescence at 298 nm peak is seen in IE water but not
      in ordinary water. From the thermal variation of UV absorption
      spectrum, one can estimate the amount of IE structure to be up to
      3%. The elevation of boiling point due to IE structure can then be
      used to calculate the molecular weight of IE structure to be the
      same as water molecule.<br>

      <br>
      Nano Fuel is a true combustion enhancer. Our catalyst increases
      the combustion without raising peak temperature in the engine and
      without the use of detergents, solvents or distillates.<br>
      <br>
      It is 100% Biodegradable, non-toxic, no metals, no chemicals and
      no carcinogens.<br>
      <br>
      Nano Fuel is environmentally friendly, reducing greenhouse gases,
      especially carbon dioxide, and other harmful exhaust emissions.<br>
      <br>
      Save your bottom line, save your engine, and save the air that we
      all breathe. You will discover that Nano Fuel truly has been
      engineered as a win-to-win for all of us.<br>
      <br>
      Nano Fuel is developed from subatomic particles founds in H2O.
      This new geometric form in the solid particles of water creates a
      strong catalytic reaction inside the combustion chamber. The
      stable solid hydrogen and oxygen clusters induce a catalytic
      reaction because of their strong electrical attraction.<br>
      <br>
      Nano Fuel is not a chemical process; there are no solvents or
      detergents, benzene, 2-Ethylhexyl nitrates or the like. All former
      “additives” without exception are harmful to the environment and
      carcinogenic to people. There are no “safe” additives. Except Nano
      Fuel!<br>
      <br>
      Nano Fuel does not create toxic byproducts and will actually
      outperform all of the former additives if one gives it enough time
      to work. Not only outshine them in performance, but at the same
      time create no damage to one’s equipment, no damage to our health
      or the environment.<br>

      Stable Water Clusters: A New Look at the Structure of Water to
      Save Lives Dr. Shui-Yin Lo Talks about the Potential Benefits of
      Double Helix Water on Sharon Kleyne Hour Power of Water Hear
      Sharon Kleyne's interview with Dr. Shui-Yin Lo on World Talk
      Radio, Voice America, Green Talk Network and Apple iTunes<br>
      <br>
      Sharon Kleyne, international water advocate and host of the Sharon
      Kleyne Hour Power of Water syndicated radio talk show, has long
      advocated more research into the physical properties of water. A
      recent discovery by Shui-Yin Lo, PhD, which he calls "stable water
      clusters" or "double helix water," has demonstrated the health
      potential of continued water research.<br>
      <br>
      Shui-Yin Lo was interviewed by Sharon Kleyne on her radio talk
      show on February 26, 2012. The interview may be heard on-demand on
      World Talk Radio, Voice America, Green Talk Network and Apple
      iTunes.<br>
      <br>
      "Water is the basis of all life on Earth," Sharon Kleyne explains.
      "Yet water is largely overlooked in medical research, possibly
      because water cannot be formulated or patented. I am extremely
      pleased that visionary scientists such as Dr. Shui-Yin Lo are
      attempting to reverse this trend."<br>
      <br>
      Far more study is needed, according to Mrs. Kleyne, on dehydration
      (water loss) as a contributing factor in disease and on the health
      role of humidity in the air.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Shui-Yin Lo began his water research career as particle
      physicist in China, where he became interested in the physical
      properties of water, which he describes as "highly complex." His
      research specialty became discovering the parameters of water
      behavior under extreme laboratory conditions.<br>
      <br>
      He predicted, and later verified through experimentation, that
      extremely pure water, when charged with extremely diluted salt
      ions, will form solid stable water clusters (double helix water)
      with many unique properties. Water, according to Shui-Yin Lo,
      contains many molecules but only three atoms per molecule. Water
      molecules are dipolar, with a positive side and a negative side
      that is much stronger than a magnet.<br>
      <br>
      These ionic charges, Shui-Yin Lo suggests, could eventually
      provide physical proof of the fourteen "meridian lines"
      hypothesized in traditional Chinese medicine, which are the basis
      for acupuncture and other therapies. He was written a book on the
      subject, Biophysics Basis for Acupuncture and Health (Dragon Eye
      Press, 2004).<br>
      <br>
      Double helix water many also have some benefit in stimulating the
      body's protective "t-cells," promoting detoxificaton and
      preventing autism.<br>

      Check out this one-hour webinar and learn more about Stable Water
      Clusters. This newly discovered phase of water is comprised of
      clusters of solid, rigid, ice-like, nanometer-sized,
      uncontaminated H2O molecules.&nbsp; Held in suspension with
      ultra-pure water, these stable water clusters have demonstrated
      unique properties that could contribute to an explanation for the
      mechanism of homeopathy.<br>
      <br>
      Increasing evidence suggests that chains of Stable Water Clusters,
      situated in fascia and connective tissue throughout the body are
      indeed the actual circuitry of the acupuncture meridian system.
      Such evidence is supported by both Atomic Force Microscope and
      Electron Microscope photographs. Because of their size and charge,
      Dr. Lo believes that these solid nanometer-sized particles absorb
      immediately into the semi-permeable membranes and enter into the
      energetic networks of the acupuncture meridian system. He feels
      these clusters are indeed the material bases for the meridian
      system known as the Jing Luo in Traditional Chinese Medicine
      (TCM).<br>

      fibromyalgia.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Still a further feature of the present invention resides in
      that the administration of the stable water clusters can include
      administering the stable water clusters to the person having a
      mental disease including depression, bipolar disorder,
      schizophrenia ADHD ADD and ASD.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Still another feature of the present invention resides in
      that the administration of the stable water clusters can include
      administering of stable water clusters to a person having a
      genetic disease from malfunction of a normal DNA.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Another feature of the present invention resides in that

      [0011] A further feature of the present invention resides in that
      the administration of the stable water clusters can include
      administering of the stable water clusters to the person who
      suffers, from overworking, stress and toxins, such as biological,
      chemical and physical toxins.<br>

      </b><b>DESCRPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0028] The method for enhancing a health of a person in accordance
      with the present invention includes administration to a person of
      an efficient amount of stable water clusters. The administration
      of the stable water clusters is carried out by administering in
      each case a product with stable water clusters. Some of such
      products are disclosed in our U.S. Pat. No. 8,383,688 issued on
      Feb. 26, 2013 which is incorporated here by reference thereto.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The stable water clusters are solid stable water clusters
      as disclosed in the above identified patent. They can have a
      ring-shaped structure of pentagon, hexagon, rectangle, joined
      together ring-shaped structures linear structures, kidney-shaped
      structures, double-helix structures, etc. They can have nanometer
      sizes. The solid stable water clusters are produced by methods
      disclosed in our U.S. Pat. No. 8,193,251 issued on Jun. 5, 2012
      which is also incorporated here by reference thereto.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In accordance with the present invention, the solid stable
      water clusters can be administered to a person drinking a solution
      containing stable water clusters through mouth, by swallowing
      small objects which contain the stable water clusters, by putting
      a topical cream which contains the stable water clusters on skin
      as disclosed in our U.S. Pat. No. 8,575,223. The solid stable
      water clusters can also be administered to a person by breathing
      the stable water clusters through mouth or nose, putting drops
      which contain the stable water clusters into eyes, ears or nose,
      cleaning colon with solution that contains the stable water
      clusters, eating food that contains the stable water clusters, and
      injecting solution that contain the stable water clusters into
      blood vessels.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In accordance with a further feature of the present
      invention, the solid stable water clusters can be administered to
      persons in the above described ways, in particular to persons
      having an autoimmune disease including arthritis rheumatoid
      arthritis, lupus, diabetes, cancer, asthma, and allergy.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The solid stable water clusters can be administered to
      persons having pain such as neck pain, upper back pain, lower back
      pain, pain in fingers, pain in hands, pain in arms, pain in
      thighs, pain in abdominal area, pain in stomach, pain in heart,
      pain from an accident, pain in head, pain in ear, pain in eyes,
      pain in nose, pain in a cheek, pain in a gum, tooth pain, pain in
      mouth migraine, and pain in sine.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Furthermore the solid stable water clusters can be
      administered to persons having chronic diseases including chronic
      fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia or mental diseases including
      depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia ADHD ADD and ASD.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The stable water clusters can be also administered to
      persons having a genetic disease from malfunction of a normal DNA,
      to athletes for improving their performance and alleviating
      soreness after workouts, to persons who suffers, from overworking,
      stress and toxins selected from the group including biological,
      chemical and physical toxins.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In all above mentioned cases and in other which are not
      specifically mentioned, the administration of effective amounts of
      the stable water clusters enhances health of persons.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The enhancing of health with the use of the stable water
      clusters will be first described in an example of a healing effect
      of stable water clusters on the brain, thyroid, and others. The
      stable water clusters, which is a new solid phase of water that is
      stable in room temperature and pressure, has been presented
      sometime ago. The stable water clusters are made up of pure water
      molecules only without any other impurity, and they have permanent
      electric dipole moment. Stable water clusters has been proposed to
      be the constituents of meridian system in Chinese medicine. The
      yin and yang of Chinese medicine fits nicely to be the electrical
      and positive charges of these stable water clusters. Recently the
      electric fields of these stable water clusters, which are emitted
      from the charges of the electric dipole, have been observed via
      Atomic Force Microscope. A double blind study using blood
      peripheral cells has reported significant increase in cytokines
      production that enhances immune ability. Recently a pilot study
      has found that there is improvement in children with ASD (Autistic
      Spectrum Disorder) from drinking water with stable water clusters.
      If stable water clusters is the basic building block of meridian
      systems, drinking SWC may repair meridians, enhance qi to flow
      smoothly, enable the body to balance itself, and greatly restore
      its own healing ability. Its healing effect may be like that of
      the needles in acupuncture. One needle can cure many diseases. So
      we expect the stable water clusters may have healing effect on
      many aspects of human health. Over the past one and a half years
      we have more than 500 subjects where their thermographs were
      taken. For this study we choose to concentrate the effect of
      stable water clusters on the brain and thyroid for a group of 30
      persons above 50 years old.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Methods and results of measuring very short term healing
      effect of the stable water clusters are presented below.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Volunteers above age 50 were recruited without any
      restriction on their health. There were 16 female and 14 male
      subjects with ages ranging from 53-77 years old. They joined our
      study for various reasons. They ranged from wanting just to have
      better health to people who cannot get well from any other methods
      and hope SWC may improve their health. For the present report a
      group of 30 subjects were studied and their data were analyzed.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The method contained two distinct features that were not
      normally done in clinical test. First, we used each subject as
      control. Each of the 30 subjects participated in the control group
      as well as in the experimental group.) The immediate healing
      effects of stable water clusters (SWC) were studied by using
      infrared image system to take thermographs before and 15 minutes
      after drinking 8 oz ordinary distilled water. Subsequently,
      through thermographs we could measure the changes of body surface
      temperatures that the SWC water had on each subject. The
      measurement of these temperatures changes of body surface became a
      measure of the healing effect of the ordinary distilled water,
      which was commonly called placebo effect, and the healing effect
      of SWC. Since thermographs were passive, non-intrusive device,
      repeated independent sets of measurements can be done many times
      without affecting one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] These were the procedures of our experiment. A first set of
      thermograph of the subject was taken where subjects did not drink
      any liquid. Then each subject was given an 8 ounce glass of
      ordinary distilled water to drink. A second set of thermograph of
      the subject was taken fifteen minutes afterwards. Then the subject
      was given 8 ounce glass of SWC to drink. A third set of
      thermographs was taken fifteen minutes afterwards. By comparing
      the first and second set of thermographs the effect of ordinary
      water was measured. It serves as the control for that person. Two
      examples are shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, showing subjects with
      control variable vs stable waster clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] It is clear from these pictures there are many hot spots
      and hot areas. We chose to study hot areas and hot spots that
      could be identified with acupuncture point in Chinese medicine. In
      particular ten acupoints were chosen. From the thermographs of the
      frontal face six hot areas or hot spots were chosen: left and
      right BL1 (the inner extreme points in the eyes), left and right
      ST4 (outer corners of the mouth), and left and right ST12 (2/3 up
      the collar bone beneath the neck). From the thermographs of the
      two sides of the head, four hot areas or hot spots were chosen:
      left and right SJ21 (next to the frontal center of the ear lobe),
      and left and right GB14 (temple area). These ten hot spots were
      chosen because of they were present in all subjects not just in
      the 30 subjects we chose here, but in all 500 subjects that we
      studied so far.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] For these hot areas and hot spots we chose to measure the
      maximum temperature as representing the seriousness of the health
      problem. The hotter the maximum temperature, the more inflamed the
      acupoint or the meridian, where the hot spot resided, was.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Let T1 (Ai) be the maximum temperature at ten acupoints Ai,
      where i=1, 2, . . . , 10, before the drinking any liquid, T2 (Ai))
      the maximum temperature at acupoints Ai 15 minutes after drinking
      ordinary distilled water, and T3 (Al) the maximum temperature at
      acupoints Ai 15 minutes after drinking SWC. The differences in
      maximum temperatures are:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      ?2,1 (Ai)=T2 (Ai)-T1 (Ai),&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)<br>
      <br>
      [0044] which measures the placebo effect of drinking ordinary
      distilled water. A negative ? means cooling of the hot spot, and a
      positive ? means a warming up of the hot spat. The difference in
      maximum temperature 15 minutes after drinking SWC as compared with
      drinking ordinary distilled water is<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      ?3,2 (Ai)=T3 (Al)-T2 (Ai).&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The set of hot spots Ai consists of two hot spots at the
      eye area BL1, two hot spots ST4 at the corners of the mouth, two
      hot spots ST12 in the collar bone area, two hot spots GB14 on the
      temples, and two hot spots SJ21 near the center of the ears. Thus,
      we have ten differences ?2,1 (Ai) of maximum temperatures at these
      ten hot spots that represent placebo effect caused by drinking
      ordinary distilled water. Furthermore, we have ten differences
      ?3,2 (Ai) of maximum temperatures that are caused by drinking
      additional SWC water. When we subtract ?3,2 (Ai) by ?2,1 (Ai) to
      get the difference<br>
      <br>
      [0046] ?(Ai), this difference<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      ?(Ai)=?3,2 (Ai)-?2,1 (Ai)&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Or<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      ?(Ai)=[T3(Al)+T1(Ai)]-2 T2 (Ai).&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)<br>
      <br>
      [0047] It represents the healing effect of SWC with placebo effect
      being subtracted out.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] First we want to demonstrate by plotting the correlation of
      ?2,1 with ?3,2. In FIG. 3 for each subject the changes in maximum
      temperatures at left and right acupoints GB 14 are shown as a
      point on the x-y plot with its ?2,1 values in the x-axis and its
      ?3,2 values in the y-axis. If the effect of SWC is exactly the
      same as the effect of distilled water, then all points should lie
      on a straight line. In FIG. 3 there is no discernable pattern of
      the points, it is a random distribution of points on the x-y
      plane. Therefore, it means the effect of SWC is completely
      different from the effect of distilled water. This lack of
      correlation among different points on the plot demonstrates that
      SWC is different from distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In FIG. 4, 5, 6, 7 correlations of the effect of distilled
      water and SWC are shown in the ear areas at SJ21, the collar bone
      areas at ST12, eye areas at BL1, and the mouth areas at ST4,
      respectively. Again, there are no discernable patterns of points
      on these five plots. This lack of correlation among different
      points on the plots indicates that SWC is different from distilled
      water in its healing effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In FIG. 8 it is a correlation plot of ?2,1 with ?3,2 for
      all points in these ten areas of 30 subjects.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] FIG. 3 shows the correlation between the effect of
      distilled water (?2,1 as x-axis) and SWC (?3,2 as y-axis) at the
      temple areas at both left and right GB 14. There was a total of 54
      total cases with 45 of those cases having &gt;±0.25 temperature
      change resulting in 83.3% significance. Positive values mean
      heating up and negative values mean cooling down. Note: the points
      that are repeated are shown as only one marker in the graph.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] FIG. 4 shows the correlation between the effect of
      distilled water (?2,1 as x-axis) and SWC (?3,2 as y-axis) at the
      ear area of both left and right SJ21. There was a total of 54
      total cases with 39 of those cases having &gt;±0.25 temperature
      change resulting in 72.2% significance. Positive values mean
      heating up and negative values mean cooling down. Note: the points
      that are repeated are shown as only one marker in the graph.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] FIG. 5 shows the correlation between the effect of
      distilled water (?21 as x-axis) and SWC (?32 as y-axis) at the
      collar bone area of left and right ST12 both left and right GB 14.
      There was a total of 58 total cases with 48 of those cases having
      &gt;±0.25 temperature change resulting in 82.8% significance.
      Positive values mean heating up, and negative values mean cooling
      down. Note: the points that are repeated are shown as only one
      marker in the graph.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] FIG. 6 shows the correlation between the effect of
      distilled water (?21 as x-axis) and SWC (?32 as y-axis) at left
      and right acupoints BL1 of eye areas. There was a total of 60
      total cases with 44 of those cases having &gt;±0.25 temperature
      change resulting in 73.3% significance. Positive values mean
      heating up and negative values mean cooling down. Note: the points
      that are repeated are shown as only one marker in the graph.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIG. 7 shows the correlation between the effect of
      distilled water (?21 as x-axis) and SWC (?32 as y-axis) at left
      and right mouth corners of acupoints ST4. There was a total of 56
      total cases with 49 of those cases having &gt;±0.25 temperature
      change resulting in 87.5% significance. Positive values mean
      heating up and negative values mean cooling down. Note: the points
      that are repeated are shown as only one marker in the graph.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] FIG. 8 shows the correlation between the effect of
      distilled water (?21 as x-axis) and SWC (?32 as y-axis) at ten
      acupoints: left and right GB14, left and right SJ21, left and
      right ST4, left and right BL1, and left and right ST12. There was
      a total of 282 total cases with 225 of those cases having
      &gt;±0.25 temperature change resulting in 79.8% significance.
      Note: the points that are repeated are shown as only one marker in
      the graph. Positive values mean heating up and negative values
      mean cooling down.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In the following figures below (FIG. 9-14) we showed the
      quantitative healing effect difference (?) of SWC, which was
      obtained after the subtraction of placebo effect from distilled
      water. The horizontal axis represented by values of ? from -2.75°
      C. to +2.75° C. They were divided into bin of size 0.25° C. In the
      vertical axis it showed the numbers of subjects who had those
      particular values of ? in each bin. We have 30 subjects. Each
      subject has two acupoints GB 14, two SJ21, two BL1, two ST4 and
      two ST12. In principle we should have 300 independent hot spots to
      measure the maximum temperatures. However due to the covering of
      the hot spots by hair which happened occasionally when pictures
      were taken, we had only usable 282 points that we could measure
      maximum temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In FIG. 9 the results for two GB14 (temples) are displayed.
      There were 54 cases total with 45 of those having &gt;±0.25° C.
      temperature change thus resulting in 83.3% (p&lt;0.01), which was
      a significant temperature change in a period of 15 minutes. The
      interval of &gt;±0.25° C. was chosen because it is two and a half
      standard deviation of the statistical fluctuation ±0.1° C. of skin
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In FIG. 10 the results for two SJ21 (ears) are displayed.
      There were 54 cases total with 39 of those having &gt;±0.25° C.
      temperature change thus resulting in 72.2% (p&lt;0.01).<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In FIG. 11 the results for two ST12 (collar bones,
      thyroids) were displayed. There were 58 cases total with 48 of
      those having &gt;±0.25° C. temperature change thus resulting in

      A method of preventing and treating autistic spectrum disorder
      includes administration to a person of a product, which contains
      stable water clusters, such as stable double helix water clusters,
      by taking the products by mouth, applying the products on a skin
      of the person, intaking the product by breathing, introducing the
      products intravenously, etc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to a method of preventing and
      treating autistic spectrum disorder.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The number of children that suffer from autistic spectrum
      disorder is increasing at an alarming rate. However, there is no
      known cure for it. While the definition of the autistic spectrum
      disorder implies that it is linked to neurological problems, it
      was determined that most of the children with autistic spectrum
      disorder have other problems, such as gastrointestinal problems,
      and therefore treatment of autistic spectrum disorder as a problem
      of the brain is too limited. It is therefore believed that it is
      advisable to develop efficient methods of prevention and treatment
      of autistic spectrum disorder.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to
      provide a new and efficient method of preventing and treatment of
      autistic spectrum disorder.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] It is also an object of the present invention to provide a
      new method of detection of autistic spectrum disorder, which will
      allow targeted prevention and treatment of autistic spectrum
      disorder, based on its early and accurate detection.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In keeping with these objects and with others which will
      become apparent hereinafter, one feature of the present invention
      resides, briefly stated, in a method of preventing and treating
      autistic spectrum disorder of a person, in accordance with which a
      product which contains stable water clusters is administered to
      the person.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The administration of the product which contains the stable
      water clusters can prevent and treat the autistic spectrum
      disorder, as will be explained in detail herein below.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In accordance with the preferable embodiment of the present
      invention, the administration to the person of the product with
      the stable water clusters includes administering to the person the
      product which contains the stable water clusters that are double
      helix water clusters. The use of the products with the double
      helix stable water clusters provides high efficiency in prevention
      and treatment of the autistic spectrum disorder.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Various procedures can be used for administration of the
      products with stable water clusters to the person for prevention
      and treatment of autistic spectrum disorder.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The products with stable water clusters can be administered
      to the persons by taking the products with stable water clusters
      via his or her mouth for prevention and treatment of autistic
      spectrum disorder. The products with stable water clusters can be
      inhaled by the persons for prevention and treatment of autistic
      spectrum disorder. The products with the stable water clusters can
      be applied topically on a skin of the person to prevent or treat
      autistic spectrum disorder. The products with the stable water
      clusters can be introduced into the body of the person intravenous
      for prevention and treatment of autistic spectrum disorder. Also,
      combinations of the above specified procedures of administration
      can be used as well.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In accordance with the present invention the prevention of
      development of autistic spectrum disorder can be carried out at a
      very early stage, when a person is a child. In accordance with one
      approach a mother can drink a product with stable water clusters,
      which will be passed to a baby through breast feeding. If however
      the baby is fed with artificial milk, then the product with stable
      water clusters can be added to the artificial milk.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In accordance with the present invention, the products with
      the stable water clusters are applied on the body of a person on
      acupoints, which lie on meridians of a meridian system of the
      person. In particular the products with the stable water clusters
      can be applied on the acupoints which are located in hot spots or
      hot areas of the body. The hot spots or hot areas are
      characterized by temperatures which are higher than temperatures
      of adjoining areas of the body and are indicative of health
      problems in the organs of the person's body, associated with the
      autistic spectrum disorder.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In accordance with the present invention, the determination
      of the hot spots and hot areas on the body of the person can be
      carried out with the use of an infrared imaging system that takes
      thermal images of the person.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] It is considered to be important to determine the hot spots
      or hot areas in twelve areas on the body of the person, such as
      front areas of left and right ears, inner points of left and right
      eyes, left and right near neck shoulder areas, left and right
      forehead temple areas, left and right collarbone areas, and left
      and right armpits areas. The products with the stable water
      clusters can be applied on acupoints associated with the hot spots
      in these areas.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The new features of the present invention are set forth in
      particular in the appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The invention itself, however, both as to its methods and
      products utilized, will be best understood from the following full
      description of preferred embodiments of the inventive method of
      preventing and treating autistic spectrum disorder.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0018] In accordance with the present invention, a new method of
      preventing and treatment of autistic spectrum disorder. In
      accordance with the inventive method, a product which contains
      stable water clusters is administered to a person to prevent or to
      treat autistic spectrum disorder. In particular, the product with
      the stable water clusters can be administered, in which the stable
      water clusters are stable double helix water clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The stable water clusters, water with stable water
      clusters, and products with stable water clusters, including
      double helix water clusters, in the present invention can be
      produced in accordance with methods disclosed in our patent
      application Ser. No. 12/592,873 filed on Dec. 3, 2009, which
      matured in U.S. Pat. No. 8,193,251 issued on Jun. 5, 2012. The
      stable water clusters, the water with stable water clusters, and
      products with stable water clusters, including double helix water
      clusters, are disclosed In our patent application Ser. No.
      12/592,877 filed on Dec. 3, 2009.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In the method in accordance with the present invention, in
      order to prevent or treat autistic spectrum disorder, the stable
      water clusters, in particular the stable double helix water
      clusters, and the products with the stable water clusters can be
      administered to a person by taking via his or her mouth. A person
      can drink water or another liquid product with the stable water
      clusters, take pills or gels with the stable water clusters, etc.,
      and thereby the stable water clusters reach digestive system of
      the person. A part of it, or sometimes the whole product if kept
      longer in the mouth, can be absorbed m the mouth and delivered to
      the blood stream directly.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The stable water clusters and the products with the stable
      water clusters can be also administered to the person by applying
      topically on the skin of the person. For example, a cream which
      contains the stable water clusters can be applied on and rubbed
      into the skin, and the stable water clusters will penetrate
      through the skin of the person's body.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The stable water dusters and the products with the stable
      water clusters can be administered to the person through
      breathing, by inhaling them. Nebulizers, inhalers and other
      devices, which are known per se in the art, can be utilized for
      this procedure of the product administration. In this case the
      stable water clusters are delivered upwards to the brain and
      downwards to the lungs of the person, without going through the
      digestive system.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The stable water clusters and the products with the stable
      water clusters can be introduced into the body of the person via
      an intravenous procedure. In this case the stable water clusters
      are delivered directly into the blood stream of the person.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] It is also contemplated that various combinations of the
      above specified procedures can be used as well, to augument the
      prevention or treatment effect, to make the person more
      comfortable in the process of administration of the product with
      the stable water clusters for prevention or treatment of autistic
      spectrum disorder.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] To improve the percentage and the rate of recovery
      sometimes it is essential to include other therapies, such as
      behavioral therapy, physiological therapy, acupuncture, herbs,
      drugs, biofeedback, massages, external qi applications and/or
      other alternative methods that are suitable for each individual
      person.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Prevention of development of autistic spectrum disorder can
      start from early childhood. This can be carried out in a way that
      a mother, as soon as a baby is born, consumes products with the
      stable water clusters, for example drinks water with the stable
      water clusters so that the stable water clusters are passed to the
      baby with the breast feeding. On the other hand, if a baby is fed
      with artificial milk, the a concentrate of the stable water
      clusters can be added to the artificial milk, which is directly
      given to the baby. Also, a cream with the stable water clusters
      can be applied on the skin of the baby. Since the stable water
      clusters are pure water, they have no harmful effect to babies, as
      do some vaccines.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In accordance with a further embodiment of the present
      invention, the products with the stable water clusters are applied
      to acupoints on the body of the person. The acupoint lies on
      meridians of a meridian system of a person and are associated with
      corresponding organs. It is important to apply the products with
      the stable water clusters on such acupoints which are located in
      so-called hot spots or areas that are indicative of corresponding
      health problems or inflammations of internal organs, since
      internal organs emit hot infrared radiation. The hot spots or
      areas have a temperature which is higher than the temperature of
      the areas that adjoin them. The hot spots or areas can be
      determined by an infrared imaging system that take thermal images
      of the corresponding parts of the body of a person and detect the
      infrared radiation of the internal organs. The thermal images
      clearly show the hot spots or areas with the elevated
      temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] There are twelve regions in which hot spots or areas should
      be considered. These areas are: front areas of left and right
      ears, inner points of left and right eyes, left and right near
      neck shoulder areas, left and right forehead temple areas, left
      and right collarbone areas, left and right armpits areas. The
      meridians of the meridian system of a person, which correspond to
      different internal organs extend through the above identified
      different areas. The difference in the temperatures of the left
      side and the right side of the corresponding area are also
      indicative of health problems of certain internal organs.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The applications of the products with the stable water
      clusters are performed on the acupoints which are located in the
      thusly determined hot spots or hot areas.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The application of the products on the acupoints
      corresponding to internal organs is based on our finding that
      autistic spectrum disorder is linked to health problems of certain
      internal organs, and therefore the application of the products
      with the stable water clusters is carried out on the acupoints
      associated with stomach meridian, bladder meridian, gallbladder
      meridian, large intestine meridian, small intestine meridian, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The infrared imaging system can also be used to monitor the
      process of recovery by making thermal images of corresponding
      areas periodically during the process of treatment of a person by
      the administration of products with the stable water clusters. The
      thermal images taken later in this process are compared with the
      thermal images taken earlier in this process, to determine the
      changing temperatures in the corresponding areas and thereby the
      progress achieved as a result of the treatment in accordance with
      the inventive method.<br>

      For increasing the concentration of stable water clusters in water
      solution an external electric field is applied to provide an
      alignment of electric dipole moments of the stable water clusters
      and for growing of the latter, the water solution with the stable
      water clusters is subjected to vigorous shaking by ultrasound to
      break the stable water clusters into a greater number of smaller
      stable water clusters, and products are produced with increased
      concentration of the stable water clusters.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for
      increasing concentration of stable water clusters, and to products
      produced thereby.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Methods and apparatuses for producing stable water clusters
      and the products which contain the stable water clusters are
      disclosed in our U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,193,251 and 8,383,688. The
      methods and apparatuses disclosed in these patents provide
      efficient production of the stable water clusters. The products
      with the stable water clusters provide numerous noticeable
      physical, chemical, biological and medical effects. It is believed
      that it is advantageous to increase the concentration of the
      stable water clusters in order to enhance such effects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to
      provide a new method and apparatus for increasing the
      concentration of the stable water clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In keeping with these objects and with others which will
      become apparent hereinafter, one feature of the present invention
      resides, briefly stated, in a method and apparatus for increasing
      the concentration of the stable water clusters in a water
      solution, in which the step and means are provided for applying to
      the water solution which contains the stable water clusters an
      external electric field providing an alignment of electric dipole
      moments of the stable water clusters and growing of the stable
      water clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In accordance with another feature of the present
      invention, the water solution with the stable water clusters is
      accommodated in a container, and the applying means are acting
      means which act on the water solution which contains the stable
      water clusters in the container and generate the external electric
      field.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The acting means of the inventive method and apparatus can
      include two plates spaced from one another and arranged outside of
      the container which contains the water solution with the stable
      water clusters so that the container is located between the
      plates.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The acting means of the method and apparatus of the present
      invention can include wire means selected from the group
      consisting of a single wire and a plurality of wires and located
      in an interior of the container which accommodates the water
      solution containing the stable water clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In accordance with the inventive method and apparatus, the
      step and means are further provided, for shaking the water
      solution which contains the stable water clusters, so as to break
      the stable water clusters into a greater number of smaller stable
      water clusters, which subsequently grow larger so that the
      concentration of the stable water clusters in the water solution
      is increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In the inventive method and apparatus, the means shaking of
      the water solution which contains the stable water clusters can
      include means generating ultrasound vibration which provides the
      shaking.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] With the container provided in the inventive method and
      apparatus and accommodating the water solution with the stable
      water clusters, the shaking step and shaking means can provide
      shaking of the container which accommodates the water solution
      with the stable water clusters.<br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0024] In accordance with the present invention, a method and an
      apparatus are proposed for increasing the concentration of stable
      water clusters. For this purpose, water or water solution is used,
      which contains the stable water clusters that are made as
      disclosed for example in our U.S. Pat. Nos. 8, 193,251 and
      8,383,688. Thereafter the new inventive method and apparatus is
      utilized to increase the concentration of the stable water
      clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In accordance with the present invention, an external
      electric field is applied to the water solution that contains the
      stable water clusters. As a result, alignment of the stable water
      clusters will occur along a direction of the external electric
      field. The stronger the external electric field, the more aligned
      are the stable water clusters. When the stable water clusters are
      aligned, an internal electric field is formed because the dipole
      moments of the stable water clusters combine. Water molecules
      adjacent to the stable water clusters align and become attracted
      firmly to the existing stable water clusters to form a part of
      new, enlarged stable water clusters. In this way, under the action
      of the strong external electric field, the stable water clusters
      grow larger.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The external electric field can be applied to the water
      solution with the stable water clusters accommodated in a
      container, for example, by means of two plates between which the
      container is located, or by means of wires introduced into the
      container, or by means of wires introduced in the container in
      combination with the plates located outside of the container.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In order to speed up the process of growth of the stable
      water clusters, it is desirable to increase the number of the
      stable water clusters in the water solution. In accordance with
      the present invention, this can be done by vigorous shaking of the
      container which contains the water solution with the stable water
      clusters. This vigorous shaking can be produced by generating
      ultrasound vibrations of the container. For example, an electrical
      transducer can be connected with the container and generate
      ultrasound vibrations of the container and thereby shaking of the
      water solution with the stable water clusters accommodated in the
      container.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In accordance with the invention, with the combination of
      the strong external electrical field and mechanical, for example
      ultrasound, shaking, a much higher concentration of the stable
      water clusters with a larger size is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] FIG. 1 shows an apparatus for applying external electrical
      field to the water solution with the stable water clusters in
      accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The apparatus has
      a container, formed for example as a rectangular glass tank 1
      which accommodates the water solution with the stable water
      clusters contained in it.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The apparatus further has two plates 2 and 3 which can
      extend parallel to one another and are spaced from one another to
      form therebetween a space, in which the tank 1 is located. The
      tank 1 is filled with water that contains stable water clusters.
      The plates 2 and 3 are connected with a not shown electric circuit
      and produce an external electric field applied to the water with
      the stable water clusters, accommodated in the tank 1. This
      provides alignment of the stable water clusters and forms an
      internal electric field because the dipole moments of the stable
      water clusters combine. Water molecules adjacent to the stable
      water clusters align and become firmly attracted to the existing
      stable water clusters. They then become a part of new enlarged
      stable water clusters, and the stable water clusters grow larger.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The apparatus further has means for vigorous shaking of the
      tank 1, which can be formed as an electric transducer 4 applied to
      the tank 1 and generating ultrasound vibrations. While the
      electrical transducer 4 is shown here as connected to the tank 1,
      it is also possible to connect the transducer to the tank 1
      through a bath of water. The ultrasound applied to the water with
      the stable water clusters in the tank 1 breaks up the stable water
      clusters into smaller ones but with large electric dipole moment.
      These smaller stable water clusters will grow bigger. Since they
      are maintained under the strong external electric field, these
      smaller stable water clusters are aligned and the net electric
      dipole moment is bigger, and also the addition of extra water
      molecules to these smaller stable water clusters is easier.
      Thereby the growth of the smaller stable water clusters into the
      bigger stable water clusters is faster and there are more of them.
      The combination of the strong external electric field and
      ultrasonic shaking creates a much higher concentration of the
      stable water clusters with larger size.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 2 shows a container 5 of the inventive apparatus for
      carrying out the inventive method, in accordance with a further
      embodiment. The container 5 can be composed of a plurality of
      individual units 6, for example of three units, as shown in this
      figure.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The external electric field can be produced, in accordance
      with a further embodiment of the invention, in a different way.
      FIG. 3 shows a unit 7 of the container of the inventive apparatus,
      which is provided with wire means. The wire means can include a
      wire or a plurality of wires 8 arranged inside the unit 7. As
      shown in FIG. 4, the container has two units 7 with the wires 8
      inside them, and a grounded conducting plate 9 located between the
      units 7. The wires 8 and the conducting plate 9 are connected to a
      power source 10 as shown in FIG. 5. In particular all wires 8 are
      connected to the same electrode, while the conducting plate 9 is
      grounded and serves as an opposite electrode. A positive voltage
      is maintained between the conducting plate 9 and the wires 8. Most
      of the potential drop occurs near the thin wires 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] It is also possible to provide in the apparatus a single
      container with a grounded conducting plate located in its interior
      and insulated from the water in the container, and with wires or
      sets of wires also located in the interior of the container, and
      correspondingly connected to a power source.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] During the operation of the inventive apparatus it is
      recommended to provide a period of the vigorous vibration that is
      followed by a period of growth without the vigorous vibration.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] One example of operation of the apparatus in accordance
      with the present invention, which carries out the inventive method
      is presented hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] A cylindrical glass container was used to accommodate the
      water solution that contains the stable water clusters. A
      conducting element which serves as one electrode and was formed as
      an aluminum foil was applied on the glass container. A platinum
      wire was inserted into the glass container in the middle of the
      water solution, and high voltage of 1,000 volt was applied to the
      wire. The glass container was placed in an ultrasound bath and was
      shaken intermittently by turning on the ultrasound bath for 30
      minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Table 1 below shows the size and number of the stable water
      clusters before the shaking and application of 1,000 volt for half
      an hour. 18 hours later the water solution was measured again. The
      measurement showed that the total number of the stable water
      clusters above 0.1 micrometer increases from 331.1 to 984.4333.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      With the present invention, a new cream for applying on a body of
      a human or an animal is proposed. The cream in accordance with the
      present invention has at least one first component including
      stable water clusters.<br>
      <br>
      The stable water clusters are produced as disclosed in our patent
      application Ser. No. 12/592,873 filed on Dec. 3, 2009, which is
      now U.S. Pat. No. 8,193,251 issued on Jun. 5, 2012. The stable
      water clusters are those stable water clusters which are disclosed
      and described in detail in our patent application Ser. No.
      12/592,877 filed on Dec. 3, 2009, whose description is
      incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
      <br>
      The cream in accordance with the present invention is used for
      applying on a body, in particular on a skin, and the stable water
      clusters which are contained in it and have nanometric sizes,
      easily penetrate the skin and produce health enhancing results.<br>
      <br>
      In the inventive cream the stable water clusters which are
      contained in its at least one first component can be double-helix
      water clusters. It is to be understood however that the stable
      water clusters of other configurations can be also utilized in the
      first component of the cream.<br>
      <br>
      The at least one first component includes a mixture of pure water
      and water with the above-mentioned stable water clusters. The pure
      water is preferably a very pure water which has 16 mega ohm or
      better resistance with low total organic carbon less than 100 ppm,
      and it mixed with the water which contains the stable water
      clusters. The amount of the water with the stable water clusters
      in the cream in accordance with the present invention is
      preferably 40% or less by weight from total weight of the cream.<br>
      <br>
      The cream in accordance with the present invention further
      includes at least one second component, which is mixed with the
      above mentioned first component of the cream. The second component
      of the inventive cream preferably can be an organic component.<br>
      <br>
      The second component of the inventive cream can include a plant
      ingredient, an animal ingredient, a nutrient supplement
      ingredient. It can also various combinations of two or three of
      the above mentioned ingredients, which are mixed with each other.<br>
      <br>
      When the second component of the cream is a plant ingredient it
      can include for example oils. When the second component of the
      cream is an animal ingredient it can include for example beeswax.
      When the second component of the cream is a nutrient supplement
      ingredient it can include for example vitamins. The oil for
      example can be coconut oil, sweet almond oil, lecithin, etc, and
      various combinations thereof. The vitamin for example can be
      vitamin E, another vitamin, and various combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The cream in accordance with the present invention, in addition to
      the above mentioned first and second components, can also include
      small amounts of scent, or fragrance, or preservatives, which are
      known per se in the art.<br>
      <br>
      In order to make the cream in accordance with the present
      invention, first water with stable water clusters is made in a
      manner described in detail in our above mentioned patent
      applications and patent, and then mixed with very pure water, so
      as to produce the first component of the cream. Then the second
      component of the cream is produced by mixing its ingredients. The
      water mixture of the ingredients of the first component is warmed
      up, the mixture of the ingredients of the second component is
      heated up and added to the first component, the thusly produced
      mixture is stirred and heated together until the inventive cream
      is formed. It is then cooled down to room temperature and is ready
      to either be stored, or packed into individual containers for
      consumption.<br>
      <br>
      It should be mentioned that the temperature of the mixtures of the
      first and second components should be greater than the freezing
      temperature of water (0° C.) and lower than the boiling
      temperature of water (100° C.), so that its water component
      remains in liquid state.<br>
      <br>
      The cream in accordance with the present invention is used for
      health enhancing purposes of a human body or an animal body. In
      accordance with one embodiment the cream is used to achieve an
      effect which is local and on a surface. In this case the inventive
      cream is applied substantially on an area of the skin which has
      skin problems. In this case the cream may be used for baby rash on
      buttocks, for a mosquito bite on a face, for itches on the skin,
      for burns of the skin, etc. The cream for a respective one of the
      above mentioned health problems can have a slightly different
      composition. In the case this local and surface application of the
      cream, it can be also used for cosmetic purposes to produce a
      smooth and better looking skin.<br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      New methods for production of water clusters will be now described
      in detail.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that ordinary water contains clusters which consist of
      water molecules. These variable water molecules are often called
      flickering-water-clusters because the hydrogen bonds are broken
      randomly by thermal energy and then recombine. The present
      invention deals with sold solid stable water clusters which are
      made of a fixed number of water molecules having a steady stable
      electric field surrounding them.<br>
      <br>
      Solid stable water clusters can be created in accordance with the
      present invention by diluting soluble substances into ultra-pure
      water.<br>
      <br>
      Such solid stable water/clusters range in size from tens of
      nanometers to a few microns in size. These have a permanent
      electric/dipole/moment. There is strong electric field surrounding
      them.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 shows an atomic force microscope picture tapping of one
      such sold solid stable water clusters where the electric field is
      explicitedly measured by its corresponding photo taken using the
      electric force mode of the same microscope. The sample consists of
      ultra-pure water containing many solid stable water clusters onto
      highly-ordered pyrolytic graphite. The atomic force microscope
      picture was taken by a tapping mode where physical contact is made
      on the first pass of the scanning device, but on the second pass
      the tip is held above the surface at a distance of 100 nanometers
      with a 1 volt bias is placed on the scanning tip, thus producing
      an electric force mode picture as in FIG. 2 as the tip then
      becomes effected by the electric field of the solid stable water
      clusters.<br>
      <br>
      The largest solid stable water clusters are of micron size and are
      made from combinations of smaller solid stable water clusters that
      range in size from tens to hundreds of nanometers. One size
      distribution of these solid stable water clusters is shown here.
      In this ultra-pure water containing solid stable water clusters,
      the Lighthouse Model L-S60 Liquid Sampler is used to shown the
      clusters in the following distinct sizes: 0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.25,
      0.3, 0.35, 0.4 and 0.5 Microns.<br>
      <br>
      Solid Stable Water Clusters<br>
      Distribution<br>
      <br>
      0.1&nbsp; 0.15&nbsp; 0.2&nbsp; 0.25&nbsp; 0.3&nbsp; 0.35&nbsp;
      0.4&nbsp; 0.5<br>
      1179&nbsp; 2377.7&nbsp; 2208.7&nbsp; 1530&nbsp; 343.7&nbsp;
      156.7&nbsp; 325&nbsp; 1173<br>
      <br>
      Since the smallest solid stable water clusters are measured in
      nanometers, they are distinct from earlier emulsion products which
      were used before.<br>
      <br>
      The strong electric fields surrounding these solid stable water
      clusters will increase the speed of chemical reactions, hence they
      can be used as catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      It is well known that oil and water do not mix naturally by
      themselves. There are ways to bind oil with water as a stable
      product; either form an emulsion via ultra-sound or vigorous
      shaking or to add chemical binders, or a combination of both.<br>
      <br>
      However, there is a practical problem of how to introduce these
      solid stable water clusters into combustion fuels which feed
      combustion engines of all types. It is necessary to break up the
      solid stable water clusters into their smaller components for the
      best catalytic effect. The nanotechnology emulsion method proposed
      here suspends nano-sized solid stable water clusters directly in
      all petroleum based fuels such as diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, etc.
      without adding additional chemicals such as binder and combustion
      enhancers.<br>
      <br>
      Water/clusters have not been made part of petroleum fuels with a
      nano-emulsion requiring no more than 3 parts per million of sold
      stable water clusters waters.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows an actual production device. One tank is the supply,
      where diesel is placed. It is pumped through a vertical
      ultra-sound shaft into a treatment tank to create a nano-emulsion.<br>
      <br>
      Thus an additive for fuel is a solution that contains solid stable
      water clusters made from water molecules. The solution is a
      special emulsion that contains a suspension of small water
      droplets of submicron size. The emulsion is created via vigorous
      shaking of water that contains sold stable water clusters and
      petroleum products such as diesel fuel, gasoline, and jet fuel
      using ultrasound device. The emulsion is added to the fuel of
      combustion engines and the like, gasoline, diesel, natural gas,
      etc., which combustion engines can be in trucks, cars, ships,
      airplanes, locomotives, or electricity generating plants.<br>
      <br>
      A skin care product in accordance with the invention can include a
      solution that contains solid stable water clusters in accordance
      with the invention. The solution can be an emulsion that contains
      a suspension of small water droplets which contain the solid
      stable water clusters in other non-water-soluble liquids. The
      non-water-soluble liquids can be liquids selected from the group
      consisting of oil and a cream.<br>
      <br>
      The skin care products described above can include additional
      chemicals. On the other hand in the skin care product in
      accordance with the invention no chemicals can be added. The
      emulsion for the skin products can be an emulsion generated via
      vigorous shaking of water that contains solid stable water
      clusters, and water droplets can be of submicron size.<br>
      <br>
      The skin care products in accordance with the invention can
      include ingredients having health benefits. The ingredients can
      include vitamins, minerals, hormones, natural herbal extracts,
      etc.<br>
      <br>
      A food product in accordance with the invention contains inventive
      solid stable water clusters. The solution can be an emulsion that
      contains a suspension of small droplets the solid stable water
      clusters in other non-water-soluble liquids. The food product can
      contain additional substances, or no substances can be added. The
      water droplets are submicron size. The above-mentioned emulsion
      can be generated via vigorous shaking of water that contains the
      solid stable water clusters.<br>
      <br>
      Numerous food products can be produced with the use of the solid
      stable water clusters and corresponding food ingredients. Also
      drinking and non-drinking water can be produced such that it
      contains the inventive solid stable water clusters.<br>
      <br>
      Solid stable water clusters can be produced by diluting organic
      and/or inorganic material with very pure water. It is necessary to
      dilute the inorganic materials to a certain dilution before it is
      possible for the stable water clusters to form. It is also
      necessary to use 18.2 MO*cm million ohms per centimeter quality
      water as the dilution water in order to have the largest amount of
      stable water clusters. Within the ultra-pure water industry,
      equipment is available to purify water to 18.2 MO*cm of
      resistance.<br>
      <br>
      An additional criteria is used to ensure the highest possible
      quality. The Light House LS-60 laser particle counter allows an
      analysis of the number of particles per unit volume present. The
      proper use of containers is ensured thus controlling the leaching
      or contamination from other chemicals or particles which could be
      present in the containers themselves. The two types of containers
      that are used in the inventive method are composed of quartz and
      polypropylene or similar materials.<br>
      <br>
      Distilled commercially available water has typical 50 thousand 0.1
      micron particle or large counts per 1 ml samples. The inventive
      method uses ultra-pure water that has particle counts less than
      500 particles per 1 ml above 0.1 micron. See Table 1 below as a
      comparison of commercially available distilled water and our
      ultra-pure-water.<br>
      <br>
      The ultra-pure water is labeled “10-Water” and is the water that
      is used with the inventive method. Measurements are from 0.1
      microns to 0.5 microns.<br>

      Therefore the first step of the inventive method is the production
      of “10-water” to use as the dilution water to create stable water
      clusters.<br>
      <br>
      Next the process of dilution is carried out in an Argon gas filled
      chamber. It is important to carry out the entire procedure in an
      atmosphere free of carbon dioxide. Pure 18.2 Mohm water will
      degenerate rapidly to 1 Mohm water or less in a matter of seconds
      when it is exposed to normal atmosphere due to the presence of
      carbon dioxide. Such an exposure of ultra-pure water to CO2 will
      form carbonic acid thereby producing ions to conduct electricity.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the dilution in accordance with the invention is
      carried out by adding a small amount of materials to the
      “10-water” in the Argon filled gas chamber. In the following
      example, sodium chloride is used:<br>
      <br>
      In table 2 the particle size distribution of sodium chloride
      solution with concentration of 10 to the minus 3 Mole is shown.<br>

      In Table 2 the particle size distribution of sodium chloride
      solution is shown with concentration of 10 minus 3 Mole made from
      “10 Water”. Dilution with “10 water” to 10 to the minus 7 under
      controlled non-atmosphere conditions equates to a linear downward
      diminishing of particles to a total of 2.7 total particles.<br>
      <br>
      Notice should be made that when that same solution is diluted
      further to 10-7 M, particles of larger than 0.1 microns appear
      much more than the readings for 10-3. Since they cannot be ions,
      they can only come from the formation of water molecules into
      clusters that were detected.<br>

      <br>
      These water-clusters prepared with the above method from very
      dilute solutions are stable over a period of days, months, and
      years. The water clusters are especially stable.<br>
      <br>
      The dilution process to make stable water clusters can be carried
      out in either small or large scale batches; a small scale batch
      can be done in liter or gallon containers whereas large scale
      batches can be done in containers for hundreds of gallons or more.<br>
      <br>
      Small scale production is shown in FIG. 8, for the production of
      stable water clusters in a gallon container. The container, tubes,
      stoppers, etc., are made of polypropylene to minimize leaching
      problem that produces contamination of the product. The stopper on
      the top of the container has three holes for three tubes. The tube
      1 allow argon to flow in, the tube 4 allows argon to flow out,
      allowing a positive argon gas pressure relative to normal
      atmosphere so that no air can flow in to contact the solution.
      This prevents the carbon dioxide contamination to the pure
      10-water, or the final production solution.<br>
      <br>
      The device can be scaled upward for mass production and can be
      automated for continual service.<br>
      <br>
      The process takes place in the following manner:<br>
      <br>
      Argon comes in from the Tube 1 and pushes all atmosphere within
      the bottle out through the Tube 4,<br>
      “10 Water” is injected from the tube 2 in the middle into the
      bottle that is devoid of atmosphere and filled with Argon;<br>
      As “10-Water” enters the bottle, a tiny amount of Substance A is
      sucked into the bottle by Venturi effect at Ventur Tube 3, thereby
      allowing the dilution of Substance A to occur in an environment
      where no carbon dioxide is present and “10 Water” can maintain its
      purity.<br>
      <br>
      Thus this production process of creation of stable water clusters
      includes adding a small amount of Material A in water, the purity
      of which is characterized by a resistivity of 18.2 Mohm and very
      small number of impurities, as measured by laser particle counter.
      The dilution process is carried out in carbon dioxide free
      atmosphere. The dilution process can be carried out in the
      presence of an inert gas, such as argon gas. The dilution process
      can be carried out in a bottle that is filled with argon gas and
      maintained at positive pressure so that no atmosphere will leak
      in. All the containers are leak and leach free vessels allowing no
      impurity/contaminants of any kind to contaminate the pure water or
      the very dilute solution where stable water clusters are created.
      The containers contain three outlet tubes on the top: one tube
      that argon flows in, one tube that argon flows out, and the third
      tube for pure water to add to the container. The third tube where
      pure water flows can suck in a small amount of dilute solute by
      Venturi effect. The dilution process is carried out without
      contact with normal air. The containers, tubes, stoppers, etc.,
      are made of polypropylene or quartz or similar materials which
      prohibit contamination. The materials A can be any organic, or
      inorganic materials artificially created or found, or isolated
      from plants, animals, and humans, such as vitamins, amino acids,
      hormones, proteins, enzymes, polypeptides, polysaccharide, DNA,
      RNA etc. The solution from dilution can be used to enhance
      combustion for fuel, to improve health to enhance biochemical
      reactions, in industrial catalytic processes of all kinds, for the
      enhancement of textiles, to enhance electroplating and similar
      processes.<br>
      <br>
      The production of stable water clusters in large scale by dilution
      of materials into very pure water was described above. It is often
      desirable to have a more concentrated solution with a much larger
      number of stable water clusters that normally obtainable through
      dilution of a single material into very pure water. In accordance
      with the invention it is proposed to enhance the production of
      stable water clusters to increase the number of clusters per unit
      volume.<br>
      <br>
      It starts with a very dilute “Solution S” of some material A. As
      an example sodium chloride is used as material A. Material A is
      diluted with very pure water to a concentration of 1.7 times
      10?&lt;7 &gt;mole prepared under strict conditions as discussed
      above. The number of stable water clusters in the Solution S can
      be measured by a laser particle counter such as a Lighthouse
      Liquid Particle Counter LS-60 and those results are shown in Table
      3.<br>

      Table 3 shows particle counts of various sizes from 0.1 micron to
      0.5 microns from a very dilute sodium chloride Solution S of
      concentration 1.1×10&lt;-7 &gt;mole prior to concentration method
      discussed below.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 shows an atomic force microscope picture of the residue of
      Solution S after evaporation of liquid residue. The shape and size
      of stable water clusters in Solution S can be explicitly seen.<br>
      <br>
      The number of stable water clusters can be increased in the very
      dilute Solution S by adding a second material that has a permanent
      electric dipole moment. Using small droplets of the second
      material designated as Material B, the material B has been diluted
      below 1.0×10&lt;2 &gt;mole; Material B is then added to Solution S
      in small droplets.<br>
      <br>
      Material B could be vitamin E or omega 3 oil, or any other organic
      or inorganic material or the mixture of many different kinds of
      materials. As a specific example, omega 3 oil is used as Material
      B.<br>
      <br>
      A very small amount of omega 3 oil is used and mixed with very
      pure water, preferably under surrounding argon gas. Since oil and
      water do not mix, additional processing is needed to mix oil and
      water. For thorough mixing ultrasound vibration is used so as
      Material B will be pulverized into a colloidal suspension. For
      maximum effect the oil molecule must be in contact with water
      molecules directly. Oil will not go into solution with water but
      rather together they form an emulsion. Then a small amount of this
      thoroughly mixed emulsion of Material B and pure water is added
      into Solution S. The final Solution S' should have a minute
      concentration of Material B in the range of 1.0×10&lt;-7 &gt;mole.<br>
      <br>
      The surface of the new organic molecule (omega 3 oil) will have
      many positively and negatively charged spots. Surrounding water
      molecules and stable water clusters will attach to these charged
      spots and these charged spots will provide growth sites for the
      stable water clusters. New stable water clusters will grow and
      existing stable water clusters created by material A will grow
      larger. The result will be a solution higher in concentration of
      stable water clusters per given volume.<br>
      <br>
      Table 4 presents the distribution of the sizes of stable water
      clusters as counted by laser particle counter for Solution S' with
      the addition of Material B using the method herein described. An
      increase of stable-water-cluster per given volume is shown:<br>

      Table 4: shows particle counts of various sized stable water
      clusters from 0.1 microns to larger than 0.5 microns from Solution
      S' after performing the enhancing discussed herein.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 shows the pictures from atomic force microscope of the
      residues obtained from dehydrated Solution S' after process of
      enhancement is complete (Tapping, Topo Frw, 1.7×3-7 diluent). The
      size and distribution of stable water molecules are explicitly
      displayed.<br>
      <br>
      Thus in this method an enhanced Solution S' is produced from an
      existing Solution S, which is known to have stable water clusters
      by adding small amount of a second Material B to Solution S,
      whereas the Solution S' will increase in the number of stable
      water clusters. The material B is liquid phase, which may be
      inorganic or organic. It can be is one of the petroleum products,
      diesel, gasoline, or its derivatives. The Material B is first
      thoroughly mixed with very pure water by vigorous shaking such as
      ultrasound shaking to form a uniform mixture, which is an
      emulsion. A small amount of the uniform mixture is added to very
      pure water under the argon gas. The very pure water comes from a
      water producing machine that produces water with very high purity
      as measured by resistivity meter to be close to 18 Mohm-cm. Each
      step of production process and not any part of the solution is
      ever exposed to carbon dioxide in the air. All the containers,
      tubes, stoppers, joints are made of materials, which do not leak
      or leach when in contact with very pure water. Examples of such
      materials are quartz and polypropylene. The enhanced Solution S'
      of stable-water-molecules can be used to be a fuel catalyst in
      combustible fuel such as gasoline, diesel, natural gas, jet fuel,
      heavy oil, and coal, to reduce coking in processing plants in oil
      refineries, power plants, manufacturing facilities that produces
      petroleum derived products, for health purposes such as
      supplements, medicines, or energized homeopathic remedies, in
      industrial processes such as the manufacture of nitrogen
      fertilizer. In industrial processes which require the use of water
      to enhance or suppress the enzymatic effect on bioactivities such
      as fermentation, to change or strengthen textiles, to improve the
      function and life of acid lead batteries.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention the
      following device can be used for industrial large-scale production
      of products containing a catalyst made from stable water clusters.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 11 shows the device that includes a feeder tank A on the
      right with diesel fuel. The diesel fuel is pumped to tank B, where
      an ultrasound vibration device is installed. Before the fuel
      reaches tank B, a small amount of concentrate catalyst CC is
      extracted from tank C by Venturi effect. The ratio R of c
      concentrate catalyst CC to diesel fuel is set to be very small,
      such as 1 part CC to 1000 part diesel. The concentrated catalyst
      CC is mixed thoroughly with diesel fuel in tank B by ultrasound
      vibration. The flow rate in and out of tank B is controlled to
      ensure a given amount of ultrasound vibration mixing time to
      achieve a thorough mixing of CC with the diesel. The mixture of CC
      plus diesel fuel flows out of tank B and reaches the main tank D.
      Usually the mixing requires more than one pass through tank B.
      Then a second round of mixing is achieved by pumping continuously
      the mixture of diesel and CC form the main tank D back through
      bank B, for further ultrasound vibration mixing, then back to main
      tank D.<br>
      <br>
      When the mixing is satisfactorily completed and the diesel fuel is
      considered to have the necessary catalyst added, it is ready to go
      to the storage tank E for shipping and distribution to users of
      diesel fuel. Similar procedure can be applied to gasoline, jet
      fuel, kerosene or other liquid petroleum products.<br>
      <br>
      While FIG. 11 shows a flow diagram for processing large quantity
      of petroleum fuel to be mixed with a liquid catalyst without
      chemical binder, FIG. 12 shows a flow diagram of the addition of
      concentrate catalyst CC from Tank C through Venturi to Tank B.<br>
      <br>
      Concentrate catalyst CC enters from tank C. Venturi meter valves
      allows CC to enter into tube carrying fuel toward tank B
      ultra-sound. Meter tube measures the volume V1 of CC to be mixed
      with diesel of volume V2. The volume of diesel V2 is controlled by
      a valve coming from the feeder tank A. The ratio R=V1/V2 is fixed.
      One way valve allows CC to go into the tube by Venturi effect to
      mix with diesel coming out from tank A into tank B. Diesel coming
      out from tank A to flow into ultrasound tank B.<br>
      <br>
      In summary the procedure for producing large quantities of
      catalyst CC for processed fuel by mixing vigorously a small amount
      of concentrate catalyst CC with diesel or like petroleum based
      fuels can be expressed as a formula:<br>
      CC+D=CD<br>
      where the ratio R is defined by the amount of CC to D by R=CC/D.
      As an example the ratio is chosen to be 1/1000 in one case.<br>
      <br>
      The method and equipment disclosed can be used generally with any
      concentration of CC. CC would contain a significant amount of
      stable water clusters to be mixed with any solution D, such as
      diesel, gasoline, oil, alcoholic products or the like or to make
      hand cream, face cream or any health product.<br>
      <br>
      To have a maximum effect of mixing and to ensure the purity of the
      product produced, the entire system from tank A to tank B, C, D
      and E would be maintained under a positive pressure of argon gas
      so as to eliminate the contamination from carbon dioxide and
      oxygen that would be present in normal room atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      Some specific examples are presented below for producing a large
      amount of dilute liquid CD which contains a lower density of
      stable water clusters from mixing concentrate CC with liquid D.<br>
      <br>
      D is diesel fuel, and CD is a fuel additive to be added to diesel
      fuel to enhance combustion and reduce pollution.<br>
      <br>
      D is gasoline, and CD is a fuel additive to be added to gasoline
      to enhance combustion and reducing pollution.<br>
      <br>
      D is any fuel, such as jet fuel, or kerosene, and CD is the fuel
      additive for jet fuel and kerosene.<br>
      <br>
      D is oil, and CD is oil with stable water clusters that can be
      used for hands, face, etc., for the enhancement of look and
      health.<br>
      <br>
      D is pure water, and CD is water with small amount of stable water
      clusters the can be used for health purpose.<br>
      D is wine and CD is wine with a small amount of stable water
      clusters that can be used as higher quality wine.<br>
      <br>
      Summarizing this embodiment it should be mentioned that the thusly
      produced large quantities of CD could be a catalyst or oil, or
      cream, produced by mixing vigorously a small amount of concentrate
      CC which contains a high density of Stable water clusters with a
      solution D which can be diesel, gasoline, oil, water or cream to
      form a dilute solution CD which could be a catalyst for diesel,
      gasoline or other petroleum fuel or cream. The mixing is done by
      ultrasound, the mixing ratio R of CC to D can be set to be a small
      amount, such as 1/1000, the ratio can be maintained by two
      automatically controlled valves, where the first valve controls
      the amount of D from feeder tank A, the second valve controls the
      amount of CC entering into the meter region, where CC is mixed
      with D by Venturi effect. The mixed and dilute liquid CD is pumped
      from the said ultrasound tank into the main tank, the mixed CD in
      the main tank is pumped to go through the ultrasound tank
      continuously for a short duration so that the mixture CD is
      thoroughly mixed and stays in the main tank. The thoroughly mixed
      liquid CD enters into a storage tank E, ready for shipment.<br>
      <br>
      The thoroughly mixed liquid CD can be used as fuel additive,
      whereas the fuel D can be diesel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel,
      etc.; as health purpose, whereas the said D is oil, and CD can be
      some emulsion or liquid form for health purpose such as for hands,
      face, etc.; as an alcoholic beverage whereas D can be any
      alcoholic beverage, such as wine, beer, etc.; the liquid D can be
      pure water, and CC is concentrate for some special stable water
      clusters C, whereas the end product CD is for health uses, such as
      drinking.<br>
      <br>
      The solid stable water clusters produced in accordance with the
      present invention have specific molecular structures.<br>
      <br>
      As explained above, it is possible to create stable water clusters
      by dilution. The dilution of sodium chloride is used as an
      example. The dilution of both organic and inorganic materials in
      ultra pure water will produce stable water clusters.<br>
      <br>
      The existence of stable water clusters is revealed by letting
      stable water clusters water or referred to as cluster water
      evaporate on a glass slide and then examining the residue left.
      This is done by light microscope and atomic force microscope. FIG.
      14 shows one of the solid stable water clusters. There are various
      shapes of stable water clusters. Some of them look like cotton
      balls. In FIG. 14 several ring-like structures can be seen, which
      can be considered to be more fundamental.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 14 the dimensions of the photo are 7.67 micron×7.67
      microns. The ring-like structure shown in the picture is
      approximately 1 micron size.<br>
      <br>
      In solid state physics, when the phenomena of phase transition is
      considered, an important principle is scaling. The interaction is
      energy, which is called the Hamiltonian in its operator formalism,
      scales. That is, the same kind of interaction occurs, no matter
      what the size of the object. FIG. 13 shows the shape of sodium
      chloride in various sizes shown in microscope with a magnification
      of 400×.<br>
      <br>
      The two left-most clusters of sodium chloride crystals can be
      noticed. The face-centered cubic structure of sodium chloride
      shows itself as a square shape in the illustrated two dimensional
      pictures. The smallest to the largest square shaped sodium
      chloride cubic structure spans a factor of approximately 100. The
      face-centered cubic structure of sodium chloride remains even down
      to nanometer size. In comparison, the scaling of the ring-like
      structure will likewise go down to nanometer size.<br>
      <br>
      There are occasions when the ring-like structure is not complete,
      but is only half complete. Then kidney-like structures are formed
      as shown in FIG. 15. In FIG. 15 picture the dimension is 1.66
      micron×1.66 microns. Kidney-like structure is approximately 600 nm
      to 700 nm.<br>
      <br>
      When the residue from evaporated cluster water is examined with
      atomic force microscope at size below one microns, some more
      precise pictures can be seen. One of such pictures is shown in
      FIG. 16. There are pentagons, with five side, hexagons with six
      sides, rectangle with four side. A group of pentagons and hexagons
      sometime form into soccer-ball-like structure. In FIG. 16 the
      picture dimension is 0.63 micron×0.63 microns. Many four, five and
      six sided ring structures can be seen. These structures range from
      approximately 30 nm to 50 nm in size. These structures combine to
      form soccer-ball-like patterns.<br>
      <br>
      The lone pair shown in FIG. 17, where water molecule is composed
      of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. These three atoms
      occupy the vertex of a tetrahedron.<br>
      <br>
      When many water molecules combine together to form a cluster, it
      is equivalent to hooking many tetrahedrons together. The lowest
      energy states for water clusters seem to point to pentagon and
      hexagon configurations, with oxygen molecules occupying the
      vertices of the pentagons, hexagons, and sometimes rectangles. By
      doing so, these pentagons and hexagons will form a
      soccer-ball-like configuration, as shown in FIG. 18.
      Mathematically they can be presented by:<br>
      5&lt;n&gt;6&lt;m &gt;<br>
      where n and m indicate the number of pentagons and hexagons that
      constitutes a soccer-ball-like configuration. For the smaller
      soccer-ball-like configuration, the vertex, where two lines meet,
      is the site of the oxygen atom. The hydrogen atoms are spread
      along the line joining the vertices. In general it may have four
      side polygons, and it may not even have a closed cage structure
      like a soccer ball. It is simply the various combination of
      pentagons, hexagons, and four side polygons. It is represented by:<br>
      5&lt;n&gt;6&lt;m&gt;4&lt;k&gt;,<br>
      where there are additional k number of four side rectangles.
      Furthermore, these are only units that can be constructed into the
      linear shape, helix shape, etc.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 18 shows balls with sixty vertices, while FIG. 19 shows a
      soccer ball with 20 hexagons white patches and 12 pentagons black
      patches, which can be denoted as 5&lt;12 &gt;6&lt;20&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      The most elementary ring structures are represented by the
      five-sided pentagon, six-sided hexagon, and four-sided rectangle,
      as shown in FIG. 20. The smallest molecular ring structures are
      composed of individual oxygen atoms occupying the vertices of
      these polygons and individual hydrogen atoms spreading along the
      lines joining these vertices.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 20 shows the symbolic ring structures of stable water
      clusters: from left to right; the pentagon; the hexagon; and the
      rectangle.<br>
      <br>
      Thus the stable water clusters of the present invention are stable
      under normal room temperature and atmospheric pressure, with
      ring-structures ranging from microns, hundreds of nanometers, tens
      of nanometers. These ring-structures could be five-sided
      pentagons, six-sided hexagons four-sided rectangles. The smallest
      of these ring structures: five-sided pentagons, six-sided hexagons
      and four-sided rectangles are made up of individual oxygen and
      hydrogen atoms, the oxygen atom being at the vertex and the
      hydrogens atoms spreading along the lines joining the vertices.
      These pentagons, hexagons or rectangles may join together to form
      larger structures, which are part of stable water clusters. The
      larger structures may be soccer-ball-like with n side being
      pentagons, m side being hexagons, and k side being rectangles,
      denoted by the formula: 5&lt;n&gt;6&lt;m&gt;4&lt;k&gt;, where n,
      k, m can be 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . to a very large integers. The larger
      structures, which may or may not include soccer-ball-like
      structures, may join together to form much larger stable water
      clusters, which are of linear shape, ring shape, kidney shape, or
      helix shape.<br>
      <br>
      It is well known that the fundamental structure of genetic
      material, DNA, is a double-helix. The structure of DNA is
      extremely complicated due to the extent of its evolutionary
      development, building slowly for eons as a coded record of
      successful life decisions. There was a beginning point on this
      long evolutionary chain, a starting point prior to the appearance
      of DNA as found in more evolutionary chain, a starting point prior
      to the appearance of DNA as found in more advanced biological life
      forms and the beginning point would have been present in primitive
      single-cell organisms. To date, no one has isolated the mechanism
      for its formation. Although it is common knowledge that life comes
      from water and without water there is no life, no one has asserted
      that there is a direct link between water and the complex form
      such as DNA.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention the stable water clusters
      can have a helix structure, in particular, two helix twins
      together forming a double-helix similar to the DNA structure.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 21 shows the picture of a DNA with a double-helix structure.
      FIGS. 22 and 23 show two atomic force microscope pictures of the
      stable water clusters in accordance with the present invention in
      a double-helix structure.<br>
      <br>
      If one compares FIG. 21 and FIGS. 22-23, there are differences and
      similarities. The difference is that the DNA double-helix is made
      up of four bases G, A, T, C whereas the stable water clusters
      double-helix is made from water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      The similarity is that they are both double-helixes, a scaled
      image of each other. The width of the stable water clusters
      double-helix is approximately 2 microns, whereas the width of the
      DNA double-helix is approximately 2 nanometers, a factor of
      one-thousand-times smaller. By scaling DNA molecules
      one-thousand-times they look similar to the double-helix stable
      water clusters.<br>
      <br>
      It is expected that the double-helix structure of stable water
      clusters can occur in nanometer, micron and even larger sizes.<br>
      <br>
      The principle of scaling symmetry is shown. The Hamiltonian (a
      mathematical function, equal for many such systems to the sum of
      the kinetic and potential energies) of a crystal remains the same,
      independent of its scale. That means, no matter whether the scale
      is nanometer, micrometer or millimeter the Hamiltonian (energy)
      remains the same. Since the shape of the crystal is determined by
      the lowest energy state, then the shape of the crystal is the same
      independent of the scale (in physical terms, no matter the size of
      the crystal, nanometer, micrometer, or millimeter, the crystal
      retains the same shape). When one examines a salt (NaCl) crystal
      it has a cubic shape in millimeters (this can be seen using a
      simple magnifying glass). When observe a NaCl crystal is observed
      with an atomic force microscope, it is also a cubic structure even
      if in micron size. The same size of NaCl also persists to
      nanometer size, which is called face-centered cube.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it is expected that the double-helix shape of stable
      water clusters in accordance with the present invention to remain
      regardless of micron or nanometer size.<br>
      <br>

      Thus stable water clusters can have helix structures, which can
      form in a double-helix shape. The double-helix structure can be
      precursor in the development of life before a DNA molecule was
      formed. The helix structure has a width of several microns size or
      several nanometers.<br>
      <br>
      It will be understood that each of the elements described above,

      A descalant means, comprising LE structured liquid crystals which
      when placed close to, or into a liquid stream, cause the formation
      of microscopic liquid crystalline structures, which act as
      nucleation sites for the formation of crystal structures of
      normally liquid-soluble or insoluble salts, and other suspended
      particles, these crystalline structures being chemically stable
      and causing a large reduction in the scaling potential of the
      liquid, thereby avoiding scale buildup on metal or other
      containment surfaces and also initiating descaling of surfaces
      already containing scale buildup. Furthermore, said means will
      reduce the amount of detergents, soaps, surfactants and polymers
      required in washing and other forms of water use.<br>

      <b>1. Background--Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to a device for reduction of scaling or
      scale buildup in liquids, water and oil transport systems and
      specifically, to a device which does not add chemicals, but
      instead utilizes micron-sized or smaller crystalline structures
      within the transported liquid, water or oil. The scaling
      components present, such as salts of calcium and magnesium in
      water and paraffins in the case of oil, are attracted to the
      crystalline structures in the liquid which serve as nucleation
      points, instead of depositing on the inner surfaces of pipes,
      vessels and other equipment. Thus the potential for scaling
      deposits is greatly reduced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Background--Description of Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The current state of the art used to reduce scale buildup in pipes
      and other liquid conveyance systems makes use of selected
      chemicals which are added to and mixed into the liquid in metered,
      small amounts. These chemicals inhibit the formation of scale or
      other deposits on the insides of the conveyance system. The main
      disadvantage of the use of chemicals is their costs as well as the
      need to meter the quantity being introduced and to vary that
      amount as the scaling material quantities vary in the stream.<br>
      <br>
      These chemicals may, in turn cause problems with later chemical
      processes or have to be removed or neutralized.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Accordingly, besides the objects and advantages of the descaling
      device described in my above patent, several objects and
      advantages of the present invention are:<br>
      (a) To provide a non-chemical means of reducing the tendency of
      hard water or other liquid to cause scale buildup on pipes and
      other equipment.<br>
      (b) To provide a device which can be attached to the outside
      surface of an existing water or oil transport system to create
      structures in the water or oil system, which bind up and
      essentially neutralize hardness ions such as calcium and magnesium
      in the case of water and paraffins and waxes in the case of oil.<br>
      (c) To provide an environmentally non-polluting means for removing
      scale or buildup, from water or oil transport equipment without
      the use of chemicals.<br>
      (d) To provide a low-cost, safe, easily installed scale inhibiting
      and descaling means.<br>
      (e) To provide a scale inhibiting and descaling means that does
      not have to come in contact with the water being treated, thereby
      allowing the means to be installed on the outside of pipes, and
      tanks, without cutting into the existing pipeline system.<br>
      (f) To provide a scale inhibiting and descaling means for removing
      scale in any liquid transport system, such as mineral deposits in
      the case of water and paraffin and waxes in the case of oil.<br>

      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Note: Definitions for various specialized terms are included here
      for clarification.<br>
      <br>
      IE stands for ice formed under a strong electric field.<br>
      <br>
      IE -structured water is one specific case of the general class of
      LE -structured liquids that is formed from water molecules. This
      is water that contains IE crystals, sometimes called IE
      structures. These structures are obtained by homeopathic methods
      or ways and means as described in my previous patent applications
      as listed on page 2. The theoretical idea is that water molecules
      from an electric dipole with an electric dipole moment of 2.9
      Debye. Under suitable conditions these water molecules will
      cluster to form crystal-like structures in the nanometer to micron
      size range. These clusters would also be expected to have a strong
      electric dipole moment.<br>
      <br>
      LE -structured liquid is a general liquid where IE structure is
      one special case. The liquid can be water, alcohol, oil or any
      other di-electric liquid. Inside this liquid there are structures
      created by the electric dipole nature of the molecules. This also
      includes the hybrid case of alcohol/water solutions containing IE
      crystals, which are made up of water molecules. LE -structure
      specifically means that the structure is induced in the liquid by
      strong electric fields which can also come from the electric field
      of an ion or from the dipole moment of molecules. In this case L
      stands for liquid.<br>
      <br>
      SE -structured solid is broadly defined as the structured solids
      that are formed under a strong electric field and also those that
      are prepared by the methods defined in the earlier inventions in
      my patent application Ser. Nos. 08/182,410 and 08/217,042 listed
      above on page 2. LE -crystal is actually a specific case of an SE
      solid, where the S stands for solid.<br>
      <br>
      Scaling is the excessive deposition and buildup of water-soluble
      and insoluble materials on the inner surface of pipes, ducts,
      tanks and other means of water conveyance, heat transfer and
      storage. For other liquids such as oil, the scaling may be
      composed of paraffin and other solids.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>FIG. 1 is a drip-feed device for feeding IE water into hard
      water or other liquid being treated. The device consists of a tank
      (10) containing a structured liquid (12) with a feed tube (20) and
      a control valve (14). The device is attached to the pipe (16)
      containing the liquid to be treated (18).<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2A shows a pipe mounted clamp-on device (25), made of SE
      solids (26) inside a container (24). The device induces IE
      structures in the liquid (28) passing through the pipe (22).<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2B shows a series of clamp-on devices (32), (34) and (36)
      connected to a pipe (30) containing the liquid (38) to be
      structured.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows a structured SE solid (48) made into a pipe section
      (46) with flanges or other means of attachment (49) attached to
      pipes (40) and (42) which contain the liquid to be structured
      (44).<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3A shows SE solids (121) placed in a tank (120) and the
      liquid to be structured (126) enters through pipe (122) and mixes
      by close contact with the SE solids (121) and becomes structured,
      then passes out through the exit pipe (124).<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3B shows a device where the SE solids (135) are contained in
      a tube (132) and the liquid (131) enters through pipe (130) and
      gets into close contact with the solids (135) then exits through
      pipe (133) as structured liquid (134).<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 shows a static mixer device used to enhance turbulence in
      the liquid being structured. The liquid (58) enters through pipe
      (50) passes through static mixer (60) which increases the
      turbulence in the liquid (58) forcing it into close contact with
      the tube surface (57). The static mixer (60) is contained within
      tube (54) which contains structured solid SE (56). The high
      turbulence in the liquid (58) enhances the structuring effect of
      the SE solid (56) by bringing more of the liquid into close
      contact with the tube ((54). The structured liquid (51) then exits
      through pipe (52).<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 shows a floating device (62) which induces IE structures in
      the liquid being treated. The device consists of a porous surface
      (64) allowing the liquid (67) to come in contact with the SE
      solids (66), thus inducing structures in the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 shows a paint-on device which can be applied to the surface
      of the pipe carrying the liquid being structured. The pipe (68)
      containing the liquid (70) is coated on the outside with a paint
      (69) containing structured solid (72). The liquid passing through
      the pipe (68) becomes structured. The length of the paint layer
      can be of any length as required to create the desired
      structuring.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 shows the relative size of IE structures and calcium
      carbonate crystals. The IE structures (74) have a positive (82)
      and negative (80) charge. These charges induce corresponding
      charges (76) and (78) in the calcium carbonate crystal (83). The
      size of the IE structure (74) is about 20 nanometers (nm), while
      the size of a calcium carbonate crystal (83) is about 20 microns.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 shows the formation of normal hard water crystals on a
      glass slide. There are two basic forms of crystal formed, the
      first is needle shaped crystals (88) and (94) and the second is
      cube shaped crystals (90) and (92). There is no alignment of the
      crystals as they are placed randomly over the surface of the
      slide.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 shows the formation of `starbursts` (100) and (106)
      consisting of calcium carbonate crystals which grow around the IE
      structures induced in the water by one form of the present
      invention. In the presence of the tiny IE structures, much larger
      crystals of hard water compounds such as calcium carbonate grow
      around the smaller IE crystals to form needle shaped (103) and
      cubic shaped (104) calcium carbonate/IE crystals. These calcium
      carbonate/IE crystals carry charge. Starbursts (100) and (106) are
      then formed due to the interaction of these calcium carbonate/IE
      crystals with other crystals in the liquid. Alignment occurs
      amongst these crystals and starbursts because of their charge and
      orderly crystal pattern lines (108) are created.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 shows one typical starburst crystal (114) that forms in
      hard water on a glass slide. The calcium carbonate needle IE
      crystals (110) form a star shape around the smaller calcium
      carbonate IE crystal (112) which is at the center of the
      starburst.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is in the form of metered structured liquids
      or devices as shown in FIGS. 1 through 6, comprising solids or
      liquids that contain the electric field of IE structures and which
      can create IE structures in water by direct injection of the
      structured water or liquid by placing the device at some distance
      from the water or liquid to be structured. To understand how this
      occurs the following discussion on the physics of the process is
      presented.<br>
      <br>
      Structured water is water which is IE -structured and has a strong
      electric dipole moment. These electric dipole moment structures
      can induce electric dipole moments in neutral molecules that move
      near them. The electric attractive force around the IE structures
      in the liquid draw neutral molecules toward the surface of the IE
      structures. The attraction is greater if the electric dipole
      moment of the IE structure is larger. The results of this
      attraction force is the creation of crystalline water structures
      which are submicron in size.<br>
      <br>
      <b>NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The problem of scaling is well known in industry and has its
      origin in the dissolved solids that are commonly found in water.
      Water soluble minerals such as calcium, magnesium, potassium and
      others are leached out into ground water. These dissolved minerals
      then find their way into water used in many different kinds of
      domestic, industrial and commercial processes. Under certain
      conditions these minerals will come out of solution and deposit on
      surfaces to form a hard scale. The chemistry of scaling is well
      known and one simple chemical reaction involving calcium, which is
      the dominant one in scaling, is described as follows.<br>
      <br>
      When water percolates through the ground, it picks up carbon
      dioxide and calcium carbonate according to the equation:<br>
      <br>
      CaCO3 +CO2 +H2 O.fwdarw.Ca(HCO3)2<br>
      <br>
      to form calcium bicarbonate which is soluble in water. This water
      is considered to be hard water which is delivered in pipes for use
      in home or industry. When this water is used with heating, such as
      in hot water service at home, or cooling towers or industrial
      boilers, chemical reactions will occur to produce solid calcium
      carbonate that is not soluble in water according to the following
      equation:<br>
      <br>
      Ca(HCO3)2 .fwdarw.CaCO3 .dwnarw.+CO2 +H2 O<br>
      <br>
      The calcium carbonate precipitates out of the water and builds up
      on heated surfaces as scale.<br>
      <br>
      This scale reduces heat exchanger efficiency as well as reduces
      the flow rate through the pipe. Normally scaling is prevented
      through the use of chemicals. Chemicals are not desirable for
      environmental reasons and also some time these chemicals have
      undesirable side effects such as corrosion and erosion.<br>
      <br>
      The invention as described in FIGS. 1 through 10 are means for
      injecting in or producing IE crystal structures in the liquid
      being treated. Once the IE crystals are injected or formed they
      act as a nucleus for supersaturated salts to crystallize. This has
      many applications in water treatment systems. For instance, it is
      well known that when water containing CaCO3, a common
      water-soluble salt, is heated, the solubility of the CaCO3 drops,
      thus pushing the solution towards saturation. In the case of
      boiler and heat exchanger systems, once the saturation point of
      the carbonate is reached, usually on the surface of the heat
      exchanger tubes, scale buildup occurs, resulting in a reduction of
      the heat exchanger efficiency and the need for periodic shutdown
      and boiler tube descaling to be done.<br>
      <br>
      There are various solutions to this problem, such as the
      purification of the boiler feedwater to very high standards. This
      can be expensive and hard to maintain, requiring specialized
      equipment and continuous water quality monitoring and metering and
      mixing of descalant chemicals into the water stream to inhibit
      scale formation.<br>
      <br>
      With the formation of IE crystals in the water, their high
      electric dipole act as nucleation points for mineral salt crystal
      formation. The calcium carbonate will form crystals around the IE
      crystals which will be in suspension in the water. In standard
      water systems, the nucleation point will be on the surface of the
      pipe or heated container for the calcium carbonate to cluster
      around. By placing a device such as is shown in FIGS. 1 through 6,
      in the flow system, scaling is greatly reduced.<br>
      <br>
      The scale-forming salts are not removed but they are physically
      bound up within the water volume and are made inactive. Analysis
      of the water sample will show that the salts are still present,
      however they no longer contribute to the normal scaling of the
      water. Thus the solid calcium carbonate will flow with the water
      rather than stick to the metal surfaces of the pipe, hence no
      scale is formed. The invention as shown in devices illustrated in
      FIGS. 1 through 6 offer an inexpensive solution to a world-wide
      problem. By the application of a device locally on the pipe or
      duct carrying the water to be treated, scale inhibition results.<br>
      <br>
      The same means as illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 6, would descale
      surfaces which are already scaled in the following manner. The IE
      crystals will attract calcium carbonate in water to form crystals
      around it so the water will contain almost no calcium carbonate,
      however calcium carbonate does dissolve to a small amount in water
      hence the scale on the metal surfaces will start dissolving into
      the water and become less and less on the metal surface whereas
      more and more will form around the IE crystals.<br>
      <br>
      There are two basic ways to introduce IE crystals in the pipe. The
      first is by actual dripping in a concentrated solution of IE
      crystals as shown in FIG. 1 and the second is by the formation of
      IE crystals within the water by an external means as shown by
      FIGS. 2 through 6.<br>
      <br>
      For the first case, the method is covered in patent application
      Ser. Nos. 08/182,410 and 08/217,042 for the formation of IE
      crystals within water and other liquids. The concentrated IE
      structured water is only a very small fraction of the total amount
      of water. A typical example is 1 part per million (ppm). In
      structured water the majority of IE crystals are in the order of
      10 nm in size, whereas from experiment we know that the calcium
      carbonate crystals are in the order of 10 microns in size. If one
      calcium carbonate crystal grows on one IE crystal, the volume
      ratio is 1000@3 or 10@9. Theoretically only one billionth of the
      amount of calcium carbonate is needed of IE crystals in volume. So
      for conservative solutions, 1 to 1 million is chosen as the ratio
      of IE crystals to calcium carbonate crystals in hard water, to do
      the job.<br>
      <br>
      The second method uses the fact that structures can be induced in
      a liquid some distance away from the structure source. This is
      because the electromagnetic field emitted by the oscillation of
      the electric dipole moment of the IE or SE crystals, which comes
      from thermal energy, is transmitted to the liquid. The ions in the
      liquid are creating and destroying IE crystal unit cells around
      them. These unit cells will act like antennae and receive the
      electromagnetic field from the previously mentioned IE or SE
      crystals. Then they are shaken loose from the ions to form
      independent IE crystals which are stable. Thus new IE crystals can
      be induced into a liquid which comes into proximity of other IE or
      SE crystals. This effect is enhanced by forcing turbulence into
      the liquid being treated as more of the liquid is brought into
      close contact as shown by the device in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      There are a number of ways in which the invention may be used to
      prevent scaling. As an SE crystal it can be made in the form of
      finely ground quartz and mixed into paint and painted onto the
      surface of a pipe or channel along which the water to be treated
      flows, as shown in FIG. 6. The solid quartz form can also be
      placed inside a tube and the tube wrapped around the pipe or
      channel containing water to be treated, or the quartz can be fused
      into a solid form and clamped around the pipe or channel as shown
      in FIGS. 2A and 2B.<br>
      <br>
      In the LE liquid form, it can be metered into the pipe or channel
      as shown in FIG. 1, and mixed directly with the water to be
      treated. Or it can be placed inside the pipe in a container,
      allowing the water to be treated to flow around the outside of the
      container, or the container can be made integral with the pipe and
      form a pipe section as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, through which the
      water flows. These are some and by no means all the possible ways
      that the structured solid or liquid can be placed in proximity
      with the water to be treated in order to create the desired effect
      on the water ion constituents.<br>
      <br>
      Applications for the invention are many and not limited to the
      following examples; washing machines and dishwaters in homes to
      replace or reduce the amount of soaps and detergents, in oil
      production to inhibit the scale buildup that occurs from produced
      water, in batteries to increase life by reducing the scale buildup
      on electrodes, in agriculture for the inhibition of scale buildup
      in watering systems including the pipes and nozzles, in washing
      systems such as a car wash for the inhibition of unsightly scale
      deposit on the car's paintwork, upstream of a water treatment
      clarifier for the faster removal of precipitates in the settling
      section, also upstream of a clarifier, where the ions which
      normally would pass through the clarifier, are precipitated out,
      in cooling towers for reduction of scale, in boilers for the
      reduction of scale in boiler tubes and heat exchanger tubes, and
      in distillers for the reduction of scale buildup.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSION, DISCUSSION AND RAMIFICATIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Accordingly, the reader will see that LE structures can be added
      to liquids to prevent scale from building up on the surface of
      components used in a wide variety of systems, both industrial and
      commercial. In addition, when a LE or SE structured liquid or
      solid is placed in proximity with a sample of the liquid, either
      in a container or flowing along a pipe, LE structures are induced
      in the liquid which in turn, will encourage scale-forming
      materials to collect around the LE structure, thus tying it up,
      reducing the scaling potential by blocking the material from
      depositing onto surfaces. The use of these LE, IE and SE
      structures replaces the need for scale inhibiting chemicals and
      offers a cheaper and environmentally acceptable alternative to
      chemical addition. It further allows the use of water contaminant
      levels that normally would not be acceptable. Furthermore, the
      flexibility of the technology of producing structures allows the
      designing of a wide variety of devices or means to create
      structures in water and other liquids, which will meet the
      specific requirements of a particular application.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Description of Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The publications and other reference materials referred to herein
      to describe the background of the invention and to provide
      additional detail regarding its practice are hereby incorporated
      by reference. Because of various Federal and State regulatory
      requirements, there is a growing need to control or reduce engine
      exhaust emissions because of their impact on health and
      environment. Combustion engine emissions have been shown to be
      major contributors to air pollution in urban areas. Vehicle
      emissions are classified as regulated and unregulated pollutants.
      Regulated pollutants are carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides
      (NOx), and unburned fuel or partly oxidized hydrocarbons (HC). The
      levels of emissions of these pollutants are specified by law.
      Unregulated pollutants include carbon deposits, polycyclic
      aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and carbon dioxide. Carbon deposits
      increase engine wear and tear, while some of the PAH isomers are
      known to be carcinogenic and mutagenic (Westerholm, R.N. (1988)
      Environ. Sci. Technol., 22:925).<br>
      <br>
      In a study conducted by South Coast Air Quality Management
      District (SCAQMD), mobile source emissions were shown to
      contribute about 98% of CO, 84% of NOx, and 62% of volatile
      organic compounds in the urban atmosphere (South Coast Air<br>
      Quality Management District, "Draft Air Quality Management Plan
      Revision," Diamond Bar,<br>
      California (1994)).<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the possible carcinogenic role of engine exhaust
      emissions, acute health effects from exposure to exhaust emissions
      have been well established. The possible connection between cancer
      and exposure to diesel engine exhaust has been investigated in
      occupationally exposed people (Screepers, P.T.J. et al., (1992)
      Int. Arch.<br>
      <br>
      Occup. Environ. Health 64:163). Based on animal studies, it has
      been postulated that the main culprits in cancer formation in
      humans are the PAHs, and their substituted derivatives
      (methyl-PAHs, nitro-PAHs, oxygenated nitro-PAHs, and oxy-PAHs),
      and the particulate matter, i.e. carbon deposits from the exhaust
      on which the PAHs are adsorbed (Screepers,<br>
      P.T.J. et al., (1992) Int. Arch. Occup. Environ. Health 64:163;
      Sjogren, M. Et al. (1996)<br>
      Chem. Res. Toxicol. 9:197; Crebelli, R. et al. (1995) Mutation
      Research 346:167).<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, there is a need for an effective, non-hydrocarbon,
      non-toxic and environmentally friendly fuel additive to reduce the
      amount of carbon deposited in internal combustion engines.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention achieves the above-stated needs by providing
      a method for reducing carbon deposited in a combustion engine from
      the burning of hydrocarbon fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The method comprises the steps of forming a fuel-water-based
      additive mixture, and introducing the fuel-water additive mixture
      to the engine during engine operation such that carbon deposited
      on the engine from combustion of the fuel-water additive mixture
      is less than carbon deposited from the combustion of the fuel
      without the additive. The water-based additive is a structured
      liquid comprising 1E crystal structured liquid.<br>
      <br>
      The invention, in another aspect, provides a fuel-water additive
      mixture which comprises a fuel and a water-based additive.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, objects of the method of the invention and of the
      fuel-water additive mixture of the invention involve reduction of
      carbon buildup in an engine which allows use of lower octane fuel.
      Another object of the invention is the avoidance of problems
      associated with pre-ignition caused by carbon buildup inside the
      cylinders. Another object of the invention is the improvement in
      performance of an engine by the reduction in carbon erosion of
      valve seats and other control surfaces. Another object of the
      invention is the reduction in emissions caused by such carbon
      erosion which allows incomplete combustion products to escape into
      the exhaust thus raising emissions. Another object of the
      invention is the maintenance of combustion efficiency for a longer
      period of the life of the engine thus saving fuel and reducing
      maintenance costs.<br>
      <br>
      These and many other features and attendant advantages of the
      present invention will become better understood by reference to
      the following detailed description of the invention when taken in
      conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE
        INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b>The present invention provides a method for reducing carbon
      deposited in a combustion engine from the burning of hydrocarbon
      fuel. The method comprises the steps of forming a fuel-water based
      additive mixture by adding a sufficient amount of a water-based
      additive to a fuel to form the fuel-water based additive mixture.
      The fuel-water based additive mixture is introduced to the engine
      during engine operation such that carbon deposited on the engine
      from combustion of the fuel-water based additive mixture is less
      than carbon deposited from the combustion of the fuel without the
      additive.<br>
      <br>
      The invention, in another aspect, provides a fuel-water based
      additive mixture which comprises a fuel and the water based
      additive.<br>
      <br>
      As set forth in the detailed example below, which is offered by
      way of illustration and is not intended to limit the invention in
      any manner, the method and mixture of the invention reduced carbon
      buildup in an engine. As a result, the invention also provides
      methods for achieving use of lower octane fuel, avoidance of
      problems associated with pre-ignition caused by carbon buildup
      inside the cylinders, reduction in fuel costs of an engine by
      allowing use of lower octane fuel, improvement in performance of
      an engine by the reduction in carbon erosion of valve seats and
      other control surfaces, and reduction in emissions caused by such
      carbon erosion which allows incomplete combustion products to
      escape into the exhaust thus raising emissions, and maintenance of
      higher combustion efficiency for a longer period of the life of
      the engine thus saving fuel and reducing maintenance costs. These
      other methods provided by the invention are achieved by the steps
      of forming a fuel-water additive mixture, and introducing said
      mixture to said engine during said engine operation such that
      carbon deposited on the engine from combustion of said mixture is
      less than carbon deposited from the combustion of the fuel in the
      absence of the additive.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Water-Based Additive</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the present invention, the water-based additive comprises a
      small amount of crystalline structured water with crystals,
      referred to herein as 1E crystals, in the micron or submicron size
      range. Growth and formation of these 1F crystalline water
      structures and preparation of the water-based additive are
      described below. Pending U.S. Patent<br>
      Applications 08/558,330 and 08/799,645, which are incorporated by
      reference, also disclose 1B crystalline water structures,
      solutions thereof, methods for making the 1F crystals, and methods
      for making concentrated solutions of the 1E water crystals. The
      type of microscopic crystalline structure, referred to therein is
      also referred to herein as IE crystal structured water.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the water-based additive of the present invention is
      an IE crystal based additive.<br>
      <br>
      1E crystal structured water is a structured liquid in which the k
      crystal structures are induced in the liquid by strong electric
      fields from the electric field of an ion or from the dipole moment
      of molecules. While structured liquids can be formed from a
      variety of polar solvents, IE-structured water is a specific case
      of the general class of structured liquids that is formed from
      water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      By way of explanation, not limitation, the formation of k
      structured water is illustrated as follows: When salt (e.g. NaCl)
      is dissolved in water, the sodium and the chlorine become ions in
      the water because of the strong dipole moment of water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Very dilute solutions are considered in which positively or
      negatively charged ions attract water molecules which have
      electric dipole moments. However, under these very dilute
      conditions, one finds that the water molecules surrounding an ion
      turn into a form of ice, not the ordinary ice where the unit cell
      has translational invariance, but one in which the crystalline
      structure of water surrounding the ion has a special symmetry due
      to the spherical nature of the coulombic force between the ion and
      the water molecule. The spherical symmetric icy structure
      surrounding ions is called 1E structure indicating it is an icy
      structure formed under the effect of an electric field. The 1E
      structures were observed and recorded under electron microscopy,
      as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application 08/799,645, and as
      disclosed in Lo, Shui-Yin (1996) "Anomalous State of Ice," Modern
      Physics Letters B, 10:909-919; and (1996) "Physical Properties of
      Water with 1E Structures," Modern Physics<br>
      Letters B, 10:921-930.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Preparation of the Water-based additive</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Generating more 1E structures and preparation of the water-based
      additive of the present invention, are described in U.S. Patent
      Applications 08/799,645 and 08/558,330, and involves forming
      concentrated crystal solutions of 1E structures. The method
      involves forming a first structured liquid comprising the 1E
      structures and/or fragments of IE structures.<br>
      <br>
      This structured liquid comprises a liquid having a dielectric
      constant greater than 1 and a material having an uneven
      distribution in charge on the surface of the material. An example
      of such material is NaCl. The first structured liquid is
      sufficiently diluted by repetitive dilution to form a second
      structured liquid. From the second structured liquid, the 1E
      structures are concentrated to form a concentrated crystal
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      Methods for concentrating 1E solutions are disclosed in a patent
      application, incorporated herein, which was filed in the United
      States Patent and Trademark Office by the inventor of the present
      invention on July 10, 1997 but for which applicant has not yet
      received notice of a serial number assigned by the USPTO. The
      disclosed methods include reverse osmosis, doping a solution with
      beads that release an k nucleating material, gas chromatography,
      fractional distillation, use of an electrical wire dipole, and
      dynamic freezing.<br>
      <br>
      For example, a concentrated 1E solution has been achieved using a
      reverse osmosis membrane. The exact size and type of filter
      depended on the dipole liquid selected to start with in creating
      the crystal structure solution. As a result, the reverse osmosis
      membrane pore size selection and concentration of the structured
      liquid is achieved according to the physical size of the crystal
      structures involved. To be specific, a quantity of a dilute or
      weak IE crystal structure solution is passed through a reverse
      osmosis unit which contains a membrane with a pore size of about
      1.8 nanometers. This size filter is small enough and intended to
      allow only the passage of single molecules of water at one time
      through the pore.<br>
      <br>
      The reverse osmosis unit is typical of those commercially
      available in various sizes and flow capacities and consists of an
      outside housing, a membrane and sealed end caps with holes for
      tubing to be connected. A carbonator type vane pump with an
      electric motor is attached by tubing to the reverse osmosis unit
      inlet side and when the motor is turned on, the pump maintains a
      pressure on the membrane by means of the tubing, kept in the range
      of 100-200 psi by adjusting a valve on the outlet side of the
      reverse osmosis unit. A key strategy for varying the concentration
      of the very dilute 1B crystal solution is the use of the reverse
      osmosis machine in reverse from its intended method by disposing
      of the output water and recycling the water that will not pass
      through the filter pore size selected. It has been determined that
      the selection of pore size will be dependent on the size of the
      molecule of the liquid utilized. For water, the membrane pore size
      selected was just slightly smaller than the size ofthe water
      molecule, about 1.8 nanometers, but it can vary from 1.0
      nanometers to 3.0 nanometers or more depending on the
      liquid/material system selected. Figure 6 illustrates a reverse
      osmosis system 10 for concentrating crystal structured water. The
      weak solution 102 is added to tank 100 then said weak solution is
      drawn up through pipe 108 by means of pump 118 then pressurized
      into tube 112 which goes through pressure gage 116 and on through
      tube 114 into the entry side ofthe reverse osmosis unit 120. The
      weak solution then flows through the membrane assembly 122 wherein
      the single water molecules are driven through said membrane 122 by
      the pressure created by pump 118 acting against valve 126 and exit
      through port 128 and are collected through tube 130 into tank 104
      as a weaker solution 106.<br>
      <br>
      The crystal structure water, being composed of groups of water
      molecules, does not go through the membrane 122 and so it flows
      out of the reverse osmosis unit 120 through port 124. The now more
      concentrated crystal structure water then flows through adjustable
      valve 126 which is adjusted to create the membrane back pressure
      as shown at the valve 116. The crystal structure water then
      returns through tube 110 to the original tank 100 where it mixes
      with the weak solution 102 remaining in tank 100. By constant
      recirculation around the system described above, the single water
      molecules are continuously removed from the weak solution and are
      stored in tank 104 causing the mixture in tank 100 to become a
      stronger concentration of crystal structure water solution. As a
      result, one can stop the procedure as the desired concentration
      level desired.<br>
      <br>
      The water-based additive of the invention used in the example
      disclosed herein was prepared by a doping method. In this method,
      water was used as a dipole liquid.<br>
      <br>
      0.05 moles of platinum chloride was mixed with 100 ml of pure 18
      Meg source water, which is a highly pure water. Removal of
      impurities from the dipole liquid was extremely important. The
      resulting mixture was called DO. DO was then serially diluted to
      produce progressively more dilute solutions which were designated,
      respectively, D1 through D9. For example, D1 was produced by
      mixing 10 ml of DO with 90 ml of pure 18 Meg source water.<br>
      <br>
      Then D2, D3, D4 and so on up to D9 were produced in the same
      manner as D1, that is by adding 10 ml of each dilution to 90 ml of
      18 Meg pure source water. Equal volumes of D9 solution and PVC
      beads (i.e. 50% v/v) were mixed. The PVC beads were 65 durometer,
      food grade PVC pellets. The D9-PVC solution was allowed to stand
      for about two hours, at which time the UV absorbance (wavelength
      195 nm) of the solution was, in the various solutions prepared by
      this method, from about 0.5 to about 2.0. In order to concentrate
      the 1B structures, this solution was then processed through a
      reverse osmosis filter and the volume reduced to 1/10th to 1/40th
      of the original volume. This reduced volume had a UV absorbance at
      195 nm of about 1.5 to about 3.0 in the various reduced volume
      solutions prepared by this method. By examination of electron
      micrographs of 1E solutions prepared for electron microscopy, it
      was estimated that the percent by weight of k structures in this
      dipole liquid (i.e. water) was from about 2% to about 10% ofthe
      weight of the water. This 1E structured liquid is considered the
      water-based additive of the invention. As used herein, a percent k
      solution means (100)weight of k structures/[weight of H2O + weight
      of k structures] in a given volume.<br>
      <br>
      As used in the example below, the water based additive had a UV
      absorbance at 195 nm of 2.5. The water-based additive was mixed
      with 95% 2-propanol in a ratio of one part water-based additive to
      20 parts 2-propanol, a ratio of 1:20. The water-based
      additiveisopropanol mixture was mixed with the fuel in a ratio of
      two parts of water-based additiveisopropanol mixture to 98 parts
      fuel, such that the water based additive (IE structured liquid)
      was 0.1% or 1000ppm in the fuel, forming a fuel-water based
      additive mixture.<br>
      <br>
      For use in the present invention, the concentration of 1E
      structures in the waterbased additive (i.e. the percentage 1E
      solution) can vary from about 0.2 % to about 20 %. A preferred
      range of concentrations is from about 0.5% to about 10%.<br>
      <br>
      As set forth in the Example below, the water based additive of the
      invention was first mixed in a 1:20 ratio with 95% 2-propanol. The
      water based additive-isopropanol mix was added to the fuel to form
      a 0.1% (v/v) fuel-water additive mixture, i.e 1000 ppm..<br>
      <br>
      At the 0.1% (v/v) loading, the fuel-water additive mixture reduced
      carbon deposited when the mixture was introduced to the engine and
      underwent combustion. The loading levels of water-based additive
      to fuel that find use in the invention range from about 0.02%
      (v/v) to about 5.0% (v/v), a preferred range being from about
      0.03% (v/v) to about 3.0% (v/v).<br>
      <br>
      The hydrocarbon fuel which comprised the fuel-water based additive
      of the invention was 87 RON (research octane number) Chevron
      regular gasoline that was commercially available. The hydrocarbon
      fuels which finds utility in the invention include, but are not
      restricted to, the group consisting of gasoline, diesel fuel,
      methane, propane, heating oils, bunker oils, naptha, and methanol,
      which hydrocarbon fuels are used in internal combustion engines,
      including spark-ignited engines, diesel engines, gas turbines, and
      in boilers and heaters.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Two sets of studies were performed to determine the effects of the
      1E fuel additive on carbon deposition and on engine out emissions.
      In both studies, the following conditions were used. Referring to
      Figure 1, studies were done using a single cylinder sparkignited
      Mark 111 Transparent Combustion Engine (Megatech Corp., Billerica,
      MA) without an exhaust emission control catalyst. Engine
      specifications are given in Table 1.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      The dynamometer was used to start and load the engine. It was also
      possible to monitor engine speed, torque, cylinder pressure,
      manifold pressure, cooling air pressure, and power output of the
      engine by the dynamometer. The cylinder or combustion chamber in
      the engine is made of a special heat resistant glass. This enabled
      one to monitor carbon deposition during engine operation.<br>
      <br>
      High accuracy rotometers were used to measure both the flow rates
      of fuel and air. An electronic fuel pump and surge-tank were used
      to establish reliable fuel and air delivery, respectively. The
      engine system had two carburetor controls. A needle valve
      controlled the amount of fuel that flowed through the lines, and a
      throttle valve controlled the amount of air in the airfuel mixture
      to establish the equivalence ratio(4), defined as the actual
      airfuel ratio to the stoichiometric airfuel ratio). A commercially
      available gasoline with 87 RON was used as the fuel. In order to
      avoid fuel composition changes, the same batch of gasoline was
      used for all of the studies described herein.<br>
      <br>
      The water-based fuel additive used an 1E crystal solution having a
      concentration of about 2% IE. crystals. The water based additive
      was prepared as described above. A fuel-water based additive
      mixture was formed by adding a water-based additive (which, as
      described above, is a 1:20 mixture of the 1E solution and
      2-propanol)to the fuel and homogeneously dispersing it into the
      fuel. At the 0.1% (v/v) loading (i.e. the final volume of the 1F
      crystal solution in the fuel was 0.1% v/v or 1000 ppm) used in the
      studies, no clouding was observed initially and over an extended
      period of time, and the gasoline-water based additive mixture was
      clear. The fuel-water based additive mixture was introduced to the
      engine during engine operation.<br>
      <br>
      Engine-out emissions for NOx, total hydrocarbons (THC) and CO were
      measured by an on-line digital gas analyzer (OTC RG240 Digital Gas
      Analyzer, Owatonna, MN) connected to the exhaust pipe by a sample
      line.<br>
      <br>
      Carbon deposits in the engine were measured gravimetrically as
      follows. The engine was operated under sufficiently fuel-rich
      conditions that led to measurable amounts of carbon deposits on
      the piston head in a 30-minute run. After each experiment in which
      either fuel without water-based additive or the fuel-water based
      additive mixture was introduced to the engine during engine
      operation, the engine was completely dismantled, and the carbon
      deposited on the piston head was carefully scraped off, and
      weighed using a sensitive analytical balance. The engine was then
      reassembled to undertake the next study.<br>
      <br>
      In the first set of studies, procedures were carried out in the
      absence of the water based additive to establish the baseline
      conditions. In the second set of studies, identical procedures
      were performed in the presence of the water based additive that
      was homogeneously dispersed into the gasoline at 0.1% (v/v) to
      form a fuel-water based additive mixture.<br>
      <br>
      Engine exhaust emissions were determined as a function of engine
      speed at 1500, 1750, 2250, and 2500 rpm and at different
      equivalence ratios, both for the base case and in the presence of
      the fuel- additive mixture.<br>
      <br>
      Engine exhaust emissions are presented in Figures 2, 3 and 4 for
      the baseline conditions. These results showed that CO and NOX were
      strongly dependent on the equivalence ratio while THC was not. As
      seen in Figure 2, THC emissions showed a slight minimum around =
      0.96-1.0 depending on the engine speed. In addition, an increase
      in engine RPM decreased THC emissions. Minimum THC emissions was
      obtained at 2500 RPM. As seen in Figure 3, CO concentration
      uniformly increased with decreasing equivalence ratio as expected
      at a constant RPM. The production of some CO is inevitable when
      fuel is burned with insufficient air. However, some CO will be
      emitted under a broad range of conditions because of the mixing
      and reaction rate limitations.<br>
      <br>
      The importance of NOX emissions from combustion sources lies in
      its contribution to the formation of secondary atmospheric
      pollutants. As seen in Figure 4, NOX emissions increased with
      increasing equivalence ratio within the range investigated as
      expected from flame temperature considerations. For engine speeds
      of 2000, 2250, and 2500 RPM, NOX concentration showed maxima
      around equivalence ratio of 1.05, as expected (Bosch Automotive
      Handbook, 3rd ed. p. 478-9, Robt. Bosch GmBh). Since the
      combination of temperature and fuel and oxygen concentration
      determines the amount of NOX formation, an NOX emissions peak
      occurred on the fuel lean side ( (1.0). Minimum NOX emissions were
      observed at engine speed of 2250 RPM.<br>
      <br>
      In the second set of experiments, i.e. in the presence of the
      fuel-water based additive mixture, the engine exhaust emissions
      showed no systematic departure from the trends observed in the
      absence of the water based additive. In addition, the levels of
      NOX, THC, and CO were well within the limits of accuracy of the
      measurements made in the absence of water based additives.<br>
      <br>
      Carbon formation studies were performed under sufficiently
      fuel-rich conditions in which measurable carbon deposition on the
      piston head occurred over a 30minute period. In this study, carbon
      deposition rates occurred at an equivalence ratio of 0.72 (fuel
      rich). Lower equivalence ratios led to excessive carbon formation
      and resulted in the early termination of runs. At higher
      equivalence ratios, carbon formation rate was too slow, and longer
      operating times became necessary to accumulate measurable
      quantities of deposits.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 5, the amount of carbon deposited on the piston head was
      plotted as a function of engine speed at the airfuel equivalence
      ratio of 0.72 and at the end of a 30minute operating time, both
      for the base case and in the presence of the additive. The
      experiments corresponding to each data point were repeated three
      times to assess the repeatability of the results. Average standard
      deviations for the base case and in the presence of additive were
      0.16 and 0.11, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      As seen in Figure 5, carbon deposition rates decreased with
      increasing RPM.<br>
      <br>
      Decrease in residence time in the engine at high RPM is a possible
      explanation for this finding. However, it is particularly
      important to note that the presence of 0.1% (v/v) water based
      additive in the fuel significantly decreased the rate of carbon
      deposition at a given<br>
      RPM. In addition, this effect was observed consistently over the
      entire engine speed range investigated. As can be seen in Figure
      5, carbon deposition rate decreased by as much as 32%, 20%, 44% at
      1750, 2000, and 2250 RPM, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      These results demonstrated that the method, water-based additive,
      and fuelwater based additive mixture of the invention decreased
      carbon deposition rate on the piston head of an internal
      combustion engine by as much as 44% compared with the use of the
      fuel in the absence of the water based additive.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the steps of the invention which involved forming the
      fuel-water based additive mixture and introducing the mixture to
      the engine during engine operation comprise the following methods
      which the invention also provides: method for using lower octane
      fuel; method for increasing efficiency of engine performance by
      reducing the rate of pre-ignition caused by carbon build-up in the
      cylinders); method for reducing fuel costs of an engine by
      allowing use of lower octane fuel; method for increasing engine
      performance by reducing carbon erosion of valve seats and other
      control surfaces; method for reducing emissions caused by such
      carbon erosion which allows incomplete combustion products to
      escape into the exhaust thus raising emissions; method for
      maintaining combustion efficiency for a longer period of the life
      of the engine thus saving fuel and reducing maintenance costs.<br>

      <b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to a method of reducing coke formation from
      pyrolysis of hydrocarbon by adding a water based additive to
      hydrocarbon reactants. The invention further relates to a
      hydrocarbon reactant-water based additive mixture.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
        <br>
        2. Description of Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      The publications and other reference materials referred to herein
      to describe the background of the invention and to provide
      additional detail regarding its practice are hereby incorporated
      by reference. The most important olefins and diolefins used to
      manufacture petrochemicals are ethylene, propylene, butylenes, and
      butadiene (Matar, S. and Hatch, L.F., "Chemistry of Petrochemical
      Processes," Gulf Publishing Co., Texas (1994)), Ethylene is one of
      the most important building blocks of synthetic organic chemistry.
      It is used in the manufacture of polyethylene and other products.
      Ethylene production rate has steadily increased over the years
      from 29 million pounds in 1985 to 46.7 million pounds in 1995
      (Chem. Engin. News, June 24, 1996). The majority ofthe ethylene
      produced today is based on the steam cracking or pyrolysis of
      alkanes, such as ethane, propane and butane, as well as heavier
      feedstocks such as aphtha and gas oil (Lee, L.K.K., et al., Oil
      and Gas J. Sept. 10, 1990, p. 60).<br>
      <br>
      The steam cracking of a feedstock is accomplished in the coils of
      a pyrolysis furnace followed by quenching of the gas in a heat
      exchanger (Matar, S. and Hatch, L.F., ibid) or the transfer line
      exchanger (TLE). A technologically important by-product of steam
      cracking is coke formation. Because of its accumulative nature,
      coke deposits build up on reactor walls and influence reactor
      performance in a number of ways. First, due to coke, the surface
      temperature of the coils is increased. This adversely affects,
      i.e. reduces the service life of the coil, and makes it impossible
      to obtain normal pyrolysis temperatures in the reactor. Second
      pressure drop is increased due to the reduction of the inner
      diameter of the coil upon coking which reduces flow rates through
      the coil, and causes a reduction in heat exchange efficiency.
      Third, coking may lead to corrosion of the coil due to
      carbonization.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, decoking of the reactor coils has to be carried out
      periodically, which results in loss of production and increased
      maintenance costs. In ethane cracking, commercial reactors must be
      decoked typically every 20-60 days (Sundaram, K.M. et al. (1981)
      AICHE Journal 7:946).<br>
      <br>
      Sundaram (ibid) studied the thermal cracking of ethane in a
      nitrogen matrix in the temperature range 750 -870 C in a mixed
      reactor. Major products reported were ethylene, methane, C4H and
      C5+. They found the gas phase decomposition to be first order in
      ethane concentration with an apparent activation energy of 54.0
      kcal/mol in agreement with previous studies in a tubular pilot
      reactor (Froment, G.F. et al. (1976) Ind. Eng. Che. process Design
      Develop., 15:495). Similar results were reported more recently by
      Fro (Rev. Chem. Eng. (1990) 6:293) for the steam cracking of
      ethane. Coke was deposited on an Inconel 500 coupon suspended
      inside the reactor from the arm of an electrobalance. The rate of
      formation of coke was found to be time dependent, starting
      initially at a faster rate and reaching an asymptotic value later
      in the run. The initial coke formation rate was attributed to
      catalytic wall effects. Once the coke layer is deposited on the
      coupon, the rate reaches its asymptotic value corresponding to
      coke deposition on coke. The estimated activation energy for coke
      formation base on a kinetic analysis of a reaction model was in
      the range of 28.349.9 kcal/mole. Gas composition measurements also
      indicated the rapid formation rate of CO early in the experiments,
      which leveled off to an asymptotic value following the coverage of
      the metal surface by coke. Initial CO production was proposed to
      be due to metal catalyzed oxidation of hydrocarbon moieties on
      reactor walls, and subsequent CO formation was attributed to the
      steam gasification of carbon. These studies also indicated that
      higher<br>
      steam dilutions decease coke formation rates.<br>
      <br>
      The decomposition of propane in a nitrogen matrix was studied by
      Sundaram and Fro (1979) in a mixed reactor in the temperature
      range 720-870 C. Major products reported were ethylene, methane,
      andC3H6. The disappearance of propane was found to be first order
      in propane concentration with an activation energy of 49.04
      kcal/mol. This is in agreement with the results of Van Damme et
      al. (AICHE Journal, 21:1065 (1975)) and Fro (1990) in the steam
      cracking of propane. The activation energy for coke formation was
      estimated to be 74.97 kcal/mole, again based on the kinetic
      analysis of a reaction model.<br>
      <br>
      This is in agreement with the experimental results of Trimm et al.
      ("Fundamental Aspects of the Formation and Gasification of Coke"
      in Pyrolysis: Theory and Industrial Practice, L.F. Albright et al.
      Eds., Academic Press, NY, p. 203 (1983)) during the steam cracking
      of propane in a flow reactor.<br>
      <br>
      Crynes and Crynes (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 26:2139 (1987)) also
      studied the formation of coke during the pyrolysis of alkanes on
      Incoloy 800 coupons in a flow reactor.<br>
      <br>
      Temperature was maintained at 7000 C by mean of an electric
      furnace. They studied coking during the pyrolysis of ethane,
      ethane, ethene, propane, propene and isobutane. They found the
      following order for coking on the coupon: ethane ( ethene (propene
      (propane ( isobutane, with no coke deposition observed for methane
      at their experimental conditions. The effects of reactor surfaces
      on coke deposition rates during the pyrolysis of propane has been
      studied extensively by Renjun (Fundamental of Pyrolysis of
      Pyrolysis in Petrochemistry and Technology, CRC Pres, Boca Raton,
      USA (1993)) in an electrobalance reactor at 850 C. The order of
      increasing coke deposition rates was found to be nickel )
      stainless ) quartz. High coking rates were also observed early on
      in the experiments, which later reached an asymptotic value upon
      surface coverage by coke.<br>
      <br>
      At present three mechanisms have been proposed to account for coke
      formation in hydrocarbon pyrolysis in industrial and laboratory
      reactors: (1) Coke formation via metal-catalyzed reactions in
      which metal carbides have been proposed to be intermediates. The
      resulting coke is filamentous and contains 1-2 wt% metal; the
      metals are positioned primarily at the tips of the filaments.
      Filamentous coke has been produced at temperatures from about 400"
      C up to 10500 C (Albright, et al. (1988) Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.
      27:755). This can be one of the coke formation mechanisms on metal
      reactor surfaces. (2)<br>
      Coke has also been proposed to form via polycyclic aromatic
      hydrocarbons (PAH) in the gas phase (see, for example, Wang, H. et
      al. (1994) J. Phys. Chem. 98:11465; and Gagurevich, I. Ph.D.
      Thesis, UCLA, 1997 for chemical paths in fuel-rich combustion),
      their nucleation and condensation into tar droplets followed by
      adsorption on surfaces where the tar proceeds to dehydrogenate
      into coke. This mechanism generally results in film or globular
      coke formation (Albright, L.F. et al. "Importance of Surface
      Reactions in Pyrolysis Units," in "Pyrolysis Theory and Industrial
      Practice, Albright, L.F. et al. Eds., Academic Press, NewYork, p.
      233 (1983)). (3) Coke can also grow directly through the reactions
      of small gas phase species with sites on the coke surface. These
      species are likely to be acetylene or other olefins, butadiene,
      and free radicals such as methyl, ethyl, vinyl, phenyl or benzyl
      radicals.<br>
      <br>
      This mechanism should be favored by higher temperatures and with
      higher concentrations of acetylene in the gas phase (see for
      example Mauss et al. 1994, for surface growth mechanisms of soot
      particles in combustion.)<br>
      <br>
      The development of coke inhibitors have paralleled the various
      coke formation mechanisms described above. The techniques commonly
      used today to reduce coke formation include the pretreatment of
      feedstocks, changing the materials of construction of the reactor,
      altering the surface chemistry of the reactor, or the addition of
      coke inhibitors to the feedstock (Renjun, Z. Fundamentals
      ofPyrolysis in Petrochemistry and Technology, CRC Press, Boca
      Raton, USA, 1993; and Burns, K.G. et al. (1991) Hydrocarbon
      Processing, p. 83). The development and use of additives appears
      to be the most effective and practical method. Coke inhibitors
      reported in the literature include salts of alkali metals or
      alkali-earth metals at ppm quantities which are believed to
      promote coke gasification by steam. In addition, the use of
      organic polysiloxane compounds in ppm quantities have been shown
      to reduce the adhesion of coke to the coil walls. Sulfur compounds
      have also been used widely to suppress coke formation, especially
      early on in the pyrolysis process by passivating metal. surfaces
      (Renjun, 1993). Compounds containing tin, antimony, copper,
      phosphorous, and chromium were also reported to have a beneficial
      effect in suppressing coke formation (Renjun, 1993).<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE
        INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention provides a method for reducing coke
      formation from pyrolysis of hydrocarbon reactant in a reactor. The
      method comprises the steps of forming a hydrocarbon
      reactant-water-based additive mixture, and introducing the mixture
      to the reactor. The coke deposited in the reactor from pyrolysis
      of the hydrocarbon reactant-water based additive mixture is less
      than coke deposited from pyrolysis of hydrocarbon reactant in the
      absence of the water based additive. The water-based additive is a
      structured liquid comprising 1E crystal structured liquid, as
      defined and disclosed below.<br>
      <br>
      The invention, in another aspect, provides a hydrocarbon
      reactant-water additive mixture which comprises a hydrocarbon
      reactant and a water-based additive.<br>
      <br>
      As set forth in the detailed example below, the method and mixture
      of the invention reduce the rate of carbon buildup, i.e. coke
      buildup that occurs in pyrolysis of hydrocarbons. As a result, the
      invention also provides a method to increase the productive
      operating period between shutdowns for removal of carbon buildup
      on the equipment surfaces of an ethane or propane or other
      hydrocarbon cracking equipment or production plants. Further
      aspects of the invention involve a method to extend the life of
      heat-exchanger surfaces and heat exchanger equipment by reducing
      the insulating effects of carbon buildup on these surfaces and
      reducing the surface chemical attack of these surfaces that occurs
      in the presence of carbon buildup layers. In still another aspect,
      the invention reduces carbon erosion that is caused by free hard
      carbon particles in a gas stream impinging on equipment components
      made from expensive high-temperature alloys and stainless steels.
      The invention also provides a method for reducing operating and
      maintenance costs of a hydrocarbon steam cracking plant. All of
      these methods are achieved by forming a hydrocarbon reactant-water
      based additive mixture and introducing the mixture to a reactor
      under conditions in which coke deposited in the reactor from
      pyrolysis of the hydrocarbon reactant-water based additive mixture
      is less than coke deposited from the pyrolysis of hydrocarbon
      reactant in the absence of the additive.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Water Based Additive</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the present invention, the water-based additive comprises a
      small amount of crystalline structured water with crystals,
      referred to herein as 1E crystals, in the micron or submicron size
      range. Growth and formation of these 1E crystalline water
      structures and preparation of the water-based additive are
      described below. Pending U.S. Patent<br>
      Applications 08/558,330 and 08/799,645, which are incorporated by
      reference, also disclose 1E crystalline water structures,
      solutions thereof, methods for making the 1E crystals, and methods
      for making concentrated solutions of the 1E water crystals. The
      type of microscopic crystalline structure, referred to herein is
      also referred to herein as 1E crystal structured water.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the water-based additive of the present invention is
      an 1E crystal based additive.<br>
      <br>
      1E crystal structured water is a structured liquid in which the 1E
      crystal structures are induced in the liquid by strong electric
      fields from the electric field of an ion or from the dipole moment
      of molecules. While structured liquids can be formed from a
      variety of polar solvents, I,-structured water is a specific case
      of the general class of structured liquids that is formed from
      water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      By way of explanation, not limitation, the formation of IE
      structured water is illustrated as follows: When salt (e.g. NaCl)
      is dissolved in water, the sodium and the chlorine become ions in
      the water because of the strong dipole moment of water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Very dilute solutions are considered in which positively or
      negatively charged ions attract water molecules which have
      electric dipole moments. However, under these very dilute
      conditions, one finds that the water molecules surrounding an ion
      turn into a form of ice, not the ordinary ice where the unit cell
      has translational invariance, but one in which the crystalline
      structure of water surrounding the ion has a special symmetry due
      to the spherical nature of the coulombic force between the ion and
      the water molecule. The spherical symmetric icy structure
      surrounding ions is called 1E structure indicating it is an icy
      structure formed under the effect of an electric field. The 1E
      structures were observed and recorded under transmission electron
      microscopy, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application 08/799,645,
      and as disclosed in Lo, Shui-Yin (1996) "Anomalous State of Ice,"
      Modern Physics Letters B, 10:909-919; and (1996) "Physical
      Properties of Water with 1E Structures," Modem Physics Letters B,
      10:921-930.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Preparation of the Water-based additive</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Generating more 1F structures and preparation of the water-based
      additive of the present invention, are described in U.S. Patent
      Applications 08/799,645 and 08/558,330, and involves forming
      concentrated crystal solutions of k structures. The method
      involves forming a first structured liquid comprising the 1E
      structures and/or fragments of 1E structures.<br>
      <br>
      This structured liquid comprises a liquid having a dielectric
      constant greater than 1 and a material having an uneven
      distribution in charge on the surface of the material. An example
      of such material is NaCl. The first structured liquid is
      sufficiently diluted by repetitive dilution to form a second
      structured liquid. From the second structured liquid, the IE
      structures are concentrated to form a concentrated crystal
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      Methods for concentrating 1E solutions are disclosed in a patent
      application, incorporated herein, which was filed in the United
      States Patent and Trademark Office by the inventor ofthe present
      invention on July 10, 1997 but for which applicant has not
      received notice of a serial number assigned by the USPTO. The
      disclosed methods include reverse osmosis, doping a solution with
      beads that release an 1F nucleating material, gas chromatography,
      fractional distillation, use of an electrical wire dipole, and
      dynamic freezing.<br>
      <br>
      For example, a concentrated 1E solution has been achieved using a
      reverse osmosis membrane. The exact size and type of reverse
      osmosis membrane depended on the dipole liquid selected to start
      with in creating the crystal structure solution. As a result, the
      reverse osmosis membrane pore size selection and concentration of
      the structured liquid is achieved according to the physical size
      of the crystal structures involved. To be specific, a quantity of
      a dilute or weak 1E crystal structure solution is passed through a
      reverse osmosis unit which contains a membrane with a pore size of
      about 1.8 nanometers. This size filter is small enough and
      intended to allow only the passage of single molecules of water at
      one time through the pore. The reverse osmosis unit is typical of
      those commercially available in various sizes and flow capacities
      and consists of an outside housing, a membrane and sealed end caps
      with holes for tubing to be connected. A carbonator type vane pump
      with an electric motor is attached by tubing and valves to the
      reverse osmosis unit inlet side and when the motor is turned on,
      the pump maintains a pressure on the membrane by means of the
      tubing and valves, and is kept in the range of 100-200 psi by
      adjusting a valve on the outlet side of the reverse osmosis unit.
      The key strategy for varying the concentration of the very dilute
      1E crystal solution is the use of the reverse osmosis machine in
      reverse from its intended method by disposing of the output
      (clean) water and recycling the water that will not pass through
      the filter pore size selected. It has been determined that the
      selection of pore size will be dependent on the size of the
      molecule of the liquid utilized. For water, the membrane pore size
      selected was just slightly smaller than the size of the water
      molecule, about 1.8 nanometers, but it can vary from 1.0
      nanometers to 3.0 nanometers or more depending on the
      liquid/material system selected. Figure 6 illustrates a reverse
      osmosis system 10 for concentrating crystal structured water. The
      weak solution 102 is added to tank 100 then said weak solution is
      drawn up through pipe 108 by means of pump 118 then pressurized
      into tube 112 which goes through pressure gage 116 and on through
      tube 114 into the entry side ofthe reverse osmosis unit 120. The
      weak solution then flows through the membrane assembly 122 wherein
      the single water molecules are driven through said membrane 122 by
      the pressure created by pump 118 acting against valve 126 and exit
      through port 128 and are collected through tube 130 into tank 104
      as a weaker solution 106.<br>
      <br>
      The crystal structure water, being composed of groups of water
      molecules, does not go through the membrane 122 and so it flows
      out ofthe reverse osmosis unit 120 through port 124. The now more
      concentrated crystal structure water then flows through adjustable
      valve 126 which is adjusted to create the membrane back pressure
      as shown at the valve 116. The crystal structure water then
      returns through tube 110 to the original tank 100 where it mixes
      with the weak solution 102 remaining in tank 100. By constant
      recirculation around the system described above, the single water
      molecules are continuously removed from the weak solution and are
      stored in tank 104 causing the mixture in tank 100 to become a
      stronger concentration of crystal structure water solution. As a
      result, one can stop the procedure as the desired concentration
      level desired.<br>
      <br>
      The water-based additive of the invention used in the detailed
      example disclosed below was prepared by a doping method. In this
      method, water was used as a dipole liquid. 0.05 moles of platinum
      chloride was mixed with 100 ml of pure 18 Meg source water, which
      is a highly pure water. Removal of impurities from the dipole
      liquid was extremely important. The resulting mixture was called
      DO. DO was then serially diluted to produce progressively more
      dilute solutions which were designated, respectively, D1 through
      D9. For example, D1 was produced by mixing 10 ml of DO with 90 ml
      of pure 18 Meg source water. Then D2, D3, D4 and so on up to D9
      were produced in the same manner as D1, that is by adding 10 ml of
      each dilution to 90 ml of 18 Meg pure source water. Equal volumes
      of D9 solution and PVC beads (i.e. 50% v/v) were mixed. The PVC
      beads were 65 durometer, food grade PVC pellets. The D9-PVC
      solution was allowed to stand for about two hours, at which time
      the UV absorbance (wavelength 195 nm) of the solution was, in the
      various solutions prepared by this method, from about 0.5 to about
      2.0. In order to concentrate the 1E structures, this solution was
      then processed through a reverse osmosis filter and the volume
      reduced to l/lOth to 1/40th ofthe original volume. This reduced
      volume had a UV absorbance at 195 nm of about 1.5 to about 3.0 in
      the various reduced volume solutions prepared by this method. By
      examination of transmission electron micrographs of IE solutions
      prepared for electron microscopy, it was estimated that the
      percent by weight of 1E structures in this dipole liquid (i.e.
      water) was from about 2% to about 10% of the weight of the water.
      This 1E structured liquid is considered the water-based additive
      of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, a percent 1E solution means (100)weight of 1E
      structures/(weight of H2O + weight of k structures ) in a given
      volume. As used in the example below, the water based additive had
      a UV absorbance at 195 nm of 2.5. For use in the present
      invention, the concentration of 1E structures in the water-based
      additive (i.e. the percentage 1E solution) can vary from about 0.2
      % to about 20 %. A preferred range of concentrations is from about
      0.5% to about 10%.<br>
      <br>
      In the industrial cracking of ethane to produce ethylene, hot
      steam is mixed with the gas ethane in a suitable chamber held at
      the desired temperature and pressure. The cracking process
      produces free carbon as an unwanted byproduct, which necessitates
      the shutdown of equipment for periodic maintenance to remove the
      buildup. In the method of the invention, 1E structured water
      replaced the water used to produce the steam used in cracking and
      the resulting reduction of coke formation upon pyrolysis of
      hydrocarbon reactant-water based additive mixture is one of the
      applications of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      A test was carried out, as described below, to determine the
      effect of the water based additive on the pyrolysis of
      hydrocarbons, in particular, ethane as occurs in the steam
      cracking of ethane. In the normal cracking process the chemical
      reaction is expressed as:<br>
      <br>
      2C2H6 + H2O + O2 = 2C2H4 + 2H2O (ethane) (ethylene)<br>
      <br>
      The actual reaction is never 100% complete and partial products of
      the reaction process are produced such as free carbon, which then
      deposits in layers, on the walls of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of the use of IE structured water for the production
      of steam, the reaction is enhanced by the presence of the 1E
      structures which act as catalysts, as shown by the following
      equation.<br>
      <br>
      2C2H6 + H2O(IE) + O2 = 2C2H4 + 2H2O (ethane) (ethylene)<br>
      <br>
      The test was done under controlled laboratory conditions and a
      diagram of the test apparatus is attached in Figure 1. The test
      equipment consisted of a quartz reactor which was maintained at
      8500C by a furnace. A steam generator was used to heat incoming
      deionized water to steam. Nitrogen was also mixed with the steam.
      A second chamber was used to mix the steam, nitrogen and ethane
      gas to a desired temperature and pressure. The mixture was then
      fed into the quartz reactor and heated to the 850"C test
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Free carbon formed during the cracking process deposits on the
      surface of a quartz coupon. The coupon was supported in a
      thermogravimetric analyzer, which measured the change in weight
      that occurred as the carbon built up on the coupon. The test setup
      had the following parameters:<br>
      <br>
      Temperature: 830C<br>
      Methane 1.8 cc/sec<br>
      Stream = 5.6 cc/sec<br>
      Qnitrogen 2.6 cc/sec<br>
      Coupon Size: 2x2x0.1 cm<br>
      <br>
      The test parameters chosen were typical of those used in
      industrial ethane and propane cracking plants. It should be
      understood that the rate at which steam is introduced in relation
      to the flow rates hydrocarbon reactants can, and the method of the
      invention is not limited to the rate disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      After a specified test time, the ethane or propane was turned off
      and the system was purged with oxygen. The oxygen quickly oxidized
      the carbon deposit on the coupon to carbon dioxide which exited
      the quartz reactor and the weight of the coupon reduced. The rate
      of deposition of the carbon on the coupon was readily measured
      over time.<br>
      <br>
      The system was then purged with nitrogen to remove any traces of
      oxygen and the test was repeated.<br>
      <br>
      In the second test which was the 1E structured water test, a
      sample of 1E structured water was used to replace the deionized
      water used in the first test and the test was then repeated. In
      this second test, the rate of carbon deposition was again recorded
      by thermogravimetric analyzer and it was found to be less than
      that of the deionized water only.<br>
      <br>
      The test was done with ethane and with propane as the main gas.<br>
      <br>
      In the tests on ethane, the carbon buildup rate using deionized
      water as the steam source was 0.341 pg/cm2-sec at 830"C. The
      carbon buildup rate for then, structured water as the steam
      source, was 0.089 ,ug/cm2-sec. This was a reduction of 74%, a very
      significant amount.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of propane cracking, the carbon buildup rate using
      deionized water as the steam source was 0.443 ug/cm2-sec at 8200C.
      The carbon buildup rate at 8200C for the 1E structured water as
      the steam source, was 0.193 ,ug/cm2-sec. This was a reduction of
      56%, also a very significant amount. The carbon buildup values at
      8300C fore the propane were 0.514 and 0.331 Zg/cm2-sec, a
      reduction of 36% which was also very significant.<br>

      <b>Effect of Water Based Additive on Rate of Formation of Coke
        Deposit in Steam Cracking of Ethane and Profane</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In Figure 1, the experimental apparatus used to study the
      formation of coke during the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons, and in
      particular, during the steam cracking of ethane and propane is
      illustrated. This apparatus is a modified version of the set up
      used to study coke formation in the pyrolysis and oxidative
      pyrolysis of methane and methyl chloride (Tran, T. et al. (1994)
      Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 33:32). The main component ofthe
      experimental system is a Cahn 131 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA,
      Madison, WI) that has a detection sensitivity of 1 microgram. The
      system has an electronic microbalance which continuously measures
      and records the mass loss or gain of a substrate material or
      coupon which was suspended from the balance by means of a 0.0127
      cm diameter platinum hangdown wire.<br>
      <br>
      Furnace temperature profile and coupon mass data were acquired and
      stored by the data acquisition and control system. The data
      acquisition hardware consisted of an IBM compatible PC and
      software provided by Cahn Systems. The software allowed for the
      operation of the furnace for any temperature time history. The
      coupon material used for these studies was quartz, with dimensions
      2 cm wide x 2 cm long x 0.1 cm thick. The coupon was centrally
      located inside a 3.5 cm i.d. x 32.5 cm long quartz reactor that
      was vertically placed inside a single zone furnace.<br>
      <br>
      The heating elements inside the furnace spanned a distance of
      about 15 cm, which thereby allowed the establishment of nearly
      isothermal central zone of about 2 cm in length in which the
      quartz coupon was placed (Tran, ibid).<br>
      <br>
      Either deionized water or the water based additive, which
      comprised 1E crystals (Lo, S. (1996)"Anomalous State of Ice,"
      Modern Physics Letters B, 10: 909; Lo, S.<br>
      <br>
      (1996) "Physical Properties of Water with IE Structures," Modern
      Physics Letters B 10:921) was pumped using a high precision
      metering syringe pump (ISCO-2600 with series D<br>
      Controller, Lincoln, NE) and was vaporized in an electric furnace
      maintained at 4000 C.<br>
      <br>
      Nitrogen gas was introduced into the liquid at the upstream of the
      steam furnace as a gas carrier. The hydrocarbon reactants, either
      ethane or propane gases, and some additional nitrogen carrier gas
      were then mixed with the steam to form a hydrocarbon
      reactant-steam mixture (i.e. absence of water-based IE additive)
      or a hydrocarbon reactant-water based additive mixture.<br>
      <br>
      The water based additive of the invention replaced the water used
      as a source for steam. As steam, the water based additive was
      added to the ethane or propane to form a hydrocarbon
      reactant-water based additive mixture. Hydrocarbon reactant-water
      based additive reduced coke deposited in the reactor. The relative
      levels or flow rates of hydrocarbon reactant and steam for forming
      hydrocarbon reactant-water based additive mixture that find use in
      the invention range were: Qernane = 1.8 cc/sec, Stream = 5.6
      cc/sec, Nitrogen = 2.6 cc/sec. It should be understood that in the
      step of forming the hydrocarbon reactant-water based additive
      mixture that the rate at which steam is introduced in relation to
      the flow rates hydrocarbon reactants can vary, and that the method
      of the invention is not limited to the rate disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrocarbon reactant-water based additive mixture was then
      introduced to the reactor through electrically heated lines. All
      the gas flows were regulated by high accuracy rotameter (Mathes
      on, Cucamonga, CA) that were calibrated before the experiments.
      The weighing components of the TGA were protected from the
      reaction products by passing helium purge gas through the chamber.
      The gases used were obtained from Mathes on (Cucamonga, CA) unless
      otherwise indicated and had the following purities:<br>
      <br>
      He:99.99%; C2H:99.9%; C3H8:99.99%; N2:99.999%, and 02:99.9%
      (Liquid Air Co.).<br>
      <br>
      All the studies were conducted at 1 atm pressure and for 1 hour
      reaction time.<br>
      <br>
      Before each run, the reactor was purged with N2 for about 10
      minutes and then decoked using 15% O2 (balance N2) mixture to
      assure that the reactor and the coupon were coke free.<br>
      <br>
      This was accomplished both by visually observing the appearance of
      the coupon through an observation hole in the furnace and by
      monitoring the weight of the coupon during the decoking process.
      If the appearance of the coupon was transparent and nonluminous,
      and its weight did not decrease with time and retained its
      original (coke-free) value, the coupon was assumed to be coke
      free. The reactor was then purged again with N2 for about 10
      minutes after which a mixture was formed between the hydrocarbon
      reactants and steam (either deionized water or water-based
      additive), and the mixture was introduced to the reactor. The
      primary reason for nitrogen purge before and after the decoking
      studies was to minimize the accumulation of potentially explosive
      mixtures in the reactor. Each run was repeated at least five times
      to ensure reproducibility and to assess the range of experimental
      errors associated with the experiments.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Since the TGA had a sensitivity limit in the microgram level, it
      was necessary to determine the optimum gas flow rates that did not
      result in excessive noise, yet allowed the acquisition of reliable
      coking data over the range of concentrations and temperatures
      which were used during the experiments.<br>
      <br>
      Following the initial scoping studies, a total gas flow rate of
      about 2.5 cm3/s, measured at STP, was determined suitable. Higher
      flow rates resulted in the establishment of undesirable flow
      patterns in the reactor that caused lateral movement of the
      hangdown wire and resulted in its contact with the baffle inside
      the reactor. It should be noted that at 2.5 cm3/s, the flow regime
      in the reactor would have been laminar and would have corresponded
      to a nominal residence time of 15 s and about 1.5 s to cross the
      quartz coupon. This residence time was determined by taking into
      account the volume occupied by the baffle (Tran, T., (1992) MS
      Thesis, UCLA Chemical Engineering). Overall reactant conversions,
      measured separately by gas chromatography at the exit of the
      reactor were generally in the range 2-5%. However, because the
      quartz coupon occupied a small fraction of the reactor volume, it
      was subjected to a nearly constant gas composition along the flow
      direction due to the differential conversion of the reactants
      within the 1.5 s reaction time. Consequently, one would have
      expected uniform coke formation along the coupon if diffusion
      limitations were also absent. If diffusion limitation were
      present, the variation of the boundary layer thickeness along the
      coupon would have led to non-uniform coke depostion. Coke
      formation appeared to be uniform along the coupon as determined by
      SEM in previous studies (Tran and Senkan, 1994), indicative ofthe
      absence of transport limitations under the study conditions
      investigated.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 2, a representative set of raw data obtained by the TGA
      is shown for the steam pyrolysis of ethane. As seen from this
      figure, the reproducibility of the experiments was excellent, well
      within 15% from one set to another. A close inspection of the
      individual experiments showed that cooking rates, i.e. the slope
      of the weight vs. time lines, were generally initially higher, but
      leveled off to an approximately constant value. The latter rate,
      corrected for the baseline shift due to the loss or gain of coke
      on the hang-down wire after the decoking process, was designated
      as the specific coke formation rate, RTGA in micrograms/min units.
      High initial coking rates were consistent with the results of
      other investigators (Sundaram, K.M. et al. (1979) Chem. Eng. Sci.
      34:635; Renjun, Z. (1993)<br>
      Fundamentals of Pyrolysis in Petrochemistry and Technology," CRC
      Press, Boca Raton, USA; Froment, G.F. (1990) Rev. Chem. Eng.
      6:293; Tran, T. et al. (1994) Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 33:32).<br>
      <br>
      The physical meaning of the weight change measured by the TGA was
      considered. As evident from the experimental system described
      above, the TGA simply measured the weight change experienced by
      the quartz coupon. This weight change could have been affected
      directly by molecular events, e.g. chemical reactions that
      resulted in the growth and/or destruction of molecular entities on
      the surface, or by macroscopic events, such as soot, tar particle
      collisions with the quartz coupon. Clearly, TA measurements could
      not distinguish between these two types of mechanisms.
      Consequently, these lumped sets of events, as detected by TGA, are
      referred to herein as the coke formation process.<br>
      <br>
      The specific coke formation rate, rc, Fg/cm2-min) was then
      determined from the following equation:<br>
      <br>
      rc=RVA (1) where A is the surface area of the coupon. The specific
      coke formation rate can also be represented by the following
      phenomenological expression:<br>
      rc=kOexp(-E/RT)f()C) Fg/cm2-min (2) where k0 is the specific rate
      constant for coke formation, E is the apparent activation energy,
      and f(C) is a functional dependency of coke formation on the
      composition of the gas phase.<br>
      <br>
      This type of a rate expression has often been used to model coke
      formation kinetics (see for example Sundaram, K.M. et al. (1979)
      Chem. Eng. Sci. 34:635; Renjun, Z. et al. (1987) Ind. Eng. Chem.
      Res. 26:2528; Froment, G.F. (1990) Rev. Chem. Eng. 6:293; Tran, T.
      et al. (1993) Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 33:32). As evident from the
      above expression, under differential conversions that should be
      observed along the 1 cm long quartz coupon, f(C) would be nearly
      constant. The determination of f(C) was not the subject of this
      study.<br>
      <br>
      In Table I, the experimental conditions were investigated and
      summarized. As evident from this table, coke formation rates were
      determined not only at fixed C2 H6, C3H8 and H2O concentrations
      but over a range of temperature ranges both in the absence and
      presence of the 1E additive. It should be noted that the
      temperature ranges studied were different for different mixtures
      because of differences in the decomposition temperatures of C2H6
      and C3H8. Consequently, all the experiments conducted did not
      correspond to identical residence times because of differences in
      gas velocities caused by different temperatures. In addition,
      changes in number of moles caused by the reaction process would
      have also altered residence times. These issues, however, should
      have had a relatively small effect on the results provided here.
      For example, differences in reactor temperatures should have
      introduced a variation in residence times no larger than about
      2.3% between the lowest and highest temperature experiments, i.e.
      100 x (840-820)/(820+273) = 2.3%. This uncertainty was well below
      the measurement errors associated with these types of experiments.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, percent change in the total number of moles would have
      been extremely small due to small conversions involved and the
      presence of steam and nitrogen dilution.<br>

      In Figure 3, the weights of coke deposited on the quartz coupon
      are presented as a function of on-stream time for the steam
      pyrolysis of ethane at 8300 C and 845" C, both in the absence
      (solid lines) and presence (dashed lines) of the 1F additive. The
      specific coke formation rates, determined from the slopes of these
      lines by the least squares fit method and the surface area of the
      coupon are presented in Table II. As is evident from this table,
      the amount of coke deposited on the coupon steadily increased with
      increasing time and reaction temperature. These results were
      totally consistent with previous studies (Froment 1990; Renjun et
      al. 1987; Tran and Senkan 1994). What is important, however, was
      the<br>
      significant and consistent reduction in coke deposition when a
      hydrocarbon reactant-water based additive mixture was introduced
      in the feedstream. For example, at 8300 C, coke<br>
      formation rate decreased from a high value of 0.341 Fg/cm2-min in
      the absence ofthe 1E<br>
      solution to a low value of of 0.0893 pg/cm2-min, representing a
      factor of 3.81 decrease or reduction in coke formation when a
      hydrocarbon reactant-water based additive mixture (comprising the
      1F crystal solution) was formed and the mixture was introduced to
      the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly at 8450 C, the coke formation rate decreased from 0.489
      to 0.225 ,ug/cm2-min, corresponding to a factor of 2.17
      improvement.<br>

      In Figure 4, the Arrhenius plots for the specific coke formation
      rate (roc) in the steam pyrolysis of C2H are presented, again, in
      the absence and presence of the 1E crystal solution in accordance
      with equation (2) presented above. The slope of these lines, which
      correspond to apparent activation energies, were 58.9 and 149
      kcal/mole, without and with the 1E crystal solution, respectively.
      These activation energies are significantly high, thus are
      indicative of the absence of transport limitations. If coke
      formation rates were limited by transport phenomena, the
      measurements would have been less sensitive to temperature and the
      apparent activation energies would have been in the range 1-5
      kcal/mole. The specific coke formation rates reported in Figure 4
      were also analyzed with regard to the wall collision frequency of
      C2H6 with the quartz coupon at the process conditions. These
      calculations indicated that coke formation rates measured by TGA
      were several orders of magnitude below the maximum limit set by
      the collision theory. It is important to note that the slopes of
      individual data sets presented in Figure 4 are different,
      suggesting that the mechanism of coke formation was different in
      the absence and presence of the 1E crystal solution.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 5, the amount of coke deposited on the quartz coupon are
      presented ~ as a function of on-stream time for the steam
      pyrolysis of propane at 820 and 830" C. A comparison of the
      results with those for ethane (Figures 2 and 3) clearly showed
      that propane had a greater propensity for coke formation. The
      specific coke formation rates in the absence ofthe additives were
      0.443 and 0.514 Fg/cm2-min at 820" and 830" C, respectively. The
      latter rate was 50% higher than the rate of coke formation in
      ethane pyrolysis at the same reaction temperature. As evident from
      Figure 5, the presence of the 1E crystal solution also reduced
      coke formation in the steam pyrolysis of propane. Coking rates
      were reduced by factors of 2.29 and 1.55 at 820 and 830" C,
      respectively (Table II).<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 6, the Arrhenius plots for the specific coke formation
      rates in the steam pyrolysis of C3H8 are presented. The apparent
      activation energies were 35.4 and 129 kcal/mole, in the absence
      and presence of the 1E additive, respectively. Although these
      values were lower than those observed for ethane, they were still
      high and indicated that intrinsic reaction kinetics, not transport
      limitations, controlled coke formation rates in the studies
      reported herein.<br>
      <br>
      Based on bond dissociation energy considerations, propane was
      expected to undergo pyrolysis at lower temperatures, and thus
      produce more coke than ethane at a given temperature. The
      experimental results presented above are consistent with this
      picture, and are presented below by way of illustration, not
      limitation. The decomposition of the hydrocarbon reactant was
      initiated by unimolecular decomposition or the scission of the
      weakest bond in the molecule. For ethane and propane these paths
      would be:<br>
      <br>
      C2fl + M = 2CH3 + M (aha=90 kcal/mole) (3)<br>
      C3H8 + M = CH3 + C2H5 = M (AHT=87 kcal/mole) (4)<br>
      The following C-H bond dissociation reactions are energetically
      more difficult:<br>
      C2H6 + M = C2H5 + H + M (AHT=100 kcal/mole) (5)<br>
      C3H* + M = I-C3H7 + H + M (AHT=95 kca1/mole) (6)<br>
      <br>
      Once radical species are generated, they accelerate reactant
      destruction leading to unsaturated C2, C3, and C4 species such as
      C2H2, C2H3, C3H3 , C4H2 These small species can then polymerize
      and result in the formation of aromatics which are believed to be
      precursors to soot and coke (Wang, H. et al. (1994) J. Phys. Chem.
      98:11464; Miller, J.A. et al. (1992) Combust. Flame 91:21) For
      example, feasible reaction sequence resulting in molecular growth
      and leading to benzene are as follows:<br>
      <br>
      C2H3 + C2H2 = C4H4 + H (7) n-C4H5 (8)<br>
      C4H4 + H = n-C4H3 + H2 (9) followed by:<br>
      n-C4H3 + C2H2 C6H6-(phenyl) (10)<br>
      n-C4H5 + C2H2 = QHo (11) or via direct C3H3 recombination:<br>
      C3H3 + C3H3 = C6H6 (12)<br>
      <br>
      Once the first aromatic ring is formed, molecular weight growth
      leading to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) can occur by
      either even carbon route (Wang, H. et al, 1994) or odd carbon
      route (Miller, J.A. et al., 1992; Colket, M.B. et al. (1995)
      Proceed. Of 2th Symposium (Int'l.) On Combustions, p. 1205);
      Marinov, N.M. et al. (1997) Combust. Sci. Tech., in Press) or more
      likely a combination of both routes. Gas phase polymerization
      subsequently leads to tar, soot and ultimately coke as a
      consequence of series of PAH condensation and dehydrogenation
      reactions.<br>
      <br>
      In the studies reported herein, since coke formation decreased or
      reduced in the presence of the 1E crystal solution, one can
      postulate several mechanism to explain this phenomenon. These
      explanations are presented as illustrations and should not be
      construed as limitations of the present invention. First, the 1E
      crystals may have preferentially adsorbed on the quartz surface
      and retarded the adsorption of coke precursors or tar droplets.
      Second, the k crystals may have chemically interfered with the
      surface reaction processes thus preventing buildup of coke by
      suppressing the following type of coke buildup reactions:<br>
      <br>
      &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="015505439-00220001" /&gt;<br>
      <br>
      coke*1+C2H2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      C,H,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      coke*1+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +H<br>
      <br>
      where coke*1 represents an activated radical site on the coke
      surface with molecular weight I.<br>
      <br>
      It should be understood that these findings show that the method
      of the invention in which a hydrocarbon reactant-water based
      additive mixture was formed and then introduced to a reactor for
      pyrolysis achieves reduction in coke formation in the reactor
      compared to pyrolysis of the hydrocarbon reactant in the absence
      of the water based additive.<br>
      <br>
      This hydrocarbon reactant-water based mixture of the invention
      also finds use in reducing coke formation from pyrolysis of
      hydrocarbons. The method and mixture of the inventions are
      intended for use in industrial production facilities, although
      other practical applications are also contemplated for the method
      and mixture where reduction of coke formation is an object. The
      application of 1E crystal solution or structured water to the
      pyrolysis hydrocarbons has been demonstrated herein to show a
      significant reduction in carbon deposit rates. This reduction in
      carbon deposit rate will allow longer use of industrial steam
      cracking plants between shut downs for carbon removal and repair
      of carbon eroded components, thus reducing plant operating costs.<br>

      A method of generating a new class of materials by physical and
      chemical means which is initiated by use of IE structured water in
      conjunction with other materials, to create final materials with
      permanent electric dipole moments. The physical means comprises
      either crystallization or mixing and the chemical means comprises
      as an example precipitation, neutralization of acids and alkalis
      and oxidation/reduction. These new materials can be used in a
      variety of applications such as enhancing growth of plants, or
      enhancing chemical reactions such as in catalytic converters, to
      name only a few.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The general preparation of LE structured liquids and SE structured
      solids are covered in prior applications 08/182,410 " Growing
      Crysfals around Charged Particles" and 08/217,042 "Growing
      Structures around Charged Particles to Form a Structured Liquid
      and Increasing the Strength of the Structured Liquid and Creating
      Structured Solids"<br>
      <br>
      In those applications, for example, application 08/217,042
      describes a descalant comprising LE structured liquid crystals
      which when placed close to, or into a liquid stream, cause the
      formation of microscopic liquid crystalline structures, which act
      as nucleation sites for the formation of crystal structures of
      normally liquid-soluble or insoluble salts, and other suspended
      particles. These crystalline structures are chemically stable and
      cause a large reduction in the scaling potential of the liquid,
      thereby avoiding scale buildup on metal or other containment
      surfaces. The crystals also initiate descaling of surfaces already
      containing scale buildup. Furthermore, use of the crystals reduce
      the amount of detergents, soaps, surfactants and polymers required
      in washing and other forms of water use.<br>
      <br>
      Application 08/182,410 describes a method for forming a structured
      solid in a polar liquid by the interaction of the polar liquid and
      an ion. The polar liquid has a strong electric dipole moment.<br>
      <br>
      In order to summarize the present invention, the definition of
      some descriptive terms are presented as follows: IE stands for ice
      formed in water under a strong electric field.<br>
      <br>
      I,r structured water is one specific case of the general class of
      LE-structured liquids that is formed from water molecules. This is
      water that contains IE crystals, sometimes called IE structures.
      These structures are obtained by ways and means as described in my
      previous patent applications as listed above. The theoretical idea
      is that water molecules from an electric dipole with an electric
      dipole moment of 2.9 Debye. Under suitable conditions these water
      molecules will cluster to form crystal-like structures in the
      nanometer to micron size range. These clusters would also be
      expected to have a strong electric dipole moment.<br>
      <br>
      Lc structured liquid is broadly defined as the structured liquids
      prepared by the earlier two inventions listed above. LE-structure
      specifically means that the structure is induced by strong
      electric fields which can come about from the electric field of an
      ion or from the dipole moment of molecules. IE-structured water is
      one specific case of this LE-structure liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Sr structured solid is broadly defined as the structured solids
      prepared by the earlier two inventions listed above. The solid
      becomes structured by treatment with IE-structured water or
      LE-structured liquid<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the Present Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is a method for combining LE structured
      liquids with other materials to form structured solids. The
      resulting structured solid materials can be used for many
      applications including but not limited to making clay used to form
      bricks, or mixed with cement with or without aggregate, for use in
      structured solid mixtures, or for encapsulation of the structured
      LE liquid in plastic, glass or ceramic to create the desired
      effect in liquids.<br>
      <br>
      The mixing or combining of the LE structured liquid with other
      materials to create structured solids or media results in a cost
      effective mechanism to structure di-electric liquids. The
      combining Of LE structured liquid with materials to form SE solids
      is done for ease of structuring various di-electric liquids.<br>

      </b><b>Description of the Preferred Embodiments</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Figure 1 shows an example of a new material (100) which has formed
      around an IE crystal (102), the original crystal (102) has a
      positive charge q+ (104) and a negative charge q (105). The new
      material (100) has the same positive +q charge (106) and negative
      charge q (107) at its ends. Since the length 1(108) of the new
      material (100) is many times larger than length d (103) of the
      original IE crystal (102) its dipole moment is much larger,
      generally by many orders of magnitude. This positive and negative
      charge (106) and (107) are built-in to the new material (100)
      which gives it new properties.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2 shows a container (110) filled with IE structured water
      (112) and with sodium hydrogen phosphate, (NaH2PO4) in the form of
      ions of sodium (114) and phosphate (116), (both exaggerated in
      size for clarification) solution.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2A shows said container (110) which has been dried by
      heating, to remove the liquid (114) shown in Figure 2, leaving a
      new structured solid precipitate (210) at the bottom of the
      container (110).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 3 shows a container (120) filled with IE structured water
      (122) into which calcium carbonate (124) has been dissolved. As
      the solution is dried, the new material, structured calcium
      carbonate (125) precipitates out with a completely different
      crystal structure to the normal precipitate. (All solute and
      precipitate are exaggerated in size for clarification)<br>
      Figure 4 shows a container (130) filled with glass powder (132),
      which has been structured by mixing with IE structured water
      (133). The IE structured water attaches to the particles of glass
      powder (132) and causes them to become structured with a permanent
      dipole moment.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 4A shows the structured glass powder produced as in Figure
      4, being poured as a,melted structured liquid (134) through a
      funnel (131) into a mold (140). The resulting structured liquid
      glass (144) contains the permanent electrical charge ofthe
      original glass powder particles (132), shown in Figure 4.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 5 shows a container (160) which contains liquid glass (162)
      which has been structured first of all, as shown in Figure 4 and
      then heated until molten.<br>
      <br>
      The molten glass is drawn through an orifice (163) which forms a
      new structured glass fiber material (164).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 6 shows a container (150) which has been wrapped in new
      structured material glass fiber (156). The container (150) has an
      inlet (154) through which liquid is passed and an outlet (152) for
      the release of the structured liquid (153). By bringing the liquid
      (155) into close physical contact with the structured glass fiber
      (156), the liquid becomes structured and leaves the container
      (150) through outlet (152) as a structured liquid (153).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 7 shows the creation of a new structured material (184) in
      a liquid solution (181) under the influence of a strong electric
      field (188), created between two metal plates (182) when an
      external voltage is applied through a battery (180) and conveyed
      to the plates (182) through electrical leads (187).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 8 shows LE structured water combined with cement to form
      structured cement spheres (200) that can be placed in a vessel
      (202) at the exit end of a swimming pool water-filtration system
      (204) so that the water drawn from the swimming pool (206) by pump
      (205) passes through pipe (209) then passes through the standard
      sand-bed filter (207) and then goes through the vessel (202)
      containing the spheres (200) and thus the pool water is exposed to
      the structured cement spheres (200) and becomes structured. The
      resulting LE structured water (208) is then passed through pipe
      (210) back to the pool (212) and mixes with the pool water (213).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 9 shows LE structured liquid (220) encapsulated in plastic,
      glass or ceramic hollow sphere shapes (222). The spheres (222) are
      enclosed in a vessel (223). Liquid (221) enters the vessel (223)
      through pipe (226) contacts the spheres (222) and becomes
      structured. The LE structured water (220) contained in the spheres
      (222) structures the liquid (224) which passes through the spheres
      (222) containing the LE structured liquid (220) and becomes
      structured liquid (224) then leaves the vessel (223) by way of
      pipe (228). This process can be done where the liquid to be
      structured for example, alcohol, should not be directly mixed with
      the LE structured liquid (220).<br>
      <br>
      The glass, plastic or ceramic spheres (222) encapsulating the LE
      structured liquid (220), could be placed in-line with the alcohol
      delivery system in a processing plant or in-situ with a glass bead
      screen. The resulting structured liquids would have a lower
      surface tension. This lower surface tension when used in cleaning
      applications will decrease the amount of detergent needed for
      cleaning and processing. The LE structured liquid can be
      manufactured in accordance with earlier practices as cited above
      in the inventor's prior applications. The LE structured liquid is
      then mixed with materials to form structured solids.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 10 shows SE structured solids (230) molded and formed into
      shapes (232) that are wrapped around a pipe (234) carrying a
      liquid to be structured (236). The liquid to be structured (236)
      passes close to the structured solid (230) and becomes structured
      and then passes out from the wrapped area along pipe (238) as
      structured water (239).<br>
      <br>
      Clay bricks can be made with structured solids to retrofit in
      large containers such as water towers and the like. The
      encapsulated structured liquids can be formed into a screen to
      pass liquids to be structured. The encapsulated LE structured
      liquids can also be mixed in with plastics through the use of
      these encapsulates.<br>
      <br>
      An external electric field can also be used to create a larger
      permanent electric dipole moment in a new structured media.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 11A shows a weak net magnetic field (240), created when a
      bunch of magnets (242) are thrown together randomly. This occurs
      because individual magnets (244) and (246) tend to attract one
      another and cancel each other's charges out and so produce a much
      smaller net magnetic field (240).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 11B shows the application of an extremely strong external
      magnetic field (250), by means of two large strong magnets (251)
      and (253). The smaller magnets (252) and (254) tend to align
      themselves under the influence of the external magnetic field
      (250) and so are much more orderly and produce a strong net
      magnetic field (256).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 11C shows the case of formation of a new structured
      material (260) by physical or chemical means, as shown earlier in
      Figure 1 when subjected to the influence of an external electric
      field (262) created by batteries (261) connected to metal
      conductors(264) and (268) through leads (265) and (267).<br>
      <br>
      The permanent electric dipole moment (266) of the new structured
      material (260) tends to line up and produce a large net electric
      dipole moment (266). This electric dipole moment (266) will become
      permanent after alignment of individual particles of the material
      (269) is complete and the external electric field (262) is
      withdrawn.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 12 shows another example where the structured media is used
      as an electronic information storage device. Currently electronic
      storage devices use a magnetic dipole of ferrous media on a disc
      surface, for storage of electronic information. The north pole
      stands for a one and south pole for a zero, or vice versa, in a
      binary system. In the present invention, a storage device would
      use a permanent electric dipole on a small spherical shape (270),
      instead of an induced magnetic dipole in a permanently installed
      ferrous particle, as the information storage device.<br>
      <br>
      As Figure 12 shows in the present invention, the positive end
      (272) stands for numeral one and the negative end (273) stands for
      numeral zero or vice versa, as in a binary system. Since the
      dipole moment is permanent the small spherical shape of structured
      material (270) can be imbedded in a soft medium (278) which allows
      it to rotate under the influence of a strong external electric
      field (276) supplied by a read/write pointer (277). If the soft
      medium is chosen correctly to produce enough friction for the
      structured solid, the spherical shape (270) then remains
      stationary. A weak electric field can then be applied through the
      read/write pointer (277) as it moves across the soft medium (278)
      containing the spherical shapes (270) and so the positive (272) or
      negative (273) values can be read.<br>
      <br>
      There are also a class of materials with ferro-electric properties
      which are analogous to the properties known as ferro-magnetics.
      Ferro-electric materials, have a permanent spontaneous electric
      polarization that can occur on one or more crystal axes and that
      can be reversed by an electric field. These ferro-electric
      materials can also be structured by use of 1E structured water to
      produce a class of new materials.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the other uses of structured material are: as an
      oxidation/reduction media in liquid and gas catalytic converters;
      as catalytic reactors in the petroleum cracking industry; as a
      ceramic for use in the manufacture of plant pots which allows the
      water added to the potted plants to become structured and hence
      enhance growth rates; as an air filter material acting as a micron
      and submicron-sized dust particle attractor; as a lining material
      in a water storage container to structure contained water for the
      enhancement of plant growth; enzyme production and enzyme reaction
      rates in a variety of commercial and industrial applications; as a
      material used in the surface of containers used to grow and
      process yeasts, algae, fungi and other commercially useful
      biological organisms to enhance their production rate in
      applications as diverse as in breadmaking and the production of
      pharmaceutical drugs; as an addition to the manufacture of wine,
      liquor and whiskey to reduce the time necessary for aging; as a
      water sprayer attachment to cause the structuring of water passed
      through the attachment for enhancement of plant growth; as a
      structured water for setting cement, concrete and other
      cement/aggregate mixtures, to enhance final cured structural
      strength; as a structured material to manufacture frictionless
      ball bearings; as a ball shape for installation in a swimming pool
      circulation line to reduce chlorine demand; as a ball shape for
      installation into the recirculation lines of a cooling tower water
      system to reduce scaling; as a surface liner for sewage treatment
      plant containers, to structure the water being treated and so
      enhance the growth of beneficial bacteria; as a structured
      material formed into shapes where the permanent charge is aligned
      before the material is fully formed thus strongly enhancing the
      electric fields around the shape, for an example of this
      application, a structured material can be used to make the body of
      a levitating train into a supermagnet; as a structured liquid for
      producing stable ferrous oxides on the surface of metal structures
      to enhance rust resistance, such as the hulls of ships and
      bridges; as a liquid surface treatment for a new class of low-cost
      rust-resistant steels; as a new class of magnets using structured
      materials in their construction; as a structured liquid for the
      oxidation of metal surfaces to create stable oxide surfaces.<br>

      A method of generating nuclear fusion, whereby bubbles of a gas of
      about 10 micron diameter, contained in heavy water, are expanded
      by use of a vacuum to about 100 microns in diameter. The
      subsequent thermal cooling and collapse of the bubbles is
      augmented by a uniform pressure externally applied and acting on
      the bubbles through the heavy water. Symmetry in the bubbles'
      shape is imparted by the addition of heat from a laser as the

      <br>
      A fuel additive for addition to hydrocarbon fuels of the type used
      in gasoline and diesel engines which enhances the combustion
      process. The fuel additive consists of a small amount of a
      selected submicron structured water, added to an organic solvent
      such as ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol. When added to a
      hydrocarbon fuel, the submicron sructure continues to grow
      throughout the fuel volume, imparting the same preselected
      combustion enhanced properties of the fuel itself. Thus when
      combustion occurs, the combustion efficiency is enhanced and no
      undesirable residues, deposits or emissions are produced by the
      additive, which, apart form the small amount of solvent, does not
      add any adverse compounds to the combustion process.<br>

      <b>Background - Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to a fuel additive for enhancing the
      combustion of liquid, solid and gaseous fuels and specifically, to
      a fuel additive that does not use conventional additive chemicals
      and instead, enhances the combustion process with an additive
      based on newly discovered microscopic, stable, crystalline water
      structures<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background - Description of Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Fuel additives have been used for some time, to enhance the
      combustion of hydrocarbon and other fossil fuels, by reduction of
      the formation of carbon deposits on engine internal surfaces and
      reduction of exhaust emissions. These additives are of various
      types such as various metallic compounds, and high volatility, low
      molecular weight hydrocarbon compounds.Some more advanced
      additives use platinum, rhodium and other precious metals, in
      various compound forms including, more recently, organometallic
      compounds which readily dissolve in fuels, to enhance the
      combustion process. In all cases, extra chemical compounds are
      added to the fuel, which may have undesirable secondary effects
      such as high toxicity on exposure and additional emissions of
      heavy metal compounds in the exhaust gas stream.<br>
      <br>
      In the preparation of oxygenated fuels as used in a number of US
      cities, which do not meet EPA winter time compliance on the
      atmospheric levels of carbon monoxide, a number of oxygenates have
      been added to gasolines over the winter months. For instance
      methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether (MTBE) has been added to gasolines to
      supply the 2.5 to 3.5% oxygen requirement. This has been done in
      an attempt to reduce carbon monoxide emissions in engine exhausts
      during cold winter conditions when partial combustion products
      create higher pollution levels. Numerous complaints have been
      received however, in these cities, from consumers who have
      experienced adverse health effects of exposure to the MTBE. Also,
      it is not clear that the expected reductions in carbon monoxide
      were actually realized in these cities during the winter months.<br>
      <br>
      In the present invention, a fuel additive consisting of a small
      amount of crystalline structured water with crystals in the micron
      or submicron size range, mixed with a simple alcohol, organic
      solvent or other carrier, or directly, without a carrier, which
      burns readily, is added in small quantities to the fuel. Growth
      and formation of these crystalline water structures are fully
      covered in my patent applications USSN 08/217,042 and USSN
      08/182,410. The type of microscopic crystalline water structure,
      called 1E crystal structured water, is selected for its catalytic
      effect on fuels and the IE crystal based additive, when added to a
      hydrocarbon fuel, grows similar structures in the fuel itself.<br>
      <br>
      When the fuel is burned, these 1E structures enhance the
      combustion process significantly. This invention avoids all the
      problems of conventional additives discussed above and produces a
      fuel additive with no adverse engine or environmental side
      effects. Further, the amount of the new IE crystal additive
      required is very small, typically about 0.1% by volume of the fuel
      being treated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Objects and Advantages ofthe Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Accordingly, besides the objects and advantages of the fuel
      additive described in my above patent, several objects and
      advantages of the present invention are:<br>
      (a) To provide a fuel additive that does not contain metal,
      organic or<br>
      inorganic compounds that may cause undesirable effects on
      emissions, or create internal engine surface deposits.<br>
      <br>
      (b) To provide a fuel additive that requires a very small amount
      to be added to the fuel to create the desired effect on exhaust
      emissions and carbon deposits.<br>
      <br>
      (c) To provide a fuel additive that can be added to any kind of
      fossil fuel, including, but not limited to; gasoline, diesel,
      bunker oil, coal, anthracite, coke, natural gas, coal gas and the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      (d) To provide a fuel additive that has a significant economic
      advantage over conventional fuel additives.<br>

      <b>Detailed Description of the Drawings/Figures</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Figure 1 is a schematic of a mass production method for producing
      structured liquids.<br>
      <br>
      The water to be structured (10) is placed in a tank (11) and a
      pump (12) drives the liquid into pipe (15). The liquid entering
      pipe (13) passes through control valve (14) and flowmeter (16).
      The initial structuring solution (22) is placed in tank (24) and
      is metered into the mainflow through valve(20) and flowmeter (18)
      into the line (19).<br>
      <br>
      The two solutions then enter the static mixer (26) where mixing
      occurs in the turbulent environment created by the static mixer.
      The mixed liquid then enters pipe (41) and flows into tank (40) as
      solution (42). This solution then enters pipe (39) and passes
      through valve (38) and flowmeter (36) into pipe (35). Some of the
      incoming mainflow is directed through pipe (28) and enters pipe
      (30), passes through valve (32) and flowmeter (34) and hence mixes
      with the flow from pipe (35) in pipe (37) the mixed flow then
      passing through static mixer (62) and entering pipe (60).<br>
      <br>
      The mixed flow then enters tank (56) as solution (58). The
      solution (58) then leaves tank (56) and passes through valve (54)
      and flowmeter (52) and into pipe (50). Part of the flow from pipe
      (28) enters pipe (44) and passes through valve (46) and flowmeter
      (48) into pipe (51). The flows from pipe (51) and (50) are then
      mixed in static mixer (64) and finally leaves the system through
      pipe (66), as final structured liquid (68). The ratios of flows in
      the various pipes is covered in the detailed discussion the comes
      later.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2 is a schematic of a self-generating process for producing
      structured liquids.<br>
      <br>
      A small amount of structured liquid (84) is placed in tank (82).
      The structured liquid (84) is then passed through valve (86), pipe
      (88) and flowmeter (90). Ordinary unstructured liquid (72) from
      tank (70) is pushed by pump (74) through valve (76) and flowmeter
      (78) into pipe (80). The contents of pipe (88) and pipe (80) mix
      together and pass through the static mixer (94) and into pipe
      (96). The mixture then passes into tank (98) and is stored (100).
      This mixture is then passed through valve (102) into pipe (104).
      When valve (106) is closed the liquid flows through valve (108)
      into tank (110) as liquid (112) which is further structured in
      tank (110). The solution can then be recirculated through pipe
      (114) into tank (82) and remixed as before with some fresh
      unstructured liquid from pipe (80).The mixture then passes as
      before into pipe (104) and can be either routed back to tank (110)
      or it can be drawn off through pipe (116) for use.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 3 is schematic of the reactor system used to evaluate the
      effect of the additive on combustion processes. A temperature
      controlling bath (120) containing a bubbler (122) filled with
      structured liquid (124) is connected up to a methane (130) and a
      carbon monoxide (132) gas supply. The gas is pumped through pipe
      (128) into the bubbler (122) where it picks up vapor of the
      structured liquid (124) and carries it through pipe (126) into the
      reactor premixing tube (142). In the reactor premixing tube (142)
      other gases such as argon (134) is fed in. Oxygen (136) is metered
      into the quartz reactor (144) to control the degree of combustion.
      The premixed gases including the structured liquid are then fed
      into the quartz reactor (144) where the gases and structured
      liquid are combusted by the three-stage electric furnace (146).<br>
      <br>
      The post combustion gases pass through pipe (148) and into the
      vent (150). Some of the gases are drawn through pipe (152) into a
      gas analyzer (154).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 4 shows the components of a typical crystalline water
      structure as observed under a scanning electron beam microscope.
      The crystal is composed of small individual crystalline structures
      (160) and (164) of different sizes, connected together.<br>
      <br>
      The overall size of the crystal structure (162) is about 2 to 3
      microns long by 1 micron wide. Flat spots (166) and (168) are
      created by individual crystals that are no longer attached to the
      main body.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 5 illustrates oxygen (180) showing individual atoms (174)
      and the covalent bond (182) attached by electrical force, to the
      surface of an individual water crystal (171) of a crystalline
      water structure (170). A hydrocarbon fuel molecule (178)
      consisting of carbon atoms (176) and hydrogen atoms (177) are
      shown attached to the same surface (171) of the crystalline water
      structure (170). This attachment brings the oxygen and hydrocarbon
      in close proximity to each other, thus greatly increasing the
      probability of reaction between the two and hence oxidation of the
      fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 6 is a schematic of a fuel tank (180) with a feed tube
      (186); the fuel tank contains a typical liquid fuel (184) filled
      up to level (182) and contains an additive container tube (188)
      filled with additive (190) inside the tank (180)..<br>
      <br>
      Figure 7 is a schematic of a fuel tank (198) containing a typical
      liquid fuel (196) filled up to level (200) and containing an
      additive container tube (194) filled with additive (195) said
      additive container tube (194) being affixed to the side of the
      tank (198).<br>

      <b>Detailed Description of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In order to summarize the present invention, the definition of
      some descriptive terms are presented as follows: LE-structured
      liquid is broadly defined as the structured liquids prepared by
      the earlier two inventions referenced above on page 1.
      LE-structure specifically means that the structure is induced in
      the liquid by strong electric fields which can come about from the
      electric field of an ion or from the dipole moment of molecules.
      IE-structured water is one specific case of the general class of
      LE-structured liquids that is formed from water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      SE-structured solid is broadly defined as the structured solids
      that are formed under a strong electric field and also those that
      are prepared by the methods defined in the earlier two inventions
      in my patent applications 08/182,410 and 08/217,042 listed above.
      LE-structured liquid is actually a liquid that contains
      SE-structured solids.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the Present Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Structured water is water which is IE-structured and has a strong
      electric dipole moment. These electric dipole moment structures
      can induce electric dipole moments in neutral molecules that move
      near them. The electric attractive force around the 1E structures
      in the liquid draw neutral molecules toward the surface of the 1E
      structures.<br>
      <br>
      The attraction is greater if the electric dipole moment of the IE
      structure is larger.<br>
      <br>
      The results of this attraction force is the creation of
      crystalline water structures which are submicron in size.<br>
      <br>
      When more than one molecule is present, say molecules A and B,
      which can react to form molecules C and D in a chemical reaction,
      it is necessary for A and B to get physically close to each other
      for the reaction to take place. With the presence of the IE
      structures pulling both A and B towards the surface of the 1E
      structure and increasing their kinetic energy, then the reaction
      rate between A and B will be increased and the 1E structures
      become the catalyst for speeding up the reaction A and<br>
      B to C and D.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is a combustion enhancing fuel additive that
      uses no chemical materials but which uses IE structures as well as
      creates crystalline structures in hydrocarbon fuels that both
      enhance the combustion of these fuels. To understand how this
      occurs, the following discussion on the chemistry of combustion
      processes is presented.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ChemistRY of Combustion Processes</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are three basic combustion processes that can be enhanced by
      the I- structured fuel additive as follows:<br>
      <br>
      (1) The combustion of hydrocarbon fuels IE CnH2n+2 + (3n+l) 2 X
      nCO2 + (n+1)H2O (1) 2 where, IE represents the catalytic effect of
      the crystal structure<br>
      (2) The complete combustion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide
      1E 2CO + 2 X 2CO2 (2)<br>
      (3) The burning of unused carbon in the combustion chamber either
      from incomplete combustion, or residual carbon deposits on the
      walls of the combustion chamber The carbon reaction is: :<br>
      C + t12O(IE) o CO + H2 (3) where the water molecules belong to the
      Ir crystal.<br>
      <br>
      By the addition of the 1E crystalline structure fuel additive, all
      three of these reactions will be enhanced and release more total
      energy due to more complete combustion and hence show better
      engine performance and reduced exhaust emissions for a variety of
      engine operating conditions.<br>
      <br>
      (4) In the combustion of coal, with a high sulfur content the
      sulfur burns according to the reactions: 1E<br>
      S + 2 o SO2 (4a) and 1E<br>
      2S + 302 X 2SO3 (4b)<br>
      The sulfur oxides then combine with water and oxygen in the air to
      produce sulfuric acid, which falls to the ground in rain. The
      presence of the acid changes soil pH which results in the well
      documented darnage to plant life.<br>
      <br>
      By using the 1E structured water, the sulfuric acid problem will
      be reduced due to the following reactions. First, the sulfur oxide
      converts to an acid form by reacting with the water molecules in
      the 1E crystal.<br>
      <br>
      S03 + H20(IE) o H2SO4 (5)<br>
      This reaction is enhanced by many orders of magnitude due to the
      strong electric dipole of the IE crystal.<br>
      <br>
      The sulfuric acid then reacts with other impurities in the coal,
      to form a salt so that very little acid is emitted in the exhaust
      gases from the coal combustion process.<br>
      <br>
      One such reaction is that of the sulfuric acid with calcium
      carbonate, which is also present in the coal as a contaminant:<br>
      H2SO4+ CaCO3 o CaSO4 + H2O + CO2 (6) or with the hydroxide form of
      calcium where:<br>
      H2SO4 + Ca(OII)2 o CaSO4 + 2H2O (7)<br>
      In both cases, the calcium sulfate is a stable precipitate and
      will become part of the fly ash from the combustion process A
      theoretical estimation of the reaction rate enhancement caused by
      the structured water is as follows:<br>
      Discussion of the Reaction Enhancement Where IE Structured Water
      Participates:<br>
      As shown in my earlier patent application as listed on page 1, the
      average increase RA per water molecule for reaction (3) or (5)
      is::<br>
      RA/M RN/M= N4 R0M (8) where: RA is the average reaction rate of an
      IE crystal<br>
      M is the number of atoms in an individual IE crystal structure<br>
      RN is the reaction rate of the 1E crystal.<br>
      <br>
      N4 is the factor of increase of the electric dipole moment.<br>
      <br>
      and Ra is the reaction rate of ordinary water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Since there are many cancellations of the electric dipole moment
      among water molecules in an 1E crystal, we expect that the
      increase in electric dipole is much smaller that the number of
      water molecules in an 1i. crystal, or M &gt; &gt; N. Nevertheless,
      even if N = Ml/2 we still have RAN2Ro. So numerically with an 1E
      structure with one hundred (M = 100) water molecules, then the
      reaction rate is increased by a factor of 100.We however expect
      the electric dipole moment of a unit cell of an 1E structure to
      align, then we have:<br>
      M = N = 100 (9)<br>
      Then the enhancement rate of a hydrogen-carbon chemical reaction,
      using IE crystals will be (100)4 times or conservatively, at least
      1 million times or more.<br>
      <br>
      The above argument also works for the general chemical reaction:<br>
      A+ H2O o C + D (10) where the water molecules come from the 1E
      structure and the I, structure will act as a catalyst for the
      above reactions.<br>
      <br>
      Discussion of Basic Chemical Reactions - Non- Water<br>
      Let us come to the class of reactions where water is not part of
      the reaction process where A, B, C and D are any chemicals and the
      1E structures, coming in vapor phase from an 1E structured water,
      act as a catalyst without being consumed in the reactions.<br>
      <br>
      One such reaction is:<br>
      2CO + 02 o 2C 2 (11)<br>
      The carbon monoxide combines with oxygen to produce carbon
      dioxide. This reaction is particularly important in the reduction
      in pollution from the exhaust gas of a car engine. The addition of
      1E crystals into the car engine will facilitate the above
      reactions in the following way. The 1E crystal attracts both the
      carbon monoxide and the oxygen to its surface due to its electric
      dipole moment. The large electric dipole moment will induce the
      oxygen molecule electric dipole moment so that the oxygen molecule
      will be attracted to the 1F crystal.Carbon monoxide has its own
      permanent electric dipole moment and will be attracted to the IE
      crystal so that the carbon monoxide and oxygen molecules will
      spend much more time in close proximity than would otherwise occur
      if the IE crystal were not present leading to a rapid increase in
      the oxidation rate of the carbon monoxide. The kinetic energies of
      CO and 2 attracted to the 1F crystal will be increased greatly,
      and hence increase their reaction rate. Thus the IE crystals serve
      as a catalyst to reduce carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      It is sometimes more convenient to use structured solids now
      called SE structured solids. See previous patent application
      numbers 08/182,410 and 08/217,042 to find details on the creation
      of such structured solids. The SE structured solids also have a
      large electric dipole moment like the IE crystal, hence it is also
      possible to substitute the above functions of the IE crystal in
      enhancing the rate of chemical reactions of the type:<br>
      A+B X C+D (12)<br>
      A particular device of this type would be a catalytic converter in
      a car where currently platinum, rhodium, palladium and other
      precious metals are now used. These precious metals can be
      substituted by SE structured solids such as structured quartz or
      structured ceramic.The general reaction of SE structured solids
      is:<br>
      SE<br>
      A+B o C + D C+D+ +Z (13) where A,B,C and D etc. are chemicals.
      This is in the presence of SE structured solids which act as a
      catalyst in the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Operation of the Additive Invention<br>
      Operation of the invention is straightforward. First to prepare
      the fuel additive, a mixture is made up of 10% of 1E structured
      water and 90% of an organic solvent, such as ethyl alcohol, ethyl
      glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropyl alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      The mixture is shaken so that the organic solvent, having a strong
      dipole moment, is also altered in structure by the presence of 1E
      crystals in the 1E structured water. The fuel additive is then
      ready to be mixed with fuel such as gasoline, diesel or any other
      petroleum fuel product or to a solid fuel such as coal or coke.
      The mixing of the additive can be done in large volumes with a
      static mixer as shown in Figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      The additive is then added to the fuel as follows. Approximately 2
      ounces of the additive mixture is poured into a 20 gallon gasoline
      or diesel fuel tank, prior to refill.<br>
      <br>
      This is a ratio of 1000:1, so the amount of actual water being
      added is no more than 80 ppm, which is acceptable for both
      gasoline and diesels. The gasoline or diesel is then poured oGtop
      of the additive and the resulting mixing in the tank is sufficient
      to create the structures throughout the gasoline or diesel. Since
      these structures are small, in the micron and submicron range,
      they will pass readily through the fuel lines, fuel pump, fuel
      filters and injectors. On entering the combustion chamber, mixed
      in the fuel, the structures with their surface charge, enhance the
      combustion of fuel according to the reactions described in the
      previous sections.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to add the 1E crystal structured water directly to
      the fuel without a carrier liquid. The practical limit for water
      in gasoline and diesel, is approximately 500 ppm. This is more
      than sufficient for the catalytic reaction if the 1E crystals to
      significantly enhance the combustion process.<br>
      <br>
      Results on Testing of the Structured C'rystal Additive<br>
      In order to estimate the effect of the crystalline structured
      water on combustion processes a simple laboratory test was carried
      out, which allowed control of all relevant variables.<br>
      <br>
      Two sets of experiments were conducted in a temperature controlled
      flow reactor using methane and carbon monoxide as reactants in
      air. The first set of experiments were done with deionized water
      to establish the reference oxidation conversion for these gases.
      In the second set, experiments were conducted to determine the
      oxidation conversions in the presence of 11. structured water,
      relative to the experiments with the deionized water.<br>
      <br>
      In each set, the gases were passed through a bubbler, containing
      the water sample being tested, which was placed in a controlled
      temperature bath held at 70C The humidified gases from the bubbler
      were routed to a tubular reactor where combustion took place.
      Exhaust gasses from the reactor were sampled using a cooled probe
      and analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard 5990A),
      equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Figure 3 shows a
      layout of the test equipment. The first batch of tests were done,
      using 1.0% methane in air containing 2% oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      Residence/reaction time in the reactor was 0.5 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      At 800C reaction tube temperature, the results showed an increase
      in oxidation of the methane from 34.1% to 39.6% of the mainflow.
      This represents an increase of about 1 6% in the reaction level by
      use of the structured water additive.<br>
      <br>
      At 1.0% methane and 0.5% free oxygen and a residence time of 0.5
      seconds, the values of oxidation reaction with and without the
      structured water additive was 22.3% and 20.13% respectively. This
      shows a conversion increase of 11% in oxidation rate.<br>
      <br>
      At 1.0% carbon monoxide and 0.5% oxygen and the same 1000C
      temperature in the reactor tube, the conversion level was 72.7%
      and 62.2% with and without the fuel additive. This shows a
      conversion increase of 17%, consistent with earlier results.<br>
      <br>
      Production of Large Volumes of Structured Liquid<br>
      With reference to Figure I A "Streamlined Mass Production of
      Structured Liquid" the procedure to produce a large amount of
      structured liquid is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      We start by making a very dilute solution of 1E structured
      crystals as follows:<br>
      Dissolve a small amount of material, say 5 mg. salt, in one liter
      of polar liquid, say deionized water. This very dilute solution is
      placed in first tank T, and is denoted as Lj in Figure 1A. Then
      polar liquid such as deionized water, Lm is pumped through a pump
      P, and channeled to several outlets each of the outlets being
      controlled by a valve Vk, k=1,3 or 5. The flow rate R1 of the
      deionized water Lm is measured by a flow meter Fk, k= 1,3 or 5.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, dilute solution L; passes through and is controlled by
      a valve V2 Its flow rate R2 is measured by flow meter F2 In Figure
      IA it is seen that dilute solution Lj after passing through valve
      V2 and flow meter F2 will mix with that portion of deionized water
      Lm which passes through valve Vl and flow meter Fì. The two
      liquids are mixed at a fixed ratio, r= R2 / Rl where Rl is the
      flow rate of deionized water Lm passing through valve Vl, while R2
      is the flow rate of dilute solution Lj which has passed through
      valve V2 . The ratio rl can be 1/9, 1/99, 1/999 or 1/499, or any
      other number.A preferred range for r, is 1/3 to 1/100.<br>
      <br>
      The two solutions will be mixed in a first static mixer SM1. A
      common static mixer which is well known in the art, is screw-like
      in shape with a left-handed screw groove alternating with a
      right-handed screw groove. The two solutions Lj and Lm will be
      mixed in a turbulent flow inside the static mixer SM1. The static
      mixer SMI should be long enough so that the mixing time of the two
      liquids, Lj and Lm, in the static mixer SMI is more than several
      seconds. The mixed solution of Lj and Lm is now shown as L1 in
      Figure 1 and is directed to a separate second tank T2.The second
      tank marked T2 is necessary to provide some time for the mixed
      solution L1 to rest or settle into a stable solution. The mixed
      solution L1 should be allowed to dwell in tank T2 for a period of
      no less than one half hour.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter, the mixed and now-settled solution L1 now referred to
      as Lls, is channeled through a valve V4, and its flow rate R4 is
      measured by a flow meter F4. The liquid<br>
      L,s is to be mixed again with deionized water L, , that is the
      portion of deionized water Lm which has been channeled through
      valve V3 and flow meter F3. The two solutions are mixed at a ratio
      r2 = R4 / R3 where R4 is the flow rate of L,s through valve V4 and
      R3 is the flow rate of Lm through valve V3 Normally, r2 is set
      equal to r. The combined liquid is now denoted as L2 and passes
      through a second static mixer SM2 which is of the same type as the
      first static mixer SMI. The L2 liquid should also have a mixing
      time in SM2 of more than several seconds.Thereafter, the mixed
      solution L2, is directed to flow into a separate third tank T3.
      The mixed solution L2 should be allowed to settle or dwell in tank
      T3 for a period of no less than one half hour.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter, the mixed and now settled solution L2 now referred to
      as L2s, is channeled through a valve V6, and its flow rate R6 is
      measured by the flow meter F6. L2s is allowed to mix with
      deionized water L,, , that is that portion of Lm which passes
      through valve V5 at flow rate R5 as measured by flow meter F5. As
      in the previous two discussions, the two solutions are mixed in a
      third static mixer SM3 at a ratio r3<br>
      R6 / R5 with r3 set normally equal to r, which is the same as r2.
      However, in principle, all r can be set differently. Again, the
      two solutions should have a mixing time in the third static mixer
      SM3 of a period no less than several seconds. Static mixer SM3
      should be of the same sort as the previous static mixers.The
      liquid which passes out of the third static mixer SM3 may be the
      final structured water L0 or further mixing, dwelling, and
      dilutions as set forth in this and the previous steps may be
      undertaken. Further, instead of using the water which passes out
      of the third static mixer SM3 as the final structured water Lo,
      the liquid could pass to a further tank T4 to dwell for no less
      than one half hour and then used as the final output liquid L().<br>
      <br>
      We have shown only three steps of diluting and mixing, indicated
      by the three different tank containers Tt, T2 and T3 and the
      different solutions in them. However, more steps are contemplated;
      the stages can be repeated many times to get different dilutions
      as needed. We have discussed dwell times in the tank of one half
      hour.<br>
      <br>
      However, dwell time can be less or more but preferably should not
      be less than 15 minutes. It is understood that the flow regulating
      means, those being the valves and meters are adjustable to adjust
      the portion of one liquid that is mixed with another liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Production of Structured Alcohol<br>
      We can manufacture structured alcohol or any structured liquid in
      large volume with the same process as described in the preceding
      paragraphs, simply by replacing the deionized water Lm with any
      other polar liquid such as pure alcohol, i.e.<br>
      <br>
      Lm = alcohol = polar liquid<br>
      The end product Lo will be structured alcohol or any structured
      liquid. If we let r,= r2= r3= 1/9, the chemical composition of the
      final product Lc will contain 1/1000 water or other polar liquid
      and 99.9% alcohol or other polar liquid. If we let rl= r2= r3=
      1/99, then the chemical composition of final product L0 will be
      one part per million water or other polar liquid, and the rest is
      alcohol or other polar liquid.<br>
      <br>
      The strength of structured alcohol or structured liquid will
      depend on the strength of the structured water or liquid Lj one
      starts with. The stronger Li we have, the stronger the final
      liquid L0 is.<br>
      <br>
      Production ofStructured Fuel<br>
      Petroleum has a complex chemical composition. It contains may
      organic chemicals which have finite electric dipole moment. So any
      liquid fuel made out of petroleum contains at least some polar
      liquid, and can be made into structured liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Since alcohol is miscible either with gasoline or diesel fuel, one
      can use structured alcohol to prepare structured fuel in the same
      setup as shown in Figure 1A.<br>
      <br>
      In such an example, structured alcohol becomes L;, and the Lm is
      fuel, which could be gasoline, diesel, or liquefied gas. Then as
      the fuel Lin is mixed in various stages, the fuel Lem will become
      structured and comes out as L0 structured fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Production of Strong Structured Liquid<br>
      In the following, we describe a method of generating a strong
      structured liquid without any additional input other than the pure
      liquid itself. For exemplary purposes only, we use water as a
      specific example. However, any polar liquid could be used. Again,
      the flow regulating means, those are the valves and the flow
      meters, are adjustable to regulate the proportion of one fluid
      that is mixed with another fluid.<br>
      <br>
      The production system is illustrated in Figure 2A. The deionized
      water Lm is pumped through pump P through the system. Its flow
      rate R1 is controlled by valve<br>
      V, and measured with a flow meter F, Once deionized water Lm
      passes through valve Vl it is mixed with a strong structured water
      L1 stored in a first tank T1.<br>
      <br>
      Structured water L1 passes through valve V2 at rate R2 as measured
      by flow meter F2.<br>
      <br>
      It is after structured water L1 passes through valve V2 that it
      mixes with deionized water L,. The mixing ratio r= R2 / R, is
      adjustable by controlling valve V2 The ratio r can be 1/9, 1/99,
      1/999 or 1/499, or any other number. A preferred range for r is
      1/3 to 1/99.<br>
      <br>
      The mixed solution is mixed thoroughly and in a turbulent way, by
      static mixer SM, the same as described with respect to Figure 1A.
      Thus the fluid should mix in the static mixer SM for a period no
      less than several seconds. The new solution is called<br>
      L2 and is stored in a second tank T2, where it should dwell no
      less than 15 minutes and preferably at least one half hour. The
      majority of solution L2 will pass through a valve V4 as the final
      product Lo. A small part of the solution L2 will be channeled via
      valve V5 to a third tank T3, where the solution L2 is strengthened
      in one of the fashions discussed above. After the solution L2 is
      strengthened, it is fed back to first tank T1 as solution L1.<br>
      <br>
      To give a numerical estimate of the strength of structured water,
      we may use the relative transmission of the U.V. light through
      structured water with respect to deionized water. That relative
      transmission T has a value of 190 nm. T is defined by the
      following equation:<br>
      T = ts.w./td.i.<br>
      <br>
      where tS w = U.V. light transmission coefficient of structured
      water<br>
      td.i. = U.V. transmission coefficient of deionized water<br>
      For zero strength T= 100%, structured water is the same as
      deionized water, and has no structures at all. If there are
      structures in the water, T will be reduced.<br>
      <br>
      We shall use:<br>
      S=1-T at A=19Onm.<br>
      <br>
      to indicate the strength of structured water where S is the symbol
      for the strength of the structured water.<br>
      <br>
      The structured water L1 that we are going to mix with deionized
      water, say, has a strength S, = 94%. After mixing the L, with
      deionized water at a ratio r=1/4, that is one part L, with four
      parts deionized water Lrn, the mixed liquid L2 may have strength
      S2 = 44%. So the final product L0 that comes out from this process
      has a strength So= S2 = 44%. A small part of the solution L2 is
      fed back to be strengthened in T3.<br>
      <br>
      The solution L2 after passing through the strengthener in T3 will
      increase its strength from S2 = 44% to 94%. Such a stronger
      solution will be fed back to container L,.<br>
      <br>
      Thus the cycle is completed.<br>
      <br>
      With this latter method, the strength of output Lo will be
      constantly changing for a period, since a stronger and stronger L,
      is used as the cycle continues. This will continue until at a
      certain point the strength of L1 will peak. Preferably, the user
      will wish to operate the system until a peak strength output Lo is
      achieved and then use this output Lo.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, Figure 2A discloses only one step of mixing,
      diluting and dwelling.<br>
      <br>
      This may be altered to increase the number of steps depending on
      the degree of dilution desired and the peak number of structures
      desired in the output Leo .<br>
      <br>
      In both embodiments herein dwell tanks are described. These dwell
      tanks may act also as tanks which increase the aspects of the
      liquid which cause the liquid to absorb light waves in a range
      differing from that of normal water. Accordingly, the tanks may be
      constructed for both purposes. One fashion of doing this would be
      to line the tanks with glass. Another way would be to place glass
      marbles in the tanks.<br>
      <br>
      In both embodiments it is to be understood that the systems could
      be hooked directly to water systems in use in a building if the
      desire is to use water as the dilutant.<br>
      <br>
      Where deionized water is desired the water can be run through a
      deionizer to become Lm . Thus in such a situation, no tank for Lm
      would be needed. Instead a constant flow of water would be
      available, which flow would be controlled by known valve means.
      Containers for L1 through Ln and Lj need only accommodate the flow
      of Lm whether hooked into main water supplies, or supplied in
      large tanks. Thus tank sizes from one gallon to 5000 gallons may
      be considered for use. This is also true for the diameter of
      piping connecting all parts.It is preferred that the piping and
      parts contacting any of the fluid that contains L1 or L; not be
      metal or if metal, be lined inside with a non metallic material
      where that material contacts the fluid containing structures. Thus
      PVC pipe, glass pipe, ceramic pipe, plastic, glass or ceramic
      lined tanks and mixers are all preferred as liner materials, if
      metal pipes must be used, otherwise simply pipes of non metallic
      materials such as PVC are preferred.<br>
      <br>
      To comprehend the flow rates which the systems of Figures lA and
      2A can accommodate, the user can expect to produce 1 to 5000
      gallons per minute or more depending on pipe sizes used and size
      of tanks. An alternative to the use of large tanks say from 10 to
      1000 gallon tanks would be a plurality of parallel or series
      arranged tanks. As an example, instead of using for L2 a one
      thousand gallon tank, one could establish ten one hundred gallon
      tanks hooked preferably in parallel, although a series connection
      is also feasible, to serve as L2 In both figures, it is preferred
      that the systems are sealed to prevent contamination.<br>
      <br>
      Dwell tanks have been discussed in both figures In a modification,
      these tanks could be omitted altogether, thereby deleting the step
      of interrupting the process for a specified time for the fluids to
      dwell.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion, Ramifications and Scope of the Invention<br>
      <br>
      Disclosed herein is a compact vacuum distillation device for the
      distillation of liquids. The device comprises an evaporator (14)
      in which liquid is evaporated and a condenser (24) where the
      liquid is condensed, both evaporator (14) and condenser (24) units
      are contained within the same distiller vessel (42). A
      refrigeration cycle (14, 28, 24, 10) is used to supply heat to
      boil the liquid being distilled and to condense the vapor. The
      distiller vessel (42) also includes a novel heater vacuum
      generator (30, 32, 34) which creates a vacuum inside the vessel.
      This vacuum allows boiling of the liquids at a reduced temperature
      thus allowing the use of a refrigeration system as the heating and
      cooling source that reduces energy consumption. The device will
      produce distilled liquid at a cost less than 25 - 50 % of simple
      distillation. Due to the compact size and the use of the same
      components as a conventional refrigerator, this device can be
      integrated into the refrigerator system and produce distilled
      water.Thus the reader will see that the fuel additive of the
      invention is based on crystalline structures in water and
      therefore provides an environmentally friendly method for
      enhancing the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels.<br>

          <b>US6010599</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Disclosed herein is a compact vacuum distillation device for the
      distillation of liquids. The device comprises an evaporator (14)
      in which liquid is evaporated and a condenser (24) where the
      liquid is condensed, both evaporator (14) and condenser (24) units
      are contained within the same distiller vessel (42). A
      refrigeration cycle (14, 28, 24, 10) is used to supply heat to
      boil the liquid being distilled and to condense the vapor. The
      distiller vessel (42) also includes a novel heater vacuum
      generator (30, 32, 34) which creates a vacuum inside the vessel.
      This vacuum allows boiling of the liquids at a reduced temperature
      thus allowing the use of a refrigeration system as the heating and
      cooling source that reduces energy consumption. The device will
      produce distilled liquid at a cost less than 25 - 50 % of simple
      distillation. Due to the compact size and the use of the same
      components as a conventional refrigerator, this device can be
      integrated into the refrigerator system and produce distilled
      water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND--FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to vacuum distillation devices and
      specifically, to such devices that are compact and incorporate a
      refrigerant cycle and utilize components which result in low
      energy consumption.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND--PRIOR ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The process of distillation has long been in use for the
      production of clean water and other liquids. The water enters a
      boiler where it is evaporated. The steam then passes through a
      cooling chamber where it condenses to form droplets of pure water
      that pass to the distillate outlet. Distillation is the only water
      purification process that removes, with certainty any solids
      contained in the feedwater.<br>
      <br>
      There are a number of recognized disadvantages in the simple
      distillation system where water boils at 212 DEG F. The first is
      the energy consumption required to boil the water and to remove
      the excess heat from the condensate. Another practical
      disadvantage is the tendency to scaling that occurs at higher
      temperatures. In the case of large-scale distillation systems, a
      number of solutions have already been developed. For instance
      multistage distillation, where some of the latent heat of
      evaporation is recovered from one distillation stage to provide
      heat for the next stage. In each stage the pressure and therefore
      the boiling temperature drops.<br>
      <br>
      Another such solution is the use of a vapor compression
      distillation device that reduces even further the energy
      requirements of large scale distillation systems. In vapor
      compression distillation, the water is evaporated by boiling and
      the resulting vapor is then compressed, which increases the vapor
      pressure and therefore temperature.<br>
      <br>
      This vapor is then used to heat up the water in the boiler and in
      this manner, the latent heat is recovered. Once the vapor
      compression distillation cycle is started, little further heat is
      required and the only energy requirement is for the vapor
      compressor itself.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of small scale distillation systems, in the order of
      250 gallons per day or less, the capital costs of multistage
      distillation and vapor compression distillation make these
      alternatives unacceptable. Thus all small scale distillation
      systems use simple distillation at atmospheric pressure and
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention incorporates a number of improvements over
      conventional simple distillation, such as heat recovery using a
      refrigeration cycle. Also the present invention creates a vacuum
      without use of an expensive mechanical pump and combines the
      normally separate boiler and condenser into one integrated unit.<br>
      <br>
      The result of these innovations is a system that produces high
      purity distilled water in a batch process, for considerably less
      energy consumption than the simple distillation method. Also,
      another advantage of low temperature distillation is the
      elimination of scaling from the impurities that normally exist in
      water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>

      <br>
      <b>Explanation of how the Invention Works or Operates</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In order to explain the operation of the system we will describe
      the stand-alone version and the integrated versions in the
      following sections.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Stand-Alone Distillation System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The basic principle in the proposed batch process distillation
      stand-alone system is to boil water in the bottom of the vacuum
      container to generate steam which then passes to a condenser at
      the top of the vacuum container. The steam is then condensed to
      distilled water. The proposed distillation system is shown in
      detail, in FIG. 1b. The process of the invention can be divided
      into the following phases: water filling, vacuum generating,
      distillate producing, and distillate discharging.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1.1 Water Filling</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Since the invention involves a batch process the first step
      involves the filling of the distiller vessel (42) with water. To
      accomplish this, first open distillate/air outlet valve (44) and
      water inlet valve (36) and close drainage valve (38). Ensure that
      compressor (10) and heater element (32) are turned off. Fill up
      distiller vessel (42) with treated water through valve (36) until
      liquid level is above the vacuum generator heater element (32),
      then, close water inlet valve (36). The system has now been
      charged with water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1.2 Vacuum Generating</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following method of creating a vacuum replaces the need for an
      expensive vacuum pump and is based on a simple heating device
      which operates as follows: Turn on heater element (32) to generate
      steam, while the water is continuously supplied to the heater
      cavity, from connector tube (30). The steam generated by the
      heater element (32) also heats the refrigerant vapor inside the
      refrigerant evaporator (24) to a superheated state. In order to
      cool the superheated refrigerant, the heat exchanger (28) will
      reduce the superheated refrigerant temperature sufficiently, to
      allow the vacuum cycle to proceed.<br>
      <br>
      The vapor generated by heater element (32) is pushed out along
      with the air initially trapped in distiller vessel (42), through
      distillate/air outlet valve (44), connector tube (46), and
      distillate reservoir (50) and is finally released from the top air
      discharge vent (48) of distillate reservoir (50). Some vapor will
      be condensed in distillate reservoir (50) when some cold
      distillate exists.<br>
      <br>
      The inside of distiller vessel (42) is lined with a insulator
      liner (43) to reduce the condensation of steam on its surface
      which would stop the steam from displacing air from the vessel.
      The steam generated by heater element (32) will dilute the air in
      distiller vessel (42) until after a few minutes, the container is
      eventually filled almost entirely with steam. Then distillate/air
      outlet valve (44) is closed and heater element (32) is turned off.<br>
      <br>
      From this point on, the pressure in the distiller vessel (42) will
      correspond to the steam temperature. When the refrigerant
      compressor (10) is turned on, steam pressure in the distiller
      vessel (42) will drop down with steam temperature, thus achieving
      the vacuum condition during operation of the device. This device
      will produce vacuum conditions in the range of (27-29)"Hg. This
      occurs even though the incoming water has not been degassed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1.3 Distillate Producing</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The process of distillate production in a stand-alone device is
      presented in two parts as follows<br>
      1.3.1 Water evaporating and refrigerant condensing and<br>
      1.3.2 Steam condensing and refrigerant evaporating.<br>
      <br>
      These are both described in detail in the following subsections.<br>
      1.3.1 Water Evaporating and Refrigerant Condensing<br>
      <br>
      The compressor (10) is now turned on and the superheated
      refrigerant vapor is discharged from the compressor (10). The
      refrigerant superheated vapor is routed to the top portion of the
      refrigerant condenser (14), which is a tube coil extending from
      the point (12) to point (18). The refrigerant condenser coil (14)
      is divided into two portions. The top portion of the coil (14) is
      contained inside the cylindrical portion of shroud (16) and the
      bottom portion of the coil (14) is covered by the disk-shaped
      portion of shroud (16). The batch of water is heated by the
      refrigerant under vacuum conditions.<br>
      <br>
      The water is preheated at the bottom portion of the refrigerant
      condenser (14) and continues to heat up to the top portion of the
      condenser (14). Water that is 1-2 inches below the water level,
      reaches a superheated condition and creates a steam/water mixture.
      The steam/water mixture bursts out from inside of the top portion
      of the shroud (16) and hits the vapor separator (34).<br>
      <br>
      The steam rises through the vapor separator (34) to the
      refrigerant evaporator I (24), while the water falls down to the
      outside of the shroud (16). Due to the density difference between
      steam and liquid, the water outside the top of the cylindrical
      portion of shroud (16) is forced downwards and then feeds under
      the bottom plate portion of the shroud (16) and then rises up the
      inside of the cylindrical part of the shroud (16). This enhanced
      circulation heat transfer device raises the convection heat
      transfer between the water and the refrigerant.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the refrigerant is continuously condensed to a low
      vapor ratio state by the water. The low vapor ratio saturated
      refrigerant is then routed to the radiator (20) and continuously
      condenses to a liquid state.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1.3.2 Steam Condensing/refrigerant Evaporating</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The refrigerant now flows through the refrigerant pressure
      reducing device I (22) (e.g. expansion valve or capillary tube),
      into the refrigerant evaporator I (24). The liquid refrigerant
      temperature drops markedly during the expansion process and the
      refrigerant becomes a low vapor ratio saturated mixture.<br>
      <br>
      The refrigerant evaporating temperature is selected above 32 DEG
      F. for water to prevent freezing. The refrigerant inside the
      refrigerant evaporator I (24), absorbs energy from the steam and
      the refrigerant evaporator I (24) acts as an evaporating tube to
      evaporate the refrigerant.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the steam releases energy and is condensed on the
      outside of the refrigerant evaporator I (24) which acts as a
      condenser for the steam in the distiller vessel (42). The
      condensate falls down to the distillate collector (40). The
      refrigerant routes into the heat exchanger (28) which extends from
      point (26) to the inlet of the compressor (10). All refrigerant
      leaving the heat exchanger should be in single-phase vapor form.<br>
      <br>
      The refrigerant leaving the heat exchanger (28), passes through
      the suction line (29) to the compressor (10). Here the compression
      process occurs. The high-pressure vapor then passes through the
      discharge line to the refrigerant condenser (14), thereby
      completing the vapor compression refrigeration cycle.<br>
      <br>
      The above refrigeration cycle can also be replaced by an
      absorption refrigeration cycle. The absorption refrigeration cycle
      is different from the vapor compression refrigeration cycle as it
      uses thermal energy instead of mechanical energy to make a change
      in the conditions necessary to complete a refrigeration cycle.<br>
      <br>
      The use of a refrigeration cycle creates a performance increase by
      the ratio of the amount of energy released from the refrigerant
      evaporator I(24) divided by the energy input to the refrigerant
      compressor (10), thus creating a significant energy saving when
      compared to a simple distillation system.<br>
      <br>
      The distilled water production is continuous from the above
      described water distillation loop until the distillate collector
      (40) is filled.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1.4 Distillate Discharging</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The next part of the batch distillation process is discharge of
      the distillate from the collector into an external reservoir.
      First open drainage valve (38) which allows air to enter the
      system and break the vacuum. The distillate outlet valve (44) is
      now opened and the distillate is discharged by gravity to the
      distillate reservoir (50). The next cycle will restart at this
      point.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Distillation System Integrated into a Standard Household
        Refrigerator.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are two basic preferred embodiments, for integration of the
      invention into a household refrigerator as described in sections
      2.1 and 2.2 below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.1 Water Distillation Device with Refrigerant Evaporator</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This system is composed of two loops, one is the water
      distillation loop and the other is the refrigeration loop. In the
      case of the water distillation loop it is the same as described in
      section 1.3 above. In the second case the refrigeration loop is
      controlled by means of three 3-way valves (54), (56) and (62).
      Thus the refrigerant leaving the compressor (10) to the radiator
      (20) and through the refrigerant pressure reducing device II (58)
      enters the refrigerator evaporator II (60) to complete the
      refrigeration cycle.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.2 Water Distillation Device without a Refrigerant Evaporator.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This embodiment is the same as that described in detail in section
      2.1 above except the refrigerant evaporator I (24) is deleted and
      the refrigerant is routed into the refrigerator evaporator II (60)
      and the top of the distiller vessel (42) acts as the steam
      condenser when it is cooled by cold air supplied from the
      refrigerator evaporator II (60).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary, Ramifications and Scope</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Accordingly, the reader will see that the compact vacuum
      distillation device of this invention can be used to produce
      distilled water with significantly reduced energy consumption when
      compared with simple distillation systems. The compact vacuum
      distillation system has the additional advantages in that:<br>
      it permits the reduction of energy consumption to less than
      (25-50)% of simple distillation systems<br>
      the size of the vacuum distillation system is reduced due to the
      combining of the water evaporator and steam condenser into one
      vessel and the generation of enhanced convection by use of a
      shroud in the water evaporator.<br>
      it utilizes a device for creation of a vacuum without the use of a
      vacuum pump, thus allowing use of a refrigeration cycle as a
      heating source for producing steam.<br>
      the use of the heater vacuum generating device reduces the overall
      size of the unit.<br>
      it reduces the formation of scaling due to the lower boiling
      temperature thus eliminating the need for descaling or the use of
      descalant chemicals.<br>
      the design is easily integrated into a conventional refrigerator
      where the refrigerator's condensing and evaporating components can
      be made integral with same components in the device.<br>
      it allows the use of lower-cost materials due to the lower
      temperatures used.<br>
      it makes the device inherently more safe too use and operate due
      to the lower boiling temperature created by the vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      While the above description contains many specificities, these
      should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the
      invention, but rather as an exemplification of one preferred
      embodiment thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Many other variations are possible. For example, the vessel can
      have many other volumetric shapes such as oval, circular, square,
      etc. and the liquid to be distilled can be other than water such
      as ethylene glycol, sea water, etc.<br>
