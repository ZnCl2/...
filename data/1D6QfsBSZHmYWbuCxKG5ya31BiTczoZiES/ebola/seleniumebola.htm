            Pathogenesis and Viral Outbreaks?</b></big><br>

      <b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      A theoretical analysis of the genomic structure of the Ebola virus
      Zaire strain reveals the existence of several open reading frames
      (ORFs) containing large numbers of inframe UGA codons. This
      clustering of UGA codons is very unlikely to have arisen by
      chance, and raises the possibility that these ORFs may encode
      selenoproteins, since, in addition to its usual role as a stop
      codon, UGA can under certain conditions encode selenocysteine. The
      other major requirement for selenocysteine insertion at UGA codons
      appears to be met in this case, due to the presence of
      selenocysteine insertion sequences (SECIS) in stable stem-loop
      structures in the appropriate Ebola Zaire mRNAs. Specifically,
      there is a SECIS in the 3’untranslated region of the nucleoprotein
      mRNA, where the largest potential selenoproteins are encoded, one
      of which may contain up to 16 selenium atoms per molecule. The
      expression of this hypothetical protein could impose an
      unprecedented selenium demand upon the host, potentially leading
      to severe lipid peroxidation and cell membrane destruction. This
      could also contribute to the characteristic hemorrhaging caused by
      intravascular blood clotting, due to the thrombotic effect of Se
      deficiency. The possibility that this gene might contribute to the
      extreme pathogenicity of the Zaire strain of Ebola virus by this
      mechanism is also consistent with the observation that this
      potential selenoprotein gene is not present in the Ebola Reston
      strain, which was not pathogenic in humans. <br>

      <div align="center"><b>Resolving Cytokine Storms with Selenium</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The highly pathogenic Zaire strain of the Ebola virus may be
      dependent on the trace mineral selenium (Se), due to the presence
      in the Ebola genome of several open reading frames (ORFs)
      containing clusters of up to 17 inframe UGA codons, which
      potentially encode the rare amino acid selenocysteine (SeC). This
      raises the possibility that Se deficiency in host populations may
      actually foster viral replication, possibly triggering outbreaks
      linked and perhaps even facilitating the emergence of more
      virulent viral strains. [2]<br>
      <br>
      Selenium is a strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory that can
      control the cytokine storms provoked from out of control
      infections. The clinical investigations in sepsis studies indicate
      that higher doses of selenium are well tolerated as continuous
      infusions of selenium as sodium selenite (4,000 µg selenium as
      sodium selenite pentahydrate on the first day, 1,000 µg
      selenium/day on the nine following days) and had no reported
      toxicity issues. In view of this new information, Biosyn
      introduced the 1,000 µg dose vials for such high selenium clinical
      usage.<br>
      <br>
      The primary symptoms of a cytokine storms are high fever, swelling
      and redness, extreme fatigue and nausea. In Ebola a combination of
      factors lead to death so we chose a combination approach that
      deals with all the factors.&nbsp; In Ebola the immune reaction may
      be fatal with cytokine storms. To stop the cytokine storms and
      acute respiratory distress inject selenium or force the world of
      medicine to produce Dr. Emanuel Revici’s liposomal selenium, which
      can be administered orally in extraordinarily high dosages, much
      higher than is available through injections.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Revici’s greatest discovery was that if we want to deliver a
      nutrient to a sick cell – attach it to a fat.&nbsp; Unsaturated
      fats are the ultimate and perfect vehicle to deliver nutrients to
      stressed cells.&nbsp; This discovery enabled Dr. Revici to package
      therapeutic minerals, at will, to delivery only to sick cells.
      This gave him a huge advantage as a therapy developer – especially
      with selenium.<br>
      <br>
      Revici used a special molecular form of selenium
      (bivalent-negative selenium) incorporated in a molecule of fatty
      acid. In this form, he can administer up to 1 gram of selenium per
      day, which corresponds to 1 million micrograms per day, reportedly
      with no toxic side effects. In contrast, too much selenite
      (hexavalent-positive selenium) has toxic effects on animals, so
      human intake of commercial selenite is limited to a dosage of only
      100 to 150 micrograms by mouth. Dr. Revici often administered his
      nontoxic form of selenium by injection, usually considered to be
      four times more powerful than the form given orally.<br>
      <br>
      The last 25 years the average daily selenium intake has fallen
      from 60µg/day to 35µg/day.&nbsp; The UK government has established
      a Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) level of selenium at
      75µg/day.&nbsp; Therefore a nutritional gap now exists between the
      actual recommended level of daily selenium and what people are
      actually achieving through their diets.[3]<br>
      <br>
      I believe I am the only doctor who has written a book on Selenium.
      I have safely used dosages on myself of a special form of selenium
      100 times what would normally be thought of as rational to great
      effect. Selenium influences both the innate, "non-adaptive" and
      the acquired, "adaptive" immune systems[4]-[5]-[6]-[7]-[8] The
      innate immune system includes barriers to infection and
      nonspecific effector cells such as macrophages. Both the T and B
      lymphocytes form the major effector cells of the acquired system
      that mature with exposure to immune challenges.<br>
      <br>
      Selenium-deficient lymphocytes are less able to proliferate in
      response to mitogen, and in macrophages, leukotriene B4 synthesis,
      which is essential for neutrophil chemotaxis, is impaired by this
      deficiency. These processes can be improved by selenium
      supplementation. The humoral system is also affected by selenium
      deficiency; for example, IgM, IgG and IgA titers are decreased in
      rats, and IgG and IgM titers are decreased in humans. In
      endothelial cells from asthmatics, there is a marked selenium
      deficiency that results in an increase in expression of adhesion
      molecules, which causes greater adhesion of neutrophils.[9]<br>
      <br>
      Selenium is also involved in several key metabolic activities
      through its selenoprotein enzymes that protect against oxidative
      damage.[10] Further, selenium deficiency may allow invading
      viruses to mutate and cause longer-lasting, more severe
      illness.[11] Animal research has shown selenium and vitamin E have
      synergistic effects, enhancing the body’s response to
      bacterial[12] and parasitic infections.[13]<br>
      <br>
      In that selenium is a potent immune stimulator is an 18-month
      study of 262 patients with AIDS that found those who took a daily
      capsule containing 200 micrograms of selenium ended up with lower
      levels of the AIDS virus and more health-giving CD4 immune system
      cells in their bloodstreams than those taking a dummy pill.<br>
      <br>
      These AIDS patients who took selenium were able to suppress the
      deadly virus in their bodies and boost their fragile immune
      systems, adding to evidence that selenium has healing powers we
      need to pay attention to in treating Ebola patients.[14] Those
      with severely compromised immune systems due to AIDS had
      dramatically better immune system response with selenium
      supplementation and this finding is consistent with the
      information presented by the NIH on their selenium web site.<br>

            Exciting Research from Dr. Will Taylor</b></big><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>
      <div align="center"><b>By Richard A. Passwater, Ph.D.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      You are witnessing a scientific breakthrough develop from theory
      to public health practice. In November 1994, Dr. Will Taylor,
      Associate Professor in the Department of Medicinal Chemistry at
      the University of Georgia, explained his hypothesis that opened
      new inroads into possibly controlling many viruses including AIDS,
      Ebola and even several "more-routine" viruses. Last month, Dr.
      Marianna Baum of the University of Miami discussed her published
      results with selenium and HIV/AIDS. We didn't discuss her latest
      results because they had not yet been peer-reviewed for
      publication, but I can tell you that they are very exciting. Dr.
      Orville Levander of the USDA has published his latest findings
      with selenium and viruses. These three aspects of research with
      selenium and human viruses recently gained interest at an
      International Conference on the subject held in Germany in April.<br>
      <br>
      As one who has conducted laboratory research with selenium and
      other antioxidants for more than 35 years, I can attest to the
      scientific and public health importance of this "new direction" in
      virus research. I don't believe that I have used that terminology
      to describe completely new concepts since my 1973 publication,
      "Cancer: New Directions," in which I reported my laboratory
      research showing that selenium and other antioxidants reduce the
      incidence of cancers. [American Laboratory 5(6) 10-22 (1973)] By
      the way, an upcoming chat with Dr. Larry Clark will discuss his
      clinical trial which found that selenium supplements can cut the
      cancer death rate in half.<br>
      <br>
      Let's chat again with Dr. Taylor to see how his new theory has had
      an effect on AIDS and viral research. It is not necessary to
      understand the technical aspects of the theory, just that, as his
      analogy illustrates, that selenium can be a birth control pill to
      some deadly viruses. If you are interested in the details of his
      theory, please refer to our November 1994 discussion which
      describes it in detail.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: Dr. Taylor, it has only been two years since we
      discussed your exciting new theory about selenium and HIV, but
      thanks to your new concept, a lot of important and exciting
      related findings have resulted in that relatively brief time as
      research goes. Not only has selenium and AIDS research leaped
      ahead, but research with selenium on many viruses from the rare
      Ebola to the common flu has produced dramatic findings.<br>
      <br>
      Are you pleased with the way in which some researchers are
      comprehending the significance of your research on the role of
      selenium in limiting the spread of at least some viruses? Or are
      you disappointed that more scientists have failed to look into
      this relationship?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: There certainly are a lot of exciting developments about
      selenium and viruses, some of which is new work and some of which
      is research that is only now gaining the attention it deserves,
      even though it was done a few years back. I am referring to the
      use of selenium to treat an Ebola-like hemorrhagic fever that
      broke out in China in the late 1980s. Hemorrhagic fevers can kill
      up to 90 percent of those infected, but this study showed that
      selenium supplementation can reduce that mortality rate
      dramatically. But let's talk about that later.<br>
      <br>
      From my perspective, however, I'd honestly have to say that
      despite the accumulation of supporting evidence, it has been
      somewhat frustrating to me that few major virology groups have
      made any attempt, let alone a serious effort, to rigorously prove
      or disprove what I now call the "viral selenoprotein theory." In
      essence that hypothesis, first proposed in my 1994 paper, is the
      idea that certain viruses (initially HIV, other retroviruses, and
      also some strains of Coxsackievirus) may interact directly with
      selenium in host cells by incorporating selenium into viral
      proteins. This would mean that the role of selenium deficiency in
      some viral diseases might be far more complex than previously
      thought - and believe me, the potential roles of selenium and
      other antioxidants in the body's defenses against infectious
      disease are already very complicated, even without this
      possibility.<br>
      <br>
      On the positive side, a number of studies have recently come out
      or are being prepared for publication (Allavena et al. 1995,
      Constans et al. 1995, Look et al. in press, Baum et al. in
      preparation), confirming that low serum or plasma selenium is a
      highly significant correlate of HIV disease progression, and a
      risk factor for mortality. While this does not prove anything
      about the MECHANISMS involved, there seems to be more going on
      here than a simple nutritional effect, and these observations are
      consistent with my 1994 prediction, based on theoretical genomic
      evidence, that dietary selenium might inhibit HIV replication and
      slow disease progression. Of course, based on his studies of the
      mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), a retrovirus relative of HIV,
      Dr. Gerhard Schrauzer had already predicted over ten years ago
      that selenium would have an anti-HIV effect. So he has had to be
      far more patient than I have so far, in waiting to see his idea
      rigorously tested.<br>
      <br>
      The most encouraging development on the clinical side is the
      long-overdue initiation of some rigorous clinical studies of
      selenium supplementation in HIV patients. These include a study by
      Dr. Marianna Baum in Miami, and a study in African AIDS patients
      that is being set up by Prof. Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur
      Institute, who recently told me that he thought the data on
      selenium and HIV are now sufficiently compelling as to justify
      such a study. I find that very gratifying, particularly since most
      AIDS patients in impoverished nations in Africa and elsewhere are
      unlikely to receive any of the expensive new antiviral drugs, like
      the HIV protease inhibitors. In those countries, all they can
      realistically hope for is inexpensive ways of slowing down the
      disease until a vaccine is found- and there is nothing I know of
      that can do this that is cheaper than selenium!<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: Dr. Montagnier is the discoverer of HIV. Our readers
      may wish to review his research in the September 1995 issue. When
      I visited Dr. Montagnier in his Pasteur Institute Laboratory, I
      handed him our 1994 article and he became very interested in your
      theory. Also, I used that article to introduce your theory to Dr.
      Baum and she became very interested in your theory as she
      commented in last month's column.<br>
      <br>
      Are clinical researchers better understanding the significance of
      the role of selenium acting directly on viruses themselves, as
      opposed to protecting the host via such mechanisms as stimulating
      the immune system?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: It has been my impression that there has been a lot of
      interest in my research among practitioners of holistic or
      alternative medicine, and M.D.s who appreciate the value of
      prevention and nutritional approaches to therapy, but that
      "mainstream" HIV clinicians are less likely to have heard of it,
      or indeed to place much hope in any type of nutritional
      supplementation approach. Thanks to a story in Dr. Jonathan
      Wright's excellent newsletter, "Nutrition and Healing", I have
      been invited to present these concepts to a large group of M.D.s
      at a meeting of the "American College for Advancement in Medicine"
      in Tampa, Fl, next spring.<br>
      <br>
      There is no doubt that part of what is catching these people's
      attention is the idea that selenium may have a direct effect on
      some viruses, rather than merely a non-specific immune-boosting
      effect. However, it's the whole story - putting my findings in the
      context of the various Chinese selenium studies, the work of Drs.
      Levander and Beck, Dr. Schrauzer, and so on - that is so
      intriguing.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: There is no doubt that you will have an interested
      audience at the ACAM Conference. These medical practitioners are
      very familiar with selenium. In addition to the clinical studies
      that you mentioned, linking selenium status to HIV disease
      progression, what are some of the specific new developments that
      you can point to as support for your "viral selenoprotein theory"?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: There is not as much as I'd like, because in many ways the
      theory has hardly been tested. However, we can say with
      considerable confidence that there is now virtually no doubt that
      some viruses can make selenoproteins - it's more a matter of which
      viruses can do it. This statement is possible because Dr. Bernard
      Moss, a scientist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
      recently reported the complete DNA sequence of a common wart
      virus, the pox virus Molluscum contagiosum. This virus appears to
      encode a gene that is 80% identical to the known mammalian
      selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase (GPx). So far he's only done
      what I have for HIV: show the potential gene is there by
      theoretical analysis. But with such an unmistakable match to a
      known selenoprotein, there's no reason to doubt that this is a
      real GPx gene.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, we have now demonstrated GPx-like sequences in
      Coxsackie B virus, the viral cofactor for Keshan disease, and the
      subject of the now famous Levander and Beck studies. If our
      readers will bear with me for just a moment, I want to point out
      to our technical readers that other developments include a
      published experimental verification of an RNA "pseudoknot" that we
      predicted in HIV, in vitro experimental verification in my lab of
      a novel frameshift site in HIV associated with a conserved UGA
      codon, and most recently, from the lab of a collaborating
      virologist, immuno-histochemical evidence in patient samples for
      some novel HIV protein variants that I predicted. Finally, in the
      test tube, selenium has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of HIV
      reactivation from latently infected cells. In summary: still no
      absolute direct proof that a virus can make a selenoprotein, but
      an increasingly strong body of favorable circumstantial evidence.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: When we discussed the mechanisms you elucidated and
      presented in your hypothesis, we also included a glossary for the
      non-virologists. Just so our non-virologists don't have to go back
      to that article or reach for their scientific dictionary, a codon
      is a three-letter code in DNA or RNA that directs insertion of an
      amino acid into proteins, a frameshift is a shift into a new
      protein coding region, a pseudoknot is an RNA structure that
      promotes frameshifts, and UGA not only stands for the University
      of Georgia but either a "stop" signal for protein synthesis or for
      selenocysteine insertion.<br>
      <br>
      As I mentioned, I have had the pleasure of introducing your
      research to several clinical investigators, yet, I am still
      struggling to get the concept across to many nutritionists and
      clinical researchers who are not overly familiar with stop codons,
      frame shifts and pseudoknots. I have the advantage of getting help
      from my youngest son, Michael, when it comes to complex modern
      virology. You may recall that the fact that my oldest son,
      Richard, graduated from the University of Georgia that led me to
      your earlier research. Rich and I deal with antioxidants more than
      viruses. Now I find it ironical that what seems like just a few
      years ago that Mike asked, "Hey, Dad, what's DNA?" Now, I have to
      ask, "Hey Mike, why do RNA-based viruses mutate more than
      DNA-based viruses? Or "Why do the HIV family of viruses have the
      highest mutation rates among a family (retroviruses) of viruses
      with high mutation rates?"<br>
      <br>
      Mike pointed out that the fleets of enzymes which check, double
      check, and transcribe DNA are at least as important as the DNA
      itself. RNA is not protected as well. Perhaps it would help
      clarify your findings if I lead you through the same line of
      questioning that Mike led me through when we first discussed your
      research. Could you briefly explain the significance of UGA codons
      in your findings on HIV, and how that may relate to the role of
      the known Selenium-containing antioxidant enzyme you mentioned
      earlier, glutathione peroxidase (GPx)?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: In essence, the UGA codon is the selenium link because it
      can direct the insertion of selenocysteine into proteins, an
      alternative to its more common role as a "stop" signal. We showed
      that in regions of HIV-1 that were presumed to be inactive or
      non-coding, UGA codons are "conserved," i.e. found in almost all
      isolates of HIV-1. Along with other structural features we
      identified, these observations suggested that the virus might
      encode selenoproteins in several such regions.<br>
      <br>
      That was a radical suggestion because apparently no one had ever
      seriously considered the possibility that viruses might encode
      selenoproteins, which were believed to be very rare. Only about
      five mammalian selenoproteins were known at the time, although
      several more have already been found, and now some leading
      researchers in this field of research believe that many more
      probably exist. GPx is the prototypical selenoprotein, and is an
      essential antioxidant enzyme in living systems, used to break down
      harmful peroxides, to maintain cell membrane integrity, and to
      generally reduce the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species.<br>
      <br>
      A deeper question is, what would a virus - say M. contagiosum or
      Coxsackievirus - gain by encoding a GPx? There could be many
      answers to that question. One is that it is now known that the
      immune system uses free radicals as part of the process of
      programmed cell death (apoptosis), which is also one of the
      mechanisms used to kill off cells infected with viruses. Thus, a
      viral GPx could serve a defensive function for the virus, by
      countering that process and at the same time keeping the host cell
      alive - again reminding us that viruses don't necessarily want
      their host cells to die.<br>
      <br>
      Oxidative stress is also known to activate the replication of many
      viruses, especially HIV, so increasing the levels of either a host
      or a viral GPx could act to inhibit viral replication. Thus, a
      viral GPx could also serve as a repressor of viral replication,
      similar to what I proposed for one of the hypothetical
      selenoproteins in HIV, although that one is not a GPx.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: Regarding the potential role of selenium in viruses
      such as HIV, Ebola and Coxsackie, would a reduced level of
      selenium-containing enzymes countering the transcription and/or
      integration process contribute to the high mutation rate
      characteristic of these RNA viruses?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: There are several things going on here. First, as you
      mentioned, RNA viruses lack the "editing" or error correcting
      enzymes characteristic of the DNA based replication machinery of
      higher organisms. Furthermore, RNA is more chemically reactive and
      unstable than DNA. Thus, RNA viruses are inherently more
      mutation-prone even than DNA viruses, and far more than their
      DNA-based hosts. This can be advantageous for a virus because by
      mutating it can increase its ability to evade the host immune
      system.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, anything that slows down the replication rate of such
      viruses will reduce their ability to mutate, because mutants are
      just "sloppy copies": no copies, no mutants. That is why in the
      chemotherapy of AIDS, high drug levels are used, to reduce viral
      replication almost to zero: otherwise, resistant viral mutants
      will rapidly emerge and the drugs won't block them. As far as the
      potential role of selenoenzymes in this, we do know that selenium
      somehow boosts the immune system, and cellular immunity in
      particular, which should help keep viral replication in check. But
      in regard to how viral selenoproteins may act, this area is so new
      that we don't have any hard data; all we really have are some
      "educated guesses" like the repressor hypothesis I mentioned
      earlier.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: Wouldn't increasing the selenium concentration in a
      virally-infected cell cause an increase in host selenoenzymes as
      well as in viral selenoenzymes?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: Since the same pool of selenocysteine is involved, one
      would expect that levels of both host and viral selenoenzymes
      would increase if more selenium was available. This touches on an
      aspect of my findings that many people have had difficulty with
      from the beginning. Many people wonder: if the virus uses or
      "needs" selenium, then why would taking selenium slow viral
      activity - wouldn't that "feed" the virus?<br>
      <br>
      The answer to this is, first of all, selenium is more essential
      for us than it is for the virus. So if selenium becomes depleted,
      we suffer far worse consequences than the virus. Secondly, it also
      depends on how the virus uses selenium in its selenoprotein. I
      explained above how a viral GPx could act to inhibit viral
      replication. Thus, I have proposed that in some cases a virus
      might use such a protein in a negative feedback loop, i.e. as a
      repressor. That would permit the virus to respond to conditions of
      low selenium in the cell - which could be a signal of impending
      cell death - by replicating at a higher rate, to "escape" from
      that cell.<br>
      <br>
      For example, under appropriate conditions, HIV is known to remain
      in cells for long periods of time, either in a latent state or
      only replicating at a very low level. Selenium-based mechanisms
      could help regulate that state.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: You are right about many people asking why "feeding"
      the virus selenium is a good thing. They wonder if it would not be
      better to starve the virus. Nutritionists and clinicians tend to
      think of selenium in terms of nourishment, but in this case you
      are not talking about selenium for the nourishment of the virus.
      Even cancer researchers sometimes miss a similar point when they
      focus strictly on nutrients and tumor status instead of the more
      important question of nutrients and immune system status Your
      explanation will help more scientists that are non-virologists get
      the point!<br>
      <br>
      In my lectures, I have used your comment about it's really not in
      the best interest of viruses to kill their hosts, because the
      viruses will also die. That is, unless they can jump ship (host)
      by spreading to their next victim. As you said, but I want to
      repeat it, the important point is that selenium is not really
      feeding the virus, but is used by the virus to determine the
      health of the host. If the infected cell (and thus the host) is
      well nourished and not in immediate danger of dying there is no
      urgent need for the virus to invade new cells.<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: Perhaps it would help some of our lay readers if instead
      of thinking of selenium as nourishment or food for the virus, they
      would think of selenium as being part of a birth control pill for
      viruses. The viruses don't need selenium for survival so much as
      for growth regulation.I already explained how a viral GPx or other
      selenoprotein can inhibit viral replication by reducing oxidant
      tone in the cell: remember that oxidative stress activates HIV. So
      a very simple analogy would be that a viral selenoprotein could
      act as a viral birth control pill, inhibiting viral reproduction
      when selenium is abundant. Of course, at the same time selenium is
      boosting the immune system and having other beneficial effects in
      the host. But when selenium levels are too low, we not only have a
      weakened immune system, the viral birth control is reduced, and
      the virus replicates at higher levels. This obviously makes sense
      for the virus, because this is the best time for it to break out -
      when the i<br>
      mmune system is weakened by selenium deficiency. Thus, by
      strengthening the immune system with high selenium/antioxidant
      levels, the virus is forced to maintain a low profile. In essence,
      this analogy explains what a repressor mechanism is, using the
      "birth control" concept.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: Does increasing the selenium concentration in the
      HIV-infected stabilize the HIV genome?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: Slowing viral replication rate reduces the opportunity to
      mutate, which is what is meant by "stabilizing" the viral genome.
      Since oxidative stress is known to activate HIV transcription,
      selenium supplementation will reduce HIV replication activity,
      simply as a consequence of increased cellular GPx levels. That has
      been proved in cell culture studies (Sappey et al. 1994).
      Furthermore, by protecting against oxidative free radical damage
      to RNA and DNA, increased dietary Selenium would directly reduce
      mutation rate. But the possible contributions or roles of viral
      selenoproteins in these processes still need to be elucidated.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: If the HIV genome is stabilized, does this give the
      immune system a more steady target that it can destroy with a
      "traditional" response?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: Certainly, if the ability of the virus to mutate is
      impaired or slowed, it will be easier for the immune system to
      neutralize it, because it will be less of a "moving target".<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: Does increasing the selenium concentration in
      HIV-infected cells stimulate the immune system? In uninfected
      cells?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: As you know, there is a remarkably extensive body of
      literature showing that dietary selenium is critical for a healthy
      immune system, and that selenium potentiates various aspects of
      cellular immunity, such as T-cell proliferation responses, and the
      action of the cytokine interleukin 2. I think only a part of this
      can be explained by known human selenoproteins like GPx, and we
      really have a lot to learn about howselenium produces its
      immune-stimulating effects. This statement is supported by the
      fact that according to an early study by McConnell using
      radio-labeled selenium in immune cells, only about 20% of the
      total selenium content is contained in GPx. So selenium is
      probably doing important things in those cells that we still don't
      understand.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: I believe it was a 1959 study by McConnell in which he
      subcutaneously injected radioactive selenium (75Se) chloride in
      dogs and measured the amount of selenium incorporated into the
      leukocytes. This is the first reference to selenium being used in
      the immune system that I am aware of. I don't believe that anyone
      has published figures changing his finding that about 20 percent
      of the selenium became incorporated into the protein fraction of
      the leukocytes, which indeed may be essentially one or both of the
      glutathione peroxidases. That's a good point for me to check with
      Dr. Orville Levander. Sorry to interrupt, I hope it didn't make
      you lose your point.<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: The point that I was getting to is that in HIV-infected
      individuals, I would expect this role of selenium in immunity to
      be at least as important as in the uninfected. In addition, since
      HIV targets the immune system, an important role for selenium in
      the normal immune response could also help explain why the virus
      might gain something by getting directly involved in selenium
      biochemistry, as I have proposed. Mimicry of host proteins and
      mechanisms is a common viral strategy.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: Does increasing the selenium level in HIV-infected
      cells increase glutathione or oxidized glutathione levels?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: Selenium increases GPx levels, and GPx uses glutathione
      (GSH) to reduce peroxides, forming GSSG (oxidized glutathione) in
      the process. So one might expect GSSG to increase when selenium is
      increased. But another enzyme, glutathione reductase, readily
      regenerates GSH from GSSG. So the total amount of both forms of
      glutathione is what is really important. Recently, French
      researchers showed that, counterintuitively, selenium
      supplementation actually increases free GSH levels significantly,
      which is good, because it is the reduced GSH form that is needed
      for many important detoxification reactions and free radical
      scavenging in the body. So some complex homeostatic mechanisms
      must be involved, that act to increase total glutathione levels
      when more selenium and GPx are available.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: It was recently noted that Keshan disease seems to have
      a viral component rather than being strictly a selenium-deficiency
      disease per se. Do you see your research as playing a role in
      understanding this development?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: Actually, this link was first noted by the Chinese in
      research published as far back as 1980. Coxsackie virus, a
      widespread relative of the common cold virus, was isolated from
      the hearts of Keshan disease victims, and was also shown to
      produce heart damage in selenium-deficient mice that was identical
      to that seen in human Keshan disease. I think this is extremely
      significant in terms of what I am saying about HIV, because Keshan
      disease is clearly a selenium deficiency disease, apparently with
      a viral cofactor. And I am saying: AIDS is a viral disease with
      selenium deficiency as a cofactor. And we now have compelling
      evidence for virally-encoded selenoproteins in both HIV and
      Coxsackie virus.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: Dr. Melinda Beck of University of North Carolina,
      Chapel Hill, made an interesting observation about how a fairly
      harmless strain of Coxsackie virus mutates within
      selenium-deficient mice (and presumably in people as well) to
      become a more harmful virus that can then spread and produce heart
      damage, even in others who are not selenium deficient. Was she
      aware of your research when she made her observation? How does her
      finding complement your research findings?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: Dr. Beck's work is an extremely important breakthrough in
      establishing the selenium-virus link. She and her collaborator Dr.
      Orville Levander were working independently in this area before I
      was, developing their line of research based on the earlier
      Chinese observations linking Coxsackie virus to Keshan disease.
      When I discovered a potential HIV-selenium link in spring of 1994,
      based purely on genomic analysis of HIV, I was unaware of their
      selenium work because their first paper showing increased
      virulence of Coxsackie virus in selenium-deficient mice was not
      yet published, although I had seen an earlier paper they did
      showing a similar effect with vitamin E.<br>
      <br>
      In a subsequent paper, they showed that when passed through
      selenium-deficient animals, the virus actually mutates into a more
      virulent strain, that retains its virulence in selenium-adequate
      animals. This has obvious implications in regard to "emerging"
      viral diseases. In their published work, Drs. Beck and Levander
      have focused on known mechanisms to explain their observations,
      along the lines we have already discussed: low selenium leads to
      weakened antioxidant defenses and reduced immune surveillance,
      higher viral replication rates, and thus to conditions favoring
      viral mutation. However, particularly now that my group has
      demonstrated unmistakable GPx-related sequences in the Coxsackie B
      virus strain that they studied, I think they are seriously
      considering the possibility of a direct virus-selenium link of the
      type I have proposed for HIV. Obviously, if Coxsackie virus
      encodes a selenoprotein, it would have to be involved in the
      mechanism underlying their observations.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: After publishing your selenium - HIV discovery, you
      proposed a possible relationship between selenium and the Ebola
      virus. What did you find and why did you think to look for this
      relationship?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: Coincidentally, I began to study Ebola less than a month
      before the 1995 outbreak in Kikwit, Zaire that brought this virus
      so drastically into the public consciousness. I did so because of
      a poster presentation I had seen that spring in Santa Fe, at a
      meeting of the International Society for Antiviral Research. A
      Russian group presented a world map showing the geographic areas
      where various hemorrhagic viral diseases tended to occur, and I
      was struck by the fact that the area shown for the filoviruses
      Ebola and Marburg matched a region in Africa that I suspected
      might be a low-selenium region. What we found was striking:
      several gene regions in Ebola contained large numbers of UGA
      codons, up to 17 in one segment. We later published a paper
      showing that it might be possible for Ebola to synthesize
      selenoproteins from these gene regions, and proposed a mechanism
      whereby this might induce artificial selenium deficiency and
      contribute to the blood clotting characteristic of Ebol<br>
      a pathology.During the revisions to the final draft of that paper,
      we learned of a 1993 paper in a Chinese journal that reported the
      use of selenium to treat an Ebola-like hemorrhagic fever, with
      remarkable results. Luckily, the English translation of the
      abstract was available. Using the very high oral dose of 2 mg
      selenium per day as sodium selenite, for only 9 days, the death
      rate fell from 100% (untreated) to 37% (treated) in the very
      severe cases, and from 22% to zero in the less severe cases.
      Apparently there were about 80 people involved in this outbreak.
      Dr. Hou of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the author of
      this study, has since told me that he thinks more lives could have
      been saved if he had been permitted to give the selenite by
      injection, because in many of the more severly affected there is
      so much organ damage due to internal bleeding that they may have
      been unable to fully absorb or retain the oral dose of selenium.
      All in all, this is the closest thing to<br>
      &nbsp;a curative result in the treatment of hemorrhagic fever that
      I have ever heard of.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: Dr. Hou used selenite because quick and dramatic action
      was required as the patients were dying in front of him. For
      normal, long-range protection, organic selenium supplements, such
      as selenium-rich yeast or selenomethionine, are preferred, as
      discussed by Dr. Gerhard Schrauzer in the December 1991 issue, and
      by others as will be discussed later in this series.<br>
      <br>
      How do hemorrhagic fever viruses cause hemorrhaging? Would
      selenium's effect on blood clotting in the host play a role in
      such diseases, or is the effect strictly an interaction with the
      virus itself?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: The characteristic hemorrhaging produced by various
      "hemorrhagic fever" viruses involves the production of blood clots
      that ultimately block small capillary vessels, which rupture under
      pressure to produce internal and even external bleeding in severe
      cases. This is known as "disseminated intravascular coagulation",
      or DIC. Thus, paradoxically, the bleeding is produced by a
      pro-clotting mechanism, and anticoagulants (which usually promote
      bleeding) have been used to treat symptoms of the disease.<br>
      <br>
      This may be very significant in regard to selenium involvement,
      because the biochemical basis for an anti-clotting effect of
      selenium is very well established. Severe selenium deficiency,
      usually artificially induced in animals, is known to produce
      hemorrhagic symptoms. Thus, the idea that hemorrhagic fever
      viruses might produce a severe selenium depletion would be
      consistent with the established pro-clotting mechanism of DIC. So
      there may be an interaction here, where viral activity is having a
      direct impact on host selenium status over the period of one or
      two weeks, sufficient to cause serious pathology.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the results obtained in the Chinese study could
      have been simply due to the anti-clotting effect of selenium, or
      other mechanisms. Dr. Hou apparently decided to try the selenium
      treatment because of his own theories about the involvement of
      selenium in complement activation, another feature of hemorrhagic
      disease. So additional studies are badly needed, to determine what
      the predominant mechanism of protection by selenium really is.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: Then do you see multiple roles for selenium against
      other viruses?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: At this point, I've very optimistic about the potential of
      dietary selenium as a broad-spectrum chemoprotectant against
      various viral diseases. A lot of that may be entirely due to the
      immune-stimulating and antioxidant benefits of selenium, but I
      think that in a number of viral diseases, some degree of direct
      interaction between the virus and selenium is likely to be
      involved. We already have quite a few viral diseases where a
      clinical correlation or definite selenium benefit has been
      established: hepatitis B/liver disease, HIV/AIDS, Coxsackie
      virus/Keshan disease, hemorrhagic fever, MMTV/cancer, and a number
      of other animal viral diseases where selenium has been used in
      veterinary practice. I also strongly suspect that various herpes
      viruses will prove responsive to selenium therapy, and the
      strongest case of a selenoprotein in a virus to date is in a pox
      virus. So the potential scope of this chemoprotection approach is
      very exciting.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: Your research is getting dramatic scientific support at
      least by some researchers, what are you looking into now?<br>
      <br>
      Taylor: After spending much of my efforts over the last two years
      in trying to extend the scope of our HIV findings in terms of
      other viruses, and trying to establish some collaborations in
      order to have the implications experimentally verified, I am now
      focusing on building up the capabilities in my own laboratory to
      do some of the necessary experimental research. It's been slow
      getting started, because we have been hampered by lack of
      financial resources, and only now is the hard evidence coming in
      that will enable us to convince Federal funding agencies that this
      research merits support. Along with a few other labs, we have
      already obtained evidence that some of the molecular features we
      predicted in HIV are real. Our objective is to clone several of
      the novel genes that we have found by genomic analysis, including
      several from HIV and the GPx homologue from Coxsackie virus, so
      the meantime we are trying to work with clinical researchers like
      Dr. Marianna Baum to promote the serious assessment of the
      potential benefits of selenium as a complementary therapy in HIV
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, I've also become very interested in the biochemical roles
      of selenium in health as well as in cancer and rheumatoid
      diseases, etc. My group is now engaged in a search for new
      selenoprotein genes in the human genome, and we are finding some
      rather intriguing things. All that I can say at this point is that
      I strongly suspect that selenium is playing a role in cell
      signaling and attachment - very important in the immune system -
      and that selenium is more than just indirectly involved in gene
      regulation. So I'm sure I'll be keeping busy well into the next
      millennium trying to find out if that hunch is really true!
      Hopefully our readers will be able to say they read it here first.<br>
      <br>
      Passwater: Well, we will all be looking forward to the selenium
      millenium! Hopefully our readers will remember they read it here
      first.<br>
      <br>
      The information that you have deduced by examining genes to see
      what they can make is a great help and gives great directions for
      the biochemists to check out. Without this help we are more or
      less left to "stumble around" trying to figure out biochemically
      how selenium does all those things that our laboratory studies
      show it does.<br>
      <br>
      I am sure that the funding agencies will soon understand the
      importance of your research. They need time to fully understand
      its consequences. You have been on the program of the
      International Conferences on selenium and human viruses. Now let's
      see if we can get you on the programs of some of the NIH virus
      researchers. Remember NIH also stands for Not Invented Here -- and
      if not invented here (at National Institutes of Health) it takes
      longer to get the attention of the establishment funders. Thanks
      for helping us keep up-to-date on your exciting research.<br>
