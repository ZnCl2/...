      The invention discloses a fluorescent quantitative PCR (polymerase

      (Ebola virus). The general method can be used for detecting that
      the sample to be detected is positive as long as the sample
      contains one or more of the five types of subtype EBOVs which are
      Z, S, B, C and R at the same time. The method overcomes the
      defects of the conventional PCR method for detecting by adopting
      the advantages of high-efficiency nucleic acid amplification of
      the PCR technology and the sensitivity of the fluorescence-dye
      SYBR Green I and the computer-aided fluorescent technology for
      detecting and improves the detection sensitivity, specificity and
      operation convenience greatly. In addition, the positive control
      adopted by the method is a section of RNA molecules transcribed in
      vitro of a NP gene, and the method is safer than the method for
      detecting by taking the inactivated virus solution as the positive
      control. The RNA molecules transcribed in vitro can be prepared in

      FIELD: medicine. ^ SUBSTANCE: blood serum is sampled from

      in 3-4 hours and for the second time - in 15-18 hours after
      presumed infection. Each serum sample is examined for a level of

      of time, the fact of body infection is stated, and the absence or
      minor change of the HCA shows the absence of body infection. The

      The present invention provides compositions and methods for

      pseudotyping with a transmembrane form of viral glycoprotein, such

      There is a substantial degree of structural similarity (although
      not sequence similarity) between the carboxy-terminal one-third of
      Filovirus glycoprotein and the transmembrane proteins of the very
      distantly related retroviruses, especially those of avian sarcoma
      viruses. The high degree of structural similarity implies
      functional homology as well. A number of compounds that are useful
      in the diagnosis and treatment of African hemorrhagic fever
      ("AHF") are disclosed. AHF infections (e.g., Ebola, Marburg) may
      be inhibited with low concentrations of peptides or antibodies of
      low toxicity. For example, analogs of a portion of the natural
      fusion glycoprotein of a Filovirus may be used to inhibit the
      normal fusion process of the virus in vivo, thus preventing or
      limiting infection.<br>
