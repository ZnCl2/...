      </b><b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] In this specification where a document, act or item of
      knowledge is referred to or discussed, this reference or
      discussion is not an admission that the document, act or item of
      knowledge or any combination thereof was at the priority date,
      publicly available, known to the public, part of common general
      knowledge, or otherwise constitutes prior art under the applicable
      statutory provisions; or is known to be relevant to an attempt to
      solve any problem with which this specification is concerned.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Hexaamminecobalt(III) chloride, also called Cohex, is
      notable for its ability to "condense" dsDNA into toroidal-like
      superstructures under low salt conditions. The metal ion itself,
      Co(III), with its high positive charge density, is an ideal
      candidate for binding nucleotides with their high negative charge
      density. Although Co(III) is not stable by itself in aqueous
      solutions, it is stabilized by coordinating with donor atoms
      (usually N) that make strong contributions to the ligand field.
      These coordinating donors could either be monodentate ligands,
      e.g., NH3, or polydentate chelators, such as cyclen, C8H20N4. The
      Co(III)-chelator complexes (e.g., cobalt cyclen complexes) have
      been used for mechanistic studies of phosphodiester cleavage for
      both its efficient hydrolysis rates and kinetic inertness, whereby
      the kinetic inertness of Co(III) ions results in the continued
      binding of the complex to the hydrolyzed phosphate.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Due to the kinetic inertness of Co(III) ions, the Cohex
      complex sequesters the "inner-sphere" ammonia ligands from most
      exchange-reactions in solution; therefore, the usual interactions
      with solution molecules are by "outer-sphere" coordination via
      water bridges to the ammonia ligands and via the high
      charge-density of the Co(III) ion. These two characteristics play
      an important role in the strong attachment of Cohex to either DNA
      or RNA and in enabling Cohex to often substitute for hydrated
      Mg&lt;2+&gt;(aq) as a cofactor in nucleic acid biochemistry.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] For example, Cohex complexation with 5S RNA-where Cohex was
      used in place of Mg&lt;2+&gt;(aq)-was found to provide no
      significant shifts in the [lambda]max of the absorption bands of
      Cohex, indicating that Cohex interaction with RNA was through
      outer-sphere complexation (and, of course, opposing charge
      attraction). It has also been reported that the number of binding
      sites on RNA was similar for Cohex and Mg&lt;2+&gt;(aq) and that
      the number was greater than expected for simple charge
      neutralization of the RNA backbone. These observations demonstrate
      that Cohex has a great propensity to bind to nucleotides at sites
      similar to Mg&lt;2+&gt;-binding sites and either inhibit or slow
      down the bio-functions of DNA and RNA.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] While certain aspects of conventional technologies have
      been discussed to facilitate disclosure of the invention,
      Applicants in no way disclaim these technical aspects, and it is
      contemplated that the claimed invention may encompass one or more
      of the conventional technical aspects discussed herein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0007] Cohex can inhibit viral transcription/translation via
      interference with viral RNA. This interference can be either via
      general "blockade" of the nucleotide strands from
      transcription/translation or may be made more overt by attaching
      hybridizing oligonucleotide strands to the Cohex. It has been
      shown that Cohex does not hydrolyze nucleotides, but does show
      potent antiviral properties against the Sindbis virus and
      Adenovirus, which are positive single-stranded (ss) RNA,
      double-strand (ds) DNA, respectively, and furthermore can act as
      an antibiotic. See US Patent Application Publication Nos.
      2008/0182835 and 2010/0004187, each of which is incorporated by
      reference in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In one embodiment, a method for treating a viral infection
      comprises administering to a patient a hexaamminecobalt(III)
      compound (e.g., hexaamminecobalt(III) chloride) in an amount
      effective to reduce an extent of a viral infection.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In a further embodiment, a method for treating a viral
      infection comprises administering to a human patient a
      hexamminecobalt(III) compound in an amount effective to reduce an
      extent of an infection of the patient with Ebola virus or HIV.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In another embodiment, a kit for delivery of a
      hexamminecobalt(III) compound by injection comprises a
      hexamminecobalt(III) compound in a pharmaceutically acceptable
      carrier, and equipment for delivery thereof by injection, wherein
      the equipment comprises at least one of a container, injection
      tubing, or an injection needle.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021] Hexaamminecobalt(III) (Cohex; FIG. 1), in particular the
      chloride salt thereof, is notable for its ability to "condense"
      dsDNA into toroidal-like superstructures under low salt
      conditions. The metal ion itself, Co(III), with its high
      (+)charge-density, is an ideal candidate for binding nucleotides
      with their high (-)charge density. Although Co(III) is not stable
      by itself in aqueous solutions, it is stabilized by coordinating
      with donor atoms (usually N) that make strong contributions to the
      ligand field. These coordinating donors could either be
      monodentate ligands, e.g., NH3, or polydentate chelators, such as
      cyclen, C8H20N4. The Co(III)-chelator complexes (e.g., cobalt
      cyclen complexes) have been used for mechanistic studies of
      phosphodiester cleavage for both its efficient hydrolysis rates
      and kinetic inertness, whereby the kinetic inertness of Co(III)
      ions results in the continued binding of the complex to the
      hydrolyzed phosphate.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Due to the kinetic inertness of Co(III) ions, the Cohex
      complex sequesters the "inner-sphere" ammonia ligands from most
      exchange-reactions in solution; therefore, the usual interactions
      with solution molecules are by "outer-sphere" coordination via
      water bridges to the ammonia ligands and via the high
      charge-density of the Co(III) ion. These two characteristics play
      an important role in the strong attachment of Cohex to either DNA
      or RNA&lt;5 &gt;and in enabling Cohex to often substitute for
      hydrated Mg&lt;2+&gt;(aq) as a cofactor in nucleic acid
      biochemistry. For example, Cohex complexation with 5S RNA-where
      Cohex was used in place of Mg&lt;2+&gt;(aq)-was examined and found
      to provide no significant shifts in the [lambda]max of the
      absorption bands of Cohex, indicating that Cohex interaction with
      RNA was through outer-sphere complexation (and, of course,
      opposing charge attraction). It has also been reported that the
      number of binding sites on RNA was similar for Cohex and
      Mg&lt;2+&gt;(aq) and that the number was greater than expected for
      simple charge neutralization of the RNA backbone. These
      observations demonstrate that Cohex has a great propensity to bind
      to nucleotides at sites similar to Mg&lt;2+&gt;-binding sites and
      either inhibit or slow down the bio-functions of DNA and RNA.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Cohex may function as a new type of broad-spectrum
      antiviral compound. For example, Cohex can be effective in
      significantly enhancing cell viability and in depressing viral
      expression for Sindbis infected BHK cells, with similar
      significant effects of Cohex against adenovirus in A549. See US
      Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0182835. These
      observations point to the potential broad-spectrum nature of Cohex
      against viruses.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] As disclosed herein, Cohex demonstrates antiviral
      properties against two additional viruses. Ebola virus is a
      negative-strand, filamentous, enveloped microorganism that belongs
      to the filoviridae family of viruses. Cohex can decrease the viral
      expression levels in a dose-dependent manner, in a variety of
      cells infected with the Ebola virus. Cohex also demonstrates
      antiviral properties against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      HIV is a member of the genus lentivirus and belongs to the
      Retroviridae family. It has a single-strand (-)RNA genome, which
      is transcribed into a complementary DNA (cDNA) inside the host
      cell by an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. The sense cDNA serves as
      a template for DNA-dependent DNA polymerase to make an antisense
      DNA copy, which forms a double-stranded viral DNA (dsDNA). The
      dsDNA is then transported into the cell nucleus where it gets
      integrated into the host cell's genome. Virus replication is
      initiated when the integrated DNA provirus is transcribed into
      mRNA.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DEFINITIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0025] As used herein, the term "reduce an extent of the viral
      infection" with regard to a patient means that the ability of
      viruses to multiply within a patient is at least partially
      reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] As used herein, a "patient" can be a human or other mammal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Antiviral Uses of Cohex</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0027] It is contemplated that Cohex could be used to treat a
      viral infection in a patient. In one embodiment, an effective
      amount of Cohex is administered to a patient suspected or known to
      have a viral infection. Optionally, a method of treatment includes
      identifying a patient who is or may be in need of such treatment.
      The patient can be a human or other mammal, including without
      limitation a primate, dog, cat, cow, pig, or horse.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In an embodiment, Cohex is administered to a patient known
      or suspected of being infected by a virus. In a further
      embodiment, Cohex is administered prior to exposure of the patient
      to a virus. In another embodiment, Cohex is administered
      subsequent to exposure of the patent to a virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The Cohex may be administered by any of various means
      including orally or nasally, or by suppository, or by injection
      including intravenous, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal
      injection, or combinations of any of these.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In an embodiment, equipment for injection of Cohex in a
      pharmaceutically acceptable comprises at least one of a container
      for the compound (such as a tube, bottle, or bag), injection
      tubing, or an injection needle.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The quantity of Cohex effective to treat an infection can
      be ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art. Exemplary
      amounts of Cohex include 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or
      20 mg/kg, or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Viral infections that can be treated include, but are not
      limited to, those associated with human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV), human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV), Papillomavirus (e.g.,
      human papilloma virus), Polyomavirus (e.g., SV40, BK virus, DAR
      virus), orthopoxvirus (e.g., variola major virus (smallpox
      virus)), EBV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis virus,
      Rhabdovirus (e.g., Ebola virus), alphavirus (e.g., Sindbis virus),
      adenovirus, and/or cytomegalovirus (CMV). In preferred
      embodiments, the viral infection is by HIV or Ebola virus.<br>
      <br>
      Preparation of Co(III) Hexammine<br>
      <br>
      [0033] While Cohex is available commercially, its synthesis is
      fairly straight forward, using air to oxidize Co(II) to Co(III):<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      CoCl2+4NH4Cl+20NH3+O2-&gt;4[Co(NH3)6]Cl3+2H2O<br>
      <br>
      [0034] 9.6 g of CoCl2.6H2O (0.06 mol) and 6.4 g of NH4Cl (0.12
      mol) were added to 40 ml of water in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask
      with a side arm and shaken until most of the salts are dissolved.
      Then 1 g of fresh activated decolorizing charcoal and 20 ml
      concentrated ammonia were added. Next the flask was connected to
      the aspirator or vacuum line and air drawn through the mixture
      until the red solution becomes yellowish brown (usually 2-3
      hours). The air inlet tube if preferably of fairly large bore (~10
      mm) to prevent clogging with the precipitated Co(NH3)6&lt;3+&gt;
      salt.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The crystals and charcoal were filtered on a Buchner funnel
      and then a solution of 6 ml of concentrated HCl in 75 ml of water
      was added. The mixture was heated on a hot plate to effect
      complete solution and filtered while hot. The hexamminecobalt
      (III) chloride was crystallized by cooling to 0[deg.] C. and by
      slowly adding 15 ml of concentrated HCl. The crystals were
      filtered, washed with 60% and then with 95% ethanol, and dried at
      80-100[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      Cohex Activity Against HIV<br>
      <br>
      [0036] There are two known strains of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2, of
      which HIV-1 is the more virulent virus and is the major cause of
      HIV infections. The first clinically useful drugs developed for
      HIV-1 were the nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors.
      AZT, or 3-azido-3-deoxythymidine, is a synthetic pyrimidine analog
      of thymidine was actually initially developed as an anticancer
      drug before it became known as a popular anti-HIV compound. The
      active form of AZT is its phosphorylated triphosphate (TP) form,
      which is a competitive inhibitor of RT because AZT-TP binds to the
      HIV-1 RT better than to the natural substrate deoxythymidine
      triphosphate (dTTP).<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Cohex was tested in a standard PBMC cell-based microtiter
      anti-HIV assay against one CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolate and one
      CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolate. For this study peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were pre-treated with the compound for
      two hours prior to infection.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Cohex was stored at 4[deg.] C. as a powder and solubilized
      for tests. The solubilized stock was stored at -20[deg.] C. until
      the day of the assay. Stocks were thawed at room temperature on
      each day of assay setup and were used to generate working drug
      dilutions used in the assays. Working dilutions were made fresh
      for each experiment and were not stored for re-use in subsequent
      experiments performed on different days. Cohex was evaluated using
      a 3 mM (3,000 [mu]M) high-test concentration with 8 additional
      serial half-log dilutions in the PBMC assays.<br>
      <br>
      PBMC Assay<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Freshly prepared PBMCs were centrifuged and suspended in
      RPMI 1640 with 15% FBS, L-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin,
      non-essential amino acids (MEM/NEAA; Hyclone; catalog
      #SH30238.01), and 20 U/ml recombinant human IL-2. PBMCs were
      maintained in this medium at a concentration of 1-2*10&lt;6
      &gt;cells/ml, with twice-weekly medium changes until they were
      used in the assay protocol. Monocyte-derived-macrophages were
      depleted from the culture as the result of adherence to the tissue
      culture flask.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] For the standard PBMC assay, the cells were plated in the
      interior wells of a 96 well round bottom microplate at 50
      [mu]L/well (5*10&lt;4 &gt;cells/well) in a standard format
      developed by the Infectious Disease Research department of
      Southern Research Institute. Each plate contains virus control
      wells (cells plus virus) and experimental wells (drug plus cells
      plus virus). Test drug dilutions were prepared at a 2*
      concentration in microtiter tubes and 100 [mu]L of each
      concentration was placed in appropriate wells using the standard
      format. 50 [mu]L of a predetermined dilution of virus stock was
      placed in each test well (final MOI ~0.1). Separate plates were
      prepared identically without virus for drug cytotoxicity studies
      using an MTS assay system (described below; cytotoxicity plates
      also include compound control wells containing drug plus media
      without cells to control for colored compounds that affect the MTS
      assay). The PBMC cultures were maintained for seven days following
      infection at 37[deg.] C., 5% CO2. After this period, cell-free
      supernatant samples were collected for analysis of reverse
      transcriptase activity and compound cytotoxicity was measured by
      addition of MTS to the separate cytotoxicity plates for
      determination of cell viability. Wells were also examined
      microscopically and any abnormalities were noted.<br>
      <br>
      Reverse Transcriptase Activity Assay<br>
      <br>
      [0041] A microtiter plate-based reverse transcriptase (RT)
      reaction was utilized (detailed in Buckheit et al., AIDS Research
      and Human Retroviruses 7:295-302, 1991). Tritiated thymidine
      triphosphate (3H-TTP, 80 Ci/mmol, NEN) was received in 1:1
      dH2O:Ethanol at 1 mCi/ml. Poly rA:oligo dT template:primer
      (Pharmacia) was prepared as a stock solution by combining 150 poly
      rA (20 mg/ml) with 0.5 ml oligo dT (20 units/ml) and 5.35 ml
      sterile dH2O followed by aliquoting (1.0 ml) and storage at
      -20[deg.] C. The RT reaction buffer was prepared fresh on a daily
      basis and consisted of 125 [mu]l 1.0 M EGTA, 125 [mu]l dH2O, 125
      [mu]l 20% Triton X100, 50 [mu]l 1.0 M Tris (pH 7.4), 50 [mu]l 1.0
      M DTT, and 40 [mu]l 1.0 M MgCl2. The final reaction mixture was
      prepared by combining 1 part 3H-TTP, 4 parts dH2O, 2.5 parts poly
      rA:oligo dT stock and 2.5 parts reaction buffer. Ten microliters
      of this reaction mixture was placed in a round bottom microtiter
      plate and 15 [mu]l of virus-containing supernatant was added and
      mixed. The plate was incubated at 37[deg.] C. for 60 minutes.
      Following incubation, the reaction volume was spotted onto DE81
      filter-mats (Wallac), washed 5 times for 5 minutes each in a 5%
      sodium phosphate buffer or 2*SSC (Life Technologies), 2 times for
      1 minute each in distilled water, 2 times for 1 minute each in 70%
      ethanol, and then dried. Incorporated radioactivity (counts per
      minute, CPM) was quantified using standard liquid scintillation
      techniques.<br>
      <br>
      MTS Staining for PBMC Viability to Measure Cytotoxicity<br>
      <br>
      [0042] At assay termination, the uninfected assay plates were
      stained with the soluble tetrazolium-based dye MTS (CellTiter 96
      Reagent, Promega) to determine cell viability and quantify
      compound toxicity. MTS is metabolized by the mitochondria enzymes
      of metabolically active cells to yield a soluble formazan product,
      allowing the rapid quantitative analysis of cell viability and
      compound cytotoxicity. This reagent is a stable, single solution
      that does not require preparation before use. At termination of
      the assay, 20-25 [mu]L of MTS reagent is added per well and the
      microtiter plates are then incubated for 4-6 hrs at 37[deg.] C.,
      5% CO2 to assess cell viability. Adhesive plate sealers were used
      in place of the lids, the sealed plate was inverted several times
      to mix the soluble formazan product and the plate was read
      spectrophotometrically at 490/650 nm with a Molecular Devices
      SPECTRAmax plate reader.<br>
      <br>
      Assay Results<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The PBMC data were normalized by dividing by either the
      average control, infected, untreated value for the infection
      measurements (% Viral Control) or by the control, uninfected,
      untreated value for the cytotoxicity measurements (% Cell
      Control). The normalized values were then analyzed for IC50 (50%
      inhibition of virus replication), CC50 (50% cytotoxicity), and
      therapeutic index values (TI=CC/IC; also referred to as Antiviral
      Index or AI).<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Cohex was tested for antiviral efficacy against one
      CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolate and one CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolate in
      PBMCs. For this study PBMCs were pre-treated with the compound for
      two hours prior to infection. FIG. 2 illustrates the decrease in
      RT activity (left), as a measure of viral activity, or uninfected
      cell viability (right) for HIV-1 NL4-3 isolate. FIG. 3 illustrates
      of the decrease in RT activity (left), as a measure of viral
      activity, or uninfected cell viability (right) for HIV-1 Ba-L
      isolate. In these Figures, "% VC" means "% Virus Control" and "%
      CC" means "% Cell Control." The results of the testing are
      summarized in Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Cohex displayed definite antiviral activity against the
      virus isolates evaluated in this study, with an average IC50 value
      of 31.2 [mu]M. There did not appear to be any difference in the
      activity of the compound based on co-receptor tropism, as the
      compound had approximately equal activity against both virus
      isolates tested. Cytotoxicity was observed with the compound at
      concentrations above 100 [mu]M (TC50=833 [mu]M), resulting in an
      average Therapeutic Index value of 26.7. These results can be
      summarized with IC50, CC50, and TI values given in Table 1.<br>

      [0046] The results show that Cohex displays very similar activity
      against HIV as against other types of viruses, attesting to the
      very broad-spectrum nature of the compound. The antiviral activity
      is not as high as specific antiviral drugs, like AZT, but there
      are situations where the use of Cohex can be an advantage.<br>
      <br>
      Cohex Activity Against Ebola Virus<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Ebola was first discovered simultaneously in 1976 in Sudan
      and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire).
      While its origins are still not firmly established, Ebola likely
      came from the rain forests of Africa. The primary reservoir is
      likely not nonhuman primates, but rather that the virus is
      zoonotic, transmitted to humans from ongoing life cycles in
      animals or arthropods.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Ebola viruses belong to the filoviridae family and has five
      known strains (subtypes): Bundibugyo, Côte d'Ivoire, Sudan, Zaïre,
      and Reston. The Bundibugyo, Sudan, and Zaïre strains have caused
      outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever among humans in Africa,
      killing up to 90% of those infected. Of the Ebola viruses, the
      Zaire strain is the most virulent and the Reston strain is the
      least virulent.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The Ebola virus is transmitted via contact with bodily
      fluids of infected persons and can take from two days to three
      weeks for symptoms to appear. Disease symptoms start with fever,
      muscle aches and a cough before progressing to severe vomiting,
      diarrhea and rashes, along with kidney and liver problems. Death
      generally occurs as the result of either one or a combination of
      dehydration and/or massive bleeding from leaky blood vessels,
      kidney, and liver failure. The World Health Organization has
      documented 1,850 cases of Ebola (mostly in sub-Saharan Africa)
      since its discovery; only 600 (32 percent) of the victims
      survived. (32 percent) of the victims survived.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] As with all viruses of the order Mononegavirales,
      filoviruses, such as Ebola, contain a single-stranded,
      negative-sense RNA molecule as their genome. The genomes of
      filoviruses are quite large at approximately 19,000 bases in
      length and contain seven sequentially arranged genes. Filovirus
      proteins can be subdivided into two categories, those that form
      the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex and those that are associated
      with the envelope. The proteins associated with the nucleocapsid
      are involved in the transcription and replication of the genome,
      whereas the envelope-associated proteins primarily have a role
      either in assembly of the virion or in receptor binding and virus
      entry.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] There is no known cure for Ebola disease. Existing
      antiviral drugs do not work well against this virus and the best
      doctors can do is attempt to maintain the patient's body fluids
      and electrolytes levels under intensive care; while bleeding
      problems may require transfusions of platelets and/or fresh blood.<br>
      <br>
      Activity of Cohex Against Ebola Virus in Cell Culture<br>
      <br>
      [0052] For EC50 assays, cells were plated onto 96-well plates and
      incubated at 37[deg.] C. for 24 hours before adding compound
      followed by cell infection with Zaire Ebola GFP virus, a virus
      strain that contains a GFP gene. The infected cells were allowed
      to grow for an additional 48 hours before reading on a Molecular
      Devices spectrofluorometer (X=485 nm, M=515 nm). Controls were
      done for +virus/-compound and -virus/-compound. The
      -virus/+compound controls were part of the CC50 tests. Dosage of
      Cohex ranged from 2.5 [mu]M to 5 mM and were done in triplicates.
      Error bars for the figures are for standard error (SE) of the
      mean.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The results for A549 cells and HepG2 cells are shown in the
      left and right panels of FIG. 4, respectively. It is seen that
      there appears to be a general flat response from 2.5 [mu]M until
      around 0.1 mM Cohex, at which point, GFP expression drops until
      there is nearly 100% suppression (-100%) of viral expression at
      concentrations above 1 mM Cohex.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The results for 293T and VeroE6 cells are shown in the left
      and right panels of FIG. 5, respectively. For 293T cells, there is
      a monotonic decrease in GFP expression with increasing Cohex, even
      starting as low as 2.5 [mu]M Cohex. For VeroE6 cells, there is
      also a decrease in GFP expression with increasing Cohex, but the
      slope of the decrease is much less pronounced than for the other
      cells. There is another difference in the cells of FIG. 4 from
      FIG. 5. The values for concentrations below 0.1 mM in FIG. 1
      fluctuate between 0 and +50 enhancement of GFP with large error
      bars, whereas the values in FIG. 2, for the same region of
      concentration, all show (except for 1 point) negative GFP
      enhancement (i.e., in the suppression of expression region). Thus,
      the behavior of Cohex for the different cell types exhibit
      differential amounts of viral expression decrease, but they all
      show decreasing levels of GFP fluorescence with increasing Cohex
      concentrations, especially above 0.1 mM.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In order to check whether the decreasing GFP levels were
      simply due to decreasing numbers of viable cells, in vitro
      cytotoxicity studies were performed for the same cell lines. That
      is, the same concentration ranges as used above were used in a
      CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay by Promega. This
      assay is based on quantitation of the ATP present in cells, which
      signals the presence of metabolically active cells, that is, a
      decrease in luminescence correlates with a decrease in the number
      of viable cells. The cells were plated out on 96-well plates, as
      above, and incubated at 37[deg.] C. for 24 hours before adding
      compound. The treated cells were then allowed to grow for an
      additional 48 hours before reading on the BMG Lumistar set on the
      ATP protocol.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In addition to the luminescence assay, a flow cytometry
      assay was performed using propidium iodide as a "dead" stain for
      A549 cells. The flow cytometry assay protocol for A549 cell line
      is similar to protocols known in the art, and is as follows. The
      cells were grown until confluent and reseeded at 100,000
      cells/well in 1 ml in 24-well plates. The monolayers were allowed
      to form overnight at 37[deg.] C. under 5% CO2. The Cohex dilution
      series was added to appropriate wells and the plate incubated for
      48 hours at 37[deg.] C. under 5% CO2. The cells were then washed,
      pelleted, resuspended in buffer, and transferred to BD falcon
      tubes for flow analysis. A BD FACSort cytometer and BD CellQuest
      software was used to quantify cell viability. Prior to flow
      analysis, 10 [mu]L of propidium iodide (PI) at 0.05 mg/ml was
      added to each tube to stain dead cells. Analysis was performed on
      1*10&lt;4 &gt;events/well.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIG. 6 shows the result of the cytotoxicity assay for A549
      and HepG2 cells plotted on semi-log scale. There appears to be no
      toxic effect until about 0.1 mM, after which there is a decreasing
      % of viable cells. To better show the region from 2.5 [mu]M to 0.1
      mM, FIG. 7 provides linear-scale plots to emphasize the
      concentration region that does affect cytotoxicity.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Both 293T and VerE6 cells lines show much less cytotoxic
      susceptibility to Cohex, leveling off between 70 to 80% viability,
      even at 5 mM Cohex. There is a variety of reactions to Cohex by
      different cell lines, but none of the cells were 100% killed,
      whereas suppression of GFP expression tends to bottom out close to
      -100% (except for VeroE6).<br>
      <br>
      [0059] It is further notable that, in addition to variability
      between cell lines, different markers can also differ in their
      assessment of viability. As an example, the results of a flow
      cytometry measurement using propidium iodide (PI) as a marker for
      dead cells shown in FIG. 9. it can be seen that PI appears to
      measure a cell property (cell permeability) that is much less
      affected by Cohex than the luminescence study (ATP levels).<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The IC50 for Cohex for the different cell lines can be
      estimated from FIGS. 1 and 2. By using a log concentration scale,
      the data can be fitted to the classic sigmoidal shape using a
      non-linear least-squares fitting program, seen in FIG. 10. The
      IC50 for the fit was found to be 0.38 mM Cohex.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The results with various cell types are shown in Table 2.<br>

      <b>Cohex Animal Study Against Ebola</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0062] An efficacy study was conducted in mice to test whether
      Cohex would have a therapeutic affect against Ebola virus
      exposure. Initially, to determine whether the mice would tolerate
      the Cohex, they received intraperitoneal (IP) injections of Cohex
      once a day for 10 days at levels of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg in
      this study. The mice tolerated the compound very well, with no
      adverse reactions reported.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] To examine the efficacy of Cohex, mice were treated by IP
      injection with either phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or Cohex in
      PBS one hour before virus exposure, and further treated once a day
      for 9 more days. In comparing the results of the mice treated with
      PBS versus those treated with 8 mg/kg of Cohex, it was found to be
      statistically very likely (p=0.01 in a chi-squared test) that the
      8 mg/kg treatment improved survival rates over the PBS treatment
      in mice infected with Ebola virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The general advantages of a broad-spectrum drug, such as
      Cohex, are its low-cost, stability, and, of course, ability to
      attack multiple microorganisms. When there is no treatment
      available, as in the case of Ebola virus, Cohex could be the only
      source of treatment. For viruses, such as HIV, where drugs with
      very high TI already exist, Cohex can be used in a combination
      drug therapy regime. There are several advantages to doing this:
      (1) as a broad-spectrum compound, Cohex can fight against
      opportunistic infections by other microorganisms; (2) Cohex may
      have a synergistic effect on existing anti-HIV drugs; (3) Cohex
      can significantly decrease the cost of anti-HIV treatment; (4)
      Cohex can slow the development of viral drug-resistance by
      presenting a very different mechanism that must be overcome.<br>

        </b><b>Method for the production of an agent against an
          infectious disease</b><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The invention relates to a method for producing a
      composition against an infectious disease, in particular against
      HIV, Ebola or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The treatment of HIV-infected people is one of the most
      urgent biomedical problems of recent times. It is as yet possible
      only to avoid an infection with the HIV virus by suitable
      measures, for example by using condoms during sexual intercourse.
      Once the HIV virus is present in the body, it is possible only to
      inhibit its effect and spread. Novel, promising therapies
      therefore relate to the inhibition of the rapid proliferation of
      the virus in human tissue. HIV prothease inhibitors block an
      important enzymatic metabolic pathway in the virus, leading to
      considerably reduced viral loads, thus slowing down the
      unremitting destruction of the immune system and the harmful
      effects, resulting therefrom, on human health.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] A large number of chemical agents used for HIV injection
      treatment are known from the literature. These include for example
      azido derivatives of [beta]-L-2'-nucleosides as disclosed in DE
      699 30 378 C2. DE 600 06 706 C2 describes N-acrylmethylthioamilite
      derivatives for inhibiting HIV replication. DE 602 04 967 T2
      describes oversulfated polysaccharides as HIV inhibitors. All
      these chemical agents have undesired side effects which are to be
      avoided.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] DE 693 27 236 T2 describes the use of dietetic whey
      proteins for the treatment of HIV-seropositive individuals. In
      this case, a denatured whey protein concentrate is described for
      the production of a medicament for the treatment of these
      individuals. The concentrate is to be designed so that the
      T-helper cell concentrations and the T-helper cell/T-suppressor
      cell ratio in an HIV-seropositive individual is increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The problem of the present invention is to provide a method
      and composition which serve to control infectious diseases, in
      particular HIV, Ebola or the like and show few side effects.<br>

      [0006] In accordance with the invention, medicinal oxygen is
      turbulently introduced under pressure into a solution which
      contains at least one plant constituent, in particular in the form
      of an extract, leading to the solution to the problem.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] Medicinal oxygen is used for example in artificial
      respiration and in inhalation therapies. For this purpose, oxygen
      must be subjected to a special preliminary process in which this
      oxygen is specially purified and its aggressive effect is reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In the present method, the medicinal oxygen is turbulently
      introduced over the course of about one hour with a
      superatmospheric pressure of about two atmospheres into the
      solution in such a way that the maximum amount of oxygen is
      introduced into the solution and also remains in the solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The solution preferably used is a physiological magnesium
      phosphoricum solution. However, this is to be understood as only
      exemplary, and other solutions are conceivable.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In a first exemplary embodiment of the invention, an
      extract from Afacimmune is to be used in the solution. Afacimmune
      means the fungus Agaricus Campestris which is normally grown on
      mineralized compost soil.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In a second exemplary embodiment of the invention, elder
      bark/flowers and/or Agaricus Blazei Murill is used as extract in
      the solution. The latter is the so-called almond fungus which
      originally comes from the Brazilian rainforest. Scarcely any
      fungus stimulates the immune system as effectively as the
      Agaricus. Its content of polysaccharides, especially of
      beta-glucans, are the highest by comparison with other medicinal
      fungi. For this reason, it is used for cancers. Its promoting
      effect on the production of blood in the bone marrow is also
      known. It is also suitable for use for alleviating liver disorders
      and assists the spleen in its purification of blood and defense
      functions.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In a further exemplary embodiment of the invention, the
      extract consists of St. John's wort and/or parsley juice in the
      solution. An extract of blue algae and/or buttercup also appears
      to be particularly effective. The blue algae extract is to contain
      about 80 g of lithium per gram of dry matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The buttercup extract is produced by pouring hot
      triple-distilled water over carefully dried buttercups and leaving
      the mixture to extract for seven minutes, with the above-mentioned
      medicinal oxygen being turbulently introduced in particular into
      the buttercup extract.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In a further preferred exemplary embodiment of the
      invention, a sugar is admixed with the solution apart from the
      solution with the Afacimmune extract. It is possible in this case
      for the sugar to have been specially treated, but normal
      granulated sugar is also possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The respective extract is preferably produced with hot
      triple-distilled water. The latter is water which has been
      distilled three times and is of very high purity.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Protection is also sought for the corresponding products
      produced by the above-mentioned methods.<br>

        <b>D-GLUCOPYRANOSE 1-[3,5-BIS
          (1,1-DIMETHYLETHY)-4-HYDROXYBENZOATE] AND ITS DERIVATIVES,
          PREPARATION AND USE THEREOF </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a compound:
      D-glucopyranose 1-[3,5-bis (1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxybenzoate]
      and its derivatives. It applies particularly but not exclusively,
      to the preparation and the use of these compounds for preparing
      medecine to treat and/or prevent infections by enveloped-viruses,
      particularly in humans, such as herpes, AIDS, influenza of the
      hepatitis B and C, virus of Dengue, Ebola and, in animals,
      Aujewsky's disease as for instance Aujewsky's in pigs.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The action of these derivatives is unique. They are not
      blocking viral replication as virustatics but they are shredding
      the viral lipid-protein membrane. These derivatives are virucide.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The herpes and AIDS viruses, like many others (influenza of
      the hepatitis B and &amp; C, SARS, Ebola etc. . . . ) are viruses
      surrounded by a lipid envelope unlike others-such as the virus of
      poliomyelitis who has no membrane-thus called naked-virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Enveloped-virus or naked-virus are non-cellular organism
      that are totally dependent of the cell they parasite for their
      survival. Viruses have no energy generating system (ATP) and no
      protein synthesis machinery. Although viral nucleic acids code for
      proteins, the synthesis of those proteins is performed on the host
      cell's ribosome. Hence, viruses must use the metabolic pathways of
      the cell as well as the capacity of these synthetic chemical
      factories that are the ribosome.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] By rending impossible the access to viral metabolic
      pathways, virustatic (Tritherapy) disrupt metabolic pathways of
      the parasited molecules that the virus uses. This better reflects
      the poor tolerance of these biological therapies that block viral
      replication without killing the virus. Thus this limits
      significantly its effectiveness and use.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Taking into account the parasitic characteristics of the
      virus that makes it unable to survive outside a living eukaryotic
      cell, this invention seeks to prohibit its penetration into the
      living eukaryotic cell. Two methods are therefore possible:<br>
      <br>
      Hiding the binding site of the host cell,<br>
      <br>
      Eliminating the lipid envelope of the virus that contains the
      routing system and the protein adsorption on the membrane of the
      host cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In the first case, there is a risk of disruption of the
      metabolic external flux of the host cell, while lysing the viral
      envelope brings several benefits. It tends to annihilate skinned
      alive virus, making it unable to recognise the binding site and
      more importantly, it eliminates the proteins responsible for the
      adsorption of the virus on the membrane of the host cell. The
      virus and the cell can not merge, the virus left outside the cell
      dies.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] It dies without any interference on the viral genome, in a
      way, by a mechanical action, limiting the risk of viral mutations
      which arise contrariwise to the mode of action of the virustatic.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] This indifference towards virus' genetic heritage explains
      the effectiveness of these virucides on resistant mutant viruses
      to various new virucides available on the market.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="us2010016.jpg" height="224"
          width="366"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b>Mode of Action</b><br>
      <br>
      [0012] The mode of action of virucides having a structure of
      di-tert-butyl such as BHT (butylhydroxytoluene) has been
      demonstrated in clinical trials against double-blind placebo in
      humans, by the disappearance or abortion of the herpes simply by
      application of a topical medicine from the onset.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Unlike the molecules acting on DNA, which induce a growth
      slow down, BHT is not involved in viral synthesis. One should
      seeks the origin of the properties of BHT elsewhere, in fact,
      Brugha M Jr, in an article published in "Science", demonstrated
      two points:<br>
      <br>
      first, that chickens receiving food containing 200 ppm BHT were
      protected against infection inoculated by the virus responsible of
      the Newcastle disease (VMN). He noted a decrease in
      sero-conversion proportional to the administered BHT dose.
      Extending its experiment with cultures of pre-treated embryonic
      chicken cells with 25 [mu]g/ml BHT, he discovered that virus
      production is reduced by 65%.<br>
      second, that BHT inhibited the development of RNA virus (VMN) as
      well as that the development of DNA virus (VHS). He mentioned as a
      reason for this effect, a possible alteration of the envelope of
      the virus by the hydrophobic properties of BHT, although the
      effect of agonist VMN on the aggregation of chicken's
      erythrocytes-known characteristic of the membrane of this
      virion-is not changed, which seemed to him contradictory.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] This hypothesis also proposed by Reimund and Cupp suggests
      that a modification of the geometry of the virus' lipid envelopes
      should prevent them to bind the membrane of the host cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Using electron microscopy, WINSTON, however, highlights the
      alteration, or even the break, of the virus' lipid envelopes,
      under the effect of treatment with BHT. BAMFORD demonstrates that
      the alteration of the viral envelope leads to the elimination of a
      protein (P3) responsible of the adsorption of the virus on the
      membrane of the host cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] It remained to demonstrate the physico-chemical mechanism
      of these reactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Studying by electronic spin resonance, the composition of
      lipid envelopes, Aloia reveals the fluidity of enveloped-virus'
      membrane and in particular of HIV's membrane, under the effect of
      heat or BHT. By changing the composition of lipid envelopes and
      the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio, the BHT reduces the membrane
      rigidity by disrupting its structure. This disruption, coupled
      with the loss of adsorption ability, prevents any recognition and
      any binding of the virus on the membrane of the host cell. ALOIA
      experimentally confirm that 30 minutes incubation at 37[deg.] C.
      in 320 [mu]g/ml BHT causes a decrease in viral infectivity on H9
      lymphocytes, by a logarithmic factor of 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] With AVF1 (3.5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoate
      octa-oxy-ethylene glycol), a substance derived from BHT, one
      manages to decrease HIV's infectivity by 7 log.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In summary, BHT's mode of action is complex:<br>
      <br>
      virucidal, lysis of the protein-lipid envelope is explained by the
      hydrophobic properties of BHT. By promoting the binding with the
      transmembrane protein of the viral envelope they induce a
      modification of the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio responsible of
      the structural disruption of the envelope, its dehiscence and the
      expulsion of the viral adsorption protein.<br>
      fusion-inhibitor through inability to identify and to merge on the
      cellular binding site.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Without cytopathic action on cells at effective doses, BHT
      is non-toxic for the organism, it only targets the membrane
      encoded by the virus and not the one of the host cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Through these complex reactions, viruses and membrane are
      no longer compatible. Key and lock being changed, the virus can
      not open the doors of the host cell for its reproduction. It dies
      being phagocyted.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The lipophilic properties of BHT and its specific mode of
      action, precise and limited, led to think that the group
      di-phenyl-tert-butyl may play a predominant role. It was therefore
      imperative for us to increase the availability of the molecule
      without altering its structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] For this purpose, the invention proposes the preparation of
      compound D-glucopyranose 1-[3,5-bis
      (1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxybenzoate] defined by the following
      formula:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The process of preparation of the compound D-glucopyranose
      1-[3,5-bis (1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxybenzoate] comprises the
      following steps:<br>
      <br>
      the production of the chloride of the
      3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid,<br>
      a esterification by the reaction of the obtained chloride acid and
      the D-glucopyranose.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The compound according to the invention and its potential
      derivatives and additional salts to a mineral or organic acid
      pharmaceutically acceptable may be presented in a composition
      consisting of at least a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] This composition may arise for instance as tablets,
      capsules, dragees, drinkable solutions or suspensions, emulsions,
      suppositories.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In addition to non-toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable
      inert excipients, such as distilled water, glucose, lactose from
      starch, talc, vegetable oils, ethylene glycol . . . , the
      compositions thus obtained can also contain preservation agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Other active ingredients may be added to these compositions
      such as 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenoic acid (BG4) or
      3.5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoate octa-oxy-ethylene glycol
      (AVF1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The amount of compound according to the invention and any
      other active ingredients in such compositions will vary depending
      on the application, age and weight of the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The synthesis of 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenoic acid (BG4),
      and its halides, such as chloride and bromide, was described in
      the application EP 0 269 981.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] This acid has been proposed for the preparation of
      antiviral drugs for the treatment of diseases linked to infection
      of a person by viruses having a lipid envelope and especially the
      herpes virus, or AIDS.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The compound of the present invention has several
      advantages particularly with regard to the BHT and
      3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenoic acid (BG4):<br>
      <br>
      Better solubility in water which facilitates the development of
      pharmaceutical preparations for a more suitable product,<br>
      Virucidal activity in lower concentrations,<br>
      A pro drugs effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] An example of preparing a compound according to the
      invention will be described below, as a non-limiting example.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The process of preparing about one kilogramme of the
      compound D-glucopyranose 1-[3,5-bis
      (1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxybenzoate comprises the following
      steps:<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The first step comprises the synthesis of acid chloride<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In a flask, 700 grams of 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenoic
      acid are dissolved while stirring, in 1400 ml of dioxane. Then,
      450 grams of thionyl chloride (3 equivalents) are introduced and
      the mixture is heated to 80[deg.] C. for 3 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The progress of the reaction is monitored by thin layer
      chromatography (TLC). Once the reaction is completed, the excess
      of thionyl chloride is removed by evaporation under vacuum and
      then the mixture is incorporated in 1400 ml of dioxane.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The second step comprises an esterification<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In a flask, 360 grams of D-glucopyranose are dissolved in
      500 ml of dioxane, then 170 ml of pyridine are added.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The solution obtained during the first step is fed into the
      flask and then the mixture is shaken at 50[deg.] C. for 3 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The progress of the reaction is monitored by thin layer
      chromatography (TLC), the reference front or RF is 0.05 using a
      mixture toluene/formic acid/acetone and phthalate para-anisidine
      as a developer,<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Once the reaction is completed, solvents are eliminated by
      evaporation under vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Then the gross product is dissolved in a mixture of
      water/ethyl acetate (to a total of 10 liters). After settling and
      washing the organic phase with acidic water, the latter is
      concentrated. The product thus obtained is recrystallized by a
      mixture of ethanol/water mixture (20 liters) and then filtered on
      frit and dried.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The compound RDW031 of a molecular weight of 412.54 g.mol-1
      is obtained with a purity of 98% controlled by liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) and further characterized by proton NMR at
      400 MHz in deuterated chloroform.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The compound RDW031 of the present invention has several
      advantages over BHT and the 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenoic acid
      (BG4):<br>
      <br>
      a better water solubility which facilitates the development of
      pharmaceutical preparations best suited for a drug.<br>

      Reduction expressed in log<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Expressed in Mol, the comparisons are in favor of the new
      molecule RDW 031, which acts at concentrations inferior to a log
      for a substantially identical inhibitory activity:<br>
      <br>
      BG 4: from 0.5% to 1%, i.e.: 0.04 to 0.02 Mol,<br>
      AVF1: from 0.5% to 1%, i.e.: 0.0083 at 0166 Mol (8.3*10&lt;-3
      &gt;to 1.66*10&lt;-2 &gt;Mol)<br>
      RDW031 active at concentration starting of 0.0625%, i.e.: 0.0015
      Mol (1.5*10&lt;-3 &gt;Mol)<br>
      <br>
      [0067] It is worth recalling that the BHT, which has a very low
      toxicity, thus remaining a reference molecule, act on
      enveloped-viruses only at concentrations of 8 to 10%, that is to
      say at molars concentrations of 0.3 to 0.4 Mol that are 100 times
      stronger than RDW 031.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Thus, the D-glucopyranose 1-[3,5-bis (1,
      1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxybenzoate] is a new molecule that
      combines a better solubility, a greater virucidal activity at
      lower doses than those of BHT and BG4.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] As these molecules, the hydrophilic pole leads to the
      disintegration of the viral envelope of the virus herpes simplex
      (VHS) and has no effect on polio virus (naked-virus).<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Its activity concerns all enveloped-viruses and
      particularly the AIDS virus for which promising studies are
      underway for various pharmaceutical packaging: film-coated tablets
      for oral administration in combination or in substitution of
      protease inhibitors when they are poorly supported.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The very low cyto-toxicity and high therapeutic scope eases
      the use with children. Without interference on the viral and human
      genome, it is possible first-line medication in pregnant women.
      All studies on rats have never shown any detectable effects on
      progeny nor on mutagenic effect, as this is expected with active
      virucide without interference on the viral or human genome.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The invention is a serious step forward in the battle
      against enveloped-viruses and especially against AIDS. One can
      hope viruses eradication by disappearance of viral loads which is
      not accessible to current virustatic that block partially the
      viral replication without killing the virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The therapeutic failures force the proliferation of drug
      combinations.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Only virucide can totally eliminate the virus colonies and
      allow the revival of the white line of CD 4 lymphocytes in
      particular and to restore the immune system of the body that HIV
      paralysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] At the end of the regulatory pharmaco-toxicological tests,
      studies on humans will began.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] From now on clinical trials on avian and porcine influenza
      will be undertaken. They will guide future studies.<br>

      [0045] The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
      (NIAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
      have classified a number of viruses as potential agents of
      bioterrorism (www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp). The
      highest threat agents, the Category A pathogens, have the greatest
      potential for adverse public health impact and mass casualties if
      used in ill-intentioned ways. Within the Category A pathogens,
      there are a number of viruses that can cause viral hemorrhagic
      fevers with high case fatality rates. The Category A hemorrhagic
      fever viruses pose serious threats as potential biological weapons
      because: 1) they can be disseminated through aerosols; 2) a low
      dose (1-10 plaque forming unit (pfu)) can cause disease; 3) they
      cause severe morbidity and mortality (case fatality rates of
      15-30%); 4) they can cause fear and panic in the general public;
      5) there are no U.S.-approved effective vaccines or specific
      antivirals available; 6) these pathogens are easily available and
      can be readily produced in large quantities; and 7) research on
      weaponizing various hemorrhagic fever viruses has been
      conducted.&lt;1 &gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a genome that
      consists of two single-stranded RNA segments designated small (S,
      3.5Kb) and large (L, 7.5Kb), both with an ambisense coding
      arrangement.&lt;36 &gt;The S RNA segment encodes the major
      structural proteins, nucleocapsid protein (NP) and a precursor
      envelope protein (GPC) encoding two envelope glycoproteins
      (external GP1 and transmembrane GP2),&lt;18, 24, 30, 31 &gt;and
      the L RNA segment encodes the RNA polymerase protein L and an 11
      KDa protein, Z protein, with putative regulatory function.&lt;19
      &gt;GP1 and GP2, which form the tetrameric surface glycoprotein
      spike, are responsible for virus entry into targeted host cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The family Arenaviridae consists of a single genus
      (Arenavirus) that includes several viruses (currently 23
      recognized viruses&lt;1&gt;) causing severe hemorrhagic fever
      diseases in humans.&lt;2 &gt;The Arenaviridae family has been
      divided into two groups according to sequence-based phylogeny. The
      "Old World" group, originated from Africa, includes the human
      pathogens lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus and Lassa
      virus. The "New World" group, originated from Latin America, is
      divided into 3 clades. Clade B includes in addition to Tacaribe
      and Amapari viruses, the Category A human pathogenic viruses Junín
      (Argentine hemorrhagic fever), Machupo (Bolivian hemorrhagic
      fever), Guanarito (Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever), and Sabiá
      (Brazilian hemorrhagic fever). These Category A viruses are
      capable of causing severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever
      disease in humans.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Rodents are the natural host of arenaviruses, although
      Tacaribe virus is found in bats. The arenaviruses
      characteristically produce chronic viremic infections in their
      natural host,&lt;15 &gt;which in turn shed virus in their urine
      and feces, ultimately infecting humans in close contact with these
      infected materials either by aerosol or direct contact with skin
      abrasions or cuts. The natural history of the human disease is
      determined by the pathogenicity of the virus, its geographical
      distribution, the habitat and the habits of the rodent reservoir
      host, and the nature of the human-rodent interaction.&lt;21 &gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Several Arenaviruses are associated with severe hemorrhagic
      disease in human. Lassa virus (from the Old World group) is
      responsible for Lassa hemorrhagic fever, while 4 viruses from the
      New World group (all from Clade B) cause severe hemorrhagic fever
      in human. Those viruses are: Junin virus responsible for Argentine
      hemorrhagic fever, Machupo virus for Bolivian hemorrhagic fever
      and Guanarito virus for Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever. Sabia virus
      was isolated from a fatal case of hemorrhagic fever in Brazil. It
      is estimated that Lassa virus causes 100,000-300,000 infections
      and approximately 5,000 deaths annually.&lt;5 &gt;So far an
      estimated 30,000 confirmed cases of Junin infections have been
      documented, while about 2,000 of Machupo, 200 of Guanarito and
      only 2 of Sabia.&lt;1 &gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Recent concerns over the use of Arenaviruses as biological
      weapons have underscored the necessity of developing small
      molecule therapeutics that target these viruses.&lt;1 &gt;The
      availability of antiviral drugs directed at these viruses would
      provide treatment and a strong deterrent against their use as
      biowarfare agents. Since antiviral drugs can be easily
      administered (oral pill or liquid) and exert their antiviral
      effect within hours of administration, they will serve to
      effectively treat diseased patients, protect those suspected of
      being exposed to the pathogen (post-exposure prophylaxis), and
      assist in the timely containment of an outbreak.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Currently, there are no virus-specific treatments approved
      for use against Arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers. Present disease
      management consists of general supportive care: monitoring and
      correcting fluid, electrolyte and osmotic imbalances and treating
      hemorrhaging with clotting factor or platelet replacement.
      Convalescent immune serum therapy may be effective in treating
      cases of Junin and Machupo virus disease, but the availability of
      such serum is extremely limited.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Ribavirin, a nucleoside analog, has been used with some
      success in Lassa fever patients. In small trials, intravenous
      ribavirin given to patients within the first 6 days after
      development of fever decreased mortality from 76% to 9%.&lt;7-9
      &gt;A controlled trial of 18 patients with Argentine hemorrhagic
      fever resulted in 13% mortality in treated patients compared with
      40% in untreated patients.&lt;10 &gt;Ribavirin therapy is
      associated with adverse effects including a dose-related,
      reversible hemolytic anemia an d also has demonstrated
      teratogenicity and embryo lethality in several animal species. It
      is therefore classified as a pregnancy category X drug,
      contraindicated during pregnancy. Intravenous ribavirin is
      available in limited supplies in the U.S. for compassionate use
      under an FND application. The dosing regimen for ribavirin therapy
      that has been used in cases of Lassa fever consists of an initial
      30 mg/kg intravenous (IV) loading dose, followed by 16 mg/kg IV
      every 6 hours for 4 days; then 8 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 6 days
      (total treatment time 10 days). The cost of treatment for an adult
      male is approximately $800. The attributes of ribavirin make it
      less than ideal for the treatment of Arenavirus hemorrhagic
      fevers.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] A number of in vitro inhibitors of Arenavirus replication
      have been reported in the literature including phenothiazines,
      trifluoroperazine and chlorpromazine,&lt;1
      &gt;amantadine,&lt;12,13 &gt;brassinosteroids&lt;14 &gt;and
      actinomycin D.&lt;15 &gt;The anti-Arenavirus activities of these
      compounds are generally weak and non-specific.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The only Arenavirus hemorrhagic fever for which studies
      have been undertaken toward development of a vaccine has been
      Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) caused by Junin virus. A
      live-attenuated vaccine, called Candid 1, has been evaluated in
      controlled trials among agricultural workers in AHF-endemic areas,
      where it appeared to reduce the number of reported AHF cases with
      no serious side effects.&lt;16 &gt;It is not known if the Candid 1
      vaccine would be useful against other Arenavirus hemorrhagic
      fevers and this vaccine is not available in the United States of
      America.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Tacaribe virus is a biosafety level 2 (BSL 2) New World
      arenavirus (NWA) that is found in clade B and phylogenetically
      related to the Category A NWA (Junín, Machupo, Guanarito and
      Sabiá). Tacaribe virus is 67% to 78% identical to Junín virus at
      the amino acid level for all four viral proteins. In order to
      screen for inhibitors of NWA a high-throughput screening (HTS)
      assay for virus replication was developed using Tacaribe virus as
      a surrogate for Category A NWA. A 400,000 small molecule library
      was screened using this HTS assay. A lead series was chosen based
      on drug properties and this series was optimized through iterative
      chemistry resulting in the identity of a highly active and
      specific small molecule inhibitor of Tacaribe virus with selective
      activity against human pathogenic NWA (Junín, Machupo, Guanarito
      and Sabiá). This molecule demonstrates favorable pharmacodynamic
      properties which permitted the demonstration of in vivo
      anti-arenavirus activity in a newborn mouse model.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] All human pathogens Arenaviruses from the New World group
      causing hemorrhagic fever are from the Clade B. These human
      pathogen viruses require manipulation under high-level containment
      (BSL-4). However, Amapari and Tacaribe viruses also from Clade B
      can be grown in tissue culture under BSL-2 (low-level)
      containment. Working under low-level containment makes
      experimentations easier and safer with these viruses. While
      Amapari virus produces low cytopathic effect, Tacaribe virus can
      be grown readily in cell culture and produce robust CPE in 4 to 6
      days. Since this CPE is directly related to viral replication,
      compounds that inhibit virus replication in cell culture can be
      identified readily as conferring protection from virus-induced CPE
      (although it is theoretically possible to inhibit CPE without
      inhibiting virus replication). Moreover, compounds having
      identified activity against Tacaribe virus will also likely be
      active against Arenavirus human pathogen causing hemorrhagic fever
      (Junin, Machupo, Guanarito and Sabia) given the high degree of
      homology (around 70% identity for all 4 proteins of Tacaribe virus
      compared to Junin virus, with long stretch of protein with perfect
      identity) between these viruses.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] What is needed in the art are new therapies and preventives
      for the treatment of viral infections and associated diseases,
      such as caused by hemorrhagic fever viruses like Arenaviruses.<br>

      [0168] In one embodiment, the mammal being treated is a human. In
      particular embodiments, the viral infection being treated is a
      hemorrhagic fever virus, such as an Areanvirus. The Arenavirus may
      be selected from the group consisting of Junin, Machupo,
      Guanavito, Sabia, and Lassa.<br>
      <br>
      [0169] These and other objects, advantages, and features of the
      invention will become apparent to those persons skilled in the art
      upon reading the details of the methods and formulations as more
      fully described below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0170] FIG. 1 provides the chemical structure, formula, and
      molecular weight of ST-336.<br>
      <br>
      [0171] FIG. 2 shows the effect of the time of addition of ST-336
      on Tacaribe virus yield and plaque formation. In FIG. 2A, Vero
      cells were infected with Tacaribe virus at a MOI=0.01. ST-336 was
      added prior to or during Tacaribe infection (-1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,
      18 or 21 hrs p.i.). At 24 hrs p.i., virus yields were determined
      by plaque assay. In FIG. 2B, Vero cells were infected with 400 pfu
      Tacaribe virus. ST-336 was added for 1 hour before the infection
      (-1), for 1 hour during adsorption (0), and for 1 hour after the
      infection (+1). Infected monolayers were washed with PBS and
      overlayed with medium containing agarose. Five days
      post-infection, cells were glutaraldehyde fixed and crystal violet
      stained prior to plaque counting.<br>
      <br>
      [0172] FIG. 3 shows that ST-336 binds with slow Koff to intact
      Tacaribe virion in the absence of cells. In FIG. 3A, a diagram of
      the virus dilution scheme prior to plating is is provided. The
      virus mixed with ST-336 and diluted (left side) or virus diluted
      and ST-336 added after dilution (right side). In FIG. 3B, pictures
      of the plaques that resulted after plating each dilution shown in
      FIG. 3A on Vero cells is provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0173] FIG. 4 shows the mapping of ST-336 drug resistant variants
      ("DRVs"). In FIG. 4A, a linear map of the glycoprotein precursor
      ("GPC") showing the location of the signal peptide ("SP"),
      transmembrane domain ("TM"), the cleavage site between GP1 and GP2
      (K261-A262), the location of the four ST-336 resistant mutants
      ("DR #1-4"), and the amino acid change for each is provided. In
      FIG. 4B, the amino acid sequence alignment of GP2 from wild type
      NWA and ST 336 DRVs is shown. Shown is the amino acid sequence of
      the C-terminal portion of GP2 (amino acids 397 to 457) containing
      the transmembrane domain (marked by vertical lines), the location
      of the mutations for DR#1-4 (underlined), and the amino acid
      difference in Amapari (in bold).<br>
      <br>
      [0174] FIG. 5 provides the chemical structure, formula, and
      molecular weight for ST-294.<br>
      <br>
      [0175] FIG. 6 shows the effect of ST-294 in newborn mice
      challenged with Tacaribe virus. Four day old BALB/c mice were
      infected IP with 30*LD50 Tacarbide virus and treated daily for 10
      days with vehicle (control), ribavarin at 25 mg/kg, ST-294 twice a

      [0176] As above, this invention relates to compounds which are
      useful for the treatment and prophylaxis of viral infections, as
      well as diseases associated with viral infections in living hosts.
      In particular, the present invention provides compounds and
      compositions and/or methods for the treatment and prophylaxis of
      hemorrhagic fever viruses, such as Arenaviruses. However, prior to
      describing this invention in further detail, the following terms
      will first be defined.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DEFINITIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0177] In accordance with this detailed description, the following
      abbreviations and definitions apply. It must be noted that as used
      herein, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the" include plural
      referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
      <br>
      [0178] The publications discussed herein are provided solely for
      their disclosure. Nothing herein is to be construed as an
      admission that the present invention is not entitled to antedate
      such publication by virtue of prior invention. Further, the dates
      of publication provided may be different from the actual
      publication dates, which may need to be independently confirmed.<br>
      <br>
      [0179] Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that
      each intervening value is encompassed within the invention. The
      upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may independently
      be included in the smaller, subject to any specifically excluded
      limit in the stated range. Where the stated range includes one or
      both of the limits, ranges excluding either both of those included
      limits are also included in the invention. Also contemplated are
      any values that fall within the cited ranges.<br>
      <br>
      [0180] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific
      terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by
      one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.
      Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those
      described herein can also be used in the practice or testing of
      the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are now
      described. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated
      herein by reference to disclose and describe the methods and/or
      materials in connection with which the publications are cited.<br>
      <br>
      [0181] By "patient" or "subject" is meant to include any mammal. A
      "mammal", for purposes of treatment, refers to any animal
      classified as a mammal, including but not limited to humans,
      domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such
      as dogs, horses, cats, cows, and the like. Preferably, the mammal
      is human.<br>
      <br>
      [0182] The term "efficacy" as used herein in the context of a
      chronic dosage regime refers to the effectiveness of a particular
      treatment regime. Efficacy can be measured based on change the
      course of the disease in response to an agent of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0183] The term "success" as used herein in the context of a
      chronic treatment regime refers to the effectiveness of a
      particular treatment regime. This includes a balance of efficacy,
      toxicity (e.g., side effects and patient tolerance of a
      formulation or dosage unit), patient compliance, and the like. For
      a chronic administration regime to be considered "successful" it
      must balance different aspects of patient care and efficacy to
      produce the most favorable patient outcome.<br>
      <br>
      [0184] The terms "treating", "treatment", and the like are used
      herein to refer to obtaining a desired pharmacological and
      physiological effect. The effect may be prophylactic in terms of
      preventing or partially preventing a disease, symptom or condition
      thereof and/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or
      complete cure of a disease, condition, symptom or adverse effect
      attributed to the disease. The term "treatment", as used herein,
      covers any treatment of a disease in a mammal, particularly a
      human, and includes: (a) preventing the disease from occurring in
      a subject which may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet
      been diagnosed as having it, i.e., causing the clinical symptoms
      of the disease not to develop in a subject that may be predisposed
      to the disease but does not yet experience or display symptoms of
      the disease; (b) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting or
      reducing the development of the disease or its clinical symptoms;
      or (c) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the
      disease and/or its symptoms or conditions. The invention is
      directed towards treating a patient's suffering from disease
      related to pathological inflammation. The present invention is
      involved in preventing, inhibiting, or relieving adverse effects
      attributed to pathological inflammation over long periods of time
      and/or are such caused by the physiological responses to
      inappropriate inflammation present in a biological system over
      long periods of time.<br>

      the disease not to develop in a mammal that may be exposed to or
      predisposed to the disease but does not yet experience or display
      symptoms of the disease,<br>
      (2) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting or reducing the
      development of the disease or its clinical symptoms, or<br>
      (3) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease
      or its clinical symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      [0235] A "therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of a
      compound or antibody that, when administered to a mammal for
      treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the
      disease. The "therapeutically effective amount" will vary
      depending on the compound, the disease and its severity and the
      age, weight, etc., of the mammal to be treated.<br>
      <br>
      Pharmaceutical Formulations of the Compounds<br>
      <br>
      [0236] In general, the compounds of the subject invention will be
      administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the
      accepted modes of administration for these compounds. The
      compounds can be administered by a variety of routes, including,
      but not limited to, oral, parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous,
      subdural, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal,
      intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intraarterial, or intralesional
      routes of administration), topical, intranasal, localized (e.g.,
      surgical application or surgical suppository), rectal, and
      pulmonary (e.g., aerosols, inhalation, or powder). Accordingly,
      these compounds are effective as both injectable and oral
      compositions. The compounds can be administered continuously by
      infusion or by bolus injection. Preferably, the compounds are
      administered by parenteral routes. More preferably, the compounds
      are administered by intravenous routes. Such compositions are
      prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art.<br>
      <br>
      [0237] The actual amount of the compound of the subject invention,
      i.e., the active ingredient, will depend on a number of factors,
      such as the severity of the disease, i.e., the condition or
      disease to be treated, age and relative health of the subject, the
      potency of the compound used, the route and form of
      administration, and other factors.<br>
      <br>
      [0238] Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be
      determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures
      or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose
      lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose
      therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose
      ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic
      index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds
      that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0239] The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal
      studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in
      humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a
      range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with
      little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range
      depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of
      administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of
      the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated
      initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in
      animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range
      which includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test
      compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as
      determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more
      accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may
      be measured, for example, by high performance liquid
      chromatography. The effective blood level of the compounds of the
      subject invention is preferably greater than or equal to 10 ng/ml.<br>
      <br>
      [0240] The amount of the pharmaceutical composition administered
      to the patient will vary depending upon what is being
      administered, the purpose of the administration, such as
      prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of
      administration, and the like, hi therapeutic applications,
      compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from
      a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially
      arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. An
      amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as "therapeutically
      effective dose." Amounts effective for this use will depend on the
      disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the
      attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of
      the inflammation, the age, weight and general condition of the
      patient, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0241] The compositions administered to a patient are in the form
      of pharmaceutical compositions described supra. These compositions
      may be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may
      be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be
      packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized
      preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to
      administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will
      be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most
      preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain
      of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result
      in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.<br>
      <br>
      [0242] The active compound is effective over a wide dosage range
      and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically or
      therapeutically effective amount. The therapeutic dosage of the
      compounds of the present invention will vary according to, for
      example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the
      manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition
      of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. For
      example, for intravenous administration, the dose will typically
      be in the range of about 0.5 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram body
      weight, preferably about 3 mg to about 50 mg per kilogram body
      weight. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response
      curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.
      Typically, the clinician will administer the compound until a
      dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0243] When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the
      subject invention are usually administered in the form of
      pharmaceutical compositions. This invention also includes
      pharmaceutical compositions, which contain as the active
      ingredient, one or more of the compounds of the subject invention
      above, associated with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable
      carriers or excipients. The excipient employed is typically one
      suitable for administration to human subjects or other mammals. In
      making the compositions of this invention, the active ingredient
      is usually mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or
      enclosed within a carrier which can be in the form of a capsule,
      sachet, paper or other container. When the excipient serves as a
      diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which
      acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient.
      Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills,
      powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions,
      emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid
      medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of
      the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules,
      suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged
      powders.<br>
      <br>
      [0244] In preparing a formulation, it may be necessary to mill the
      active compound to provide the appropriate particle size prior to
      combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is
      substantially insoluble, it ordinarily is milled to a particle
      size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is
      substantially water soluble, the particle size is normally
      adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform
      distribution in the formulation, e.g., about 40 mesh.<br>
      <br>
      [0245] Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose,
      dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia,
      calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium
      silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone,
      cellulose, sterile water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The
      formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as
      talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents;
      emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as
      methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and
      flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be
      formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of
      the active ingredient after administration to the patient by
      employing procedures known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0246] The quantity of active compound in the pharmaceutical
      composition and unit dosage form thereof may be varied or adjusted
      widely depending upon the particular application, the manner or
      introduction, the potency of the particular compound, and the
      desired concentration. The term "unit dosage forms" refers to
      physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human
      subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined
      quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired
      therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical
      excipient. The concentration of therapeutically active compound
      may vary from about 1 mg/ml to 250 g/ml.<br>
      <br>
      [0247] Preferably, the compound can be formulated for parenteral
      administration in a suitable inert carrier, such as a sterile
      physiological saline solution. For example, the concentration of
      compound in the carrier solution is typically between about 1-100
      mg/ml. The dose administered will be determined by route of
      administration. Preferred routes of administration include
      parenteral or intravenous administration. A therapeutically
      effective dose is a dose effective to produce a significant
      steroid tapering. Preferably, the amount is sufficient to produce
      a statistically significant amount of steroid tapering in a
      subject.<br>
      <br>
      [0248] Administration of therapeutic agents by intravenous
      formulation is well known in the pharmaceutical industry. An
      intravenous formulation should possess certain qualities aside
      from being just a composition in which the therapeutic agent is
      soluble. For example, the formulation should promote the overall
      stability of the active ingredient(s), also, the manufacture of
      the formulation should be cost effective. All of these factors
      ultimately determine the overall success and usefulness of an
      intravenous formulation.<br>
      <br>
      [0249] Other accessory additives that may be included in
      pharmaceutical formulations of compounds of the present invention
      as follow: solvents: ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol;
      stabilizers: EDTA (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid), citric
      acid; antimicrobial preservatives: benzyl alcohol, methyl paraben,
      propyl paraben; buffering agents: citric acid/sodium citrate,
      potassium hydrogen tartrate, sodium hydrogen tartrate, acetic
      acid/sodium acetate, maleic acid/sodium maleate, sodium hydrogen
      phthalate, phosphoric acid/potassium dihydrogen phosphate,
      phosphoric acid/disodium hydrogen phosphate; and tonicity
      modifiers: sodium chloride, mannitol, dextrose.<br>
      <br>
      [0250] The presence of a buffer is necessary to maintain the
      aqueous pH in the range of from about 4 to about 8 and more
      preferably in a range of from about 4 to about 6. The buffer
      system is generally a mixture of a weak acid and a soluble salt
      thereof, e.g., sodium citrate/citric acid; or the monocation or
      dication salt of a dibasic acid, e.g., potassium hydrogen
      tartrate; sodium hydrogen tartrate, phosphoric acid/potassium
      dihydrogen phosphate, and phosphoric acid/disodium hydrogen
      phosphate.<br>
      <br>
      [0251] The amount of buffer system used is dependent on (1) the
      desired pH; and (2) the amount of drug. Generally, the amount of
      buffer used is in a 0.5:1 to 50:1 mole ratio of buffenalendronate
      (where the moles of buffer are taken as the combined moles of the
      buffer ingredients, e.g., sodium citrate and citric acid) of
      formulation to maintain a pH in the range of 4 to 8 and generally,
      a 1:1 to 10:1 mole ratio of buffer (combined) to drug present is
      used.<br>
      <br>
      [0252] A useful buffer in the invention is sodium citrate/citric
      acid in the range of 5 to 50 mg per ml. sodium citrate to 1 to 15
      mg per ml. citric acid, sufficient to maintain an aqueous pH of
      4-6 of the composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0253] The buffer agent may also be present to prevent the
      precipitation of the drug through soluble metal complex formation
      with dissolved metal ions, e.g., Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, Ba, which may
      leach out of glass containers or rubber stoppers or be present in
      ordinary tap water. The agent may act as a competitive complexing
      agent with the drug and produce a soluble metal complex leading to
      the presence of undesirable particulates.<br>
      <br>
      [0254] In addition, the presence of an agent, e.g., sodium
      chloride in an amount of about of 1-8 mg/ml, to adjust the
      tonicity to the same value of human blood may be required to avoid
      the swelling or shrinkage of erythrocytes upon administration of
      the intravenous formulation leading to undesirable side effects
      such as nausea or diarrhea and possibly to associated blood
      disorders. In general, the tonicity of the formulation matches
      that of human blood which is in the range of 282 to 288 mOsm/kg,
      and in general is 285 mOsm/kg, which is equivalent to the osmotic
      pressure corresponding to a 0.9% solution of sodium chloride.<br>
      <br>
      [0255] The intravenous formulation can be administered by direct
      intravenous injection, i.v. bolus, or can be administered by
      infusion by addition to an appropriate infusion solution such as
      0.9% sodium chloride injection or other compatible infusion
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0256] The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage
      form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about 100 mg, more
      usually about 10 to about 30 mg, of the active ingredient. The
      term "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units
      suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals,
      each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material
      calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in
      association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
      <br>
      [0257] The active compound is effective over a wide dosage range
      and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective
      amount. It, will be understood, however, that the amount of the
      compound actually administered will be determined by a physician,
      in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the
      condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the
      actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the
      individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and
      the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0258] For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the
      principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical
      excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a
      homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When
      referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it
      is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout
      the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided
      into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills
      and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into
      unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for
      example, 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0259] The tablets or pills of the present invention may be coated
      or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the
      advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can
      comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter
      being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two
      components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to
      resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner
      component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in
      release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric
      layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric
      acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as
      shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.<br>
      <br>
      [0260] The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the
      present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or
      by injection include aqueous solutions suitably flavored syrups,
      aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible
      oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut
      oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      [0261] Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include
      solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous
      or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid
      or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically
      acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the
      compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory
      route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably
      pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of
      inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the
      nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a
      face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing
      machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions may be
      administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices which
      deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0262] The compounds of this invention can be administered in a
      sustained release form. Suitable examples of sustained-release
      preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic
      polymers containing the protein, which matrices are in the form of
      shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of
      sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (e.g.,
      poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) as described by Langer et al.,
      J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 15: 167-277 (1981) and Langer, Chem. Tech.
      12: 98-105 (1982) or poly(vinyl alcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat.
      No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma
      ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., Biopolymers 22: 547-556, 1983),
      non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (Langer et ah, supra),
      degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON
      DEPOT(TM) (i.e., injectable microspheres composed of lactic
      acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and
      poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP-133,988).<br>
      <br>
      [0263] The compounds of this invention can be administered in a
      sustained release form, for example a depot injection, implant
      preparation, or osmotic pump, which can be formulated in such a
      manner as to permit a sustained release of the active ingredient.
      Implants for sustained release formulations are well-known in the
      art. Implants may be formulated as, including but not limited to,
      microspheres, slabs, with biodegradable or non-biodegradable
      polymers. For example, polymers of lactic acid and/or glycolic
      acid form an erodible polymer that is well-tolerated by the host.
      The implant is placed in proximity to the site of protein deposits
      (e.g., the site of formation of amyloid deposits associated with
      neurodegenerative disorders), so that the local concentration of
      active agent is increased at that site relative to the rest of the
      body.<br>

      [0298] Another preferred formulation employed in the methods of
      the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices
      ("patches"). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide
      continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the
      present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use
      of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents
      is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,023,252,
      issued Jun. 11, 1991, herein incorporated by reference. Such
      patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand
      delivery of pharmaceutical agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0299] Direct or indirect placement techniques may be used when it
      is desirable or necessary to introduce the pharmaceutical
      composition to the brain. Direct techniques usually involve
      placement of a drug delivery catheter into the host's ventricular
      system to bypass the blood-brain barrier. One such implantable
      delivery system used for the transport of biological factors to
      specific anatomical regions of the body is described in U.S. Pat.
      No. 5,011,472, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0300] Indirect techniques, which are generally preferred, usually
      involve formulating the compositions to provide for drug
      latentiation by the conversion of hydrophilic drugs into
      lipid-soluble drugs. Latentiation is generally achieved through
      blocking of the hydroxy, carbonyl, sulfate, and primary amine
      groups present on the drug to render the drug more lipid soluble
      and amenable to transportation across the blood-brain barrier.
      Alternatively, the delivery of hydrophilic drugs may be enhanced
      by intra-arterial infusion of hypertonic solutions which can
      transiently open the blood-brain barrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0301] In order to enhance serum half-life, the compounds may be
      encapsulated, introduced into the lumen of liposomes, prepared as
      a colloid, or other conventional techniques may be employed which
      provide an extended serum half-life of the compounds. A variety of
      methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in,
      e.g., Szoka et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728 and
      4,837,028 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0302] Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are suitable
      for use in a variety of drug delivery systems. Suitable
      formulations for use in the present invention are found in
      Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mace Publishing Company,
      Philadelphia, Pa., 17th ed. (1985).<br>
      <br>
      Utility<br>
      <br>
      [0303] The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the
      invention show biological activity in treating and preventing
      viral infections and associated diseases, and, accordingly, have
      utility in treating viral infections and associated diseases, such
      as Hemorrhagic fever viruses, in mammals including humans.<br>
      <br>
      [0304] As noted above, the compounds described herein are suitable
      for use in a variety of drug delivery systems described above.
      Additionally, in order to enhance the in vivo serum half life of
      the administered compound, the compounds may be encapsulated,
      introduced into the lumen of liposomes, prepared as a colloid, or
      other conventional techniques may be employed which provide an
      extended serum half life of the compounds. A variety of methods
      are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g.,
      Szoka, et al, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728 and 4,837,028,
      each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0305] The amount of compound administered to the patient will
      vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the
      administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the
      patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In
      therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a
      patient already suffering from AD in an amount sufficient to at
      least partially arrest further onset of the symptoms of the
      disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish
      this is defined as "therapeutically effective dose." Amounts
      effective for this use will depend on the judgment of the
      attending clinician depending upon factors such as the degree or
      severity of AD in the patient, the age, weight and general
      condition of the patient, and the like. Preferably, for use as
      therapeutics, the compounds described herein are administered at
      dosages ranging from about 0.1 to about 500 mg/kg/day.<br>
      <br>
      [0306] In prophylactic applications, compositions are administered
      to a patient at risk of developing AD (determined for example by
      genetic screening or familial trait) in an amount sufficient to
      inhibit the onset of symptoms of the disease. An amount adequate
      to accomplish this is defined as "prophylactically effective
      dose." Amounts effective for this use will depend on the judgment
      of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the age,
      weight and general condition of the patient, and the like.
      Preferably, for use as prophylactics, the compounds described
      herein are administered at dosages ranging from about 0.1 to about
      500 mg/kg/day.<br>
      <br>
      [0307] As noted above, the compounds administered to a patient are
      in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These
      compositions may be sterilized by conventional sterilization
      techniques, or may be sterile filtered. When aqueous solutions are
      employed, these may be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the
      lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous
      carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound
      preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably
      from 5-9 and most preferably from 7 and 8. It will be understood
      that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or
      stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.<br>
      <br>
      [0308] Hemorrhagic fever viruses (HFVs) are RNA viruses that cause
      a variety of disease syndromes with similar clinical
      characteristics. HFVs that are of concern as potential biological
      weapons include but are not limited to: Arenaviridae (Junin,
      Machupo, Guanavito, Sabia and Lassa), Filoviridae (ebola and
      Marburg viruses), Flaviviridae (yellow fever, omsk hemorrhagic
      fever and Kyasanur Forest disease viruses), and Bunyaviridae (Rift
      Valley fever). The naturally occurring arenaviruses and potential
      engineered arenaviruses are included in the Category A Pathogen
      list according to the Center for Disease control and Prevention as
      being among those agents that have greatest potential for mass
      casualties.<br>
      <br>
      [0309] Risk factors include: travel to Africa or Asia, handling of
      animal carcasses, contact with infected animals or people, and/or
      arthropod bites. Arenaviruses are highly infectious after direct
      contact with infected blood and/or bodily secretions. Humans
      usually become infected through contact with infected rodents, the
      bite of an infected arthropod, direct contact with animal
      carcasses, inhalation of infectious rodent excreta and/or
      injection of food contaminated with rodent excreta. The Tacaribe
      virus has been associated with bats. Airborne transmission of
      hemorrhagic fever is another mode, but somewhat less common.
      Person-to-person contact may also occur in some cases.<br>
      <br>
      [0310] All of the hemorrhagic fevers exhibit similar clinical
      symptoms. However, in general the clinical manifestations are
      non-specific and variable. The incubation period is approximately
      7-14 days. The onset is gradual with fever and malaise, tachypnea,
      relative bradycardia, hypotension, circulatory shock,
      conjeunctival injection, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy,
      encephalitis, myalgia, back pain, headache and dizziness, as well
      as hyperesthesia of the skin. Some infected patients may not
      develop hemorrhagic manifestations.<br>
      <br>
      [0311] Methods of diagnosis at specialized laboratories include
      antigen detection by antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA), IgM antibody detection by antibody-capture
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, reverse transcriptase
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and viral isolation. Antigen
      detection (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and reverse
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction are the most useful
      diagnostic techniques in the acute clinical setting. Viral
      isolation is of limited value because it requires a biosafety
      level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory.<br>
      <br>
      [0312] The following synthetic and biological examples are offered
      to illustrate this invention and are not to be construed in any
      way as limiting the scope of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><br>
      <br>
      [0313] The following examples are put forth so as to provide those
      of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and
      description of how to make and use the present invention, and is
      not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as
      their invention nor is it intended to represent that the
      experiments below are all or the only experiments performed.
      Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers
      used (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.) but some experimental
      errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated
      otherwise, parts are parts by weight, molecular weight is weight
      average molecular weight, temperature is in degrees Centigrade,
      and pressure is at or near atmospheric.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Synthesis of Compounds</b><br>
      <br>
      [0314] The compounds of formula I, as well as IA and IB above are
      readily prepared via several divergent synthetic routes with the
      particular route selected relative to the ease of compound
      preparation, the commercial availability of starting materials,
      and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0315] The compounds of Formulae I and II can be prepared from
      readily available starting materials using the following general
      methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical
      or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures,
      times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are
      given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise
      stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular
      reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined
      by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.<br>
      <br>
      [0316] Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the
      art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent
      certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions.
      Suitable protecting groups for various functional groups as well
      as suitable conditions for protecting and deprotecting particular
      functional groups are well known in the art. For example, numerous
      protecting groups are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts,
      Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second Edition, Wiley, New
      York, 1991, and references cited therein.<br>
      <br>
      [0317] Furthermore, the compounds of this invention will typically
      contain one or more chiral centers. Accordingly, if desired, such
      compounds can be prepared or isolated as pure stereoisomers, i.e.,
      as individual enantiomers or diastereomers, or as
      stereoisomer-enriched mixtures. All such stereoisomers (and
      enriched mixtures) are included within the scope of this
      invention, unless otherwise indicated. Pure stereoisomers (or
      enriched mixtures) may be prepared using, for example, optically
      active starting materials or stereoselective reagents well-known
      in the art. Alternatively, racemic mixtures of such compounds can
      be separated using, for example, chiral column chromatography,
      chiral resolving agents and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0318] Unless otherwise indicated, the products of this invention
      are a mixture of R, S enantiomers. Preferably, however, when a
      chiral product is desired, the chiral product can be obtained via
      purification techniques which separates enantiomers from a R, S
      mixture to provide for one or the other stereoisomer. Such
      techniques are known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0319] In another embodiment, the compounds can be provided as
      prodrugs which convert (e.g., hydrolyze, metabolize, etc.) in vivo
      to a compound of Formula I above. In a preferred example of such
      an embodiment, the carboxylic acid group of the compound of
      Formula I is modified into a group which, in vivo, will convert to
      a carboxylic acid group (including salts thereof).<br>
      <br>

      above, it has its generally accepted meaning. Further, all
      temperatures are in degrees Celsius (unless otherwise indicated).
      The following Methods were used to prepare the compounds set forth

      invention in further detail. These examples illustrate suitable
      methods for the synthesis of representative members of this
      invention. However, the methods of synthesis are intended to
      illustrate and not to limit the invention to those exemplified
      below. The starting materials for preparing the compounds of the
      invention are either commercially available or can be conveniently
      prepared by one of examples set forth below or otherwise using
      known chemistry procedures.<br>

      Assay 1<br>
      <br>
      [0331] Approximately 400,000 compounds from the compound library
      were tested in this assay. Assay plates were set up as follows.
      Vero cells were plated at 80% confluency on 96-well plates. Test
      compounds (80 per plate) from the library were added to wells at a
      final concentration of 5 uM. Tacaribe virus (TRVL 11573) was then
      added at a virus dilution that would result in 90% CPE after 5
      days (pre-determined as an 800-fold dilution of the virus stock;
      multiplicity of infection [MOI] approximately 0.001). Plates were
      incubated at 37[deg.] C. and 5% CO2 for 5 days, then fixed with 5%
      glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The extent of
      virus CPE was quantified spectrometrically at OD570 using a
      Molecular Devices VersaMax Tunable Microplate Reader. The
      inhibitory activity of each compound was calculated by subtracting
      from the OD570 of test compound well from the average OD570 of
      virus-infected cell wells, then dividing by the average OD570 of
      mock-infected cell wells. The result represents the percent
      protection against Tacaribe virus CPE activity conferred by the
      compound. "Hits" in this assay were defined as compounds that
      inhibited virus-induced CPE by greater than 50% at the test
      concentration (5 (J.M). Of the approximately 400,000 compounds
      screened in the Tacaribe virus HTS campaign, 2,347 hits were
      identified (0.58% hit rate).<br>
      <br>
      [0332] Quality hits are defined as inhibitor compounds (hits) that
      exhibit acceptable chemical structures, antiviral potency and
      selectivity, and spectrum of antiviral activity. Specifically,
      compounds identified as hits in HTS assays (described above) were
      evaluated against four criteria: (i) chemical tractability, (ii)
      inhibitory potency, (iii) inhibitory selectivity and, (iv)
      antiviral specificity. Based on the HTS parameters, all hits have
      EC50 values &lt;5 uM. The chemical structures of compounds that
      met this initial criterion were visually examined for chemical
      tractability. A chemically tractable compound is defined as an
      entity that is synthetically accessible using reasonable chemical
      methodology, and which possesses chemically stable functionalities
      and (potential) drug-like qualities. Hits that passed this
      medicinal chemistry filter were evaluated for their inhibitory
      potency. EC50 values were determined from a plot of the compound
      inhibitory activity typically across eight compound concentrations
      (50, 15, 5, 1.5, 0.5, 0.15, 0.05 and 0.015 uM). To assess whether
      the hit is a selective inhibitor, the effect on cellular functions
      was determined using a standard cell proliferation assay. A 50%
      cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) was determined using a
      tetrazolium-based colorimetric method, which measures the in situ
      reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
      bromide (MTT) to insoluble blue formazan crystals by mitochondrial
      enzymes in metabolically active cells. Solubilized crystals were
      quantified spectrometrically. Using the EC50 and CC50 values, a
      Selective Index (SI) was calculated (SI=CC50/EC50). Hits with SI
      values of at least 10 were considered further.<br>
      <br>
      [0333] The specificity of the antiviral activity exhibited by hit
      compounds was determined by testing the compounds against a number
      of related and unrelated viruses. Compounds are tested against a
      variety of unrelated DNA (HSV, CMV, vaccinia virus) and RNA (RSV,
      rotavirus, Rift Valley fever, Ebola virus, Ebola GP-pseudotype,
      Lassa GP-pseudotype, HIV env-pseudotype) viruses. Compounds that
      will be selected for further development are thosejha are
      selective against the selected original target virus and inactive
      against unrelated viruses.<br>

      <br>
      [0334] A chemical library was created and screened that represents
      a broad and well-balanced collection of 400,000 compounds
      accumulated over a number of years from a variety of distinct
      sources. The library achieves broad coverage across property space
      involving the following chemical descriptors: calculated logarithm
      of n-octanol/water partition coefficient (ClogP), polar
      (water-accessible surface area (PSA), globularity (three
      dimensional structure) and molecular weight (average: 394.5
      daltons).<br>
      <br>
      Cells and Viruses<br>
      <br>
      [0335] Vero (African green monkey kidney epithelial, ATCC #CCL-81)
      cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM, Gibco)
      supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 25 [mu]g/ml gentamicin, and
      10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). For infection
      medium (IM), the serum concentration was reduced to 2%. HEp-2
      cells (human carcinoma of the larynx epithelial; ATCC #CCL-23)
      were cultured in MEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1%
      penicillin/streptomycin. MRC-5 cells (human normal lung
      fibroblast; ATCC #CCL-171) were cultured in MEM containing 10%
      heat-inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine
      (Invitrogen 25030-081), 1% Non-Essential Amino Acids (Invitrogen
      #11140-050), 1% sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen #11360-070), and 2%
      sodium bicarbonate. MA104 cells (epithelial African green monkey
      kidney, ATCC CRL-2378.1) were cultured in MEM with 1%
      penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, 1% Non-Essential Amino
      Acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 2% sodium bicarbonate and 62.5
      ug/ml trypsin and no serum during virus infection. All cell lines
      were incubated at 37[deg.] C. and 5% CO2. Respiratory syncytial
      virus (RSV; A isolate), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV;
      Armstrong E350 isolate), cytomegalovirus (CMV; AD-169 isolate),
      herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1; KOS isolate), Vaccinia virus
      (Strain WR), Tacaribe virus (strain TRVL 11573) and rotavirus
      (strain WA) were obtained from ATCC (#VR-1422, #VR-1540, #VR-134,
      #VR-538, #VR-1493, #VR-1354, #VR-114, and #VR-2018 respectively).
      Candid 1 and Amapari BeAn 70563 were obtained from Dr. Robert Tesh
      at the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, Tex.). Work
      done with BSL 4 viruses (Lassa, Machupo, Guanarito, and Junín) as
      well as severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV) was conducted by collaborators at USAMRIID (Fort
      Detrick, Md.).<br>
      <br>
      Antiviral Assays for Specificity Screening: Cytopathic Effect
      ("CPE") Assay, Virus Plaque Reduction Assay, and ELISA<br>
      <br>
      [0336] A viral CPE assay was used to evaluate the antiviral effect
      of compounds against Tacaribe virus (Vero cells), Candid-1 vaccine
      virus (Vero cells), Amapari virus (Vero cells), SARS-CoV (Vero
      cells), HSV-1 (Vero cells), RSV (HEp-2 cells), vaccinia virus
      (Vero cells), and Rotavirus (MA104). An enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay ("ELISA") was used to evaluate the antiviral
      effect of compounds against CMV (MRC-5 cells) and LCMV (Vero
      cells). All of these assays were carried out in the appropriate
      media containing 2% heat-inactivated FBS. Ninety-six-well cell
      culture plates were seeded 24 hours before use with 1.5*10&lt;4
      &gt;(Vero), 2.2*10&lt;4 &gt;(HEp-2 and MA104), and 4.5*10&lt;4
      &gt;(MRC-5) cells per well. For compound susceptibility testing,
      compounds (solubilized with 100% DMSO) were added to duplicate
      wells at final concentrations of 50, 15.8, 5, 1.6, 0.5, 0.16,
      0.05, 0.016 and 0 [mu]M. The final concentration of DMSO in the
      assays was 0.5%. Virus stocks were titrated in a separate
      experiment to determine the concentration that resulted in 90%
      destruction of the cell monolayer (CPE assay) after 3 days (HSV-1,
      Rotavirus and vaccinia) or 4 days (SARS-CoV, RSV, Tacaribe virus,
      Candid 1 vaccine virus and Amapari virus) or the concentration
      that generated an ELISA signal of 2.5 at an optical density of 650
      nm (OD650) after 3 days (LCMV) or 4 days (CMV). These
      pre-established dilutions of virus were added to wells containing
      serial dilutions of compound. Uninfected cells and cells receiving
      virus without compound were included on each assay plate. In
      addition, reference agents, when available, were included on each
      assay plate (gancyclovir for HSV-1 and CMV, Sigma #G2536;
      ribavirin for LCMV and RSV, Sigma #R9644; and rifampicin for
      vaccinia virus, Sigma #R3501). Plates were incubated at 37[deg.]
      C. and 5% CO2 for either 3 days (HSV-1, Rotavirus, LCMV, Vaccinia
      virus) or 4 days (Tacaribe virus, Amapari virus, Candid 1 virus,
      SARS-CoV, RSV, and CMV). HSV-1, SARS-CoV, Rotavirus, Vaccinia
      virus, RSV, Tacaribe virus, Amapari virus, Candid 1 vaccine virus
      infected plates were processed for crystal violet staining while
      plates infected with CMV and LCMV were processed for ELISA
      analysis. For crystal violet staining, the plates were fixed with
      5% glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. After
      rinsing and drying, the optical density at 570 nm (OD570) was
      measured using a Microplate Reader. For ELISA analysis, the medium
      from the LCMV and CMV-infected plates was removed and the cells
      were fixed with 100% methanol (Fisher, CAS #67-56-1, HPLC grade)
      for 20 minutes at room temperature. The methanol solution was
      removed and the plates were washed 3 times with PBS. Non-specific
      binding sites were blocked by the addition of 130 [mu]L of
      Superblock Blocking Buffer (Pierce #37515) for 1 hour at 37[deg.]
      C. The blocking agent was removed and the wells were washed 3
      times with PBS. Thirty [mu]L of a 1:20 dilution of LCMV Nuclear
      Protein (NP) specific monoclonal antibody (generous gift of Juan
      Carlos de la Torre, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla
      Calif.) or 30 [mu]L of a 1:200 dilution of CMV (protein 52 and
      unique long gene 44 product) specific cocktail monoclonal
      antibodies (Dako, #M0854) in Superblock Blocking Buffer containing
      0.1% Tween-20 was added. Following 1 hour incubation at 37[deg.]
      C., the primary antibody solution was removed and the wells were
      washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. Forty [mu]L of
      goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugated monoclonal
      antibody (Bio-Rad #172-1011) diluted 1:4000 (LCMV) or 1:400 (CMV)
      in Superblock Blocking Buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20 was added
      to the wells and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37[deg.]
      C. The secondary antibody solution was removed and the wells were
      washed 5 times with PBS. The assay was developed for 15 minutes by
      the addition of 130 [mu]L of 3,3',5,5-tetramethylbenzidine
      substrate (Sigma #T0440) to quantify peroxidase activity. The
      OD650 of the resulting reaction product was measured using a
      Molecular Devices Kinetic Microplate Reader with a 650 nm filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0337] Antiviral activity against Tacaribe virus was evaluated by
      three methods: CPE Assay, Plaque Reduction, and Virus Yield
      Inhibition Assay. For the HTS CPE Assay, Vero cells were plated at
      80% confluency on 96-well plates. Test compounds (80 per plate)
      from the library were added to wells at a final concentration of 5
      [mu]M. Tacaribe virus was then added at a virus dilution that
      would result in 90% CPE after 5 days (multiplicity of infection
      ("MOI") approximately 0.001). Plates were incubated at 37[deg.] C.
      and 5% CO2 for 5 days, then fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde and
      stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The extent of virus CPE was
      quantified spectrometrically at OD570 using an Envision Microplate
      Reader. The inhibitory activity of each compound was calculated by
      subtracting from the OD570 of test compound well from the average
      OD570 of virus-infected cell wells, then dividing by the average
      OD570 of mock-infected cell wells. The result represents the
      percent protection against Tacaribe virus CPE activity conferred
      by each compound. "Hits" in this assay were defined as compound
      that inhibited virus-induced CPE by greater than 50% at the test
      concentration (5 [mu]M). Hits that possessed chemical tractability
      were further evaluated for their inhibitory potency. The
      inhibitory concentration 50% (EC50) values were determined from a
      plot of the compound inhibitory activity following the CPE assay
      across eight compound concentrations (50, 15, 5, 1.5, 0.5, 0.15,
      0.05 and 0.015 [mu]M). All determinations were performed in
      duplicate.<br>
      <br>
      [0338] In the Plaque Reduction Assay, Vero cell monolayers grown
      in 6-well plates were infected with about 50 PFU/well in the
      absence or presence of various concentrations of the compounds.
      After 1 h of virus adsorption at 37[deg.] C., residual inoculum
      was replaced by a 50:50 mix of 1% seaplaque agarose (in de-ionized
      water) and 2*MEM. Plaques were counted after 5-7 days of
      incubation at 37[deg.] C. The EC50 was calculated as the compound
      concentration required to reduce virus plaque numbers by 50%.
      Under BSL 4 conditions at USAMRIID the plaque reduction assays
      (with Lassa, Machupo, Guanarito, and Junín viruses) were performed
      as follows: 200 PFU of each virus was used to infect Vero cells.
      After virus adsorption, cell monolayers were rinsed and overlaid
      with complete medium containing 1% agarose and either lacking test
      compound or with different concentrations ranging from 15 [mu]M to
      0.05 [mu]M. After 5 days incubation at 37[deg.] C., the monolayers
      were stained with neutral red and the numbers of plaques were
      counted.<br>
      <br>
      [0339] In Virus Yield Reduction Assays, Vero cells grown in
      24-well plates were infected with Tacaribe virus at a multiplicity
      of infection ("MOI") of 0.1 in the presence of different
      concentrations of the compounds, two wells per concentration.
      After 48 h of incubation at 37[deg.] C. virus was harvested and
      the virus yields were determined by plaque formation in Vero
      cells. The EC50 values were calculated as indicated above and
      similar calculations were performed to determine EC90 and EC99.<br>
      <br>
      Cytotoxicity Assay<br>
      <br>
      [0340] Cell viability was measured by a cell proliferation assay
      to determine a compound's effect on cellular functions so that a
      50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) could be calculated; the
      ratio of this value to the EC50 is referred to as the selective
      index (S.I.=CC50/EC50). Two types of assays were used to determine
      cytotoxicity. One was a colorimetric method that measures the
      reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium
      bromide (MTT), and the other uses fluorimetry to measure the
      reduction of resazurin (Alamar Blue). Both methods produced
      similar data. Confluent cultures in 96-well plates were exposed to
      different concentrations of the compounds, with two wells for each
      concentration, using incubation conditions equivalent to those
      used in the antiviral assays.<br>
      <br>
      Medicinal Chemistry<br>
      <br>
      [0341] Several potent compounds were identified by the Tacaribe
      HTS and were grouped into several clusters of structure type. One
      cluster of compounds, with ST-336 (FW=407.3) representing the
      prototype based on antiviral activity and chemical tractability,
      was chosen for further development. Through retrosynthetic
      analysis of ST-336, it was determined that a library of analogues
      could be prepared convergently in a single synthetic step by
      combining an isocyanate with an acyl hydrazide. Using this
      chemistry, 165 analogues were prepared and the most potent
      examined for in vitro metabolism (S9).<br>
      <br>
      Time of Addition Experiment<br>
      <br>
      [0342] This experiment was designed to characterize the mechanism
      of action of the anti-viral compounds. Vero cells were grown in 24
      well culture plates. The medium was removed when the cells reached
      70-80% confluency and replaced with infection medium. Cells were
      infected with Tacaribe virus at MOI=0.1. After 1 hour adsorption,
      the viral inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh infection
      medium. Duplicate wells were treated with 3 [mu]M ST-336 h prior
      to infection, at the time of infection or at specific times post
      infection (from 1 to 20 h p.i.). Control infected cell cultures
      were treated with drug vehicle (DMSO) only. ST-336 was removed 1
      hour post absorption and the monolayer was washed twice with cold
      PBS-M and replaced with fresh infection medium. The cells were
      harvested at 24 h p.i. and were titrated as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0343] In a separated experiment, Vero cells plated in a 6 well
      dish were infected with Tacaribe virus at MOI=4. Absorption was
      carried out for 1 hour. Three [mu]M of ST-336 was added for 1 hour
      at 1 hour before infection, during infection, and 1 hour following
      infection. Following drug addition and virus infection, monolayers
      were washed 3 times with complete media. Four hours following last
      drug addition, monolayers were overlaid with 1% agarose without
      compound until plaques developed. At 5 to 7 days post infection,
      monolayers were fixed, crystal violet stained and plaque numbers
      counted.<br>
      <br>
      Assay for Compound Binding to Intact Virus<br>
      <br>
      [0344] This experiment was designed to test the binding/fusion
      inhibitory properties of ST-336 towards Tacaribe virus. Vero cells
      were grown in MEM with 2% fetal calf serum. For this experiment,
      cells were grown to 70-80% confluency in 24-well culture plates.
      In one set of tubes Tacaribe virus (4000 pfu) was treated with 1%
      DMSO, serially diluted tenfold in infection medium and treated
      with the specific concentrations of ST-336 (400 pfu+0.5 [mu]M
      ST-336, 40 pfu+0.05 [mu]M ST-336) or DMSO only (400 pfu or 40
      pfu+DMSO). In another set of tubes Tacaribe virus (4000 pfu) was
      treated with 5 [mu]M ST-336 then serially diluted tenfold in
      infection medium. The suspensions were plated in wells and after
      adsorption for one hour inocula were removed and overlaid with
      0.5% Seaplaque agarose in MEM. The plate was incubated at 37[deg.]
      C. until cytopathic effect was observed in the DMSO control well.
      The cells were fixed with 5% gluteraldehyde and stained with 0.1%
      crystal violet for plaque visualization.<br>
      <br>
      [0345] Another assay employed to test the binding properties of
      ST-336 to pre-fusion F-proteins on virions was a dialysis
      experiment. Purified Tacaribe virus (1000 pfu) was incubated with
      5 [mu]M of ST-336 or 0.5% DMSO. The suspensions were dialyzed
      overnight at 4[deg.] C. in a dialysis chamber. Twenty four hours
      post dialysis viral suspensions were titrated on Vero cells. Post
      one hour adsorption, inocula were removed and a 0.5% Seaplaque
      agarose in MEM overlay was applied. The plate was incubated at
      37[deg.] C. until cytopathic effect was observed. The cells were
      fixed with 5% gluteraldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet.
      To confirm absence of free drug in dialysed virus-drug sample,
      virus was spiked in dialysed mixture at time of infection and
      plaques developed as described above.<br>
      <br>
      Isolation of Drug Resistant Variant Viruses<br>
      <br>
      [0346] Initially, single plaques of WT Tacaribe virus was
      isolated. For this plaque-purification Vero cells in a 6-well
      plate were infected with 50 pfu/well of WT Tacaribe virus for 1
      hour at 37[deg.] C. Following virus adsorption the inoculum was
      removed and each well was overlaid with 0.5% Seaplaque agarose in
      MEM and incubated at 37[deg.] C. until plaques were visible (5-7
      days). Four plaques were picked and further amplified in Vero
      cells in a 24-well plate until CPE developed (5-7 days).
      Virus-infected cell extracts were harvested by scraping cells into
      the media and then collected in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Each
      plaque-purified isolate was further amplified in 150 mm plates,
      and then each virus stock that originated from one virus plaque
      was titrated.<br>
      <br>
      [0347] For the isolation of compound-resistant Tacaribe virus
      variants, each wild type plaque-purified isolate was titrated in
      the presence of 3 [mu]M ST-336 as described. Vero cells in a
      6-well plate were infected with 10&lt;4&gt;-10&lt;6 &gt;pfu/well
      in media containing 3 [mu]M ST-336 for 1 hour, then the cells were
      overlaid with 0.5% seaplaque agarose in MEM containing 3 [mu]M
      ST-336 and incubated until plaques formed. Plaques were picked and
      used to infect Vero cells in a 24-well plate without compound.
      When CPE developed the infected wells were harvested. Each
      drug-resistant isolate was then titrated on a 96-well plate in 0.5
      log dilutions, starting with 25 [mu]L of pure virus stock, without
      compound and with 1 [mu]M and 3 [mu]M ST-336. Each mutant went
      through several rounds of plaque purification before final virus
      stocks were made.<br>
      <br>
      Sequencing<br>
      <br>
      [0348] RNA was extracted from each of the Tacaribe WT isolates
      (1-4) and four of the drug resistant isolates (DR#1-4) and used
      for reverse transcription PCR. Primers specific to the GPC
      (Tac-forward: 5' GCCTAACTGAACCAGGTGAATC (SEQ ID NO:1) and
      Tac-reverse: 5' TAAGACTTCCGCACCACAGG (SEQ ID NO:2)) from Tacaribe
      were used for amplification and sequencing.<br>
      <br>
      Solubility<br>
      <br>
      [0349] Two tests were used to assess compound solubility:
      solubility in cell culture medium with and without various
      concentrations of serum and solubility in aqueous buffer at pH
      7.4. The solutions were stirred overnight and then filtered
      through an Amicon Centrifree YM-30 column with a 30,000 MW cut off
      to remove potentially precipitated compound and compound bound to
      protein. The compound was quantified by LC/MS or UV spectrometry.<br>
      <br>
      Stability<br>
      <br>
      [0350] In vitro metabolic stability was determined by Absorption
      Systems (Exton, Pa.) using the 9000*g supernatant (S9) of
      homogenized liver from various species as a source of oxidative
      conjugation enzymes (e.g., cytochromes P450, UdP-glucuronosyl
      transferase) that are known to be the primary pathways of
      biotransformation for most drugs. The metabolic stability was
      measured as the persistence of parent compound over incubation
      time in the S9 fractions by mass spectrometry. Briefly, human,
      rat, mouse and guinea pig S9 fractions were obtained from Xenotech
      (Lenexa, Kans.). The reaction mixture, minus cofactor cocktails,
      was prepared (1 mg/ml liver S9 fractions, 1 mM NADPH, 1 mM UDPGA,
      1 mM PAPS, 1 mM GSH, 100 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 10 mM
      magnesium chloride, 10 [mu]M test article) and equilibrated at
      37[deg.] C. for 3 min. An aliquot of reaction mixture was taken as
      a negative control. The reaction was initiated by the addition of
      cofactor cocktails to the reaction mixture only, and then the
      reaction mixture and negative control were incubated in a shaking
      water bath at 37[deg.] C. Aliquots (100 [mu]l) were withdrawn in
      triplicate at 0, 15, 30, and 60 minutes and combined with 900
      [mu]l of ice-cold 50/50 acetonitrile/dH2O to terminate the
      reaction. Each sample was analyzed via LC/MS/MS. The natural log
      of the percent remaining was plotted versus time. A linear fit was
      used to determine the rate constant. The fit was truncated when
      percent remaining of test article was less than 10%. The
      elimination half-lives associated with the disappearance of test
      and control articles were determined to compare their relative
      metabolic stability.<br>
      <br>
      Genotoxicity<br>
      <br>
      [0351] An exploratory bacterial mutagenicity assay (Ames test) was
      used to assess the potential of the compound genotoxicity. This
      assay utilized S. typhimurium tester strains TA7007 and TA7006
      (single base pair mutations) and TA98 (frame shift mutation) with
      and without metabolic activation (Arochlor-induced rat liver S9)
      as described previously.&lt;32 &gt;<br>
      <br>
      Pharmacokinetic ("PK") Assessments in Rats and Newborn Mice<br>
      <br>
      [0352] Analysis of the oral pharmacokinetics of selected compounds
      was performed in Sprague Dawley rats in a single dose study with
      serum samples taken over a 24 h period. For the newborn mice PK
      evaluation, 4 day old BALB/c mice were dosed intraperitoneally
      (IP) and serum samples were taken over a 24 hour period. A 50
      [mu]l aliquot of plasma was combined with 150 [mu]l of 100%
      acetonitrile containing an internal standard (100 ng/ml
      tolbutamide) in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. Samples were vortexed
      and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for ten minutes. An 80 [mu]l aliquot
      of the resulting supernatant was then transferred to an HPLC for
      vial analysis. Plasma levels of each compound were determined by
      LC/MS/MS, and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using
      WinNolin software.<br>
      <br>
      Efficacy in Newborn Mouse Model<br>
      <br>
      [0353] To determine tolerability of ST-294, newborn (4 days old)
      BALB/c mice were given IP dosages of 0 (vehicle), 10, 25, or 100
      mg/kg/day of ST-294 for 5 days with assessment of clinical status
      daily.<br>
      <br>
      [0354] To test the efficacy of ST-294 in the Tacaribe newborn
      mouse model, four day old BALB/c mice (8 per dose group) were
      challenged with 3*10&lt;3 &gt;PFU (30XLD50) of Tacaribe virus per
      mouse by IP injection with death as the end point. Mice were
      either treated with placebo (vehicle), ribavirin (MP Biomedical)
      administered IP at 25 mg/kg once a day for 10 days, or ST-294
      administered IP at 100 mg/kg once a day or at 50 mg/kg twice a day
      for 10 days. Mice were monitored daily and weighed every other day
      throughout the study. Any mice showing signs of morbidity were
      euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. All animal studies conformed to
      the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research and were approved
      through appropriate IACUC review.<br>
      <br>
      Results<br>
      <br>
      Homology Between Tacaribe and Other BSL 4 NWA<br>
      <br>
      [0355] There are currently 23 recognized viral species of the
      Arenaviridae family.&lt;4 &gt;These viruses have been classified
      into two groups: the Old World (Lassa/LCM) arenaviruses and the
      New World (Tacaribe complex) group. The New World Tacaribe complex
      comprises three phylogenetic lineages, designated clades A, B, and
      C. Clade B includes the prototypic Tacaribe virus, Amapari virus
      and the four South American Category A pathogens (Junín, Machupo,
      Guanarito and Sabiá). Tacaribe virus is 67% to 78% identical to
      Junín virus at the amino acid level for all four viral
      proteins.&lt;23 &gt;Working with authentic Category A arenaviruses
      requires maximum laboratory containment (BSL-4), and therefore
      presents significant logistical and safety issues. Since Tacaribe
      virus is closely related to the Category A pathogens it was chosen
      as a surrogate BSL 2 NWA for the development of a HTS assay to
      screen for inhibitors of virus replication.<br>
      <br>
      Tacaribe HTS Assay<br>
      <br>
      [0356] Since Tacaribe virus grows well in cell culture and causes
      clear virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) a robust HTS CPE assay
      was developed in a 96-well plate. The CPE assay is a whole cell
      assay which allows for calculation of the selective index of the
      compounds and identification of inhibitors of any essential steps
      in the virus life cycle. Of the 400,000 compounds screened in the
      Tacaribe virus HTS assay, 2,347 hits were identified (0.58% hit
      rate). All of these hits had EC50 values &lt;=5 [mu]M. The 2,347
      hits were then qualified based on four criteria: i) chemical
      tractability, ii) inhibitory potency, iii) inhibitory selectivity,
      and iv) antiviral specificity. A chemically tractable compound is
      defined as an entity that is synthetically accessible using
      reasonable chemical methodology, and which possesses chemically
      stable functionalities and potential drug-like qualities. Hits
      that passed this medicinal chemistry filter were evaluated for
      their inhibitory potency. EC50, CC50, and selective index (SI)
      values were determined to assess whether the hit was a selective
      inhibitor. Hits with SI values of at least 10 were considered
      further. Of the 2,347 hits identified, 36 compounds exhibited all
      the characteristics of quality hits. These compounds were
      chemically tractable, had EC50 values &lt;=5 [mu]M and SI values
      &gt;=10. Among the 36 quality hits, there were several clusters of
      structure type. One structure type was chosen for further
      development and ST-336 is the representative prototype for this
      series. ST-336 is a 407.33 dalton compound and its structure is
      shown in FIG. 1.<br>

      Characterization of ST-336<br>
      <br>
      [0357] As seen in Table 1, ST-336 has submicromolar potency, good
      selectivity, and antiviral specificity against Tacaribe virus as
      well as the Category A NWA. Evaluation of ST-336 in a virus yield
      reduction assay against Tacaribe virus produced EC90 and EC99
      values of 0.068 [mu]M and 0.085 [mu]M respectively. The CC50 value
      for ST-336 on Vero cells is &gt;20 [mu]M, which represents the
      solubility limit of this compound in cell culture media, giving it
      a selective index of &gt;363. The activity of ST-336 against
      Tacaribe virus was tested on multiple cell lines and all the EC50
      values were similar to those achieved on Vero cells (data not
      shown). When tested against several arenaviruses, ST-336 showed no
      inhibitory activity against OWA, either LCM virus or authentic
      Lassa virus (Table 1). This drug also lacked activity against the
      NWA Amapari virus. This was a surprising result given the close
      phylogenetic relationship between Amapari and Tacaribe
      viruses.&lt;23, 19 &gt;This discrepancy is later discussed
      following sequencing of GP2 of all NWA. However, importantly
      ST-336 showed potent antiviral activity against the vaccine strain
      of Junín virus (Candid 1) as well as Machupo, Guanarito, and Junín
      (Table 1).<br>

      <br>
      [0358] The specificity of the antiviral activity exhibited by
      ST-336 was determined by testing against a number of related and
      unrelated viruses. As shown in Table 2, ST-336 showed no activity
      against a variety of unrelated DNA (HSV, CMV, vaccinia virus) and
      RNA (RSV, Rotavirus, SARS and Ebola virus) viruses.<br>
      <br>
      Mechanism of Action of ST-336<br>
      <br>
      [0359] A single cycle (24 h) time of addition experiment was done
      to determine when during the virus replication cycle ST-336 exerts
      its antiviral activity. The effect of ST-336 on Tacaribe virus
      yield was determined following addition of compound to Vero cell
      cultures at various times before or after infection. ST-336 was
      added at one hour before infection (-1 h), during virus adsorption
      (0 h), and at several times post-infection. Drug was kept,
      following sequential addition, on infected cell cultures for the
      entire time of the experiment. Control infected cultures were
      treated with drug vehicle (DMSO) only. At 24 hours post-infection,
      samples were collected, and virus yields were determined by plaque
      assay. As shown in FIG. 2A, ST-336 exerted its inhibitory effect
      only at the very early stage in the virus life cycle. Addition of
      ST-336 at any time points post-infection had no effect on virus
      yield. These data suggest that ST-336 is an early stage inhibitor
      of virus replication.<br>
      <br>
      [0360] These results were confirmed in a second type of time
      addition experiment. In this experiment, compound was spiked in
      the culture medium for only 1 hour, at 1 hour before infection (-1
      h), during infection (0) and at 1 hour post infection (+1 h), and
      then removed. The cultures were washed to remove any residual
      compound and overlaid with agarose. Virus plaque numbers were then
      determined at 5 days post-infection. Data in FIG. 2B showed that
      while compound added before and after virus adsorption for 1 hour
      had no effect on plaque formation, compound added during the 1 h
      adsorption/entry process dramatically reduced Tacaribe plaque
      formation. These data are consistent with ST-336 being an
      adsorption/entry inhibitor.<br>
      <br>
      [0361] Two approaches were taken to determine if ST-336 is binding
      to intact virions. In the first experiment, 1000 PFU of purified
      Tacaribe virus was incubated with ST-336 or DMSO and dialyzed
      overnight at 4[deg.] C. and titrated. While no virus was titrated
      from the dialyzed bag originally incubated with drug, more than
      300 PFU of virus was titrated from the DMSO vehicle dialyzed bag
      (data not shown). No drug was biologically detected in the
      dialysis bag originally containing 5 [mu]M of drug as measured by
      the incapability of the virus plus drug dialyzed mixture to
      inhibit freshly added Tacaribe virus (300 PFU). These data
      suggested that ST-336 binds intact virions with a very slow
      dissociation constant. In the second experiment (FIG. 3), Tacaribe
      virus was incubated in a test tube with 5 [mu]M of ST-336 or DMSO.
      Serial 1:10 dilutions were performed and for some samples ST-336
      was added as a specified dilution representing the concentration
      of drug expected following sample dilution. As virus and compound
      are diluted with media, the compound concentration will reach a
      concentration without an inhibitory effect, unless the compound
      was capable of binding to virus. Test virus without compound in
      the initial tube was also diluted in media and compound
      concentrations corresponding to that found in the tubes where
      virus and compound were diluted together was added to each virus
      dilution. Titration on Vero cells showed that ST-336 present in
      excess in the initial tube was carried over for two additional
      1:10 dilutions through specific virus binding and inhibits virus
      infection. Whereas when drug was added at a specified dilution
      virus was not inhibited to the same degree as virus diluted with
      drug (data not shown). These data suggest that ST-336 binds with
      at least a slow Koff to intact protein present on Tacaribe virus.<br>
      <br>
      Isolation of Drug Resistant Variants<br>
      <br>
      [0362] The expected mutation rate of RNA viruses is very high (1
      mutant in 10,000) and a common approach to determining the target
      of an antiviral is to isolate virus resistance to the antiviral
      and then map the site of resistance. Virus variants with reduced
      susceptibility to ST-336 were isolated from wild type Tacaribe
      virus stocks plated in the presence of ST-336. The observed
      frequency of ST-336 drug resistant (ST-336&lt;DR&gt;) variants was
      as expected for RNA viruses. Sixteen ST-336&lt;DR &gt;isolates
      from four independent wild type Tacaribe virus stocks were
      isolated and plaque purified three times. All ST-336&lt;DR
      &gt;isolates were tested for their ability to grow in the presence
      of ST-336. The growth of ST-336&lt;DR &gt;isolates was unaffected
      by the presence of ST-336 at concentrations that completely
      inhibited wild type Tacaribe virus replication (data not shown).
      The isolation and confirmation of drug resistant virus variants
      strongly suggest that ST-336 acts as a direct antiviral inhibitor.<br>
      <br>
      [0363] To determine the genetic basis for resistance and the
      molecular target of ST-336, RNA was isolated from the wild type
      and ST-336&lt;DR &gt;isolates. Based on the time of addition
      experiments, it was suspected that the viral glycoproteins might
      be the target of ST-336. The entire glycoprotein precursor GPC
      region of the S segment was sequenced. Sequence analysis was
      performed on four wild type isolates (WT#1-4) and four
      ST-336&lt;DR &gt;isolates derived from drug selection applied to
      each corresponding parental wild type isolate (DR#1.1 from WT#1,
      DR#2.1 from WT#2, DR#3.1 from WT#3 and DR#4.1 from WT#4). The
      sequence analysis showed that the GPC gene from the four parental
      wild type isolates had identical sequences. When compared to the
      GPC sequences of four drug resistant variants, each possessed a
      single nucleotide change that in all cases resulted in an amino
      acid change. FIG. 4A shows the location of each of the mutations
      which are located in or around the transmembrane domain of GP2.
      The sequence alignments of the region of the GP2 containing the
      changes is presented in FIG. 4B. The single change in DR#1.1 was
      at amino acid position 418 (I418T), in DR#2.1 at amino acid 416
      (T416N), in DR#3.1 at amino acid 433 (S433I) and in DR#4.1 at
      amino acid 436 (F436I). I418 is similarly conserved (I or L, but
      never a T) in all clade B New World arenavirus, while T416 is
      conserved among all clade B NWA. F436 is similarly conserved with
      one exception; Amapari virus encodes a leucine at position 436.
      This change in Amapari virus may explain its lack of
      susceptibility to ST-336 (Table 2). I418, T416, S433 and F436 lie
      near the N-terminal and C-terminal limits of the putative
      transmembrane domain of GP2, a region known to play a vital role
      in enveloped virus fusion.&lt;17, 27, 28, 38, 39 &gt;Taken
      together, these data suggest that amino acid changes in arenavirus
      GP2 at either position 416, 418, 433 or 436 are sufficient to
      confer reduced susceptibility to ST-336 and are consistent with
      the proposed fusion inhibition mechanism suggested by virological
      experiments.<br>
      <br>
      Hit-to-Lead Optimization<br>
      <br>
      [0364] Preliminary data showed that ST-336, while demonstrating
      interesting antiviral activity and specificity, had poor
      pharmacokinetic (PK) properties in rodents (mouse and rats, data
      not shown). In order to improve the PK properties of ST-336, a
      lead optimization chemistry campaign was initiated. The objective
      of the optimization program was to develop compounds that possess
      attributes consistent with the ultimate drug product profile. Lead
      optimization activities comprised a series of iterations involving
      design and chemical synthesis of analogs of the lead structure,
      followed by a series of biological, physiochemical, and
      pharmacological evaluations of the new compounds. Chemical analogs
      flowed through a compound evaluation paradigm that involved first
      in vitro virological and cytotoxicity assessments, followed by a
      series of evaluations as listed: in vitro metabolic stability
      (S9), solubility, exploratory bacterial mutagenesis and
      pharmacokinetic assessments. 165 analogues were prepared and the
      most potent were examined for in vitro metabolism in S9 liver
      extracts. The most stable were dosed in rats, and ST-294 emerged
      as a potent, orally bioavailable representative of the compounds.<br>

      is show in FIG. 5. ST-294 was tested against the drug resistant
      Tacaribe mutants generated with ST-336 (DR#1-4) and all of the
      mutants elicited cross-resistance to ST-294 suggesting that this
      compound is targeting the same area of GP2 as ST-336 (data not
      shown). The activity of ST-294 against Tacaribe, Machupo,
      Guanarito, and Junín viruses was similar to that seen with ST-336
      (Table 3). The CC50 of ST-294 on Vero cells is &gt;50 [mu]M
      yielding a selective index of &gt;416. Further characterization of
      ST-294 showed that this compound is soluble up to 23 [mu]M in
      media containing 10% fetal calf serum and up to 480 [mu]M in
      buffer at pH 7.4 (Table 3). The metabolic stability of ST-294 was
      tested in S9 liver extracts from rat, mouse, human, and guinea
      pigs and was found to be most stable in human S9 followed by
      mouse, rat and guinea pig respectively (Table 3). Analysis of the
      oral pharmacokinetics of ST-294 was initially performed in the rat
      as this species is well characterized for this type of study. The
      rats were dosed with ST-294 by oral gavage and samples were taken
      over a 24 h period. Serum levels were very high (Cmax=6670 ng/ml)
      and ST-294 has good oral bioavailability (68.2%) (Table 3).<br>

      Efficacy Study with ST-294 in Newborn Mouse Model<br>
      <br>
      [0366] ST-294 has potent antiviral activity against NWA and good
      drug-like properties, so the next step was to test the ability of
      ST-294 to inhibit NWA-induced disease in an animal model. For the
      Category A agents, the experiments require BSL 4 containment.
      However, in an effort to obtain an initial readout, a Tacaribe
      virus challenge model in newborn mice was established. In
      preparation for this study, PK and tolerability experiments were
      performed with ST-294 in newborn mice prior to conducting an
      efficacy trial. Newborn (4 day old) BALB/c mice were dosed IP with
      10 mg/kg of ST-294 and blood samples were collected for analysis.
      Relative to in vitro antiviral concentrations required to inhibit
      Tacaribe virus CPE (EC50=66 ng/ml), mean plasma concentrations in
      newborn mice were well above this level for prolonged periods of
      time (&gt;15* through 8 h and 6* at 24 h after dosing, data not
      shown). In this model the drug is delivered via the IP route due
      to the difficulty of performing multiple oral gavages on newborn
      mice. To test tolerability, newborn mice were given IP dosages
      ranging from 0-100 mg/kg/day of ST-294 for 5 days. Dosages of 100
      mg/kg/day for 5 days were well tolerated by the newborn mice as
      there were no clinical signs of toxicity and the mice gained
      weight at the same rate as the control mice (data not shown). This
      highest tested concentration of ST-294 of 100 mg/kg/day was used
      in a Tacaribe animal efficacy study.<br>
      <br>
      [0367] The drug levels and half-life shown in the PK study in the
      newborn mice was not equivalent to that seen in the rats, but the
      serum levels seemed sufficient to perform a proof-of-concept
      animal study in the Tacaribe animal model. Four day old mice were
      challenged with 30*LD50 of Tacaribe virus and treated with
      placebo, ribavirin as a control or ST-294. As the results in FIG.
      6 demonstrate, ST-294 showed efficacy in the Tacaribe infected
      newborn mice with both survival and a delay in death similar to
      the drug control (ribavirin). Taken together these data suggest
      that ST-294 is a promising and appropriate drug candidate to
      advance into definitive animal studies where guinea pigs and
      primates will be challenged with authentic NWA (Junín and
      Guanarito viruses) and treated at various times post infection and
      prophylatically with ST-294.<br>
      <br>
      Discussion<br>
      <br>
      [0368] Through a successful HTS and medicinal chemistry program, a
      NWA antiviral drug candidate, ST-294, has been identified. This
      drug potently and selectively inhibits NWA viruses in vitro
      including the 3 NIAID/CDC Category A viruses (Junín, Machupo, and
      Guanarito viruses). This compound was also evaluated for stability
      in S9 liver extracts and for it's pharmacokinetic properties and
      was found to be metabolically stable and orally bioavailable. In a
      preliminary animal efficacy study, ST-294 showed significant
      protection against Tacaribe virus induced disease in newborn mice.
      Through mechanism of action studies it is apparent that this
      series of compounds targets GP2 and are viral entry inhibitors.<br>
      <br>
      [0369] From the dialysis and dilution experiments (FIG. 3) it is
      apparent that the drug binds to virus and is carried over during
      dilutions. This phenomenon could potentially have an effect when
      titrating virus samples during other experiments. However, in the
      time of addition experiment, there was not enough drug carry over
      due to high dilution to affect the titers when added 1 hour or
      more after infection (FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      [0370] Since ST-294 has better S9 stability than ST-336 does, it
      is thought that metabolism occurs at the methyl group on the
      aromatic ring (FIG. 1). The benzylic position is susceptible to
      oxidation. When there is no benzylic hydrogen present as in ST-294
      (FIG. 2), the oxidation is blocked and thus eliminates the fastest
      metabolism pathway. The addition of the difluoromethoxy group in
      ST-294 gave this compound increased S9 stability, but did not
      reduce antiviral activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0371] In the Tacaribe newborn mouse model the mice appear to die
      of a neurological disease (indicated by hind quarter paralysis)
      and it is not known whether ST-294 can cross the blood brain
      barrier. Also the drug levels and half-life of this drug candidate
      given IP in newborn mice is not as good as oral dosing in rats so
      serum levels and compound getting to the brain may have
      compromised the ability to obtain complete protection in this
      model. The more appropriate animal models for hemorrhagic fever
      caused by arenaviruses are in guinea pigs and non-human primates
      where the virus replicates predominantly in the spleen, lymph
      nodes and bone marrow causing hemorrhagic diathesis. Guinea pig
      models are well established for Junín, Machupo, and Guanarito
      virus diseases, and represent the best small animal model for
      evaluation during preclinical studies.&lt;26, 34 &gt;Guinea pigs
      infected with pathogenic strains of Junín virus develop a fatal
      disease akin to human AHF.&lt;37 &gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0372] There are many reports of the role of transmembrane in the
      function of viral fusion proteins. In the case of influenza virus
      hemagglutinin, it is clear that a transmembrane anchor is required
      for full fusion activity.&lt;27 &gt;In contrast, specific sequence
      requirements within the transmembrane domain have been identified,
      for example, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1, murine
      leukemia virus, foamy viruses, coronavirus, Newcastle disease
      virus and measles virus.&lt;27 &gt;Based on the drug resistant
      variants generated during these studies, the ST-336 class of
      compounds targets the GP2 envelope protein, with mutations
      eliciting reduced susceptibility to the drug arising in or around
      the transmembrane region (FIG. 4).<br>
      <br>
      [0373] Drugs that target the interactions between the virus
      envelope and the cellular receptor represent a new class of
      antiviral drugs. For HIV therapy, entry inhibitors have recently
      raised great interest because of their activity against multi-drug
      resistant viruses. A new antiviral against HIV was recently
      approved by the FDA called enfuvirtide. Enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) is a
      potent fusion inhibitor that blocks formation of the six-helix
      bundle and thus prevents membrane fusion.&lt;29 &gt;Enfuvirtide
      has been successful in improving the virological and immunological
      response in treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients.&lt;33
      &gt;There are several other compounds that counter HIV entry that
      are in different developmental stages, among them: 1) the
      attachment inhibitor dextrin-2-sulfate; 2) the inhibitors of the
      glycoprotein (gp) 120/CD4 interaction PRO 542, TNX 355 and BMS
      488043; and 3) the co-receptor inhibitors subdivided in those
      targeting CCR5 or CXCR4.&lt;20 &gt;The success of enfuvirtide and
      others in the development pathway are proof that virus entry
      inhibitors can be used to treat viral diseases in humans.<br>
      <br>
      [0374] ST-294 also has the potential for prophylactic use since
      this drug appears to bind to the virus (FIG. 3) and would prevent
      infection. Other virus entry inhibitors have demonstrated
      protection when given prophylactically.&lt;22 &gt;This is an
      indication that can be pursued to determine its feasibility.<br>
      <br>
      [0375] The results presented here show that ST-294 is a potent
      specific inhibitor of New World arenaviruses including the
      Category A hemorrhagic fever viruses (Junín, Machupo, and
      Guanarito). More importantly, the target of ST-294 (virus entry
      into the cell) serves as a viable target for antiviral
      development. Since virus infection can be completely inhibited at
      concentrations in the nanomolar range, the target for ST-294 would
      seem to be both accessible and extremely sensitive to reagents
      that disrupt its role in the infection process. Therefore, it will
      be important to further define the mechanism involved in ST-294
      mediated inhibition.<br>

      Japanese Encephalitis, California Encephalitis, Human T-cell
      Leukemia, Newcastle Disease, respiratory tract infection and
      bronchitis, Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis, Lassa Hemorrhagic Fever,
      and Hanta Hemorrhagic Fever by IM injection of a mixture
      comprising a first ingredient selected from the group consisting
      of procaine, chloroprocaine, tetracaine, chlorotetracaine,
      bromoprocaine, proparacaine, fmoroprocaine and benzocaine, and a
      second ingredient selected from the group consisting of
      dexamethasone, flumethasone and betamethasone. In the context of
      the present disclosure, the named ingredients also include
      therapeutically effective salts and hydrates, thereof. [05] The
      scope of the present invention includes variants of viruses that
      cause the above-referenced diseases. For example, the Hantavirus
      includes numerous variants, including the Hantaan virus, the
      Puumala virus, the SEO virus, the Dobrava virus, the Sin Nombre
      virus, etc. Conversely, some of the above-referenced diseases are
      variants of the same genus. For example West Nile Disease and
      Japanese encephalitis are caused by variants of the Flavivirus
      genus, which also includes the Murray Valley encephalitis virus.
      The present disclosure encompasses all variants of the
      specifically referenced diseases that are capable of being treated
      by the method described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [06] The treatment further comprises administration of an
      electrolyte solution such as Hydrite, PEDIALYTE, etc. Electrolytes
      can be administered orally or intravenously. In addition, the
      patient is also treated by administration of an antipyretic, such
      as calpol, paracetamol, aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [07] The term "therapeutically effective salts or hydrates," as
      use herein, represents those salts or hydrates which are, within
      the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact
      with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue
      toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like and
      correspond to a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically
      acceptable salts are well-known in the art. The salts can be
      prepared in-situ during the final isolation and purification of
      the compounds of the invention or separately by reacting the free
      base group with a suitable organic acid. Representative acid
      addition salts include acetate, adipate, alginate, ascorbate,
      aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate,
      butyrate, camphorate, camphersulfonate, citrate,
      cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate,
      ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate,
      hemisulfate, heptonate, hexanoate, hydrobromide, hydrochloride,
      hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate,
      laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate,
      methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate,
      oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate,
      3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate,
      stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate,
      toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts and the like.
      Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include
      sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and the like, as
      well as nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations,
      including, but not limited to ammonium, tetramethylammonium,
      tetraethylammonium, methyl amine, dimethyl amine, trimethylamine,
      triethylamine, ethylamine and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [08] Injectable mixtures of this invention comprise
      pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous
      solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as
      sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable
      solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable
      aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles
      include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene
      glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like), vegetable oils (such as
      olive oil), injectable organic esters (such as ethyl oleate) and
      suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for
      example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the
      maintenance of the required particle size in the case of
      dispersions and by the use of surfactants.<br>
      <br>
      [09] These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as
      preservative, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing
      agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured
      by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents,
      for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid and the
      like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as
      sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the
      injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the
      inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum
      monostearate and gelatin.<br>
      <br>
      [10] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example,
      by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by
      incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid
      compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water
      or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.<br>

      generally, patients having any of SARS, Ebola, Marburg, West Nile,<br>
      <br>
      German Measles, Yellow Fever, Saint Louis Encephalitis, Japanese
      Encephalitis, California Encephalitis, Human T-cell Leukemia,
      Newcastle Disease, respiratory tract infection and bronchitis,
      Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis, Lassa Hemorrhagic Fever, and Hanta
      Hemorrhagic Fever are treated with an IM injection of a mixture
      comprising between about 0.2-7.9 ml of about 0.5-17% a first
      ingredient select from the group consisting of procaine,
      chloroprocaine, tetracaine, chlorotetracaine, bromoprocaine,
      proparacaine, fluoroprocaine and benzocaine, and between about
      0.1-8.5 ml of about 4 mg/ml of a second ingredient selected from
      the group consisting of dexamethasone, flumethasone and
      betamethasone. The treatment plans for SARS, Ebola, Marburg, West
      Nile, German Measles, Yellow Fever, Saint Louis Encephalitis,
      Japanese Encephalitis, California Encephalitis, Newcastle Disease,
      respiratory tract infection and bronchitis, Lymphocytic
      Choriomeningitis, Lassa Hemorrhagic Fever, and Hanta Hemorrhagic
      Fever generally involve two injections at about 60-120 minute
      intervals for between about 1-5 days. For Human T-cell Leukemia,
      the treatment plan is similar except for the 15-30 day treatment
      duration. In a further embodiment, the Human T-cell Leukemia
      patient is treated for 5 days, and then treated daily under lab
      testing until favorable results are found. The patients are
      further treated with an electrolyte solution during the treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [22] Generally, for all treatments, children may be treated by IM
      injections of between about 0.5-7 ml of the above-described
      mixtures in the above-described time intervals. In particular
      embodiments, an adult is injected with about 2 ml of the mixture,
      while children under 13 are injected with about 1 ml of the
      mixture. The treatment interval for all treatments can vary,
      depending on virus, from once every 3 days up to 3-4 per day.<br>
      <br>
      [23] In an embodiment, a composition according to the present
      invention is made by mixing 2% chloroprocaine and dexamethasone
      Sodium Phosphate. Around 30 mg of chloroprocaine in 1.5 ml of a 20
      mg/ml solution is mixed with around 2 mg of dexamethasone in 0.5
      ml of a 4 mg/ml solution. The total volume of 2 ml comprising the
      two mixed formulations are gently mixed and aseptically
      transferred into a sterile 2 ml syringe. Empirical observation
      indicated that treatment by chloroprocaine and dexamethasone took
      less time and produced improved results over procaine and
      dexamethasone. In an alternative embodiment, 3 ml is taken out of
      a 30 ml bottle of chloroprocaine (20 mg/ml). Then 3 ml of
      dexamethasone (4 mg/ml) is added into the above-recited
      chloroprocaine bottle. This provides a 9:1 mixture of
      chloroprocaine and dexamethasone. The bottle is gently mixed
      (shaken) and the solution is ready to be aseptically transferred
      into a sterile syringe for IM administration.<br>
