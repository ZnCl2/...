        </span>
        <div style="text-align: left;">There are nearly 100 million car
          and trucks operating in North America, and no matter what is
          invented for the future, those vehicles will continue
          operating for several years. <br>
          <br>
          This means our denizens of the highways will continue
          polluting and guzzling fuel at then same pace which has caused
          our present day fuel shortage and outrageously inflated costs.<br>
          <br>
          An invention that improves fuel economy and at the same time
          helps curb noxious exhaust emissions is needed.<br>
          <br>
          Exchange reports on two such devices -- and they would work
          well together. One is the electronic device invented by Ben
          Polo ( featured in Exchange issue # 5/6 ) and the other is the
          Power Pak, a device invented by Charlie brown and Robert
          Whipkey of New York.<br>
          <br>
          Brown, a retired Air Force pilot, adn his partner have
          recently completed three years of detailed and complex
          research into fuel consumption and polluting emissions.<br>
          <br>
          The Power Pak evolved from an earlier device called the "Ring
          of Power", and it is literally an air conditioner for
          combusion chambers. The inexpensive, easy-to-install devices
          works on any car or truck to improve performance, increase
          mileage and control emissions.<br>
          <br>
          Vaporizers and the like have been tried, but they don't do the
          job. Our equipment humidifies the air so that combustion takes
          place under optimum conditions", Brown explained.<br>
          <br>
          "You cannot see humidity like you can vapor, and that's
          probably the reason it works so much better."<br>
          <br>
          Brown heads the firm of Charlie Brown Enterprises and also a
          group called Mobile Energy Research Center in Miami.<br>
          <br>
          Everyone knows that a car seems to run better in the rain or
          when the air is moist. brown explains it this way:<br>
          <br>
          "Precisely what happens within the engine with humid versus
          dry air has not been scientifically proven; there are two
          theories, but nothing positive. We do know, however, that air
          between 90 and 95% humidity gets the best performance.<br>
          <br>
          The fuel/air ratio is optimum, the rate of burn is slower and
          more effective and we see a reduction of carbon deposits in
          the engine, a reduction of carbon monoxide and a drastic
          reduction of oxides of nitrogen (NOx( that pollutes so badly.<br>
          <br>
          "Additionally, our system results in less engine vibration,
          longer spark plug life, longer engine life, a quiter engine
          and increase effective road horsepower and signficantly
          improved gasoline mileage."<br>
          <br>
          That statement sounds like an auto-makers dream commercial.
          Can it be true?<br>
          <br>
          "We have spent thousands of hours and many thousands of
          dollars in very thorough and precise testing", Brown stressed.<br>
          <br>
          "Despite the promise shown by our testing, we have been
          totally ignored by the various branches of our government that
          are supposed to be concerned about the problems of fuel
          economy and pollution", Brown said with obvious smouldering
          frustration.<br>
          <br>
          "We have offered to supply our units, at no cost whatsoever to
          anyone except ourselves, to more than a dozen supposedly
          concerned institutions", Brown added.<br>
          <br>
          Letters offering the device for testing without cost have been
          sent to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department
          of Transportation; the State of Floida; General Motors
          Corporation; Ford Motor Company; Chrysler Corporation [ ...
          &amp;c... ]<br>
          <br>
          It would seem that if our pollution and fuel problems are so
          pressing as the powers that be claim they are, then any one or
          all of the above organizations would have excitedly tested a
          rpomising device.<br>
          <br>
          Evidently that's not how it works in our system.<br>
          <br>
          "I don't think all those bureaucrats buzzing around up in
          Washington have any sort of system", Brown complained. "Both
          the EPA and the Transportation department flatly refused to
          test our device or discuss our concept.<br>
          <br>
          "The state of Florida advises us that they cannot test the
          concept on one of their vehicles because the manufacturer
          would void the warrantty -- can you imagine that?", Brown said
          with a shake of his head.<br>
          <br>
          "We're protected by patents so the auto manufacturers can
          surely look into it without threat of a nuisance suit", Brown
          added. "But they ignore us. It's a mystery to me".<br>
          <br>
          One of the reasons the auto manufacturers may be choosing to
          ignore Brown and his device -- hoping he'll go away -- is the
          political pork barrel foisted on the public a few seasons ago
          known as the "catalytic converter".<br>
          <br>
          American consumers are paying the additional cost of these
          emissisons control units that lower auto efficiency and shave
          time off engine life.<br>
          <br>
          "If I've ever seen a boondoggle, those catalytic converters
          are it", Brown noted.<br>
          <br>
          "The thing is expensive -- but profitable for the automakers
          -- it has no effect on oxides of nitrogen and I've seen tests
          which indicate the catalytic converters actually add another
          pollutant to the air -- sufluric acid .<br>
          <br>
          "They only reduce carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, and then
          only on cars using unleaded gas. For this we have to pay a
          price? Beats me!" commented the exasperated pilot and
          engineer.<br>
          <br>
          The EPA ordered the catalytic converters and the auto moguls
          feigned frustration at being told to install them, when all
          along it added to profitablility and a great deal of free
          advertizing via media stories.<br>
          <br>
          One might ask, why not take the thing down to your local auto
          dealer and get him to test it?<br>
          <br>
          "The manufacturers have a policy that forbids dealers from
          testing new devices or concepts", Brown pointed out.<br>
          <br>
          Meanwhile, millions of Americans are subject to televised
          propaganda about EPA mileage estimates designed to sell cars
          and major oil companies advertise how hard they are striving
          to provide the "energy needed to keep America rolling".<br>
          <br>
          Brown admits that his earlier device, the "Ring of Power"
          caused rust problems and was expensive because it was made of
          ceramic tile. But the Power Pak solves both problems and fits
          easily on all vehicles.<br>
          <br>
          "One of our problems certainly must be the rash of gas-saving
          gimmicks that popped up across the country over the last few
          years. These useless gimmicks have given all such devices a
          bad name".<br>
          <br>
          Carburetion devices have come and gone throughout the history
          of automotive engines, and teh auto makers steadfastly deny
          that anything more efficient than what they manufacture has
          ever come forth.<br>
          <br>
          Some of the "better ideas" did turn out to have major
          drawbacks. The famed Fish carburetor invented by John Fish was
          indeed more efficient for racing cars and hotrods, but for
          around-town driving it left much to be desired.<br>
          <br>
          The equally noted Pogue carburetor invented by Canadian Nelson
          Pogue could indeed obtain fantastic mileage -- but it did not
          give the car the necessary performance standards American
          drivers demand.<br>
          <br>
          However, Brown's Power Pak is in a class by itself. it is not
          a mere gimmick; it works and has impressive test credentials
          -- and it can be inexpensively installed on present vehicles.<br>
          <br>
          Rather than attempting to force new carburetion sytems down
          industry's throat -- as several inventors have tried to do and
          failed -- Charlie Brown has found a way to make today's fuel
          systems, in both gasoline and diesel engines work cleaner and
          more efficiently.<br>
          <br>
          California has at least acknowledged Polo's Equalizer; Brown
          has been totally ignored. his Power Pak deserves a fair
          hearing and trial.<br>
          <br>
          Brown repeated his statement, still incredulous that the
          powers that be do not act:<br>
          <br>
          "Here is something that can be inexpensively installed on
          existing cars; giving them longer life and better performance
          for the investment.<br>
          <br>
          "In addition we help clean up the air and save fuel".<br>
          <br>
          The automakers certainly cannot say that!<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A humidity
          amplification system for an internal combustion engine 1
          comprises a conduit 10, eg of heat resistant silicone plastics
          material, for conveying a portion of exhaust gas to a point 19
          in an air intake 6 upstream of a throttle plate 24 forming
          part of the air intake. The conduit 10 may take exhaust gases
          from a collector 4 located between a catalytic converter 3 and
          a silencer 5 to a vaporising chamber 7 which is heated eg by
          thermal connection 8 to the exhaust manifold 2. In a diesel
          engine, a vacuum pump may be used to draw recycled exhaust gas
          through the conduit 10. The amount of exhaust gas to be
          recycled may be determined using a humidity sensor 29. In a
          modification, the exhaust collector 4 is located upstream of
          the catalytic converter 3 and an auxiliary catalytic converter
          (14, fig.3) is provided in the tube 10. An EGR tube (33,
          fig.4) may be provided between the exhaust and inlet manifolds
          so that the engine management system 22 can select humidity
          amplification, eg at high engine speeds, or EGR, eg at low
          engine speeds.<br>
