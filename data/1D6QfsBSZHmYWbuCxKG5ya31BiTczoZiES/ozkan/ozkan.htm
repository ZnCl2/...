        <p><b>A BETTER WAY TO MAKE HYDROGEN FROM BIOFUELS</b> </p>
        <p>&nbsp;by Pam Frost Gorder <br>

      <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Researchers here have found a way to convert
        ethanol and other biofuels into hydrogen very efficiently. </p>
      <p>A new catalyst makes hydrogen from ethanol with 90 percent
        yield, at a workable temperature, and using inexpensive
        ingredients. </p>
      <p>Umit Ozkan, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering
        at Ohio State University, said that the new catalyst is much
        less expensive than others being developed around the world,
        because it does not contain precious metals, such as platinum or
        rhodium. <br>
        Umit Ozkan </p>
      <p>"Rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst, and it
        costs around $9,000 an ounce," Ozkan said. "Our catalyst costs
        around $9 a kilogram." </p>
      <p>She and her co-workers presented the research Wednesday, August
        20 at the American Chemical Society meeting in Philadelphia. </p>
      <p>The Ohio State catalyst could help make the use of
        hydrogen-powered cars more practical in the future, she said. </p>
      <p>"There are many practical issues that need to be resolved
        before we can use hydrogen as fuel -- how to make it, how to
        transport it, how to create the infrastructure for people to
        fill their cars with it," Ozkan explained. </p>
      <p>"Our research lends itself to what's called a 'distributed
        production' strategy. Instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at
        a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations, we
        could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located
        at the gas stations. So we wouldn't have to transport or store
        the hydrogen -- we could store the biofuel, and make hydrogen on
        the spot." </p>
      <p>The catalyst is inexpensive to make and to use compared to
        others under investigation worldwide. Those others are often
        made from precious metals, or only work at very high
        temperatures. </p>
      <p>"Precious metals have high catalytic activity and -- in most
        cases -- high stability, but they're also very expensive. So our
        goal from the outset was to come up with a precious-metal-free
        catalyst, one that was based on metals that are readily
        available and inexpensive, but still highly active and stable.
        So that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the
        world." </p>
      <p>"Whenever a process works at a lower temperature, that brings
        energy savings and cost savings," Ozkan said. “Also, if the
        catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields,
        we don’t need as much of it. That will bring down the size of
        the reactor, and its cost”. </p>
      <p>The new dark gray powder is made from tiny granules of cerium
        oxide -- a common ingredient in ceramics -- and calcium, covered
        with even smaller particles of cobalt. It produces hydrogen with
        90 percent efficiency at 660 degrees Fahrenheit (around 350
        degrees Celsius) -- a low temperature by industrial standards. </p>

        catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields,
        we don’t need as much of it. That will bring down the size of
        the reactor, and its cost”. </p>
      <p>The process starts with a liquid biofuel such as ethanol, which
        is heated and pumped into a reactor, where the catalyst spurs a
        series of chemical reactions that ultimately convert the liquid
        to a hydrogen-rich gas. </p>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges the researchers faced was how to
        prevent "coking" -- the formation of carbon fragments on the
        surface of the catalyst. The combination of metals -- cerium
        oxide and calcium -- solved that problem, because it promoted
        the movement of oxygen ions inside the catalyst. When exposed to
        enough oxygen, the carbon, like the biofuel, is converted into a
        gas and gets oxidized; it becomes carbon dioxide. </p>
      <p>At the end of the process, waste gases such as carbon monoxide,
        carbon dioxide and methane are removed, and the hydrogen is
        purified. To make the process more energy-efficient, heat
        exchangers capture waste heat and put that energy back into the
        reactor.&nbsp; Methane recovered in the process can be used to
        supply part of the energy. </p>
      <p>Though this work was based on converting ethanol, Ozkan's team
        is now studying how to use the same catalyst with other liquid
        biofuels. Her coauthors on this presentation included Ohio State
        doctoral students Hua Song and Lingzhi Zhang. </p>
      <p>This research was funded by the Department of Energy. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Catalyst systems and methods provide benefits in reducing the
        content of nitrogen oxides in a gaseous stream containing nitric
        oxide (NO), hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide (CO), and oxygen
        (O.sub.2). The catalyst system comprises an oxidation catalyst
        comprising a first metal supported on a first inorganic oxide
        for catalyzing the oxidation of NO to nitrogen dioxide
        (NO.sub.2), and a reduction catalyst comprising a second metal
        supported on a second inorganic oxide for catalyzing the
        reduction of NO.sub.2 to nitrogen (N.sub.2). </p>

      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] The present invention is generally directed to systems
        and methods of catalytic removal of pollutants in a gaseous
        stream, and is specifically directed to systems and methods of
        catalytic removal of pollutants via catalyst systems comprising
        oxidation and reduction catalysts. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] Nitrogen oxides (NO, NO.sub.2, N.sub.2O) contribute to
        several environmental hazards including global warming, smog,
        ground level ozone formation, and acid rain. Emission reduction
        is possible through modification of combustion parameters, but
        reducing NO.sub.x emissions to acceptable levels requires
        effective aftertreatment technologies. Current catalytic
        NO.sub.x reduction control technologies include three-way
        catalysts and ammonia-based selective catalytic reduction. While
        these methods are highly effective for current combustion
        technologies, they are unsuitable for the next generation of
        high efficiency lean-burn natural gas engines. Three-way
        catalysts are inactive in oxygen rich environments, while the
        large size and expense of ammonia SCR installations make them an
        impractical solution in a distributed energy context. </p>
      <p>[0004] NO.sub.x, trap systems have received attention as a
        possible solution for lean NO.sub.x removal. These traps rely on
        bifunctional materials to store and reduce NO.sub.x under
        different engine cycles. Under lean conditions NO.sub.x is
        `trapped` on alkali metal oxides, and the engine is then
        periodically run under rich conditions to accomplish reduction
        over precious metals. These changes in engine operating
        conditions would necessitate additional engine controls.
        Additionally, current trap materials such as Ba and Pt are
        susceptible to sintering and SO.sub.2 poisoning. </p>
      <p>[0005] The use of hydrocarbons as reducing agents in NO removal
        has attracted significant attention. The presence of
        hydrocarbons in current engine exhaust streams would make them a
        readily available and cost effective choice. However,
        hydrocarbon combustion, particularly in oxygen rich
        environments, may block NO reduction reactions. </p>
      <p>[0006] As demands increase for methods of removing pollutants,
        the need arises for improved systems and methods of pollutant
        removal, especially systems operable to offset the hydrocarbon
        combustion in oxygen rich environments. </p>

      <p>[0010] Additional features and advantages provided by
        embodiments of the present invention will be more fully
        understood in view of the following detailed description. </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0011] In accordance with one embodiment of the present
        invention, a catalyst system for reducing the content of
        nitrogen oxides in a gaseous stream containing nitric oxide
        (NO), hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide (CO), and oxygen (O.sub.2)
        is provided. The catalyst system comprises an oxidation catalyst
        comprising a first metal supported on a first inorganic oxide
        for catalyzing the oxidation of NO to nitrogen dioxide
        (NO.sub.2). The oxidation catalyst may comprise any combination
        of metals with inorganic oxides, which are suitable to
        accelerate the reaction of NO with oxygen to produce NO.sub.2.
        The first metal may include, but is not limited to, cobalt,
        silver, or combinations thereof, and the first inorganic oxide
        may include, but is not limited to, titania, zirconia, alumina,
        or combinations thereof. In one exemplary embodiment, the
        oxidation catalyst may comprise cobalt on a zirconia support,
        wherein the oxidation catalyst comprises from about 1 to about
        10% by weight of cobalt. The oxidation reaction may convert
        about 50% to about 90% by weight of the NO to NO.sub.2, and, in
        one embodiment, may produce a conversion of between about 70% to
        about 90% by weight. The temperature of the oxidation may vary
        based on the components of the gaseous stream and the catalysts.
        The oxidation generally occurs at a temperature of about 200 to
        about 500.degree. C. In a further embodiment, the above
        conversions may be achieved at a temperature of about
        300.degree. C. </p>
      <p>[0012] Furthermore, the catalyst system also comprises a
        reduction catalyst comprising a second metal supported on a
        second inorganic oxide for catalyzing the reduction of NO.sub.2
        to nitrogen (N.sub.2). The reduction catalyst may comprise any
        combination of metals with inorganic oxides suitable to
        accelerate the reaction of NO.sub.2 with hydrocarbons in the
        gaseous stream to produce N.sub.2. In some embodiments, the
        second metal may comprise palladium, and the second inorganic
        oxide may comprise titania, zirconia, alumina, or combinations
        thereof. The palladium may comprise about 0.1 to about 0.5% by
        weight of cobalt; however, other amounts are contemplated
        depending on the catalytic requirements of the reduction
        reaction. In one exemplary embodiment, the reduction catalyst
        comprises palladium on a sulfated zirconia support. The
        reduction reaction may convert about 50% to about 80% by weight
        of the NO.sub.2 to N.sub.2, and, in a further embodiment, may
        produce a conversion of between about 60% to about 80% by
        weight. </p>
      <p>[0013] The high degree of conversion in the reduction step is
        due, in large part, to the initial oxidation step. NO.sub.2 is
        more easily reduced than NO in a gaseous stream that includes
        both oxygen and hydrocarbons. For NO reduction, the combustion
        reaction of hydrocarbon in the presence of oxygen dominates over
        the reduction reaction of NO to N.sub.2. By oxidizing NO to
        NO.sub.2 and then reducing the NO.sub.2, the conversion to
        N.sub.2 is greatly enhanced, because the NO.sub.2 reduction
        reaction is not substantially blocked by the hydrocarbon
        combustion, which is the case for NO reduction. </p>
      <p>[0014] In the gaseous stream, the hydrocarbons may comprise
        various compounds known to one skilled in the art. These
        hydrocarbon compounds may include, but are not limited to,
        methane, ethane, propane, or combinations thereof. The oxygen in
        the gaseous stream may be fed in excess to overcome any
        thermodynamic limitations of the oxidation reaction. In one
        embodiment, the gaseous stream may comprise about 2 to about 15%
        O.sub.2. </p>
      <p>[0015] The catalyst system may comprise various configurations
        known to one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the
        oxidation catalyst and the reduction catalyst are disposed on a
        catalyst bed. In a few exemplary embodiments, the catalyst bed
        may define a mixed bed, a monolith bed structure having
        oxidation and reduction catalysts embedded therein, or a bed
        comprising alternating layers or sections of oxidation and
        reduction catalysts. The catalysts can be combined in the system
        in several ways: physically mixing of catalyst powders, layering
        the catalyst powders, impregnating a single monolith support
        with both catalysts, or alternating sections of impregnated
        monolith support. The following catalyst production methods
        provide exemplary procedures for producing the oxidation and
        reduction catalysts of the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0016] An oxidation catalyst comprised of cobalt supported on
        either titania or zirconia may be produced through incipient
        wetness or sol-gel techniques. The catalyst may contain between
        1% and 10% cobalt by weight. The incipient wetness catalyst is
        prepared by first calcining the support (titania or zirconia) at
        500.degree. C. for 3 hours. Cobalt is then added to the support
        by the addition of a cobalt nitrate in water or ethanol
        solution, in amount equal to the pore volume of the support. The
        sample is then dried at 100.degree. C. overnight. After drying
        the catalyst sample is calcined in air at temperatures between
        300-600.degree. C. for 3 hours. Based on final desired weight
        loading of cobalt several additions of cobalt nitrate solution
        may be used. The catalyst can be prepared either by drying, or
        by calcining the catalysts between cobalt nitrate solution
        additions. The sol-gel prepared catalysts are synthesized in a
        single step. A solution of titanium isopropoxide or zirconia
        propoxide (depending on the desired support material) in
        isopropyl alcohol is hydrolyzed with a solution of cobalt
        nitrate in water. The water is added under stirring, and once
        complete the resulting gel is dried in air overnight and then
        calcined at between 300-600.degree. C. for 3 hours in air. </p>
      <p>[0017] In producing the reduction catalyst comprising palladium
        supported on a sulfated zirconia support, the sulfated zirconia
        support is first prepared by pore volume addition of ammonium
        sulfate in water solution to a zirconia support. After the
        addition step, the treated support is dried at 100.degree. C.
        overnight, then calcined in air at 500.degree. C. for 3 hours.
        Palladium is added through pore volume additions of a palladium
        chloride and water solution. Small amounts of hydrochloric acid
        may be used to dissolve the palladium chloride. After adding the
        palladium chloride solution, the catalyst sample is dried at
        100.degree. C. overnight and then calcined in oxygen at
        500.degree. C. for 3 hours. </p>
      <p>[0018] In addition to the removal of nitrogen oxides
        (NO.sub.x), the catalyst system may also be operable to oxidize
        carbon monoxide and/or hydrocarbons. In one embodiment, the CO
        in the gaseous stream may be oxidized to carbon dioxide
        (CO.sub.2) in the presence of the oxidation catalyst. In yet
        another embodiment, the catalyst system may also be operable to
        oxidize the hydrocarbons in the gaseous stream in the presence
        of the oxidation catalyst. Oxidizing the hydrocarbons may reduce
        the amount of unoxidized hydrocarbons, which may enhance the
        reduction of NO.sub.2 to N.sub.2. Thus, in a further embodiment,
        the catalyst system may comprise an additional oxidation
        catalyst, e.g. oxidation catalyst bed, to oxidize unreacted
        hydrocarbons after the reduction step. In an exemplary
        embodiment, a hydrocarbon feed comprising 85% methane/10%
        ethane/5% propane may be oxidized in the presence of an
        oxidation catalyst, wherein the ethane and propane are
        substantially oxidized at a temperature of about 275 to about
        325.degree. C. and the methane is substantially oxidized at a
        temperature of about 425 to about 450.degree. C. </p>
      <p>[0019] The present invention has numerous applications for
        pollutant removal from gaseous streams. In one embodiment, the
        catalyst system may be incorporated in a lean exhaust pollutant
        removal system. The lean exhaust removal system, which is
        applicable for lean burn engines, e.g. natural gas fuel engines,
        comprises an exhaust outlet in communication with the catalyst
        system and configured to deliver the gaseous stream to the
        catalyst system. To minimize costs, the lean exhaust removal
        system eliminates the need for the injection of additional
        hydrocarbon reducing agent in the reduction of NO.sub.2. The
        system relies on the unburned hydrocarbon fuel remaining in
        exhaust. The lean exhaust removal system, as described herein,
        may also be applied to other devices, such as diesel engines and
        advanced gas reciprocating engines. </p>

      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] The present invention is generally directed to systems
        and methods of catalytic removal of pollutants in a gaseous
        stream, and is specifically directed to systems and methods of
        catalytic removal of pollutants at low temperatures. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] Air pollution continues to be a serious global problem.
        The present industrial plants and automobiles burn fossil fuels
        and emit a staggering amount of gaseous pollutants, principally
        unburned or partially burned fossil fuels, carbon monoxide,
        nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide. Thus, there is a high
        demand for air purification methods, which remove these
        pollutants, such as carbon monoxide. </p>
      <p>[0004] Numerous technologies have been developed; however, many
        of these technologies are costly and/or inefficient. As a
        result, there is a continuing desire to develop systems and
        methods to effectively remove carbon monoxide from gaseous
        streams at minimal cost. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0005] In a first embodiment of the present invention, a method
        of carbon monoxide (CO) removal is provided. The method
        comprises providing an oxidation catalyst comprising cobalt
        supported on an inorganic oxide. The method further comprises
        feeding a gaseous stream comprising CO, and oxygen (O.sub.2) to
        the catalyst system, and removing CO from the gaseous stream by
        oxidizing the CO to carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2) in the presence of
        the oxidation catalyst at a temperature between about 20 to
        about 200.degree. C. </p>
      <p>[0006] In a second embodiment of the present invention, another
        method of CO removal is provided. The method comprises providing
        an oxidation catalyst comprising cobalt on a titania or a
        zirconia support, feeding a gaseous stream comprising carbon
        monoxide (CO), and oxygen (O.sub.2) to the catalyst system, and
        oxidizing the CO to carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2) in the presence of
        the oxidation catalyst at a temperature between about 100 to
        about 200.degree. C. </p>
      <p>[0007] Additional features and advantages provided by
        embodiments of the present invention will be more fully
        understood in view of the following detailed description. </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0008] In accordance with one embodiment of the present
        invention, a method of carbon monoxide (CO) removal is provided.
        The method comprises providing an oxidation catalyst comprising
        cobalt supported on an inorganic oxide. The inorganic oxide,
        when used in combination with the cobalt, may comprise any
        material effective at oxidizing CO to carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2).
        The inorganic oxide may include, but is not limited to, titania,
        zirconia, or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the
        catalyst comprises from about 1 to about 10% by weight of
        cobalt. </p>
      <p>[0009] The method further comprises feeding a gaseous stream
        comprising CO, and oxygen (O.sub.2) to the catalyst system. The
        gaseous stream may comprise up to about 3% CO, or in a further
        embodiment, from about 600 ppm to about 3% CO. The gaseous
        stream may comprise less than about 10% H.sub.2O, or in a
        further embodiment, less than about 2% H.sub.2O. In one
        embodiment, the gaseous stream may comprise up to about 15%
        O.sub.2, or in a further embodiment, about 2% to about 10%
        O.sub.2. </p>
      <p>[0010] The method then includes removing CO from the gaseous
        stream by oxidizing the CO to CO.sub.2 in the presence of the
        oxidation catalyst at a temperature between about 20 to about
        200.degree. C. In a further embodiment, the temperature ranges
        from between about 100 to about 200.degree. C. It is further
        contemplated to conduct the oxidation at higher temperatures,
        for example, up to about 500.degree. C. At temperatures above
        100.degree. C., there is less likelihood of catalyst
        deactivation. In one embodiment, the oxidation of CO to CO.sub.2
        defines a conversion of about 90% to substantially about 100%.
        In a further embodiment, the conversion of CO to CO.sub.2 is
        maximized at temperatures between about 100 to about 200.degree.
        C. </p>
      <p>[0011] Oxidizing the CO at low temperatures, for example, at
        room temperature, benefits the system. For instance, minimizing
        the temperature may minimize the heating and/or electric costs
        required. Moreover, at temperatures below 200.degree. C., the
        combustion of hydrocarbons present in the gaseous stream is
        minimal, and thus does not affect the reaction kinetics of other
        reactions, for example, the CO oxidation. </p>
      <p>[0012] The catalyst system may comprise various configurations
        known to one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the
        oxidation catalyst may be disposed on a catalyst bed. In some
        exemplary embodiments, the catalyst bed may define a powder bed,
        or a monolith bed structure having the cobalt embedded in the
        inorganic oxide support. The catalyst can be combined in the
        system in several ways: producing a bed of powdered catalyst, or
        impregnating a single monolith support with the oxidation
        catalyst. The following catalyst production methods provide
        exemplary procedures for producing the oxidation catalyst of the
        present invention. </p>
      <p>[0013] An oxidation catalyst comprised of cobalt supported on
        either titania or zirconia may be produced through incipient
        wetness or sol-gel techniques. The catalyst can contain between
        1% and 10% cobalt by weight. The incipient wetness catalyst is
        prepared by first calcining the support (titania or zirconia) at
        500.degree. C. for 3 hours. Cobalt is then added to the support
        by the addition of a cobalt nitrate in water solution, in amount
        equal to the pore volume of the support. The sample is then
        dried at 100.degree. C. overnight. After drying, the catalyst
        sample is calcined in air at temperatures between
        300-600.degree. C. for 3 hours. Based on the final desired
        weight of cobalt, several additions of cobalt nitrate solution
        may be used. The catalyst can be prepared either by drying, or
        by calcining the catalysts between cobalt nitrate solution
        additions. The sol-gel prepared catalysts are synthesized in a
        single step. A solution of titanium isopropoxide or zirconia
        propoxide (depending on the desired support material) in
        isopropyl alcohol is hydrolyzed with a solution of cobalt
        nitrate in water or ethanol. The water is added under stirring,
        and once complete the resulting gel is dried in air overnight
        and then calcined at between 300-600.degree. C. for 3 hours in
        air. </p>
      <p>[0014] The method has numerous pollutant removal applications,
        for example, in respiratory and environmental pollution control
        processes. The method may be applicable for use in sealed
        environments, for example, a submarine or a spacecraft. In
        addition, these catalysts could be used for gas purification in
        closed-cycle CO.sub.2 lasers, and CO gas sensors. Furthermore,
        the method may be applicable for selectively oxidizing CO in
        steam reforming reactions, and for fuel cell applications in
        which CO must be removed from the gas feed to prevent poisoning
        of the electrodes. This method can also be used to remove CO

      <p>Abstract --- Fe-Al-Cu catalysts have numerous industrial
        applications, for example, as catalysts in a water gas shift
        reactor. A method of producing a Fe-Al-Cu catalyst comprises the
        steps of providing an organic iron precursor, dissolving the
        organic iron precursor in a solvent solution, adding an aqueous
        solution comprising aluminum nitrate and copper nitrate to the
        organic iron precursor-solvent solution, precipitating a gel
        comprising Fe-Al-Cu by adding a base, and drying the gel to form
        the Fe-Al-Cu catalyst. </p>
