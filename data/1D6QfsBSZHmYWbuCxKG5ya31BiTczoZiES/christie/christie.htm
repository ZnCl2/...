      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Two Cairns inventors
          yesterday unveiled a world first commercial machine which can
          power a house from a permanent, clean, green and virtually
          free energy source. The machine, developed by Brinsmead
          mechanical engineer John Christie and Edge Hil electrician Lou
          Brits, has an international patent pending and is expected to
          go on the market for $4000-$5000.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Relying on the attraction
          and repulsion of internal magnets, the Lutec 1000 operates
          continually on a pulse-like current 24 hours a day - producing
          24 kilowatts of power - once it is kickstarted from a battery
          source. The device is more than 500 per cent efficient,
          compared to a car which is less than 40 per cent efficient and
          loses power through heat and friction. No powerlines would be
          needed to distribute energy from the individual power sources.
          There is no heat, harmful emissions or airborne matter in the
          transmission. If it were not for the magnets, which have a
          life of 1300 years, and the battery pack, which has a life of
          about five years, the machine would be in perpetual motion.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A demonstration of the motor
          from the carpeted study of Mr Christie's Brinsmead home
          revealed the device in all its glory - bigger than the average
          cyclone back-up generator but much less noisy. M Christie and
          Mr Brits have been tinkering together on the motor in their
          spare time since they met in a Sheridan St cafe five years ago
          and began sharing ideas. One and a half years ago, the design
          was perfected and the pair lodged a patent with Brisbane
          patent attorneys Griffith Hack. Mr Christie said the next step
          was to develop a small-scale pilot plant in Cairns to begin
          distributing the motors to the places they were needed most -
          such as shops and homes in the power-starved Daintree region
          and the Torres Strait. He said the price tag for the devices
          could vary in remote locations depending on government
          rebates, freight and installation costs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The beauty of the device was
          that it was transportable and could be packed in a removalist
          van along with other earthly possessions when moving house, he
          said The only problem the pair now face is in raising $500,000
          to start their production plant. "We're trying to keep it
          local, and trying to keep it in Australia, but it's hard
          because, offshore, they are more aggressive in taking up new
          initiatives," Mr Christie said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Already, the invention has
          received interest from the United States, China, Japan and
          Indonesia. "But we want to set up here and put the product on
          the market first, and then we'll take it to the world," he
          said. Mr Christie said it had been hard to keep a lid on the
          invention which had such a huge potential in the quest for
          clean, green, energy production. He said he and Mr Brit also
          feared the worst once they realised the significance of their
          invention. "We were afraid the kids would be kidnapped or we'd
          be shot, I'm not kidding," he said. "You hear horror stories
          about people running up against fuel companies, but it's all
          hogwash --- people in the main are desperately looking for
          technologies that will help our environment."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The pair have begun
          discussions with Ergon [ the local electricity supplier
          utility] as there is also the opportunity of selling energy
          back to the grid. Mr Christie said the average home with a
          pool needed only 14kW of energy per day - which meant a 10 kW
          daily excess would be left over during the generation process</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Griffith Hack partner Cliff
          Carew, who was speaking from Brisbane, confirmed the device
          was genuine and unique. "An international application has been
          lodged, they've conducted an international search and haven't
          come up with anything similar, so it would seem to be a new
          concept," Mr Carew said. He said it would be another two and a
          half years before the patent was recognised in 140 countries
          around the world - the usual length of time for an
          international patent to be processed.</font> </p>

      <h4> <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>The Cairns Post</i><b>
            ~ Two Cairns inventors who say they have developed a radical
            new energy generating machine have been swamped with
            inquiries over the past 24 hours since going public with
            their discovery.</b></font></h4>
      <font face="Times New Roman,Times">One Cairns businessman already
        has offered a substantial sum of money to bankroll the
        establishment of a factory to produce the new generator.</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He was among a crowd of
          curious Far Northerners who rushed to contact Edge Hill
          electrician Lou Brits and Brinsmead mechanical enginner John
          Christie once news of their invention broke in the Cairns Post
          yesterday.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Investors, people with
          scientific backgrounds and those who were keen to buy one of
          the new Lutec 1000 machines to power their homes swamped the
          Cairns Post and the two inventors, who work from home, with
          their calls. The generator is capable of producing 24
          kilowatts of energy per day and is powered by the alternating
          attraction and repulsion of internal magnets once it is
          kickstarted from a battery source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has more than twice
          enough energy to power the average family home, while
          remaining free from heat, emissions or airborne matter. Mr.
          Christie said he and Mr. Brits realised their invention "flew
          in the face of physics" by being 500 per cent efficient - but
          it worked.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The phone hasn't stopped
          ringing." Mr. Christie said yesterday afternoon. We've had
          calls from the Daintree - people wanting to place orders and
          buy them. We're happy about that but, really, we're not in the
          position to take orders."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Christie said he began
          receiving phone calls from 7:30AM yesterday (when the story
          was first reported).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Christie said people
          begain arriving unannounced on his doorstep from 8:30AM.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He said two people he had
          never met before had even needed to be ushered out of the room
          just after 9AM when he went on air for a radio interview.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An international patent is
          pending on the invention and the two men already have received
          interest from overseas.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But Mr. Brits and Mr.
          Christie say they are keen to setup a production plant in
          Cairns to produce the machines on a small scale to power homes
          in remote areas of Queensland like the Daintree region and in
          the Torres Strait.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Cairns businessman Alex Roma
          yesterday said he was prepared to help bankroll the production
          plant as it was an opportunity to expand industry in the Far
          North.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ahead of meeting the two
          inventors late yesterday, Mr. Roma said if their invention
          stacked up, he was prepared to up up "a large sum" to help
          make the local production plant a reality.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Looking at this, it's
          fantastic," he said. "I've always said Cairns needs a boost in
          industry - it's one thing Cairns is lacking. We'd employ local
          people and produce something we could export apart from sugar
          cane and seafood."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Roma said an opportunity
          existed to produce locally not just the machines but all of
          the accompanying components.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Member for Leichhardt Warren
          Entsch lent his support to the proposal to develop a plant to
          manufacture the clean, green power generators in Cairns.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ergon Energy spokeswoman
          Sara Collins said discussions were ongoing with the inventors,
          who hope to sell excess power back to the grid.</font> </p>

          </b>)</font></center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have never said there is
          an "endless" source of energy emanating from magnets. We have
          said that the magnets we use in the Lutec 1000 are able to
          maintain their magnetic qualities for over twelve hundred
          years. That is a long time when gauged by human life
          expectancy, but is not forever. We welcome informed opinion,
          and to that end have sought out the highest qualified people
          in Australia and the United States of America to review our
          work.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Lutec 1000 only baffles
          those who misinterpret the actions taking place within it as
          being outside common scientific principles and laws, where in
          fact it certainly is not. We will try to make a simple
          explanation to demonstrate what motivates the Lutec 1000
          motor/ generator:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let’s say we hang a ten kilo
          weight off a permanent magnet butted to a steel roofing beam,
          and that the only thing holding the permanent magnet to the
          steel beam is the magnetism. Now let’s do the same thing, but
          this time with an electro-magnet which requires a constant
          electrical input to maintain its magnetic qualities.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let’s say we leave them both
          there for ten years"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">They will both perform the
          same task, that of holding the ten kilos off the floor. The
          electro-magnet, however, has needed to be fuelled by
          electricity provided by a generator of some kind - it could be
          hydro, nuclear, wind, solar, coal or oil - and has cost a
          large amount in terms of energy. Much work (in the scientific
          sense) has been done to provide the constant electric current
          necessary to maintain its magnetic hold on the steel girder.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now take notice, the
          permanent magnet has not needed to be energised by an external
          source, it has done the job for free" using only the magnetism
          it contains to perform the same job. The clue here is in the
          title of "permanent" magnet.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That same principle is one
          of the reasons the Lutec 1000 motor turns, it is of course the
          spinning of the centre core of the motor which is caused by
          the permanent magnets being attracted and then repulsed from
          the steel cores of the fixed stator coils. It is this primary
          movement that allows the magnetic fields around the stator
          coils to be "cut" by the effect of the permanent magnets
          sweeping past the steel cores of the coils.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Note that we have achieved
          two effects from one cause, thus inducing an electric current
          per Mr Faraday’s theory, and so generating electricity as an
          output or product of the motors motion. The only electricity
          consumed has been that required to temporarily charge the
          coils and so creating a temporary magnet of like polarity to
          cause the permanent magnet to be repulsed rather than
          attracted.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are a couple of other
          major factors that we won’t go into here, suffice it to say
          that our current prototype demonstrates 1500% more "out" than
          "in"...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For the technically-minded,
          the following formula is used to determine consumption of
          input power:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the waveforms are
          periodic with constant rotational speed of the machine and
          constant mechanical load on the output, then a calculation of
          energy usage over one full rotational cycle should suffice.

              Skeptics Challenged</font></font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(Unidentified source)</font></center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Inventors of the
          controversial Lutec fuel-free energy generator have thrown off
          the machine's cover and invited sceptics to air their doubts
          when the generator is publicly displayed later this year.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Lutec 1000 has been
          refined and redeveloped for the sixth time and inventors Lou
          Brits and John Christie say the machine is almost ready for
          release. They are also inviting qualified electricians to
          personally contact them about becoming licensed installers for
          the Cairnes area.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The sixth generation Lutec
          1000 now stands one metre tall (in an upright position) and
          has a steel frame which has allowed the inventors to attach
          more magnets closer to the drum to increase the power
          generation capacity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Christie said the
          'switches' used to supply the energy into the drum-shaped
          machine were also becoming smaller and more compact.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The new-look Lutec should be
          completed by the end of the month and the inventors hope to
          display all six generations of the machine at the Hilton Hotel
          later this year.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While Mr. Christie is eager
          to silence the critics with a public demonstration, he must
          wait for international agreements to be finalized.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, he did invite the
          'doubters' to see the machine work in person, saying patents
          were now pending in more than 100 countries, and he could
          provide detailed information of experts who could verify their
          work.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">'They are welcome to contact
          us and we will give them the names of experts who have
          assessed the machine, but who's going to pay the experts, who
          are paid more than $US90 an hour, to sit down and explain it
          to them - because we're not,' Mr. Christie said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">'We don't mind people
          criticising the machine, but no one who has come to see the
          motor has gone away still believing it would not work.'</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Brits said the crux of
          the disbelief centred around the perception that the Lutec
          1000 created energy - an assumption which was essentially
          flawed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">'They are not taking into
          account the combination of the capabilities of permanent
          magnets and the effects on the incoming current caused by the
          induction of a greater current caused within the motor,' he
          said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">'All people see is the
          amount of energy we are putting in and more coming out. They
          then wrongly assume that we are creating energy.'</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The core of the Lutec 1000
          spins as the magnets - spaced alternately around the drum -
          are attracted then repulsed (using a small electrical circuit)
          to steel cores which are off-set above the centre down.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Brits said the machine
          released the energy stored in the magnets and anyone who
          doubted the 'stored energy' should try holding a piece of
          steel off the ground for an extended period.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">'In the same way as a person
          holding a weight uses energy while they are not moving, a
          magnet uses energy to attract and hold a piece of steel,' he
          said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">'And it's absolute nonsense
          that a magnet can only be used on once. Everybody knows if you
          take a fridge magnet off the fridge and put a new piece of
          paper under it, it still sticks as good as new.'</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A recent demonstration
          showed the inventors were modest in claiming a 400 per cent
          increase in energy output, with the Lutec 1000 lighting up six
          light bulbs (360 watts) with an input of just 42 watts.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Brits admitted the
          magnets would run out of 'energy', in approximately 1300
          years, but could be recharged with an electrical current.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Christie said he and Mr.
          Brits had recently been approached by a company whowere
          interested in adapting the Lutec to power machines used in
          space exploration and he believed eventually the generator
          could be used in motor operated appliances.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Environmental Protection
          Agency had also assessed the machine with the intention of
          giving inertial household users rebates or 'green house
          credits'.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He said the size and
          capability of the machine could be changed to suit the need
          and envisioned a household full of Lutec 1000's.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">'Things like your fan could
          have a Lutec motor and the excess energy created could go back
          into a household battery to run static appliances like your
          television.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">'It is certainly possible
          that it could remove a household from the power grid
          completely.'</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has been almost a year
          since many of you first registered your interest in the Lutec
          technology phenomenon. We apologize for the long delay in
          preparing this much awaited newsletter. We can only say that
          we share your frustrations as the past year has been mainly
          spent trying to source venture capital to get the Lutec
          revolution underway.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sadly, we have to report
          that it is almost impossible to obtain financial support for a

          Australia.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, the year has not
          been wasted by any means. Lou and John have continued
          development of the Lutec 1000. The solid state switching has
          been designed, built, tested and installed onto the machine
          with the results to output exceeding expectations. The machine
          itself has also undergone a number of design refinements which
          ahve all added to improved efficiency.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Finally I can report that
          the manufacture of these generators has been awarded to a
          Cairns electrical manufacturer with prodcution expected to
          start by the end of this financial year. Initially the rate of
          production will be limited to only 10 per month, but we expect
          to increase this to 250 per month as demand and capital allow.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We hope to have one of the

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For those of you waiting for
          the opportunity to acquire one of these electrical generators,
          please act quickly as weexpect demand to far outweigh supply
          and the waiting period for delivery may be as much as 6
          months.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fortunately the
          international interest in this new revolutionary technology
          far exceeds the apathetic approach shown by Australian
          entrepreneurs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We can now report that a

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Field of Invention</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention
          relates to motors which are used for generating a torque and
          generators used for generating electricity.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Background of the
            Invention</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A typical electric motor
          consists of a stator and rotor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The operation of an electric
          motor is based on the principal that an electric current
          through a conductor produces a magnetic field, the direction
          of current in an electromagnet such as a coil of wire
          determines the location of the magnet poles and like magnetic
          poles repel and opposite poles attract.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The stator which is
          typically called the field structure establishes a constant
          magnetic field in the motor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Typically the magnetic field
          is established by permanent magnets which are called field
          magnets and located at equally spaced intervals around the
          rotor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The rotor or armature
          typically consists of a series of equally spaced coils which
          are able to be energized to produce a magnetic field and thus
          north or south poles.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By keeping the coils
          energized the interacting magnetic fields of the rotor and the
          stator produce rotation of the rotor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To ensure that rotation
          occurs in a single direction a commutator is typically
          connected to the windings of the coils of the rotor so as to
          change the direction of the current applied to the coils.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the direction of the
          current was not reversed the rotor would rotate in one
          direction and then reverse its direction before a full cycle
          of rotation could be completed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The above description
          typifies a DC motor. AC motors do not have commutators because
          alternating current reverses its direction independently.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For a typical AC motor such
          as an induction motor the rotor has no direct connection to
          the external source of electricity. Alternating current flows
          around field cols in the stator and produces a rotating
          magnetic field. This rotating magnetic field induces an
          electric current in the rotor resulting in another magnetic
          field.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This induced magnetic field
          from the rotor interacts with the magnetic field from the
          stator causing the rotor to turn.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An electric generator is
          effectively the reverse of an electric motor. Instead of
          supplying electricity to coils of either the stator or the
          rotor, the rotor or armature is rotated by physical forces
          produced by a prime mover.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In effect a generator
          changes mechanical energy into electrical energy.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Summary of the Invention</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention is
          aimed at providing an improved rotary device which operates
          with improved efficiency compared to conventional rotary
          devices.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention is
          also concerned with providing a system for controlling a
          rotary device which is able to generate electrical and/or

          is connected to the rotary device to control rotation of the
          rotary device, and wherein the controller is adapted to
          periodically energize at least one energizing coil of the
          device to create a magnetic field of a polarity which induces
          the rotor to rotate in s single direction and wherein the
          controller is switched off so as to e-energize the energizing
          coil when other forces, being forces other than those
          resulting from the energized energizing coil produce a
          resultant force which induces rotation of the rotor in a
          single direction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Preferably the controller is
          adapted to energize the energizing coil for a period which the
          resultant force from the other forces acts to rotate the rotor
          in the opposite direction, whereby the force applied by the
          energizing coil overcomes (is greater than) the resultant

          EMF induced by other forces to urge the rotor to rotate in the
          single direction before the resultant force is zero.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As shown in <b><a
              href="#fig4a">Figure 4a</a></b> according to the first
          embodiment of the invention a system is provided consisting of
          a rotor 11 having four permanent magnets M1, M2, M3, M4 which
          are evenly spaced at 90° with respect to each other.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The system includes a stator
          12 consisting of three electro-magnet energizing coils A, B, C
          which are spaced 120° apart from each other.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each coil A, B, C is
          connected in circuit with a power supply of 54 volts and a
          switch RS1, RS2, RS3.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each of the contacts RS1,
          RS2, RS3 are part of a rotary switch 13 having contacts 14,
          15, 16, 17 which are spaced at 90° with respect to an adjacent
          contact.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The rotary switch 13 is
          provided with contact brushes 18, 19 and is mounted on an axle
          20 which is the same or common with the axle of the rotor 11.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each of the contacts 14, 15,
          16, 17 is specially configured with a trapezoidal shape, with
          the two non-parallel sides consisting of a straight side 21,
          and a tapered side 22 which tapers outwardly from top side 23
          to bottom side 24.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The result is that each
          contact increases in width from the top side to the bottom
          side 24.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The brush 18 is able to be
          moved vertically relative to the contacts 14, 15, 16, 17 while
          the brush 19 is in constant contact with the base.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although <b><a href="#fig1">Figure










              1</a></b> only shows the rotary switch 13 having a single
          series of four contacts 14, 15, 16, 17, for the three coil
          stator system, shown in <b><a href="#fig4a">Figure 4a</a></b>
          there would in fact be preferably the contact discs on the
          axle 20.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each contact disc would have
          contacts for a respective one of the coils A, B, C, but each
          brush for the other discs would be offset by 30° and 60°
          respectively.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A description of the
          operation of the system shown in Figures 1 to 4a will now be
          set forth below.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If it is assumed that the
          magnets M1, M2, M3, M4 are initially aligned as shown in <b><a
              href="#fig4a">Figure 4a</a></b> with magnet M1 opposite
          one end of coil A, coil A is energized whenever one of the
          magnets M1 to M4 is aligned opposite it and for a
          predetermined time after the permanent magnet has passed it.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As shown in <b><a
              href="#fig6">Figure 6</a></b> coil A is energized by
          contact RS1 providing an electrical connection through the
          rotary switch 13.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This occurs by one of the
          contacts 14 to 17 being aligned in contact with brush 18. At
          this time current is applied from the power source VA and
          continues to be applied until the brush 18 is no longer in
          contact with one of the contacts 14 to 17.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For the three coil/four pole
          arrangement of the first embodiment it is preferred that the
          brushes are moved to a vertical position where the width of
          each contact is sufficient for each of the switches RS1, RS2
          and RS3 to be closed for 12°, 51', 50" of the rotation of the
          rotor 11. After this time the switches RS1 to RS3 are open and
          no more current is delivered to any one of the coils A to C.
          When the current to each of the coils is switched off a back
          EMF is induced in each of the coils A to C and this back EMF
          represented by item Z results in current being maintained in
          each of the coils for an additional small period of time after
          the contacts RS1 to RS3 are opened.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By switching the coils A to
          C in the above manner the rotor 11 can be induced to rotate
          with a lower amount of input current to the stator than would
          be required if current was delivered constantly to the coils A
          to C.</font> </p>

          displacement of the rotor shows a sinusoidal curve having a

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For a full 360° rotation of

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If it is assumed that it is

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because each of the coils A
          to C has an iron core even when the coils are unenergized the
          natural magnetic attraction occurring between each magnet and

          move in a direction to the closest iron core.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whenever a magnet is
          opposite an iron core the magnetic attraction is greatest and
          there is no force applied by that magnet to move the rotor
          either clockwise or counterclockwise. Likewise when a magnet
          is positioned midway between adjacent iron cores, there is
          also a resultant force of 0 which translates to no resultant
          force being applied to the rotor to rotate it in either
          direction by that magnet.</font> </p>

          coil A to pull the magnet M1 in a counter clockwise direction.
          If the resultant forces applied by the other magnets were
          sufficient to overcome the attraction between permanent magnet
          M1 and the iron core of coil A the rotor would still manage to

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A current could be applied
          to the coil A for an angular displacement of 15° of magnet M1,

          current to coil A for this period of angular displacement a

          overcome the resultant force counterclockwise which occurs for
          0° to 15° of angular displacement of magnet M1.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although current to coil A
          can be applied for longer than this period it has been
          discovered that by applying current for this period a back EMF

          connected in series, parallel or series parallel.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(b) It is only when the

          the rotor that even numbers of permanent magnets are
          necessary, but not necessarily even numbers of pairs of stator
          coils positioned in the stator. Furthermore the direction DC

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(d) The spacings between the

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(v) Regardless of the rotor
          containing even or uneven numbers of permanent magnets the
          stator can operate with only one stator coil and stator iron
          core and still be highly effective but with reduced total

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With the above configuration
          of poles and coils if it is desired to move the rotor
          clockwise, current would need to be supplied to the coils of
          the stator to overcome the counter-clockwise force whenever
          this is counter-clockwise, but as explained previously,
          current does not need to be supplied to the coil to energize
          the coil for the full period during which the resultant force
          is counter-clockwise.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For convenience and ease of
          explanation the above embodiments have been restricted to
          permanent magnets on the rotor and coils on the stator.
          However the basic concept behind the invention does not change
          if the permanent magnets are replaced by coils which are
          energized to produce the appropriate magnetic poles.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Similarly for an AC rotary
          device a rotating magnetic field generated by the stator
          winding or by the rotor/armature winding could similarly be
          switched to reduce the amount of current required to maintain
          rotation of the motor in one direction and to maximize the
          influence of back EMF on maintaining rotation of the motor in
          a single direction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The above principles also
          apply to generators where coils are energized to produce a
          magnetic field. In such a situation the coils are switched on
          for a time sufficient to maintain rotation in the single
          direction and to maximize the influence of back EMF which
          tends to maintain rotation of the rotor/armature in a single
          direction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By using the above concept
          it is possible to produce an output which can be both
          mechanical and electrical at the same time. Current generated
          in the stator coil windings can be used as an output and
          likewise the torque generated by the rotor can be used to
          supply a mechanical output. Likewise only one or the other
          form of output may be utilized.</font> </p>

          reports background details to enforce his argument that this

          along with Dr. Harold Aspden of the United Kingdom (IBM's
          Patent Director for 19 years), was placed in the public domain

          28% efficiency.&nbsp; The exchange was amendable, despite the

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The inventors would start
          with fully charged batteries for the demonstration. They
          assumed that the battery terminal voltage would decrease
          linearly as the battery was used. So, after using the battery
          for, say, 30 minutes, they would again measure the battery
          terminal voltage, and subtract this value from the start
          voltage, then multiply that difference voltage times the known
          amp-hour capacity of the battery bank, to come up with their
          assumption of the total energy consumed from the battery bank.
          Unfortunately, battery terminal voltage is almost flat for
          perhaps 90 percent of the battery capacity, before it drops
          off rather steeply for the last 10 percent of it's capacity.
          Parke Cole and I tried to explain this to the inventors. I am
          not sure we succeeded. We were about the 15th group of people
          to show up on their door step after they went public. We were
          the first people to bring our own test equipment. The
          inventors said that the first people to show up were the
          Russian Mafia. Our bottom line was 50 watts of DC power input,
          which resulted in 14 watts of rotary mechanical power output.
          I hope the inventors have improved their device from where we
          tested it so that it now matches their statements of it's
          performance.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thanks for that update. It
          seems evident that although electro-magnets require energy
          input to "turn on", permanent magnets require energy input to
          "turn off"! The example given on their Website - the permanent
          magnet and electro-magnet supporting a weight from a steel
          beam - should demonstrate this principle. i.e., Energy must be
          inputted to the electro-magnet in order to overcome the
          weight. Although no external energy is required for the
          permanent magnet to support the weight, energy must be
          supplied to OVERCOME the magnet and cause the weight to
          fall...thereby producing useful energy. In other words, the
          permanent magnet is producing zero energy while supporting the
          weight.</font> </p>

      <p>...Walter Rosenthal traveled there with his high frequency

      <p>IT IS THE SAME OLD LYING GAME! </p>
      <p>People are measuring high freq. DC or fast pulsating AC with AC
        meters calibrated to sine wave 0.707 RMS. </p>
      <p>You can not do that! </p>
      <p>Using just AC meters (like an old VTVM), I could easily show
        you that a resistor, capacitor, and inductor arrangement will
        always give you over unity! (Just by ignoring the current to
        voltage phase angle.) </p>
      <p>Walter measured the voltage vs. time digitally (storing many
        data points per cycle), and the current vs. time digitally, and
        then calculated the power point by point via computer, and then
        calculated the average power digitally - for input power and
        output power. </p>
      <p>Then you can get the True output to input power ratio. </p>
      <p>You must use a high frequency oscilloscope with such computing
