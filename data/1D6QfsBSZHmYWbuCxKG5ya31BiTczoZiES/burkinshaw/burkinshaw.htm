            Debut in 2009</b></big><b><br>

      Xeros Ltd's washing machine uses less than 2 percent of the water
      and energy of a conventional machine.<br>
      <br>
      A new washing machine that uses just a cup of water, a pinch of
      detergent, and about 1,000 small plastic chips to clean clothes
      may be available for consumers in the UK next year.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at Leeds University designed the machine, which will
      be marketed by a spin-off company called Xeros Ltd (which means
      "dry" in Greek). Company founder Stephen Burkinshaw, a professor
      of textile chemistry, explains that the machine will reduce both
      water and energy consumption.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, washing machine use accounts for 13 percent of daily
      household water consumption in the UK, or about 21 liters (5.5
      gallons) of water per day, according to the UK organization
      Waterwise. Besides saving water, the Xeros machine uses just 2% of
      the energy of a conventional washing machine. And since clothes
      come out nearly dry, they don´t require the use of a dryer.<br>
      <br>
      "We have shown that it can remove all sorts of everyday stains,
      including coffee and lipstick, while using a tiny fraction of the
      water used by conventional washing machines," Burkinshaw said.<br>
      <br>
      When doing a load of wash, users throw their clothes in like a
      normal washing machine. Then a cartridge in the back of the
      machine adds plastic chips - about 45 pounds (20 kg) of them - to
      the load. Next, a cup of water containing the detergent is added.
      After the water dissolves the dirt, the chips absorb the water,
      without the need for a rinse or spin cycle. When finished, a grill
      at the bottom of the machine opens to collect the chips.<br>
      <br>
      According to Xeros, the chips can last for about 100 loads of
      laundry, or about six months for an average family. The company
      has not yet provided details on what the chips are made of, or how
      easily and safely the chips can be disposed of or recycled.<br>
      <br>
      Working with Leeds University´s commercialization partner IP
      Group, Xeros has secured an investment of almost 500,000 pounds
      ($984,400) for the project. The price of the Xeros washing
      machines for consumers is "not expected to be dramatically
      different from (conventional) washing machines," according to the
      company.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>The Xeros Machine</b><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <b>Overview</b><br>
      <br>
      At first glance a Xeros washing machine appears no different to a
      conventional machine. Access via the unmodified door, the full
      colour controller display, and the general appearance are all
      reassuringly familiar. The proprietary technology that allows the
      machine to handle Xeros polymer beads as part of its wash process
      is hidden from view. The capability for bead storage, transport,
      and crucially, addition and removal from the wash load, is all
      built in.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bead Storage<br>
        <br>
      </b>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="2_sump.jpg" width="226"
          height="236"><br>
      </div>
      Beads are stored in a wet sump mounted low in the machine, which
      is decoupled from the wash drum housing to aid machine balancing
      during high speed extract. The internal structure of the sump is
      specially designed to allow easy removal and transport of the
      beads up into the drum. Storage of the beads in this way also
      enables their cleaning during long term use of the machine, and
      easy hygiene control.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bead Transport/Addition</b><br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="3_bead_pump.jpg" width="221"
          height="237"><img alt="" src="4_sepunit.jpg" width="305"
          height="308"><br>
      </div>
      Also mounted low in the machine is the bead pump which during the
      wash cycle moves the beads to the top of the machine in a small
      amount of transport water. This bead/water mixture then enters a
      proprietary separator device, which passes the beads into the wash
      drum, whilst returning the transport water directly back down to
      the sump where it is used to move the next bead pulse. Crucially,
      the addition of beads to the drum is via another proprietary
      system, which allows the machine door access to remain unhindered
      during use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Washing/Bead Removal</b><br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="5_showerheads.jpg"
          width="271" height="267"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The Xeros polymer beads are then intimately mixed with the wash
      load in the drum, and the combination of their gentle and uniform
      mechanical action plus their tailored chemistry helps generate
      outstanding stain removal, with excellent fabric care.<br>
      <br>
      During the wash phase, the beads continuously fall through holes
      in the drum wall, and return to the sump, where they are again
      pumped back up to the separator device to continue the washing
      process. Hence, the beads are flowed through the wash load during
      washing, allowing stain removal and transport away – so generating
      excellent greying control. The rate of bead flow through the drum
      is one of the key parameters to the Xeros process, and various
      process control features ensure this is tailored to give optimum
      performance.<br>
      <br>
      Xeros uses a spray rinsing system to further deliver on its
      promise of low water consumption. This too is a proprietary piece
      of technology, and it delivers excellent rinsing performance
      versus conventional processes. During rinsing the bead pump is
      switched off, and the combination of low and high speed extracts
      enables the last few beads remaining in the wash load to fall
      through the drum, and return to the sump. The wash load is then
      ready to be removed, and the machine is ready for its next cycle.<br>

      New machine by Xeros cleans clothes with beads and a tiny amount
      of water and may cut household bills by 30%<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The Xeros washing machine uses up to 90% less water than a
      conventional one. <br>
      <br>
      "Dry" cleaning is set to become a domestic activity with a washing
      machine that uses 90% less water than a normal laundry cycle and
      could be available by the end of 2011. The device, developed by
      Leeds-based Xeros Ltd, replaces water with tiny plastic beads that
      suck up stains and its producers claim it will shift stubborn
      pounds from household energy bills as well.<br>
      <br>
      The Xeros process uses 3mm-long nylon beads that can get into all
      the crevices and folds of clothing and can also be re-used
      hundreds of times. The beads flood the machine's drum once the
      clothes are wet and the humidity is at the right level. After the
      washing cycle is complete, the beads drain away in the same way as
      water in a conventional machine.<br>
      <br>
      The chief executive of Xeros, Bill Westwater, said: "The net
      saving in water, detergent and electricity and including the cost
      of the beads, we calculate, is about a 30% cost saving for the
      user." He claims the machine has been tested successfully on a
      range of fabrics stained with everything from mud, red wine and
      curry stains to ink from ballpoint pens.<br>
      <br>
      According to the Energy Saving Trust, just under one-third of
      household energy is used to heat water. Laundry washing also
      accounts for 15% of all household water consumption; meaning if
      everyone in the UK converted from normal washing to the Xeros
      system, the carbon emissions saved would be the equivalent of
      taking 1.4 m cars off the roads. Another perk of the device is
      that it should allow many delicates to be "dry" cleaned at home.<br>
      <br>
      Xeros has already received research and development funding from
      Yorkshire Forward and has just returned from a
      government-sponsored "Clean and Cool" trade mission to the United
      States, aimed at securing investment from venture capitalists in
      Silicon Valley in California.<br>
      <br>
      The idea for polymer-based cleaning came from Stephen Burkinshaw,
      a polymer chemist at Leeds University who spent 30 years working
      out how to improve the dyeing of plastics used in fabrics. A few
      years ago he realised that the stains on clothes acted in a
      similar way to dyes, and he wondered if he could use plastics to
      attract away the stains.<br>
      <br>
      After experimenting with a range of plastics, he settled on nylon.
      Thanks to a natural property of the material, nylon beads attract
      stains to their surface and, in 100% humidity, the molecular
      structure of the plastic becomes amorphous, so the stains diffuse
      into the centre of the beads. "Not only are you able to suck the
      stain off the clothes, you're also able to ensure there's no
      deposition back onto the clothes," said Westwater.<br>
      <br>
      When the beads are at the end of their life, saturated with dirt
      and stains, they can be collected and recycled into, for example,
      dashboards for cars. Eventually Westwater wants to design a
      closed-loop recycling system for his washing machines, where
      saturated beads can be refreshed and re-used in Xeros machines.<br>
      <br>
      Westwater has already built a prototype washing machine and aims
      to have a product ready for the commercial laundry market by the
      end of next year, with a consumer version coming to market shortly
      afterwards. "There is more of a technical challenge [in
      development] as you compact the system. But it's not just about
      that - there's also consumer inertia. For millenia, people have
      been washing their clothes with water and a bit of detergent and
      suddenly we're coming along and saying that most of that water can
      be replaced by these beads. That's a big leap in the consumers'
      minds."<br>
      <br>
      Claire Cunningham, a spokesperson for the government-backed
      Technology Strategy Board, said Xeros had an "interesting and
      innovative product" and the environmental and financial savings
      were of particular interest when it was selected to take part,
      along with the 18 other British clean technology companies, in the
      Clean and Cool trade mission.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- The invention
      provides a method and formulation for cleaning a soiled substrate,
      the method comprising the treatment of the moistened substrate
      with a formulation comprising a multiplicity of polymeric
      particles, wherein the formulation is free of organic solvents.
      Preferably, the substrate is wetted so as to achieve a substrate
      to water ratio of between 1:0.1 to 1:5 w/w. Optionally, the
      formulation additionally comprises at least one cleaning material
      and, in this embodiment, it is preferred that the polymeric
      particles are coated with the at least one cleaning material.
      Preferably, the cleaning material comprises a surfactant, which
      most preferably has detergent properties. Most preferably, the
      substrate comprises a textile fibre. Typically, the polymeric
      particles comprise particles of nylon, most preferably in the form
      of nylon chips. The results obtained are very much in line with
      those observed when carrying out conventional dry cleaning
      processes and the method provides the significant advantage that
      the use of solvents, with all the attendant drawbacks in terms of
      cost and environmental considerations, can be avoided. <br>

        </b>
        <div align="left"><b>Field of the Invention</b><br>
          <br>
          [0001] The present invention relates to the aqueous cleaning
          of soiled substrates, specifically textile fibres and fabrics,
          using a cleaning system comprising polymeric particles. More
          specifically, the invention is concerned with a system wherein
          the polymeric particles include antimicrobial agents which
          prevent mould and bacterial growth on the particles which may
          occur after repeated uses in washing procedures.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Background to the Invention</b><br>
          <br>
          [0002] Aqueous cleaning processes are a mainstay of both
          domestic and industrial textile fabric washing. On the
          assumption that the desired level of cleaning is achieved, the
          efficacy of such processes is usually characterised by their
          levels of consumption of energy, water and detergent. In
          general, the lower the requirements with regard to these three
          components, the more efficient the washing process is deemed.
          The downstream effect of reduced water and detergent
          consumption is also significant, as this minimises the need
          for disposal of aqueous effluent, which is both extremely
          costly and detrimental to the environment.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] Such washing processes, whether in domestic washing
          machines or their industrial equivalents (usually referred to
          as washer extractors), involve aqueous submersion of fabrics
          followed by soil removal, aqueous soil suspension, and water
          rinsing. In general, the higher the level of energy (or
          temperature), water and detergent which is used, the better
          the cleaning. The key issue, however, concerns water
          consumption, as this sets the energy requirements (in order to
          heat the wash water), and the detergent dosage (to achieve the
          desired detergent concentration). In addition, the water usage
          level defines the mechanical action of the process on the
          fabric, which is another important performance parameter; this
          is the agitation of the cloth surface during washing, which
          plays a key role in releasing embedded soil. In aqueous
          processes, such mechanical action is provided by the water
          usage level, in combination with the drum design, for any
          particular washing machine. In general terms, it is found that
          the higher the water level in the drum, the better the
          mechanical action. Hence, there is a dichotomy created by the
          desire to improve overall process efficiency (i.e. the
          reduction of energy, water and detergent consumption), and the
          need for efficient mechanical action in the wash. For domestic
          washing in particular there are defined wash performance
          standards specifically designed to discourage the use of such
          higher levels in practice, in addition to the obvious cost
          penalties which are associated with such usage.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] Current efficient domestic washing machines have made
          significant strides towards minimising their consumptions of
          energy, water and detergent. EU Directive 92/75/CEE sets a
          standard which defines washing machine energy consumption in
          kWh/cycle (cotton setting at 60[deg.]C), such that an
          efficient domestic washing machine will typically consume
          &lt;0.19 kWh/kg of washload in order to obtain an 'A' rating.
          If water consumption is also considered, then 'A' rated
          machines use &lt;9.7 litres/kg of washload.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] Detergent dosage is then driven by manufacturer
          recommendations but, again, in the domestic market, for a
          concentrated liquid formulation, a quantity of 35 ml (or 37 g)
          for a 4-6 kg washload in soft and medium hardness water,
          increasing to 52 ml (or 55 g) for a 6-8 kg washload (or in
          hard water or for very dirty items) is typical (see, for
          example, Unilever pack dosage instructions for
          Persil&lt;(R)&gt; Small &amp; Mighty). Hence, for a 4-6 kg
          washload in soft/medium water hardness, this equates to a
          detergent dosage of 7.4-9.2 g/kg whilst, for a 6-8 kg washload
          (or in hard water or for very dirty items), the range is 6.9-
          9.2 g/kg.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] Energy, water and detergent consumptions in the
          industrial washing process (washer-extractors) are
          considerably different, however, and usages of all three
          resources are less constrained, since these are the principal
          factors in reducing cycle time - which is, of course, more of
          a consideration than in the case of domestic use. For a
          typical industrial washer extractor (25 kg washload rated and
          above), energy consumption is 0.30- 1 .0 kWh/kg, water is at
          20-30 litres/kg, and detergent is much more heavily dosed than
          for domestic washing. The exact level of detergent used will
          depend on the amount of soiling, but a range of 20-100 g/kg is
          representative.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] Thus, it can be taken from the above discussion that it
          is the performance levels in the domestic sector which set the
          highest standard for an efficient fabric washing process, and
          that these are: an energy consumption of &lt;0.19 kWh/kg, a
          water usage of &lt;9.7 litres/kg, and a detergent dosage of
          approximately 8.0 g/kg. However, as previously observed, it is
          becoming increasingly difficult to reduce the water (and,
          hence, energy and detergent) levels in a purely aqueous
          process, due to the minimum requirement to wet the fabric
          thoroughly, the need to provide sufficient excess water to
          suspend the soil removed in an aqueous liquor and, finally,
          the necessity to rinse the fabric.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] Heating of the wash water is then the principal use of
          energy, and a minimum level of detergent becomes necessary in
          order for an effective concentration to be reached at the
          operating wash temperature. Means to improve mechanical action
          without increasing the water level used would, therefore, make
          any aqueous wash process significantly more efficient (i.e.
          yield further reductions in energy, water and detergent
          consumption). It should be noted that mechanical action itself
          has a direct effect on the detergent level, since the greater
          the level of soil removal which is achieved through physical
          force, the less that is required of the detergent chemistry.
          However, increasing the mechanical action in a purely aqueous
          washing process has certain associated drawbacks. Fabric
          creasing readily occurs in such processes, and this acts to
          concentrate the stresses from mechanical action at each
          crease, resulting in localised fabric damage. Prevention of
          such fabric damage (i.e. fabric care) is of primary concern to
          the domestic consumer and the industrial user.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] In the light of these challenges which are associated
          with aqueous washing processes, the present inventors have
          previously devised a new approach to the problem, which allows
          the deficiencies demonstrated by the methods of the prior art
          to be overcome. The method which is provided eliminates the
          requirement for the use of large volumes of water, but is
          still capable of providing an efficient means of cleaning and
          stain removal, whilst also yielding economic and environmental
          benefits.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] Thus, in WO-A-2007/128962, there is disclosed a method
          and formulation for cleaning a soiled substrate, the method
          comprising the treatment of the moistened substrate with a
          formulation comprising a multiplicity of polymeric particles,
          wherein the formulation is free of organic solvents.
          Preferably, the substrate is wetted so as to achieve a
          substrate to water ratio of between 1 :0.1 to 1 :5 w/w, and
          optionally, the formulation additionally comprises at least
          one cleaning material, which typically comprises a surfactant,
          which most preferably has detergent properties. In preferred
          embodiments, the substrate comprises a textile fibre and the
          polymeric particles comprise, for example, particles of
          polyamides, polyesters, polyalkenes, polyurethanes or their
          copolymers but, most preferably, are in the form of nylon
          beads.<br>
          [0011] The use of this polymeric cleaning method, however,
          presents a requirement for the cleaning particles to be
          efficiently separated from the cleaned substrate at the
          conclusion of the cleaning operation, and this issue is
          addressed in WO-A-2010/094959, which provides a novel design
          of cleaning apparatus requiring the use of two internal drums
          capable of independent rotation, and which finds application
          in both industrial and domestic cleaning processes.<br>
          <br>
          [0012] In co-pending WO-A-201 1/064581 , there is provided a
          further apparatus which facilitates efficient separation of
          polymeric cleaning particles from the cleaned substrate at the
          conclusion of the cleaning operation, and which comprises a
          perforated drum and a removable outer drum skin which is
          adapted to prevent the ingress or egress of fluids and solid
          particulate matter from the interior of the drum, the cleaning
          method requiring attachment of the outer skin to the drum
          during a wash cycle, after which the skin is removed prior to
          operating a separation cycle to remove the cleaning particles,
          following which the cleaned substrate is removed from the
          drum.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] In a further development of the apparatus of WO-A-201
          1/064581 , there is disclosed in co-pending WO-A-201 1/098815
          a process and apparatus which provides for continuous
          circulation of the polymeric cleaning particles during the
          cleaning process, and thereby dispenses with the requirement
          for the provision of an outer skin.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] Further benefits in terms of reduced power and
          consumable requirements for the cleaning method originally
          proposed in WO-A-2007/128962 have been disclosed in copending
          GB Patent Application No. 1018318.4, where the technology has
          been refined to achieve at least equivalent cleaning
          performance whilst employing significantly reduced levels of
          detergents and much lower process temperatures.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] The apparatus and methods disclosed in the foregoing
          prior art documents have been highly successful in providing
          an efficient means of polymeric cleaning and stain removal
          which also yields significant economic and environmental
          benefits. The move to much lower wash temperatures has been
          particularly beneficial in this regard. As a consequence of
          the achievement of such lower temperatures, however, the need
          to control hygiene in the washing machine has become
          significantly more important. Hotter wash temperatures
          (&gt;60[deg.]C) can provide some level of hygiene control via
          thermal disinfection, since heat is an efficient destroyer of
          mould and bacteria, and higher temperatures are increasingly
          beneficial. When these polymeric cleaning processes are run at
          lower temperatures (&lt;40[deg.]C), however, hygiene
          considerations are magnified compared to the equivalent
          aqueous process, due to the presence of the polymeric
          particles. Said particles provide a large additional surface
          area contained within the washing machine, on which mould and
          bacteria can grow. The growth here can be accelerated by the
          fact that the particles remain moist for a considerable time
          after each wash process has been run, and the overall levels
          of mould and bacteria reached can be further increased if the
          machine remains unused for extended periods of time.<br>
          <br>
          [0016] The hygiene problem in the polymeric cleaning machine
          can, of course, be controlled by similar means to that used in
          conventional aqueous domestic or industrial washing, namely
          the use of higher wash temperatures as noted above, and/or
          chemical additives in the wash water used. Suitable additives
          include chlorine derived bleaches (e.g. sodium hypochlorite)
          or oxygen derived bleaches (e.g. hydrogen peroxide), but the
          use of these materials has drawbacks in that they can decolour
          some garment types, and generally promote fabric damage
          through chemical attack. The oxygen derived bleaches also
          become less effective at lower wash temperatures
          (&lt;40[deg.]C), even when used in combination with suitable
          activators, e.g tetraacetyl ethylene diamine. Other additives
          based on chloro compounds (e.g. liquid chlorophenols) can also
          be used, but with similar drawbacks. Possibly the most benign
          means of achieving antimicrobial performance in the wash water
          is via the addition of silver-containing materials (e.g.
          silver-containing zeolite materials). Such approaches are
          expensive to consider, however, as they are effectively
          applicable for single wash use only. Furthermore, as in all
          cases with chemical additives in the wash water, there are
          effluent treatment considerations to take into account.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] In looking to further develop the method of the
          cleaning process from WO-A- 2007/128962 and co-pending GB
          Patent Application No. 1018318.4, therefore, the present
          inventors have now sought to provide a process which allows
          the aforementioned hygiene deficiencies with polymeric
          cleaning to be overcome, particularly at low wash temperatures
          (&lt;40[deg.]C). Hence, in the presently claimed invention,
          the inventors, by means of the addition of an antimicrobial
          agent to the polymeric particles, seek to provide a process in
          which lower levels of mould and bacterial growth occur within
          the washing machine at all times. The introduction of the
          antimicrobial agent in this way overcomes the drawbacks which
          would be associated with single use addition into the wash
          water (i.e. fabric damage, expense and effluent treatment
          considerations), and the action of the antimicrobial agent is
          continuous over the lifetime of the polymeric particles, which
          are reused many times in subsequent washes, as is common
          practice with this technology.<br>
          Statements of Invention<br>
          <br>
          [0018] Thus, according to a first aspect of the present
          invention, there is provided a method for aqueous cleaning of
          soiled substrates, said method comprising the treatment of the
          moistened substrate with a formulation comprising a
          multiplicity of polymeric particles, wherein said polymeric
          particles comprise at least one antimicrobial agent.<br>
          <br>
          [0019] Said substrate may comprise any of a wide range of
          substrates, including, for example, plastics materials,
          leather, paper, cardboard, metal, glass or wood. In practice,
          however, said substrate most preferably comprises a textile
          fibre or fabric, which may comprise either a natural material,
          such as cotton, or a synthetic textile material, for example
          nylon 6,6 or a polyester.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] Said antimicrobial agent inhibits the growth of
          microbes such as mould and bacteria, and may comprise any
          readily commercially available product which is suitable for
          such purposes, and which would be well known to the skilled
          person. Particularly suitable agents include solid
          chlorophenol derivatives, such as 5-chloro-2-(2,4-
          dichlorophenoxy)phenol, which is commercially available as
          Triclosan or Microban&lt;(R)&gt;, or its derivatives, and
          silver-containing materials, most particularly
          silver-containing zeolite materials, including products from
          the Bio-Gate&lt;(TM)&gt; Irgaguard&lt;(R)&gt; or
          HyGate&lt;(TM)&gt; ranges including, for example,
          Bio-Gate&lt;(TM)&gt; BG-Tec Plus, Irgaguard&lt;(R)&gt; B 5000,
          Irgaguard&lt;(R)&gt; B 7000, HyGate&lt;(TM)&gt; 4000 and
          HyGate&lt;(TM)&gt; 9000.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] Said polymeric particles may comprise any of a wide
          range of different polymers. Specifically, there may be
          mentioned polyalkenes such as polyethylene and polypropylene,
          polyesters and polyurethanes. Preferably, however, said
          polymeric particles comprise polyester or polyamide particles,
          most particularly particles of polyethylene terephthalate,
          polybutylene terephthalate, nylon 6, and nylon 6,6, most
          preferably in the form of beads. Said polyesters and
          polyamides are found to be particularly effective for aqueous
          stain/soil removal, whilst polyalkenes are especially useful
          for the removal of oil-based stains. Optionally, copolymers of
          the above polymeric materials may be employed for the purposes
          of the invention.<br>
          <br>
          [0022] Specifically, the properties of the polymeric materials
          may be tailored to particular requirements by the inclusion of
          monomeric units which confer desired properties on the
          copolymer. Thus, the polymers may be adapted to attract
          particular staining materials by comprising co-monomers which,
          inter alia, are ionically charged, or include polar moieties
          or unsaturated organic groups. Examples of such groups may
          include, for example, acid or amino groups, or salts thereof,
          or pendant alkenyl groups.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] Furthermore, the polymeric particles may comprise
          either foamed or unfoamed polymeric materials. Additionally,
          the polymeric particles may comprise polymers which are either
          linear or crosslinked, and said particles may be solid or
          hollow.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] Said antimicrobial agent is most conveniently
          introduced into said polymer particles during extrusion of
          said polymer. Thus, the antimicrobial agent is especially
          preferably added to the molten polymer prior to extrusion. In
          an alternative embodiment, said polymer particles may be
          coated with said antimicrobial agent after extrusion.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] Preferably, said antimicrobial agent is added to said
          polymer at a level of 0.1 - 5.0%, (w/w), most preferably
          0.5-2.5% (w/w), especially preferably 1 .5-2.0% (w/w).<br>
          <br>
          [0026] Whilst, in one embodiment, the method of the invention
          envisages the cleaning of a soiled substrate by the treatment
          of a moistened substrate with a formulation which essentially
          consists only of a multiplicity of polymeric particles which
          comprise at least one antimicrobial agent, in the absence of
          any further additives, optionally in other embodiments the
          formulation employed may further comprise at least one
          additional cleaning agent. Preferably, the at least one
          additional cleaning agent comprises at least one surfactant.
          Preferred surfactants comprise surfactants having detergent
          properties and said additional cleaning agents preferably
          comprise detergent formulations. Said surfactants may comprise
          anionic, non-ionic, cationic, ampholytic, zwitterionic and/or
          semi- polar non-ionic surfactants. Optionally, said at least
          one additional cleaning agent comprises at least one enzyme
          and/or bleach. Preferably, said at least one additional
          cleaning agent is mixed with said polymeric particles but, in
          an alternative embodiment, each of said polymeric particles is
          coated with said at least one additional cleaning agent.
          Further additives may be incorporated with said additional
          cleaning agent, as appropriate; said additives may include,
          for example, anti-redeposition additives, optical brighteners,
          perfumes, softeners and starch, which can enhance the
          appearance and other properties of the cleaned substrate.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] As previously stated, various polyester and/or
          polyamide homo- or co-polymers may be used for the polymeric
          particles, including polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene
          terephthalate, nylon 6 and nylon 6,6. Preferably, the nylon
          comprises nylon 6,6 homopolymer having a molecular weight in
          the region of from 5000 to 30000 Daltons, preferably from
          10000 to 20000 Daltons, most preferably from 15000 to 16000
          Daltons. The polyester will typically have a molecular weight
          corresponding to an intrinsic viscosity measurement in the
          range of from 0.3-1.5 dl/g as measured by a solution technique
          such as ASTM D-4603.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] The ratio of polymeric particles to substrate is
          generally in the range of from 0.1 :1 to 10:1 w/w, preferably
          in the region of from 0.5:1 to 5:1 w/w, with particularly
          favourable results being achieved with a ratio of between 1 :1
          and 3:1 w/w, and especially at around 2:1 w/w. Thus, for
          example, for the cleaning of 5 g of substrate, typically
          textile fabric, 10 g of polymeric particles, optionally coated
          with surfactant, would be employed in one embodiment of the
          invention. The ratio of polymeric particles to substrate is
          maintained at a substantially constant level throughout the
          wash cycle.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] The polymeric particles are of such a shape and size as
          to allow for good flowability and intimate contact with the
          soiled substrate, which typically comprises a textile fibre or
          fabric. A variety of shapes of particles can be used, such as
          cylindrical, spherical or cuboid; appropriate cross-sectional
          shapes can be employed including, for example, annular ring,
          dog-bone and circular. In preferred embodiments of the
          invention, said particles are in the form of beads and, most
          preferably, comprise cylindrical or spherical beads.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] The particles may have smooth or irregular surface
          structures and can be of solid or hollow construction.
          Particles are of such a size as to have an average mass of 1
          -50 mg, preferably from 10-30 mg, more preferably from 12-25
          mg. [0031] In the case of cylindrical beads, the preferred
          particle diameter is in the region of from 1.0 to 6.0 mm, more
          preferably from 1.5 to 4.0 mm, most preferably from 2.0 to 3.0
          mm, and the length of the beads is preferably in the range
          from 1.0 to 5.0 mm, more preferably from 1 .5 to 3.5 mm, and
          is most preferably in the region of 2.0 to 3.0 mm.<br>
          <br>
          [0032] Typically, for spherical beads, the preferred diameter
          of the sphere is in the region of from 1 .0 to 6.0 mm, more
          preferably from 2.0 to 4.5 mm, most preferably from 2.5 to 3.5
          mm.<br>
          <br>
          [0033] The method of the invention may be applied to a wide
          variety of substrates, as previously stated. More
          specifically, it is applicable across the range of natural and
          synthetic textile fibres and fabrics, but it finds particular
          application in respect of nylon 6,6, polyester and cotton
          fabrics.<br>
          <br>
          [0034] Prior to treatment according to the method of the
          invention, the substrate is moistened by wetting with water,
          to provide additional lubrication to the cleaning system and
          thereby improve the transport properties within the system.
          Thus, more efficient transfer of the at least one cleaning
          material to the substrate is facilitated, and removal of
          soiling and stains from the substrate occurs more readily.
          Most conveniently, the substrate may be wetted simply by
          contact with mains or tap water. Preferably, the wetting
          treatment is carried out so as to achieve a substrate to water
          ratio of between 1 :0.1 to 1 :5 w/w; more preferably, the
          ratio is between 1 :0.2 and 1 :2, with particularly favourable
          results having been achieved at ratios such as 1 :0.2, 1 :1 ,
          1 :1 .2 and 1 :2. However, in some circumstances, successful
          results can be achieved with substrate to water ratios of up
          to 1 :50, although such ratios are not preferred in view of
          the significant amounts of effluent which are generated.<br>
          <br>
          [0035] Suitable examples of apparatus for the execution of
          this method are disclosed in WO-A-2010/094959, WO-A-201
          1/064581 and WO-A-201 1/098815. In preferred embodiments of
          the invention, the claimed method additionally provides for
          separation and recovery of the polymeric particles, which are
          then re-used in subsequent washes.<br>
          <br>
          [0036] As a consequence of employing the cleaning method of
          the present invention, excellent cleaning performance may be
          achieved whilst using significantly reduced levels of
          detergents and much lower process temperatures. Thus, cleaning
          operations according to the invention, whilst possible at
          temperatures up to 95[deg.]C, are typically carried out at
          temperatures not exceeding 65[deg.]C, and optimum performance
          is generally achieved at 5- 35[deg.]C. It is at this lower end
          of the operational temperature range that the antimicrobial
          polymeric particles ensure improved hygiene in the washing
          machine used. <br>
          <br>
          [0037] According to a second aspect of the present invention,
          there is provided a formulation for aqueous cleaning of soiled
          substrates, said formulation comprising a multiplicity of
          polymeric particles, wherein said polymeric particles comprise
          at least one antimicrobial agent.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] Said substrate may comprise any of a wide range of
          substrates, including, for example, plastics materials,
          leather, paper, cardboard, metal, glass or wood. In practice,
          however, said substrate most preferably comprises a textile
          fibre or fabric, which may comprise either a natural material,
          such as cotton, or a synthetic textile material, for example
          nylon 6,6 or a polyester.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] In one embodiment, said formulation may essentially
          consist only of said multiplicity of polymeric particles which
          comprise at least one antimicrobial agent, but optionally in
          other embodiments said formulation further comprises at least
          one additional cleaning agent. Preferably, the at least one
          additional cleaning agent comprises at least one surfactant.
          Preferred surfactants comprise surfactants having detergent
          properties and said additional cleaning agents preferably
          comprise detergent formulations. Said surfactants may comprise
          anionic, non-ionic, cationic, ampholytic, zwitterionic, and/or
          semi-polar non-ionic surfactants. Optionally, said at least
          one additional cleaning agent also comprises at least one
          enzyme and/or bleach.<br>
          <br>
          [0040] Said formulation is preferably used in accordance with
          the method of the first aspect of the invention, and is as
          defined in respect thereof. Additional additives may be
          incorporated in said formulation, as appropriate; said
          additives may include, for example, anti-redeposition
          additives, optical brighteners, perfumes, softeners and starch
          which can enhance the appearance and other properties of the
          cleaned substrate.<br>
          <br>
          [0041] The formulation and the method of the present invention
          may be used for either small or large scale processes of both
          the batchwise and continuous variety and, therefore, find
          application in both domestic and industrial cleaning
          processes. Excellent performance can also result from the use
          of fluidised beds, and this is particularly the case when the
          method of the invention is used for carrying out wet cleaning
          processes.<br>

          [0042] Embodiments of the invention are further described
          hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in
          which:<br>

          <br>
          <b>Detailed Description of the Invention</b><br>
          <br>
          [0043] As previously noted, the antimicrobial agent is most
          conveniently introduced into the polymer particles during
          extrusion of said polymer and is then added in a suitable
          amount to the molten polymer prior to extrusion. Particularly
          suitable agents include solid chlorophenol derivatives, such
          as 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol, which is
          commercially available as Triclosan or Microban&lt;(R)&gt;, or
          its derivatives, and silver-containing materials, including
          products from the Bio-Gate&lt;(TM)&gt;, Irgaguard&lt;(R)&gt;
          or HyGate&lt;(TM)&gt; ranges including, for example,
          Bio-Gate&lt;(TM)&gt; BG-Tec Plus, Irgaguard&lt;(R)&gt; B 5000,
          Irgaguard&lt;(R)&gt; B 7000, HyGate&lt;(TM)&gt; 4000 and
          HyGate&lt;(TM)&gt; 9000. Preferably, said antimicrobial agent
          is added to said polymer at a level of 0.1 -5.0%, (w/w), most
          preferably 0.5-2.5% (w/w), especially preferably 1.5-2.0%
          (w/w).<br>
          <br>
          [0044] In alternative embodiments, the polymer particles may
          be coated with the antimicrobial agent after extrusion in
          which case the particles are suitably placed in a container
          with an appropriate amount of the antimicrobial agent, and the
          preferably sealed container is agitated for, typically, 15-30
          minutes at temperatures at or just above ambient temperature.
          The coated particles are then removed from the container and
          are ready for use in cleaning processes.<br>
          <br>
          [0045] In a typical operation of a cleaning cycle according to
          the method of the invention, soiled garments are first placed
          into a rotatably mounted cylindrical cage of a cleaning
          apparatus according to the method described in WO-A-201
          1/098815. Such an apparatus is illustrated in Figures 1 (a)
          and 1 (b), wherein there is seen an apparatus comprising
          housing means (1 ) having a first upper chamber having mounted
          therein a rotatably mounted cylindrical cage in the form of
          drum (2) (perforations not shown) and a second lower chamber
          comprising sump (3) located beneath said cylindrical cage. The
          apparatus additionally comprises, as first recirculation
          means, bead and water riser pipe (4) which feeds into
          separating means comprising a bead separation vessel (5),
          including filter material, typically in the form of a wire
          mesh, and a bead release gate valve which feeds into feeder
          means comprising bead delivery tube (6) mounted in cage entry
          (7). The first recirculation means is driven by pumping means
          comprising bead pump (8). Additional recirculation means
          comprises return water pipe (9), which allows water to return
          from the bead separation vessel (5) to the sump (3) under the
          influence of gravity. The apparatus also comprises access
          means shown as loading door (10), though which material for
          cleaning may be loaded into drum (2). The main motor (20) of
          the apparatus, responsible for driving the drum (2), is also
          depicted.<br>
          <br>
          [0046] Following loading of the soiled garments into said
          apparatus, the polymeric particles and the necessary amount of
          water, together with any required additional cleaning agent,
          are added to said rotatably mounted cylindrical cage (2).
          Optionally, said materials are introduced via the first
          recirculation means (4) into the cylindrical cage (2), which
          is located in a first chamber of said apparatus.
          Alternatively, said polymeric particles may, for example, be
          pre-mixed with water and added via the separating means (5)
          located adjacent said cylindrical cage (2).<br>
          <br>
          [0047] During the course of agitation by rotation of the cage
          (2), the fluids and a quantity of the polymeric particles exit
          through perforations in the cage (2) and into the second
          chamber (3) of the apparatus. Thereafter, the polymeric
          particles may be recirculated via the first recirculation
          means (4) such that they are transferred to the separating
          means (5), from which they are returned, in a manner
          controlled by control means, to the cylindrical cage (2) for
          continuation of the washing operation. This process of
          continuous circulation of the polymeric particles continues
          throughout the washing operation until cleaning is completed.<br>
          <br>
          [0048] Thus, the polymeric particles which exit through the
          perforations in the walls of said rotatably mounted
          cylindrical cage (2) and into said second chamber (3) are
          recirculated and reintroduced through said separation means
          (5) and, by operation of control means, through the feeder
          means (6), back into said cage (2), thereby to continue the
          cleaning operation.<br>
          <br>
          [0049] Typically, a wash cycle according the method of the
          present invention comprises the steps of:<br>
          <br>
          (a) introducing polymeric particles, additional cleaning agent
          and water into a second chamber of a cleaning apparatus of the
          type described in WO-A- 201 1/098815;<br>
          <br>
          (b) agitating said polymeric particles, additional cleaning
          agent and water;<br>
          <br>
          (c) loading at least one soiled substrate into the rotatably
          mounted cylindrical cage of said apparatus via access means;<br>
          <br>
          (d) closing the access means so as to provide a substantially
          sealed system;<br>
          <br>
          (e) introducing said polymeric particles, additional cleaning
          agent and water into said rotatably mounted cylindrical cage;<br>
          <br>
          (f) operating the apparatus for a wash cycle, wherein said
          rotatably mounted cylindrical cage is caused to rotate and
          wherein fluids and polymeric particles are caused to fall
          through perforations in said rotatably mounted cylindrical
          cage into said second chamber in a controlled manner; (g)
          operating pumping means so as to transfer fresh polymeric
          particles and recycle used polymeric particles to separating
          means;<br>
          <br>
          (h) operating control means so as to add said fresh and
          recycled polymeric particles to said rotatably mounted
          cylindrical cage in a controlled manner; and<br>
          <br>
          (i) continuing with steps (f), (g) and (h) as required to
          effect cleaning of the soiled garments.<br>
          <br>
          [0050] Optionally, said polymeric particles, additional
          cleaning agent and water may be introduced into said rotatably
          mounted cylindrical cage via recirculating means. More
          preferably, however, said polymeric particles, additional
          cleaning agent and water are introduced into said rotatably
          mounted cylindrical cage via dosing means such as, for
          example, a fixedly mounted nozzle. Most conveniently, said
          nozzle may be fixedly mounted on said access means.<br>
          <br>
          [0051] Additional cleaning agents are advantageously employed
          in said method, as further discussed below. Said additional
          cleaning agents may be added to the second chamber of said
          apparatus with said polymeric particles and introduced, via
          the first recirculation means, into the cylindrical cage.
          Alternatively, an additional cleaning agent is pre-mixed with
          water and added to said cylindrical cage via the separating
          means during step (e). More preferably, however, said
          additional cleaning agents are added to said cylindrical cage
          via said dosing means. The method of the invention facilitates
          the use of reduced quantities of said additional cleaning
          agents.<br>
          <br>
          [0052] In preferred embodiments of the invention, said
          additional cleaning agents may be added to said cylindrical
          cage in multiple dosing steps during the cleaning operation,
          rather than in a single dosing step.<br>
          [0053] Preferably, pumping of said fresh and recycled
          polymeric particles proceeds at a rate sufficient to maintain
          approximately the same level of particles in said rotatably
          mounted cylindrical cage throughout the cleaning operation,
          and to ensure that the ratio of particles to soiled garments
          stays substantially constant until the wash cycle has been
          completed.<br>
          <br>
          [0054] On completion of the wash cycle, feeding of polymeric
          particles into the rotatably mounted cylindrical cage ceases
          and the speed of rotation of the cage is gradually increased
          in order to effect a measure of drying of the cleaned
          substrate. Some polymeric particles are removed at this stage.
          Typically, the cage is rotated at a rotation speed of between
          100 and 800 rpm in order to achieve drying; for a 98 cm
          diameter cage, a suitable speed of rotation would be around
          300 rpm. Subsequently, rotation speed is reduced and returned
          to the speed of the wash cycle, so as to allow for final
          removal of the polymeric particles. After separation, the
          polymeric particles are recovered in order to allow for reuse
          in subsequent washes.<br>
          <br>
          [0055] Optionally, following initial drying at high rpm, said
          method may additionally comprise a rinsing operation, wherein
          additional water may be added to said rotatably mounted
          cylindrical cage in order to effect complete removal of any
          additional cleaning agent employed in the cleaning operation.
          Water may be added to said cylindrical cage via said
          separating means, by said dosing means, or by overfilling the
          second chamber of said apparatus with water such that it
          enters the first chamber and thereby enters into said
          rotatably mounted cylindrical cage. Following rotation at the
          same speed as during the wash cycle, water is removed from
          said cage by allowing the water level to fall, as appropriate,
          and again increasing the speed of rotation to, typically,
          100-800 rpm in order to achieve a measure of drying of the
          substrate; a speed of rotation of around 300 rpm would, once
          again, be appropriate for a 98 cm diameter cage. Said rinsing
          and drying cycles may be repeated as often as desired.<br>
          <br>
          [0056] Optionally, said rinse cycle may be used for the
          purposes of substrate treatment, involving the addition of
          treatment agents such as anti-redeposition additives, optical
          brighteners, perfumes, softeners and starch to the rinse
          water.<br>
          <br>
          [0057] Said polymeric particles are preferably subjected to a
          cleaning operation in said second chamber by sluicing said
          chamber with clean water in the presence or absence of a
          cleaning agent, which may be selected from at least one of
          surfactants, enzymes and bleaches. Alternatively, cleaning of
          the polymeric particles may be achieved as a separate stage in
          said rotatably mounted cylindrical cage. After cleaning, the
          polymeric particles are recovered such that they are available
          for use in subsequent washes.<br>
          <br>
          [0058] Generally, any remaining polymeric particles on said
          garments may be easily removed by shaking the garments. If
          necessary, however, further remaining polymeric particles may
          be removed by suction means, preferably comprising a vacuum
          wand.<br>
          <br>
          [0059] The method of the invention is principally applied to
          the cleaning of substrates comprising textile fibres and
          fabrics, and has been shown to be particularly successful in
          achieving efficient cleaning of textile fabrics which may, for
          example, comprise either natural materials, such as cotton, or
          man-made and synthetic textile materials, for example nylon
          6,6, polyester, cellulose acetate, or fibre blends thereof.<br>
          <br>
          [0060] The volume of wash water added to the system is
          calculated so as to achieve a fabric to wash water ratio which
          is preferably between 1 :0.1 and 1 :5 w/w; more preferably,
          the ratio is between 1 :0.2 and 1 :2, with particularly
          favourable results having been achieved at ratios such as 1
          :0.2, 1 :1 , 1 :1.2 and 1 :2. Most conveniently, the required
          amount of water is introduced into the rotatably mounted
          cylindrical cage of the apparatus after loading of the soiled
          substrate into said cage. An additional amount of water will
          migrate into the cage during the circulation of the polymeric
          particles, but the amount of water carry over is minimised by
          the action of the separating means.<br>
          <br>
          [0061] As previously stated, preferred embodiments of the
          method of the invention envisage the cleaning of soiled
          textile fibres or fabrics by treatment of the moistened fibres
          or fabrics with a formulation which include a multiplicity of
          polymeric particles and further comprise at least one
          additional cleaning agent. Said at least one additional
          cleaning agent preferably comprises at least one detergent
          composition.<br>
          <br>
          [0062] The principal components of the detergent composition
          comprise cleaning components and post-treatment components.
          Typically, the cleaning components comprise surfactants,
          enzymes and bleach, whilst the post-treatment components
          include, for example, anti-redeposition additives, optical
          brighteners, perfumes, softeners and starch.<br>
          <br>
          [0063] However, the detergent composition may optionally
          include one or more other additives such as, for example
          builders, chelating agents, dye transfer inhibiting agents,
          dispersants, enzyme stabilizers, catalytic materials, bleach
          activators, polymeric dispersing agents, clay soil removal
          agents, suds suppressors, dyes, structure elasticizing agents,
          fabric softeners, starches, carriers, hydrotropes, processing
          aids and/or pigments.<br>
          <br>
          [0064] Examples of suitable surfactants may be selected from
          non-ionic and/or anionic and/or cationic surfactants and/or
          ampholytic and/or zwitterionic and/or semi-polar nonionic
          surfactants. The surfactant may be present at a level of from
          about 0.1 % to about 99.9% by weight of the cleaning
          composition, but is usually present from about 1 % to about
          80%, more typically from about 5% to about 35%, or from about
          5% to 30% by weight of the cleaning compositions.<br>
          <br>
          [0065] The detergent composition may include one or more
          detergent enzymes which provide cleaning performance and/or
          fabric care benefits. Examples of suitable enzymes include,
          but are not limited to, hemicellulases, peroxidases,
          proteases, other cellulases, other xylanases, lipases,
          phospholipases, esterases, cutinases, pectinases, keratanases,
          reductases, oxidases, phenoloxidases, lipoxygenases,
          ligninases, pullulanases, tannases, pentosanases, malanases,
          [beta]-glucanases, arabinosidases, hyaluronidase,
          chondroitinase, laccase, and amylases, or mixtures thereof. A
          typical combination may comprise a mixture of enzymes such as
          protease, lipase, cutinase and/or cellulase in conjunction
          with amylase. [0066] Optionally, enzyme stabilisers may also
          be included amongst the cleaning components. In this regard,
          enzymes for use in detergents may be stabilised by various
          techniques, for example by the incorporation of water-soluble
          sources of calcium and/or magnesium ions in the compositions.<br>
          <br>
          [0067] The detergent composition may include one or more
          bleach compounds and associated activators. Examples of such
          bleach compounds include, but are not limited to, peroxygen
          compounds, including hydrogen peroxide, inorganic peroxy
          salts, such as perborate, percarbonate, perphosphate,
          persilicate, and monopersulphate salts (e.g. sodium perborate
          tetrahydrate and sodium percarbonate), and organic peroxy
          acids such as peracetic acid, monoperoxyphthalic acid,
          diperoxydodecanedioic acid, [Nu],[Nu]'-
          terephthaloyl-di(6-aminoperoxycaproic acid),
          [Nu],[Nu]'-phthaloylaminoperoxycaproic acid and
          amidoperoxyacid. Bleach activators include, but are not
          limited to, carboxylic acid esters such as
          tetraacetylethylenediamine and sodium nonanoyloxybenzene
          sulfonate.<br>
          <br>
          [0068] Suitable builders may be included in the formulations
          and these include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal,
          ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates, alkali
          metal silicates, alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates,
          aluminosilicates, polycarboxylate compounds, ether
          hydroxypolycarboxylat.es, copolymers of maleic anhydride with
          ethylene or vinyl methyl ether, 1
          ,3,5-trihydroxybenzene-2,4,6-trisulphonic acid, and
          carboxymethyl-oxysuccinic acid, various alkali metal, ammonium
          and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as
          ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, as
          well as polycarboxylates such as mellitic acid, succinic acid,
          oxydisuccinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1
          ,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and
          soluble salts thereof.<br>
          <br>
          [0069] The detergent composition may also optionally contain
          one or more copper, iron and/or manganese chelating agents
          and/or one or more dye transfer inhibiting agents. Suitable
          polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents include, but are not
          limited to, polyvinylpyrrolidone polymers, polyamine N-oxide
          polymers, copolymers of N- vinylpyrrolidone and
          N-vinylimidazole, polyvinyloxazolidones and
          polyvinylimidazoles or mixtures thereof.<br>
          <br>
          [0070] Optionally, the detergent formulation can also contain
          dispersants. Suitable water-soluble organic materials are the
          homo- or co-polymeric acids or their salts, in which the
          polycarboxylic acid may comprise at least two carboxyl
          radicals separated from each other by not more than two carbon
          atoms.<br>
          <br>
          [0071] Suitable anti-redeposition additives are
          physico-chemical in their action and include, for example,
          materials such as polyethylene glycol, polyacrylates and
          carboxy methyl cellulose. <br>
          <br>
          [0072] Optionally, the detergent composition may also contain
          perfumes. Suitable perfumes are generally multi-component
          organic chemical formulations, a suitable example of which is
          Amour Japonais supplied by Symrise&lt;(R)&gt; AG.<br>
          <br>
          [0073] Appropriate optical brighteners fall into several
          organic chemical classes, of which the most popular are
          stilbene derivatives, whilst other suitable classes include
          benzoxazoles, benzimidazoles, 1 ,3-diphenyl-2-pyrazolines,
          coumarins, 1 ,3,5-triazin-2-yls and naphthalimides. Examples
          of such compounds include, but are not limited to, 4,4'-
          bis[[6-anilino-4(methylamino)-1
          ,3,5-triazin-2-yl]amino]stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, 4,4'-
          bis[[6-anilino-4-[(2-hydroxyethyl)methylamino]-1
          ,3,5-triazin-2-yl]amino]stilbene-2,2'- disulphonic acid,
          disodium salt,
          4,4'-Bis[[2-anilino-4-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-1 ,3,5-
          triazin-6-yl]amino]stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, disodium
          salt, 4,4'-bis[(4,6-dianilino-1 ,3,5-
          triazin-2-yl)amino]stilbene-2,2 -disulphonic acid, disodium
          salt, 7-diethylamino-4- methylcoumarin,
          4,4'-Bis[(2-anilino-4-morpholino-1
          ,3,5-triazin-6-yl)amino]-2,2'- stilbenedisulfonic acid,
          disodium salt, and 2,5-bis(benzoxazol-2-yl)thiophene.<br>
          <br>
          [0074] Said agents may be used either alone or in any desired
          combination and may be added to the cleaning system at
          appropriate stages during the cleaning cycle in order to
          maximise their effects.<br>
          <br>
          [0075] The method of the present invention may be used for
          either small or large scale batchwise or continuous processes
          and finds application in both domestic and industrial cleaning
          processes.<br>
          <br>
          [0076] As previously noted, the method of the invention finds
          particular application in the cleaning of textile fibres and
          fabrics. The conditions employed in such a cleaning system do,
          however, allow the use of significantly reduced temperatures
          from those which typically apply to the conventional wet
          cleaning of textile fibres and fabrics and, as a consequence,
          offer significant environmental and economic benefits. Thus,
          typical procedures and conditions for the wash cycle require
          that fibres and fabrics are generally treated according to the
          method of the invention at, for example, temperatures of
          between 5 and 35[deg.]C for a duration of between 5 and 45
          minutes, optimally in a substantially sealed system.
          Thereafter, additional time is required for the completion of
          the rinsing and bead separation stages of the overall process,
          so that the total duration of the entire cycle is typically in
          the region of 1 hour.<br>
          <br>
          [0077] It is at these lower wash temperatures that the
          efficacy of the presently claimed invention is greatest. The
          inventors have sought, by addition of an antimicrobial agent
          to the polymeric particles used, to provide a process in which
          lower levels of mould and bacterial growth occur in the
          washing machine at all times. The introduction of the
          antimicrobial agent in this way, overcomes the drawbacks
          associated with single use addition into the wash water (i.e.
          fabric damage, expense and effluent treatment considerations),
          and its action is continuous over the lifetime of the
          polymeric particles, as said particles are re-used many times
          in subsequent washes, as is common practice with this
          technology.<br>
          <br>
          [0078] The invention will now be further illustrated, though
          without in any way limiting the scope thereof, by reference to
          the following examples and associated illustrations.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example</b><br>
          <br>
          [0079] Approximately 80 kg of nylon 6,6 beads were supplied by
          Rhodia Operations, Aubervilliers, France - grade 24FE3. This
          material was divided into individual samples of approximately
          20 kg, each of which was then dried for 3[1/2] hours at
          80[deg.]C in a desiccator. The polymer beads and the
          appropriate amounts of a silver zeolite antimicrobial agent
          (Bio Gate&lt;(TM)&gt; BG-Tec Plus) when used, were intimately
          mixed by shaking them together in a sealed container, prior to
          extrusion using a Rondol 21 mm diameter twin screw extruder at
          Smithers-RAPRA, Shawbury, UK. The four samples of polymer
          beads produced contained 0% (as a control, comparative
          example), and 1 .0, 1 .5 and 2.0% w/w levels of the Bio
          Gate&lt;(TM)&gt; BG-Tec Plus respectively. The twin screw
          extruder was operated with a screw speed of 400 rpm, and with
          8 sequential temperature settings down the barrel, namely:
          zone 1 @ 240[deg.]C, zone 2 @ 250[deg.]C, zone 3 @ 260[deg.]C,
          zone 4 @ 265[deg.]C, zone 5 @ 265[deg.]C, zone 6 @ 265[deg.]C,
          and zone 7 @ 265[deg.]C. The die plate (zone 8) was also
          maintained at 265[deg.]C. The extruded lace was then passed
          through a water bath to cool and form a continuous solid
          strand, before being cut to form polymer beads of approximate
          dimensions 4.0 x 1 .7 x 1.7 mm.<br>
          <br>
          [0080] In order to test the antimicrobial efficiency of these
          beads, 25 g aliquots of each bead sample were inoculated with
          6 ml of either pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) at approximately
          3.1 x 10&lt;3&gt; cfu/ml (colony forming units/millilitre), or
          aspergillus brasiliensis (ab) at approximately 1.4 x
          10&lt;3&gt; cfu/ml. The inoculated beads were then stored at
          (31 +-1 )[deg.]C for the duration of the study, and at various
          time points (t), samples of the beads representing 1 ml of the
          inoculum (i.e. 5.17 g of beads/inoculum mixture) were removed
          to 9 ml of diluent and shaken vigorously. The resulting
          suspensions were tested using a standard plate count method.
          Incubation was for 5 days at (31 +-1 )[deg.]C for the pa based
          suspensions in tryptone soya agar growth medium, and for 5
          days at (24+-1 )[deg.]C for the ab based suspensions in
          sabouraud dextrose agar growth medium. The results are shown
          in Table 1 . Bead Sample Count (cfu/ml) Count (cfu/ml) Count

          [0081] As can be seen from Table 1 , there is a pronounced
          antimicrobial effect from the 24FE3 beads extruded with the
          2.0% w/w BG-Tec Plus antimicrobial agent. This has resulted in
          suppression of mould and bacterial growth in repeated use
          washing with these antimicrobial beads in apparatus as
          described in WO-A-201 1/098815.<br>
