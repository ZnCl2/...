        <b>William Jacques' "Coal Battery"</b> was claimed to operate
        with 82% efficiency; his critics, however, showed that he
        neglected to consider the thermal energy of the furnace and the
        power consumed by the air pump. As a result, the actual
        efficiency was only 8%. Furthermore, subsequent research
        concluded that the apparatus produced power by thermolectric
        action, not by electrochemistry. Jacques specifically speculated
        in his patent that "The phenomenon of electrolytic action causes
        the conversion of the potential energy of the carbon into
        electrical energy instead of heat, as is the case when oxygen
        combines with the carbon without the intervention of an
        electrolyte. It is desirable in order to facilitate the chemical
        action, and consequently obtain a more considerable current of
        electricity, to thoroughly impregnate the electrolyte with
        oxygen, and this may be done by admitting the air..." In the
        article published in Harper's, the battery action was explained
        thus:: "That the electric current was due to the chemical
        combination of the oxygen of the air with the coke (carbon),
        there could be no doubt. Quantitative tests showed that oxygen
        was taken from the air; that carbon was consumed; that carbonic
        acid was formed. Moreover, the electromotive force obtained
        agreed almost exactly with that which is theoretically obtained
        from the combustion of oxygen with carbon to form carbonic acid
        (1.04 volts). That the phenomenon was not due to thermoelectric
        action was proved by the fact that when the whole apparatus was
        so enclosed that all the parts were kept at uniform temperature
        the maximum, the maximum electromotive force and current were
        obtained. Again. Later experiments with far larger apparatus
        have not only confirmed these results, but have shown that under
        proper conditions the electrical energy thus obtained is
        substantially equal to the potential energy of the weight of
        carbon consumed within the pot..."</blockquote>

        (Date unknown; circa 1896)
        <center><b><font size="+1">"Electricity Direct from Coal"</font></b></center>
        A lump of cannel is burning on the grate. What takes place? The
        air is drawn in beneath the grate and rises through the bars.
        Its oxygen combines with the coal to produce carbonic acid gas,
        which, together with the inert nitrogen of the air and the smoke
        or unconsumed carbon, rises in the chimney and escapes. This is
        the role played by the <i>materials</i>. How about the <i>forces</i>?
        The chemical union of oxygen with the coal sets free the coal’s
        stored-up energy, and this energy, being indestructible, must
        manifest itself in some way, and so shows itself as <i>heat</i>.
        This is the whole story of combustion.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>Sitting before an open fire I have often dreamed of
        converting the stored-up energy of the coal into some form of
        energy even more useful to man than heat. We know that,
        theoretically at least, all of nature’s forces are
        inter-convertible; why should not the potential energy of coal
        be converted directly into electricity instead of heat? Could
        all of the energy be extracted from a single pound of coal and
        made to do mechanical work, this work would more than equal a
        day’s labor of a very strong man. In the great coal-fields that
        are distributed over the surface of the earth, nature has stored
        up a supply of energy safely estimated to equal the hand labor
        of the entire population of the world continued for a thousand
        years.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>The most convenient and useful, and therefore the most
        tractable, form of energy is electricity. In the facility with
        which we may at will and without waste convert it into such
        other forms of energy as happens to be desired lies the
        superiority of electricity over all the rest of nature’s forces.
        Having electricity, we may easily produce heat or light, or
        mechanical motion, or chemical force; but electricity itself has
        hitherto been produced in quantity only by the use of
        complicated mechanism and with great waste.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>Electricity today is generated by a dynamo that is
        turned by an engine which is operates by steam, and the steam is
        made from water by means of heat derived from the combustion of
        coal. But this is a long and circuitous process, with a large
        leakage at every step. Much of the energy of combustion goes up
        the chimney as heat or smoke; much of the heat is lost in
        boiling the water to make steam; much of the expansive force of
        the steam is wasted as it escapes from the engine; much of the
        power of the engine is wasted as friction; and there is some
        loss in the dynamo itself. Recent tests, made by a committee of
        the National Electric Light Association, show that the average
        plant wastes 97.4 per cent and utilizes as electricity only 2.6
        per cent of the energy theoretically obtainable from the coal.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>The problem then was to convert the energy of coal
        more directly into electricity; to do away with the dynamo and
        the steam engine; possibly even to do away with heat itself.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>A multitude of experiments were made. In the earlier
        days my attempt was merely to do away with the dynamo and with
        steam, and convert heat into electricity. A fire of coke,
        burning on an insulated grate, gave some slight electrical
        manifestations, but they were not encouraging. Experiments with
        various novel forms of thermopile were tried, but a
        consideration of the theory of the subject soon made it evident
        that it was not even theoretically possible to convert more than
        a very small percentage of the energy of the coal into
        electricity in this way. The generation of electric currents by
        alternately heating and cooling the magnetic cores of wire coils
        gave no promise of efficient results. I tried nature’s plan of
        producing lightning -- the evaporation of water continual
        dissipation of vapor globules -- and though I succeeded in
        producing miniature thunderstorms, the quantity of electricity
        obtainable was not sufficient for any commercial use. Indeed, my
        researches have led me to doubt whether the total energy of a
        good brisk thunderstorm, dramatic as is its display, is equal to
        fire. For a minute fraction of a second the force of a stroke of
        lightning is terrific, but its duration is so brief that even if
        it could be harnessed, it would be capable of doing very little
        useful work. Many other plans, all of them intensely interesting
        from a purely scientific point of view, were tried; but from
        most of them no current was obtained that was economically
        capable of being put to any industrial use.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>Nature is a coy mistress, yet she likes to be wooed,
        and to the diligent suitor gives occasional tokens of
        encouragement; and it happened that one day I surprised her in
        secret, and discovered the way by which we may abandon even
        combustion and heat itself, and convert the stored-up energy of
        coal <i>directly</i> into electricity.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>It came to me almost as a revelation that if the
        oxygen of the air could be made to combine with the coal under
        such circumstances that the production of heat could be
        prevented, and at the same time a conducting path could be
        provided in which a current of electricity [<i>missing line in
          the text</i>] the coal for the oxygen would necessarily be
        converted into electricity and not into heat; for any given form
        of electricity will be converted into such other form as the
        surrounding conditions make most easy. Given the proper
        conditions, the potential energy of coal would rather convert
        itself into electricity than into heat.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>This led to experiments in which coal was submerged in
        a liquid so that the oxygen of the air would not come in direct
        contact with the coal and produce combustion. Further, such a
        liquid was chosen that when air was forced through it to the
        coal, the oxygen of the air would temporarily enter into
        chemical union with the liquid and then be crowded out by a
        further supply of oxygen and forced to combine with the coal. We
        may picture each successive atom of oxygen, on its way from the
        source of air supply through the liquid to the coal, as
        temporarily entering into chemical union with each of a row of
        atoms of the liquid, just as each successive man as he circles
        around in the "grand right and left" of dancing temporarily
        clasps hand with each of the ladies of the set. When one
        substance passes through another in this way it furnishes a path
        in which an electric current may flow, so that by causing the
        oxygen to combine with the carbon through he intervening liquid
        opportunity is furnished for an electric current to develop, and
        since combustion cannot take place, the chemical affinity of the
        coal for the oxygen is converted directly into electricity, and
        not into heat. Liquids which thus allow atoms of oxygen and a
        current of electricity to pass through them may be called
        "electrolytic carriers".</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>I have thus discovered what I believe to be a new fact
        or principle not hitherto known to natural science -- a
        principal which I hope may be as valuable to pure science as my
        invention promises to be valuable to the useful arts. Stated
        scientifically, my discovery is that if oxygen of the air be
        cause to combine with carbon, not directly as in combustion, but
        through an intervening electrolytic carrier, the stored up
        energy of the carbon may be converted directly into electrical
        energy, and not into heat.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>Crudely speaking, my invention consists in generating
        electricity by causing the oxygen of the air to combine with
        coal beneath the level of a suitable liquid.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>The invention is a process; it is not a machine. The
        process may be carried on with very simple apparatus. An early
        form of apparatus consisted of a platinum crucible of the size
        and shape of an after-dinner coffee cup, partially filled with
        common potash, that was kept liquid by suspending the crucible
        over a gas flame. Within the potash was suspended, by means of a
        platinum wire, a lump of ordinary coke of the size of a peanut.
        Into the molten potash a stream of air was blown by means of a
        platinum tube like a straw. The wire by which the carbon was
        suspended formed the negative pole, and a second wire attached
        to the crucible the positive pole, of the generator. Attaching
        these wires to a small electric motor, I found that when air was
        blown into the potash the motor started; when the current of air
        was interrupted, the motor stopped. From this minute apparatus a
        current of several amperes was obtained. The electromotive force
        was a little over one volt.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>That the electric current was due to the chemical
        combination of the oxygen of the air with the coke (carbon),
        there could be no doubt. Quantitative tests showed that oxygen
        was taken from the air; that carbon was consumed; that carbonic
        acid was formed. Moreover, the electromotive force obtained
        agreed almost exactly with that which is theoretically obtained
        from the combustion of oxygen with carbon to form carbonic acid
        (1.04 volts). That the phenomenon was not due to thermoelectric
        action was proved by the fact that when the whole apparatus was
        so enclosed that all the parts were kept at uniform temperature
        the maximum, the maximum electromotive force and current were
        obtained. Again. Later experiments with far larger apparatus
        have not only confirmed these results, but have shown that under
        proper conditions the electrical energy thus obtained is
        substantially equal to the potential energy of the weight of
        carbon consumed within the pot.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>The invention had now been made. Electricity had been
        obtained directly from carbon. Would it work on a larger scale?
        Could the numerous practical difficulties be overcome? Platinum
        is more expensive even than gold, and hence some other metal
        must be used. Iron was tried, but the current obtained when the
        invention was practiced in an iron vessel was very small.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>Vessels of copper, lead, zinc, tin, aluminum, nickel,
        magnesium, were destroyed. Gold and silver gave good results,
        but inferior to platinum. Again and again the experiments were
        repeated. There seemed to be no reason in theory why iron should
        not work as well as platinum, and vessels were made from samples
        of iron of all kinds.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>Finally the reason was found. Most specimens of iron
        have an oily surface, which when heated, becomes converted into
        carbon, so that the iron tends to the action of the proper
        carbon itself. This led to a method of cleansing the surface of
        the iron; and when properly cleansed an iron pot is as good as
        one of platinum, and of course far cheaper.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>The pots were now made larger and larger, until today
        they are made as large as a barrel; and the current is measured
        in hundreds of amperes.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>Numerous other difficulties have had to be overcome.
        Coal, as it comes to us from the mines, is not a good conductor
        of electricity, and though an experimental apparatus was
        constructed in which it was found possible to consume ordinary
        coke shoveled onto a submerged grate, it has been found best to
        crush the coal and mould it into large sticks of convenient size
        to handle, and bake them to drive off the included gases and
        give them good electrical conductivity.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>The rapidity with which the carbon is consumed, and
        consequently the strength of the electric current yielded by a
        cell, is greatly increased by thoroughly impregnating all parts
        of the liquid with an excess of oxygen; and this is best done by
        terminating the air supply pipe in a rose nozzle something like
        that of a watering pot, so that the air is injected into the
        liquid in a large number of fine sprays.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>There are many kinds of liquid that may be used as
        electrolytic carriers, but unfortunately the most suitable
        become liquid only at elevated temperatures; so a certain amount
        of coal or other fuel has to be burned on a grate beneath the
        pots to maintain this temperature. As, however, there is no
        considerable consumption of heat, excepting as it is used in
        warming the incoming air or is lost by radiation, we may expect
        that in large apparatus, where a large number of pots are
        enclosed in a reasonably heat-tight oven, the consumption of
        coal on the grate will become comparatively very small. Even
        with a small two-horsepower apparatus, in which no very great
        precautions were taken to retain the heat, measurements showed
        that only one-third of a pound of coal per electrical horsepower
        hour was burned on a grate. A steam engine and dynamo of
        equivalent power would have consumed at least 40 times as much.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>Molten potash has many advantages as an electrolytic
        carrier, but it has the disadvantage of absorbing more or less
        of the carbonic acid given off by the carbon or contained in the
        air; so that if potash be used, although a part of the carbonic
        acid is swept away by the nitrogen, and more may be carried to
        the surface and liberated by adding to the potash suitable
        carriers of carbonic acid, sooner or later the potash becomes
        contaminated and has to be cleansed. By choosing electrolytic
        carriers that have no affinity for carbonic acid, the need of
        frequent cleansing is avoided since, fortunately, the
        consumption of the carbon is so much more complete than it is in
        ordinary combustion that with reasonably pure grades of coal
        only a small amount of easily removable ash is formed.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>The quantity of current that may be taken from a pot
        is about three-quarters of an ampere per square inch of carbon
        surface; so that a pot containing six sticks of carbon, each
        three inches in diameter and eighteen inches long, a size
        conveniently manufactured, handled and used, yields about 750
        amperes, or a little more than one electrical horsepower. The
        electromotive force of each pot, whether large or small, is a
        little more than one volt. When greater voltage is desired, the
        requisite number of pots are connected in series and heated in
        one common oven. The air is pumped in by means of an
        electrically driven air pump, operated by a small portion of the
        current generated.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>It would be premature to attempt to give any final
        data as to the efficiency of the new process when practiced on a
        large scale. Improvements are constantly being made. As compared
        with modern steam-engines, only relatively small carbon electric
        generators have as yet been built; and it should be remembered
        that with this generator, as with the steam engine, increased
        size means increased efficiency per pound of coal, particularly
        in the coal consumed on the grate. Following, however, are some
        results of a test (made by experts not connected with the
        development of the invention) upon a small and comparatively
        crude two horsepower carbon electric generator that has been in
        occasional use for some six months:</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>Average electrical HP developed: 2.16 HP <br>
        Average electrical HP used by air pump: 0.11 “ " <br>
        Average net electrical HP developed: 2.05 " <br>
        Carbon consumed in pots per electrical HP: 0.223 lb <br>
        Coal consumed on grate per electrical HP: 0.336 " <br>
        Total fuel consumed per electrical HP: 0.559 " <br>
        Electricity obtained from 1 lb of coal*: 1336 watt hours (32% of
        that <i>theoretically</i> obtainable) <br>
        (* 0.4 lb in pots &amp; 0.6 lb on grate)</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>Thus the efficiency of this particular generator was
        12 times greater than that of the average electric light and
        power plant in use in this country, and 40 times greater than
        plants of corresponding size.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>There are, however, many details still to be worked
        out, and many improvements yet to be made, before the carbon
        electric generator can be put into general commercial use on a
        scale comparable with that of modern steam engines. Contrary to
        some statements that I have read, I believe it will be some time
        yet before the dynamo is relegated to the attic with the
        spinning wheel, or the wheels of the steam engine cease to
        revolve.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>It is interesting to speculate as to what may be the
        outcome of this discovery when, in the fullness of time, all of
        these details shall have been worked out.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>&nbsp; <br>
          <i>To all whom it may concern</i>:</blockquote>
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote>Be it known that I, William W. Jacques, of Newton,
          in the State of Massachusetts, have invented a new and useful
          Method or Process of Converting the Potential Energy of Carbon
          or Carbonaceous Materials into Electrical Energy. Of which the
          following is a specification.</blockquote>
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote>It is well know that carbon and carbonaceous
          materials -- such as anthracite and bituminous coals, coke and
          gas-carbon -- have a chemical affinity for oxygen, and that
          when brought at a proper temperature in contact with oxygen,
          whether pure or diluted, as in the case of air, such carbons
          enter into chemical combination with the oxygen and the
          potential energy of the coal is converted into heat. This
          process is known as "combustion".</blockquote>
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote>I have discovered that if oxygen, whether pure or
          diluted, as in air, be caused to combine with carbon or
          carbonaceous materials, not directly, as in the case of
          combustion, but through an intervening electrolyte, the
          potential energy of the carbon may be converted directly into
          electrical energy instead of into heat.</blockquote>
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote>My invention is founded on this discovery; and it
          consists in the process of converting the potential energy of
          carbon or carbonaceous materials into electrical energy by
          chemically combining oxygen with said carbon or carbonaceous
          material through an intervening electrolyte.</blockquote>
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote>A convenient and practical way of carrying out my
          invention is to immerse a cylinder of carbon in molten sodium
          hydrate and force a current or blast of air into the molten
          sodium hydrate in such manner that the sodium hydrate becomes
          saturated with oxygen in excess over that which the sodium
          hydrate normally contains. A circuit being completed from the
          sodium hydrate, which is the electrolyte, by means of a
          collecting electrode not chemically acted upon by the
          electrolyte and an extraneous conductor to the carbon an
          electric current flows continuously from the sodium hydrate
          through the collecting electrode and the exterior conductor to
          the carbon, the strength of the current depending primarily on
          the rapidity with which the air is blown into the sodium
          hydrate, and the oxygen of the air caused to combine with the
          carbon.</blockquote>
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote>In this process the carbon is gradually converted
          into carbonic acid, which mostly bubbles up through the
          electrolyte and escapes. The resultant composition of the
          sodium hydroxide remains unchanged, excepting as hereinafter
          explained, and oxygen from the air is consumed. The nitrogen
          with which the oxygen of the air is diluted, having no
          chemical affinity for any other substance present, simply
          bubbles through the electrolyte and escapes. The sodium
          hydrate is contained in a vessel of pure iron, upon which it
          has no sensible chemical action when melted, and this iron
          vessel serves as the collecting electrode or positive pole of
          the generator, while the carbon forms the oxidizable electrode
          or negative pole.</blockquote>
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote>My conception of the function of the electrolyte is
          that it carries oxygen electrolytically from the air to the
          carbon, or that the phenomenon of electrolytic action causes
          the conversion of the potential energy of the carbon into
          electrical energy instead of heat, as is the case when oxygen
          combines with the carbon without the intervention of an
          electrolyte. It is desirable in order to facilitate the
          chemical action, and consequently obtain a more considerable
          current of electricity, to thoroughly impregnate the
          electrolyte with oxygen, and this may be done by admitting the
          air under pressure in a considerable number of fine sprays. It
          is also desirable to maintain a constant circulation to the
          electrolyte, so that new portions, freshly charged with
          oxygen, may successively be brought in contact with the
          carbon. Such circulation is well obtained by the ebullition
          into which the electrolyte is thrown by the admission of air
          under pressure. Again, it is desirable, in order to prevent
          the setting up of electromotive forces opposed to the proper
          electromotive force of the generator, to keep the whole body
          of the electrolyte and the contained carbons and containing
          vessel, used also as a collector, at a more or less uniform
          temperature throughout, and this is conveniently done by the
          ebullition of the electrolyte due to the air forced in. Again,
          the constant ebullition of the electrolyte removes from the
          surface of the consumed carbon such ash and other products of
          chemical action as may form upon it, thus leaving fresh
          surfaces exposed to the action of the electrolyte.</blockquote>

        <blockquote><b>Figure 1</b> shows a suitable apparatus for
          practicing my invention, making use of sodium hydrate as an
          electrolyte and air as a source of oxygen supply. <b>Figure 2</b>

        <blockquote>The apparatus being put together as shown and the
          electrolyte having been brought to the proper temperature, the
          pump <i>A</i> is operated and air is forced into the
          electrolyte, causing a violent ebullition, which ebullition
          supplies to the electrolyte an excess of oxygen, brings fresh
          portions of the electrolyte continually in contact with the
          carbon, detaches the carbonic acid and ash formed on the
          surface of the carbon, and keeps the whole interior of the
          generator at a uniform temperature.</blockquote>
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote>Although the greater part of the carbonic acid,
          whether resulting from the union of carbon and oxygen or
          already existing in the air supply, bubbles up through the
          electrolyte and escapes, a portion of this carbonic acid
          combines with a portion of the caustic soda to form carbonate
          of soda, and this, together with the ash from the carbon,
          slowly contaminates the electrolyte, and in the course of time
          lessens its efficiency. The efficiency of the generator may,
          however, be maintained by drawing off from time to time a
          portion of the contaminated electrolyte and admitting a fresh
          portion to take its place.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>The contamination of the caustic soda by its union
          with carbonic acid may be reduced, and its life consequently
          prolonged, by adding a small percentage of oxide of magnesium.
          My conception of the action of the oxide of magnesium is that
          the free carbonic acid combines with it in preference to the
          caustic soda, and that the carbonate of magnesium so formed is
          quickly decomposed into carbonic acid, which escapes, and
          oxide of magnesium which is again ready to repeat its action.
          Briefly, the oxide of magnesium serves as a carrier to convey
          the carbonic acid through the electrolyte.</blockquote>
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote>My invention is not limited to the particular
          electrolyte above mentioned, nor to the air as a source of
          oxygen supply, nor to the apparatus described above.</blockquote>
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote>There are many electrolytes that may be used in
          practicing my invention. Following are some of the desirable
          characteristics: They should become liquid t a convenient
          temperature. They should possess good electrolytic
          conductivity. They should be capable of readily taking up
          oxygen from the air or other source of supply, and also
          capable of readily giving up oxygen in combination with the
          carbon. They should not have a strong affinity for carbonic
          acid, and, in case air is used as a source of oxygen supply,
          should not have any considerable affinity for the nitrogen and
          other substances with which the oxygen of the air is diluted.
          The molten hydrates of potash and soda are especially suitable
          for practical use.</blockquote>
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote>Instead of using the air as a source of oxygen
          supply, it is evident that I may use oxygen artificially
          prepared by any of the well-known methods, and, as might
          naturally be supposed, the chemical action takes place more
          rapidly with pure oxygen than when the oxygen is diluted, as
          in air.</blockquote>
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote>The air or oxygen may be supplied to the electrolyte

          acted upon by the electrolyte, from which action, however, the
          current flow from the electrolyte to the collecting electrode
          tends to protect the latter. Platinum is almost universally
          applicable, though expensive. Pure iron is very generally
          applicable and inexpensive. Steel and iron containing any
          considerable quantity of carbon should be avoided, in that
          they may set up an inverse electromotive force, which
          materially reduces the efficiency of the generator.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>Forms of carbon that I have found convenient for use
          are gas-carbon, anthracite coal that has been baked as to give

          charcoal, and in fact any form of carbon or carbonaceous
          material which has or to which may be given sufficient
          conductivity to allow of the conduction of the electric

          of course be obtained by coupling any desired number of
