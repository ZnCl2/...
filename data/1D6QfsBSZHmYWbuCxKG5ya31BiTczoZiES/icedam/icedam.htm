      No plan to stop Fukushima from contaminating Pacific? Tepco
      adviser ‘doubts’ ice wall can stop groundwater from flooding plant
      — We’re concerned it may affect ‘environmental protection’ and
      cause ‘unintended consequences’ (VIDEO)<br>
      <br>
      Kyodo News, May 1, 2014: Int’l expert doubts ice wall will solve
      Japanese nuclear plant leaks — An international nuclear expert
      [Dale Klein, head of TEPCO supervisory panel] expressed skepticism
      Thursday over [the] plan to set up an ice wall to ultimately stop
      radioactive water from further increasing [...] Former British
      Atomic Energy Authority Chairwoman Barbara Judge [...] said there
      is a need to assess during summer whether the ice wall method
      would be effective. The remarks by the two overseas experts came
      at a time when concerns over the plan are being raised by Japan’s
      Nuclear Regulation Authority and engineering experts. Their
      opinions may cast a shadow on TEPCO’s plan to begin operating the
      ice wall by the end of next March.<br>
      <br>
      Dale Klein, head of TEPCO supervisory panel: “I’m not convinced
      that the freeze wall is the best option. What I’m concerned about
      is unintended consequences. Where does that water go and what are
      the consequences of that? I think they need more testing and more
      analysis [...] No one has built a freeze wall this long for this
      period of time. Typically, you build a freeze wall for a few
      months [...] The freeze wall is expensive [and they need to make
      the] best use of limited resources. [...] I would encourage them
      to get international advice a little bit more.”<br>
      <br>
      Bloomberg, May 1, 2014: A government-backed plan for a frozen
      underground wall to limit water contamination at the wrecked
      Fukushima atomic station needs further vetting for potential risks
      to the environment, an adviser to the plant’s operator said. The
      plan, which is intended to keep groundwater from seeping into the
      basements of the plant’s damaged reactor buildings, may not
      function as intended because it’s based on untested assumptions
      about the site’s hydrology, said Dale Klein, who chairs Tokyo
      Electric Power Co.’s Nuclear Reform Monitoring Committee. The wall
      is scheduled to be completed by the end of March 2015 and will
      remain in operation through 2020, Mayumi Yoshida, a Tepco
      spokeswoman, said by phone.<br>
      <br>
      Klein: “Are there any unintended consequences? We’re concerned
      about safety and environmental protection [...] if Tepco finds
      technical information that indicates the frozen wall is not the
      best, they need to communicate that to the government. I know the
      government has said that they will put in the frozen wall, but I
      hope that science will trump political policy.”<br>

          <br>
          A dam construction method utilizing refrigerating technology
          is provided, the method takes natural water as the material to
          construct the dam and constructs an ice dam body by utilizing
          the refrigerating technology. The method includes the
          following steps: choosing the forms and quantity of ice unit
          bodies, determining the positions and quantity of frozen
          contact points, manufacturing sufficient ice unit bodies by
          frozen units, choosing heat insulating material with high
          performance as the heat preservation layer to cover on the
          outside of the frozen ice unit bodies; temporarily fixing the
          ice unit bodies; quickly freezing the seams of the ice unit
          bodies to form a whole ice dam; mounting temporary generating
          equipment and completing the temporary dam body; thawing the
          ice dam body after a permanent dam body is completed.<br>
          <br>
          [0001] The present invention relates to a dam construction
          method, in particular to a dam construction method that
          utilizes natural water body as the dam material and utilizes
          freezing technique.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIO</b>N<br>
          <br>
          [0002] As the global energy situation becomes more and more
          severe, it is an extremely urgent task to take full advantage
          of hydropower resources. In hydropower resource utilization
          projects, dam construction is an especially important link.
          Owing to a variety of factors in dam construction, such as
          long construction period, high investment, long ROI period,
          complex construction, significant impact on navigation and
          environment and so on, the utilization of hydropower resources
          develops very slowly. A great deal of hydropower resources can
          not be utilized fully and timely. Consequently, the energy
          crisis becomes more and more serious, and our living
          environment is increasingly deteriorated.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] Presently, all dams are constructed with reinforced
          concrete. In view of the large size of dam, it is necessary to
          minimize the hydration heat and cost of concrete, namely, the
          amount of cement used should be minimized. Generally speaking,
          employing large-size aggregate can achieve that purpose.
          Therefore, usually the dam concrete is with degree 4 of
          gradation, in which the maximum size of aggregate can be up to
          15 cm. However, if the conventional concrete adopts aggregate
          in larger size, it is suitable for use due to the limitation
          of mixing and vibrating capability.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] Rock fill dam is a common dam type. At present, the
          common construction procedures of rolled rock fill dam are as
          follows: gather materials from the stock ground, transport the
          materials by truck directly onto the dam, and then roll the
          rock fill with a heavy vibrating roller to achieve the design
          compactness. Such construction procedures are simple and the
          dam construction cost is low. However, the size of rock fill
          dam is greater than the concrete dam; especially, rock fill
          dam usually has to be impervious, and therefore additional
          spillways must be arranged, which will result in significant
          increase of project cost. In addition, if clay core wall is
          used as the impervious body in rock fill dam, the construction
          will be easily interfered and will be sensitive to the
          climate, and the core wall may crack as a result of uneven
          subsidence. In recent years, reinforced concrete face rock
          fill dam has developed quickly, but there are still a lot of
          problems with regard to crack control of face.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] There are mainly two existing concrete dam construction
          methods: column construction method and roller compacted
          concrete construction method.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] The construction with typical column construction
          method is carried out by block placement, assisted with
          temperature control measures. That method has been widely
          applied in construction of concrete dams, such as the Three
          Gorges Concrete Gravity Dam in China. This method has obtained
          rich experience in assurance of concrete construction quality
          and concrete crack control, and presently the method is still
          the most commonly used method in concrete dam construction.
          However, with such a concrete construction method, a large
          quantity of formworks are required, and a variety of
          temperature control measures such as embedded cooling water
          pipes are required; in addition, the procedures are complex,
          the cost is high, and the construction speed is low.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] The roller compacted concrete construction method was
          put forward by Professor Raphael (USA) in 1970s. This method
          employs zero-slump concrete and vibration rolling technique,
          characterized by high construction speed, simplified
          temperature control measures and low cost. More and more dams
          are constructed with roller compacted concrete nowadays, such
          as Shimenzi Arch Dam and Shapai Arch Dam in China. However,
          the inter-layer bonding strength of roller compacted concrete
          is relatively poor; especially, as a result of high
          construction speed and simplified temperature control, in the
          late stage of dam construction and early stage of dam
          operation, the concrete temperature is still high, therefore
          the built-up part may crack and has to be repaired. The cracks
          caused by temperature load are mainly a result of high
          hydration heat in roller compacted concrete, though the cement
          content in roller compacted concrete is lower than that in
          common concrete. To reduce the risk of cracking, structural
          measures such as induced joints and structural joints are
          taken for arch dams constructed with roller compacted
          concrete; however, the construction complexity is increased.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0008] To overcome the drawbacks in conventional dam concrete
          construction methods, such as complex procedures, high cost,
          and low construction speed, etc., the present invention
          provides a dam construction method that utilizes natural water
          body as the dam material and utilizes freezing technique,
          which is based on freezing technique and utilizes natural
          water body as dam material. With this method, flow closure is
          completed quickly before the concrete dam is constructed, to
          form a temporary power generation works, which can be used as
          the permanent dam body or a temporary dam body, to provide
          enough energy and preferable construction conditions for
          constructing the permanent concrete dam. The method is
          characterized by short construction time, reduced investment,
          and environmental protection.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] The object of the present invention is achieved by the
          following technical scheme:<br>
          <br>
          [0010] A method of dam construction utilizing freezing
          technique, which utilizes natural water body as dam material
          and utilizes freezing technique to construct an ice dam body,
          comprising the following steps:<br>
          <br>
          [0011] 1) Choosing the forms, geometry size, shapes, and
          structural frameworks of unit body, determining the quantity
          of unit body, and arranging the locations and amount of
          freezing contacts, according to the dam structure;<br>
          <br>
          [0012] 2) Arranging unit body formwork according to the forms,
          geometry size, and shapes of the unit body, pre-reserving
          distribution sluice gates, and choosing a high-performance
          heat insulation material of insulation layer to cover the unit
          body formwork in the freezing part;<br>
          <br>
          [0013] 3) Pouring water into the unit body formwork to form
          unit water body, powering up and starting freezing machines to
          freeze the unit water body to below the freezing point to form
          solid ice unit body; repeating this step to produce enough ice
          unit body;<br>
          <br>
          [0014] 4) Towing the ice unit body with towing equipment to
          the place where the dam is to be constructed and fixing the
          ice unit body temporarily, arranging freezing contacts in the
          gaps between the ice unit bodies, and freezing quickly to form
          an integral ice dam;<br>
          <br>
          [0015] 5) Closing the distribution sluice gates from bottom to
          top successively, till all distribution sluice gates are
          closed; as the downstream level declines, installing and
          connecting sluice pipelines for temporary power generation
          from top to bottom, starting from the upper sluice gate, till
          the requirements for installation of temporary power
          generation equipment are met;<br>
          <br>
          [0016] 6) Installing temporary power generation equipment, and
          utilizing the temporary power generation equipment to supply
          power to the freezing machines, to prevent the solid ice unit
          body from melting down, and thereby form an ice dam;
          completing the construction of the temporary dam body;<br>
          <br>
          [0017] 7) Starting the construction of permanent concrete dam
          body; after the permanent dam body is placed, melting down the
          ice dam formed by the solid ice unit body, reclaiming the
          equipment, and completing the normal power generation works.<br>
          <br>
          [0018] In step 4) of the present invention, the distribution
          sluice gates on the ice unit bodies are in fully open state.
          Since the density of the ice unit body is lower than the
          density of water and cavities are formed in the ice unit body,
          the ice unit body will float on water, causing excessive
          clearance between the bottom surfaces of ice unit body and the
          riverbed. To solve this problem, for the ice unit body
          submerged below the water surface, weight-enhancing material
          must be added into the cavities, to force the ice unit body to
          settle onto the riverbed. The ice unit body kept on or above
          water surface can be placed directly.<br>
          <br>
          [0019] In view that a plurality sets of freezing contacts are
          arranged on the ice unit body and the ice dam is composed of a
          plurality of ice unit body, automatic monitoring and control
          systems are arranged at the freezing contacts and service
          passages are arranged for the freezing contacts on the ice
          unit body, in order to eliminate any possible failure of the
          freezing contacts timely.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] In the present invention, the ice unit body is wrapped
          with a high-performance heat insulation material of insulation
          layer, and the freezing machines keep the ice unit body in low
          temperature during the entire process; therefore, the ice unit
          body will not melt down and can maintain enough strength.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] In the present invention, the electric power
          consumption is calculated as follows:<br>
          <br>
          [0022] According to the specific-heat capacity formula:<br>
          <br>
          [0000]<br>

          <br>
          [0023] Take the Three Gorges Dam project for example (the
          efficiency factor is not taken into account):<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          [0024] Set the temperature drop [Delta]t=20[deg.] C.; then,
          the total power consumption is:<br>
          <br>
          [0000]<br>

          <br>
          [0025] The total electric power consumption is:<br>
          <br>
          [0000]<br>
          234.5*10&lt;13&gt;/3.6*10&lt;6&gt;=65.14*10&lt;7 &gt;kwh<br>
          <br>
          [0026] Calculated with 0.5 Yuan/kwh, the required electric
          power cost is:<br>
          <br>
          [0000]<br>
          65.14*10&lt;7 &gt;kwh*0.5 Yuan/kwh=RMB 325.7 millions Yuan<br>
          <br>
          [0027] In contrast, the total static investment of the Three
          Gorges Dam is as high as RMB 50 billions Yuan.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] The method provided in the present invention is based
          on freezing technique, and utilizes natural water body as dam
          material. With the method, flow closure can be accomplished
          quickly before the concrete dam is constructed, to form a
          temporary power generation works, which can be used as a
          permanent dam body or a temporary dam body to provide enough
          energy and preferable construction conditions for the
          subsequent construction of the permanent concrete dam, and
          thereby achieve the purpose of accelerating construction
          period, reducing investment, and protecting environment.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] The method provided in the present invention can
          minimize the period of the early stage of dam construction,
          and thereby minimize the entire construction period of
          project, to assure the hydropower works to yield returns as
          soon as possible. With this method, since power generation can
          be achieved in the construction period, the works can not only
          supply power for dam construction but also supply power to the
          electric network to yield returns. The method of dam
          construction with freezing technique described in the present
          invention thoroughly changes the conventional underwater
          construction approach, makes the dam size more reasonable,
          reduces material consumption, ensures construction quality,
          and saves investment greatly. Moreover, with the freezing
          technique for dam construction, the ice dam can be melt down
          immediately after the construction of the dam body is
          completed, leaving no wastes that may adversely affect the
          navigation course or pollute the water body in the riverbed.<br>

          <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0030] A method of dam construction utilizing freezing
          technique as described in the present invention, which
          utilizes natural water body as dam material and utilizes
          freezing technique to construct an ice dam body, comprising
          the following steps:<br>
          <br>
          [0031] 1) Choosing the forms, geometry size, shapes, and
          structural frameworks of unit body, determining the quantity
          of unit body, and arranging the locations and amount of
          freezing contacts, according to the dam structure;<br>
          <br>
          [0032] 2) Arranging unit body formwork according to the forms,
          geometry size, and shapes of the unit body, pre-reserving
          distribution sluice gates, and choosing a high-performance
          heat insulation material of insulation layer to cover the unit
          body formwork in the freezing part;<br>
          <br>
          [0033] 3) Pouring water into the unit body formwork to form
          unit water body, powering up and starting freezing machines to
          freeze the unit water body to below the freezing point to form
          solid ice unit body; repeating this step to produce enough ice
          unit body;<br>
          <br>
          [0034] 4) Towing the ice unit body with towing equipment to
          the place where the dam is to be constructed and fixing the
          ice unit body temporarily, arranging freezing contacts in the
          gaps between the ice unit bodies, and freezing quickly to form
          an integral ice dam;<br>
          <br>
          [0035] 5) Closing the distribution sluice gates from bottom to
          top successively, till all distribution sluice gates are
          closed; as the downstream level declines, installing and
          connecting sluice pipelines for temporary power generation
          from top to bottom, starting from the upper sluice gate, till
          the requirements for installation of temporary power
          generation equipment are met;<br>
          <br>
          [0036] 6) Installing temporary power generation equipment, and
          utilizing the temporary power generation equipment to supply
          power to the freezing machines, to prevent the solid ice unit
          body from melting down, and thereby form an ice dam;
          completing the construction of the temporary dam body;<br>
          <br>
          [0037] 7) Starting the construction of permanent concrete dam
          body; after the permanent dam body is placed, melting down the
          ice dam formed by the solid ice unit body, reclaiming the
          equipment, and completing the normal power generation works.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] In step 4) of the present invention, the distribution
          sluice gates on the ice unit bodies are in fully open state.
          Since the density of the ice unit body is lower than the
          density of water and cavities are formed in the ice unit body,
          the ice unit body will float on water, causing excessive
          clearance between the bottom surfaces of ice unit body and the
          riverbed. To solve this problem, for the ice unit body
          submerged below the water surface, weight-enhancing material
          must be added into the cavities, to force the ice unit body to
          settle onto the riverbed.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] The operations for implementing the present invention
          are as follows:<br>
          <br>
          [0040] First, select the dam site according to the design
          requirement, and determine the structural arrangement of the
          ice dam system (mainly including: dam body, navigation lock,
          and diversion channel, etc.) according to the requirements for
          the permanent dam body or temporary dam body.<br>
          <br>
          [0041] Determine the quantity of the unit body according to
          the structural requirements of the dam body, select the forms,
          geometry size, shapes, and structural framework of the unit
          body, and determine how to arrange the freezing contacts and
          determine the amount of the freezing contacts according to the
          technical requirement. Mount freezing heat exchanging
          apparatuses in cavity bushings with appropriate dimensions
          (length, diameter) according to the geometry size of the ice
          unit body, to form freezing contacts. Determine the spacing
          between the freezing contacts according to the freezing effect
          areas of the freezing contacts.<br>
          <br>
          [0042] In view that a plurality sets of freezing contacts are
          arranged on the ice unit body and the ice dam is composed of a
          plurality of ice unit bodies, reliable automatic monitoring
          and control systems should be arranged at the freezing
          contacts, in order to ensure normal operation of the freezing
          contacts.<br>
          <br>
          [0043] With consideration of requirements for energy
          conservation and cost reduction, the ice unit body should be
          designed into cavity structure as far as possible, and service
          passages for the freezing contacts should be considered, in
          order to eliminate any possible failure of the freezing
          contacts timely. The part on and above the water surface can
          be built with ice unit body with cavity structure directly.
          Due to the fact that the density of the ice unit body is lower
          than the water and cavities are formed in the ice unit body,
          the ice unit body will float on water, causing excessive
          clearance between the bottom surfaces of ice unit body and the
          riverbed. To solve this problem, appropriate weight-enhancing
          material can be added into the cavities, to ensure the ice
          unit body can reach the depth at a time; the weight-enhancing
          material can be water. The ice unit body are towed and fixed
          temporarily in the assembling process, to ensure assembling
          accuracy.<br>
          <br>
          [0044] Arrange unit body formwork and pre-reserve distribution
          sluice gates according to the forms, geometry size, shapes of
          the unit body. Select a high-performance heat insulation
          material of insulation layer to cover the framework of
          freezing part of the unity body, and keep the dam body at a
          constant temperature. The covering material is used as the
          material of unit body formwork before freezing. Large-size
          covering material can be assembled and spliced.<br>
          <br>
          [0045] Power on and start up the freezing machines to freeze
          the water unit body to below the freezing point, so as to form
          solid ice unit body. Repeat this step to produce enough ice
          unit body according to the requirement of the design. Towing
          points should be reserved on the ice unit body at appropriate
          positions according to the requirement of the design.<br>
          <br>
          [0046] Tow the ice unit body with towing equipment (towing
          boat or windlass) to the design locations and fix them
          temporarily. Arrange freezing contacts in the gaps between the
          ice unit bodies and freeze quickly, to form the integral ice
          dam. At this point, the distribution sluice gates on the ice
          unit bodies should be in fully open state.<br>
          <br>
          [0047] Close the distribution sluice gates from bottom to top
          successively, till all distribution sluice gates are closed;
          as the downstream water level declines, install and connect
          sluice pipelines for temporary power generation from top to
          bottom, starting from the upper sluice gate, till the
          requirements for installation of temporary power generation
          equipment are met;<br>
          <br>
          [0048] Select and install temporary power generation equipment
          in appropriate quantity and model; then, start power
          generation and switch to maintain the power supply for the ice
          dam.<br>
          <br>
          [0049] Construct the permanent dam body (concrete dam body).
          After the permanent dam body is placed, melt down the ice dam,
          reclaim the equipment, and start normal power generation. The
          reclaimed equipment can be reused.<br>
          <br>
          [0050] In the present invention, the construction of permanent
          dam body (concrete dam body) should be coordinated with the
          construction of the temporary ice dam, and the construction
          process of conventional hydropower dam works should match the
          construction requirements for freezing dam.<br>
          <br>
          [0051] During implementation of the present invention, the
          power supply from the electric network should be scheduled
          comprehensively, i.e., schedule how long the power supply from
          the electric network can freeze the ice unit body into ice
          dam, how much electric power is required to maintain the ice
          dam body in frozen state, what influences the temporary power
          generation has on the electric network when the dam body is at
          constant temperature, how to determine the model, requirement,
          quantity and installation procedures of the temporary power
          generation equipment, and how to switch with the electric
          network timely once temporary power generation is established.<br>
          <br>
          [0052] Before implementation of the present invention, basic
          experiments can be carried out to obtain relevant data, for
          example, quick freezing experiment of ice dam can be carried
          out, to determine the dam size, contact distribution, freezing
          method, freezing speed, water depth drop, water flow speed,
          water temperature, and relation between keeping constant
          temperature and power consumption, and relevant data.
          Experiments on coordination between construction of frozen dam
          body and construction of permanent dam body can be carried
          out; experiments on ice dam strength, structure form, water
          depth drop, water flow speed, and water temperature can be
          carried out to obtain relevant data; experiments on ice dam
          melting and component reclamation can be carried out, to
          obtain relevant data. The experimental data and phenomena can
          be summarized, to form several feasible construction schemes,
          and then the construction schemes can be optimized.<br>
          <br>
          [0053] Once the method provided in the present invention is
          applied widely, it will greatly drive the utilization progress
          of water power resources, and thereby significantly reduce
          predatory exploitation of other non-environment-friendly
          resources. Therefore, the method provided in the present
          invention has important and far-reaching strategic
          significance in environment protection and national strength
          building. The method provided in the present invention can
          also be applied widely in flood fighting, flow closure and
          strategic military engineering.<br>

          The present invention deals with insulated ice dams, with
          makeup cooling facilities, applicable to cool, short summer
          nordic countries; for river dams, for dams harnessing the sea
          tidal power etc., using: a) ice dams processed and frozen
          during the cold winter months, making use of the sub-zero
          atmospheric air temperature to freeze an isolated mass of
          water, section by section, leaving cooling agent
          conduits/tunnels, across the ice dam, accessible to man and to
          robots, b) a layer of ice/frozen wood pulp mixture known to
          have a higher melting temperature than the pure ice alone, to
          cover the exposed surface of the ice dam all around serving as
          a primary insulation skin covering the ice dam, c) an
          additional ice dome over the water level increasing the weight
          of the ice dam to counterbalance the uplifting forces acting
          on it, d) an insulation cover over the whole surface of the
          ice dam, e) cold water sprinkling system over the exposed
          insulation cover, when the atmospheric temperature rises over
          the melting point, causing the sprinkled water to evaporate
          and cool down the insulation cover, f) a cooling process of
          the ice dam during the summer season using, generally, the
          method of compressed and decompressed gases, to cool the gases
          to sub-zero temperature, to be circulated through the cooling
          agent conduits provided across the ice dam, to maintain the
          said ice dam in its frozen state, g) a heat exchanging process
          between the warm cooling gases in summer and the natural cold
          water accumulating behind the dam to lower the temperature of
          the cooling gases prior and during the compression and
          decompression operation, so transferring the cold water
          temperature to the cooling gases; air or other cooling agents,
          and in turn, to the ice dam to maintain the ice at sub-zero
          temperature during summer season, resulting in an ice dam
          using material (water) supplied and delivered on site by
          nature, frozen by nature in winter and partly maintained in
          its frozen state in summer by nature as well.<br>
