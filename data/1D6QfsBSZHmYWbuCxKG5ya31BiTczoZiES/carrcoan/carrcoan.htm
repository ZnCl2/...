          <b>Mustang Inventor's High-Speed Toy Takes Off</b> </p>
        <p>by <b>Gregory Potts</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>MUSTANG (OK) --- Inventor Robert Carr is concerned that parents
        will be afraid when they learn the truth about the Xstream
        Flyer, a new toy airplane his company is selling. </p>
      <p>It can fly at speeds up to 100 miles per hour. In fact, because
        of its unique aerodynamic design, the hand-held plane actually
        picks up speed once it starts soaring. </p>
      <p>"You expect to see this normal, slow-flying glider and this
        thing takes off like a rocket," he said. But the toy is made of
        such a soft, flexible plastic that it cannot hurt anyone, even
        at high speeds, he said. Although airplanes have long been a
        staple of the toy world, Carr insists that his invention is
        different. </p>
      <p>"It's totally different from any airplane you can find
        anywhere," he said. The plane's speed and long flight distances
        are made possible by a duct in the wings. In addition to its
        speed, propelled by nothing more than a flick of the wrist, the
        buoyant plane also can zoom underwater. In fact, the technology,
        for which he has already received two patents, is so advanced
        that Carr thinks it could be applied to real airplanes. Carr has
        applied for six more patents on the toy. </p>
      <p>Carr, a flight instructor for 26 years, plans to use toy
        profits to fund research for real-life uses for the Xstream.
        Carr founded IWA Toy Co. in Mustang to sell his product. In its
        first four weeks on the market, IWA Toy has sold 50,000 planes,
        which retail for $12.95. The toys got a huge boost when they
        were featured in <i>Discover</i> magazine. </p>
      <p>Locally, they are at Larry's IGA in Mustang and several
        7-Eleven stores. They are also available at the company's Web
        site at&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">http://www.iwatoyco.com</span>.
        Carr said the company could have sold more of the toys, which
        are made in China, if the first shipment had not been held up in
        Los Angeles by the dock workers' strike. The toys are sold out
        while the company awaits a new shipment. </p>
      <p>Carr is planning a major expansion in the toy's production and
        distribution. By March, he expects to be selling 400,000 gliders
        per month through 15,000 stores. Along with this growth, Carr
        said the young company is already looking for new offices. He
        hopes to stay in Mustang. The company employs eight full-time
        employees and "dozens" of consultants. The Xstream is only the
        beginning for IWA Toy Co., Carr said. The company's next toy
        launch will be a radio-controlled plane, possibly on the market
        as soon as July. </p>

              Works</font></b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">by Robert Carr</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The coanda directs the airflow downward from its trailing edge,
        turbocharging the internal wing and separating the airflow from
        the underside of the duct top. This arrangement of airfoils
        reduces drag, enhances lift and thrust output. </p>
      <p>The Xstream and related toy industry products are based on the
        Internal Wing Aircraft (IWA) technology, which is a design that
        generates extraordinary lift and thrust by the action of air
        moving through a shaped duct. The technology and multiple
        applications related to aerospace designs are covered under U.S.
        Patents 4,568,042 and 4,579,300 as well as current patent
        pending. </p>
      <p>The extraordinary lift and thrust characteristics of the IWA
        design are a result of the duct, the bottom of which serves as
        the internal wing, and the coanda, which is the leading surface
        that extends toward the nose on each side and looks like a wing.
      </p>
      <p>As the glider is moving through a flowing medium (air or
        water), or ascthat medium is being pushed through the system in
        powered versions, the air or water comes off the upper trailing
        edge of the coanda in a downward direction toward the internal
        wing. </p>
      <p>The downward direction of the air or water has two effects on
        the flow through the system. First, it separates the flow from
        the top of the duct. This separation is what inhibits the
        pressure under the top of the duct from decreasing. </p>
      <p>If the pressure under the top of the duct were allowed to
        decrease too much then the positive lift generated from the
        bottom of the duct, the internal wing, would be negated by the
        negative lift generated by the top of the duct. </p>
      <p>Second, the downward direction of the flow off the back of the
        coanda laminates this air or water to the flow that has come
        into the system and onto the internal wing from under the
        coanda. </p>
      <p>Therefore, the IWA design doubles the mass of the air or water
        that is flowing over and operating on the internal wing. The
        lift produced increases exponentially with the mass of the
        medium operating on the wing. Also, the lamination process
        combined with the confining effect of the sides of the duct
        squeezes the flow in much the same fashion as your thumb
        squeezes the flow of water when you place it over the end of a
        running garden hose. </p>
      <p>This squeezing action produces a venturi effect that results in
        an increase in velocity of the flow through the internal wing
        system. <br>
        Lift also increases exponentially with the velocity of the flow
        through the system. </p>
      <p>In addition, the increase in velocity produces thrust. We call
        this thrust-producing effect Dynamic Natural Propulsion. </p>
      <p>The venturi effect is the same phenomenon utilized by designers
        of jet engines. So, in essence the IWA system becomes its own
        engine. The bottom line is the mass of the flow operating on the
        wing is doubled and the velocity of the flow through the system
        is dramatically increased. All of this adds up to a design that,
        incredibly, creates its own lift and thrust. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>Lift for an aircraft is provided by forming a longitudinal
        lifting duct therethrough, said lifting duct having a
        substantially planar roof and a longitudinally cambered floor.
        When the aircraft is driven forwardly, a stream of air enters
        and passes through the lifting duct and the contouring of the
        floor of the lifting duct give rise to a pressure gradient in
        the air stream which result in a higher pressure on the roof of
        the lifting duct than on the floor thereof so that the pressure
        difference provides lift for the aircraft. </p>

      <p><b>Description ~</b> </p>
      <p>This application is a substitute application for my earlier
        related application Ser. No. 092,349, filed Nov. 8, 1979, now
        abandoned. </p>
      <p>The present invention relates generally to aircraft, and, more
        particularly, but not by way of limitation, to means for
        providing lift for aircraft. </p>
      <p>It is common knowledge that air pressure at a point on the
        surface of a moving object is a function of the velocity with
        which air streams over the surface at that point. Indeed, this
        principle is the basis for aircraft design; that is, it is
        common practice to shape the wings of an aircraft so that the
        velocity of air streaming over the top surface of each wing is
        greater than the velocity of air streaming over the bottom
        surface of the wing. This velocity differential, achieved by the
        contour of the wing, results in a pressure differential across
        the wing so that a net force, lift, is exerted on the wing to
        support the aircraft in flight. </p>
      <p>The present invention exploits this principle in a novel manner
        to similarly achieve lift for an aircraft. In particular, the
        present invention contemplates the establishment of a pressure
        gradient in air streaming through a duct formed through the
        fuselage of an aircraft to provide lift for the aircraft. The
        pressure gradient increases from the floor of the duct to the
        roof thereof so that a larger force is exerted on the roof of
        the duct than on the floor thereof and the lift on the aircraft
        is the difference in these two forces. To this end, the duct
        extends longitudinally through the fuselage so that, as the
        aircraft is driven forwardly through the air, air enters and
        streams through the duct. The pressure gradient is then achieved
        by forming portions of the fuselage defining the roof of the
        duct such that the roof is substantially planar from the forward
        end of the aircraft to the rear end thereof and by forming
        portions of the fuselage defining the floor of the duct such
        that the floor is cambered along the longitudinal extent
        thereof. This camber of the floor of the duct results in a
        higher air stream velocity near the floor of the duct than near
        the roof of the duct to establish the desired pressure gradient.
      </p>
      <p>The use of a duct through the fuselage of an aircraft, rather
        than a wing mounted externally of the fuselage, results in a
        number of benefits. A lifting duct will generally result in a
        more compact aircraft than can be constructed using external
        wings and the use of a duct offers flexibility in the design of
        aircraft to meet varying purposes. Since the shape of the
        exterior of an aircraft having a lifting duct can remain fixed
        while the profile of the duct is changed, such change can be
        used to vary the performance characteristics of the aircraft so
        that the aircraft designer is given a design variation
        capability that will generally not be available where external
        wings are used to lift the aircraft. That is, changes in
        performance can be accomplished by shaping structural members
        which provide the longitudinal camber of the floor and the
        effect of such shaping can be determined independently of other
        factors involved in the overall interaction of the aircraft with
        the air through which the aircraft will move. Moreover, since
        the floor of the duct is within the fuselage, an aircraft
        constructed in accordance with the present invention offers the
        capability of providing mechanisms for shaping the floor in
        flight without affecting the structural integrity of the
        aircraft as might be the case were shaping attempted in a wing
        extending in cantilever fashion from the fuselage. In addition,
        the formation of lifting surfaces within a duct permits a direct
        utilization for lifting purposes of air streams produced by
        engines and normally used to propel an aircraft so as to provide
        lift via the forward motion of the aircraft through the air.
        With lifting surfaces formed in a duct, such streams can be
        diverted into the duct to pass therethrough and provide lift so
        that the aircraft can be flown at lower speeds than would
        generally be the case for comparable aircraft having external
        wings. </p>
      <p>An object of the present invention is to provide an aircraft
        which utilizes air streaming through a duct to provide lift. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to enable
        compactness of aircraft design. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF FIGS. 1 THROUGH 3 </p>
      <p>Referring now to the drawings in general and to FIGS. 1, 2 and
        3 in particular, shown therein and designated by the general
        reference numeral 10 is one preferred embodiment of an aircraft
        constructed in accordance with the present invention. In
        general, the aircraft 10 comprises a fuselage 12 having: a
        forward end 14; a rear end 16; a first side 18; a second side
        20; a top 22; and a bottom 24; the terms top and bottom being
        used herein to denote generally uppermost and lowermost surfaces
        of the aircraft 10 at such times that the aircraft 10 is in
        level flight. The aircraft 10 further comprises: a vertical
        stabilizer 26 mounted on the top 22 of the fuselage 12 near the
        rear end 16 thereof and extending vertically therefrom at such
        times that the aircraft 10 is in level flight; a first engine 28
        mounted on the first side 18 of the fuselage 12 near the forward
        end 14 thereof; and a second engine 30 mounted on the second
        side 20 of the fuselage 12 near the forward end 14 thereof. For
        purposes of illustration, the engines 28 and 30 have been drawn
        as jet engines. However, the present invention is not limited to
        aircraft having such propulsive means; rather, any type of
        engine that produces a rearward air stream so as to provide
        thrust for the aircraft 10 can be used to propel the aircraft 10
        without departing from the scope and spirit of the present
        invention. The stabilizer 12 can have an integral, external
        rudder 32 as has been shown in the drawings and, when such is
        the case, conventional control mechanisms (not shown) are
        provided for pivoting the rudder 32 for guidance purposes. The
        aircraft 10 further comprises conventional landing gear (not
        shown). </p>
      <p>Lift for the aircraft 10 is provided by a lifting duct 34 which
        intersects the forward and rear ends, 14 and 16 respectively, of
        the fuselage 12 and extends longitudinally through the fuselage
        12 between the ends 14 and 16 thereof. As has been indicated in
        FIGS. 1 and 3, the duct 34 has a generally rectangular
        transverse cross-section and FIG. 2 has been provided to show
        the longitudinal cross-section of the duct 34. (The fuselage 12,
        including portions thereof defining the duct 34, is constructed
        using conventional air frame construction methods so that a
        detailed discussion of the construction of the air frame need
        not be given for purposes of the present disclosure.
        Accordingly, conventional framing members, such as spars,
        stringers and the like, have not been shown in the drawings in
        the interest ofclarity of description. Rather, where
        conventional framing methods would be employed in constructing
        portions of the aircraft 10, hatching has been used in drawings
        of cross-sections to indicate the use of such conventional
        methods.) As is indicated by a comparison of FIGS. 1 and 2, the
        duct 34 has a roof 36 which is substantially planar in form and
        which is oriented relative to the top 22 and bottom 24 of the
        fuselage 12 so as to be disposed substantially horizontally at
        such times that the aircraft 10 is in level flight. The floor 38
        of the duct 34, on the other hand, has a central portion 40
        which arches upwardly toward the roof 36 of the duct 34. That
        is, the floor 38 of the duct 34 is provided with a camber along
        the longitudinal extent thereof. This camber in the floor 38 of
        the duct 34 provides lift for the aircraft 10 as will be
        described below. </p>
      <p>The aircraft 10 is provided with a plurality of internal
        rudders disposed within the duct 34 near the rear end 16 of the
        fuselage 12 and one of these rudders, designated 42, is shown in
        FIG. 2. The remaining rudders, designated 44 and 46, have been
        shown in FIG. 3 to which attention is now directed. As shown in
        FIG. 3, each of the rudders 42-46 has a forward, rod-shaped
        portion 48 and the upper and lower ends of the portions 48
        extend into apertures (not shown) formed in the roof 36 and
        floor 38 of the lifting duct 34. As in the case of the external
        rudder 32, conventional control mechanisms are provided for
        pivoting the rudders 42-46 about the rod-shaped portions 48
        thereof. Fin portions 50 of the rudders 42-46 extend from the
        rod-shaped portions 48 thereof generally toward the rear end 16
        of the fuselage 12 for guidance of the aircraft as will be
        discussed below. </p>
      <p>As will be noted in FIG. 3, portions of the fuselage 12
        adjacent the rear end 16 thereof are constructed separately from
        remaining portions of the fuselage 12 which extend to the
        forward end 14 thereof. Specifically, portions of the fuselage
        12 which form the sides of the lifting duct 34 at the rear end
        16 of the fuselage 12 are formed into a vertically extending
        flap 52, at the first side 18 of the fuselage 12, and another
        vertically extending flap 54, at the second side 20 of the
        fuselage 12. The flaps 52, 54 are pivotally connected to
        remaining portions of the fuselage 12 at the leading edges 56,
        58 thereof via internal hinge members (not shown) and
        conventional control mechanisms are provided to pivot the flaps
        52, 54 on remaining portions of the fuselage 12. Specifically,
        the control mechanisms interconnect the flaps 52 and 54 with the
        rudders 42-46 so that, each time the rudders 42-46 are pivoted
        in the direction designated 60 in FIG. 3 for rudder 44, flap 52
        is pivoted laterally outwardly from the fuselage 12; that is, in
        the direction designated 62 in FIG. 3. Similarly, each time the
        rudders 42-46 are pivoted in the direction designated 64 in FIG.
        3 for rudder 44, the flap 54 is pivoted laterally outwardly from
        the fuselage 12; that is, in the direction designated 66 in FIG.
        3. Any conventional control mechanism can be used for
        concertedly pivoting the flaps 52, 54 and the rudders 42-46. For
        example, hydraulic actuating cylinders (not shown) connected to
        portions of the flaps 52, 54 near the leading edges 56, 58
        thereof and connected to the rod-shaped portions 48 of the
        rudders 42-46 and a suitable hydraulic valve circuit can be used
        for this purpose. </p>
      <p>Portions of the fuselage 12 forming the roof 36 of the lifting
        duct 34 at the rear end 16 of the fuselage 12 are formed into
        two transversely extending flaps 68, 70 and portions of the
        fuselage 12 forming the floor 38 of the lifting duct 34 are
        similarly formed into two transversely extending flaps 72, 74.
        The flaps 68-74 are pivotally connected to remaining portions of
        the fuselage 12 in the manner that the flaps 52, 54 are
        connected to such remaining portions of the fuselage 12 and a
        conventional control mechanism is provided for pivoting the
        flaps 68-74 for pitch and roll control of the aircraft 10. That
        is, the flaps 68-70 can be pivoted upwardly or downwardly as a
        unit to deflect air exiting the lifting duct 34 upwardly or
        downwardly so as to raise or lower the forward end 14 of the
        aircraft 10. Similarly, the flaps 68 and 70, near the first side
        18 of the fuselage 12, can be pivoted upwardly (or downwardly)
        while the flaps 70 and 74, near the second side 20 of the
        fuselage 12, can be pivoted downwardly (or upwardly) so that, as
        will be discussed below the flaps 68-74 form ailerons for the
        aircraft 10. </p>
      <p>OPERATION OF FIGS. 1, 2 AND 3 </p>
      <p>The aircraft 10 is operated in a manner similar to the
        operation of a conventional aircraft; that is, the engines 28,
        30 project streams of air rearwardly to provide thrust which
        propels the aircraft 10 forwardly and lift for the aircraft 10
        is provided by the motion of the aircraft 10 through the air.
        More particularly, as the aircraft 10 moves through the air, air
        will enter the lifting duct 34 at the forward end 14 of the
        fuselage 12 and stream therethrough so as to exit therefrom at
        the rear end 16 of the fuselage 12. As the air streams through
        the lifting duct 34, the contour of the cambered portion 40 of
        the floor 38 of the lifting duct 34 results in a higher stream
        velocity at the floor 38 of the lifting duct 34 than at the roof
        36 thereof so that the air streaming through the lifting duct 34
        exerts a higher pressure at the roof 36 than at the floor 38.
        Accordingly, a pressure gradient is established vertically
        across the lifting duct 34 and such pressure gradient results in
        a larger force being exerted on the roof 36 of the lifting duct
        34 than is exerted on the floor 38 thereof by air streaming
        through the lifting duct 34. This difference in the net forces
        exerted on the roof 36 and floor 38 of the lifting duct 34
        provide the requisite lift necessary to maintain the aircraft 10
        in flight. </p>
      <p>Should it be desired to turn the aircraft 10, the rudders 32
        and 42-46 and the flaps 68-74 provide the aircraft 10 with the
        capability of making a banked turn in the manner of a
        conventional aircraft. In particular, should it be desired to
        turn the aircraft to the left, air streaming through the lifting
        duct 34 generally along the first side 18 of the fuselage 12 is
        deflected upwardly as it exits the duct 34 by pivoting the flaps
        68 and 72 upwardly and air streaming through the duct 34
        generally along the second side 20 of the fuselage 12 is
        deflected downwardly by pivoting the flaps 70 and 74 downwardly.
        The deflection of air generally upwardly as it leaves the duct
        34 near the first side 18 of the fuselage 12 and the deflection
        of air downwardly as it leaves the duct 34 generally along the
        second side 20 of the fuselage 12 exerts a coupled about the
        longitudinal axis of the fuselage 12 in substantially the same
        manner that air deflected by the ailerons on the wings of a
        conventional aircraft give rise to a couple about the
        longitudinal axis of the fuselage of such conventional aircraft.
        The couple so provided about the longitudinal axis of the
        fuselage 12 lowers portions of the fuselage 12 adjacent the
        first side 18 thereof while raising portions of the fuselage 12
        adjacent the second side 20 thereof. The rudders 32 and 42-46
        are pivoted in the direction 60 shown in FIG. 3 to deflect air
        laterally of the first side 18 of the fuselage 12 of the
        aircraft 10 so as to pivot the forward portions of the aircraft
        10 toward the left as seen by occupants of the aircraft 10. The
        concurrent pivotation of the flap 52 in the direction 62 as the
        rudders 32, 42-46 are pivoted in the direction 60 prevents
        interference with the diversion of air streaming from the
        lifting duct 34 laterally outwardly of the first side 18 of the
        fuselage 12 so that the pivotation of the flap 52 enhances the
        turning capability of the aircraft 10 via the internal rudders
        42-46. A banking turn to the right can be made by pivoting the
        rudders 32, 42-46 and the flaps 68-74 in directions opposite to
        those utilized for making a turn to the left and the pivotation
        of the flap 54 in the direction 66 in such case has an effect
        similar to the effect of pivotation of the flap 52 at such times
        that a turn to the left is made. </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF FIG. 4 </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 4, shown therein and designated by the
        general reference numeral 10a is a schematic cross-section of a
        second embodiment of an aircraft constructed in accordance with
        the present invention. The aircraft 10a comprises a fuselage 12a
        having a lifting duct 34a and a stabilizer 16a similar to the
        stabilizer 16 of the aircraft 10. As in the aircraft 10,
        portions of the fuselage 12a near the rear end 16a thereof can
        be formed into flaps (not shown) which provide ailerons for the
        aircraft 10a and internal rudders (not shown) can be mounted in
        the lifting duct 34a as in the lifting duct 34 of the aircraft
        10. </p>
      <p>The aircraft 10a differs from the aircraft 10 in that the
        engines of the aircraft 10a can be utilized directly to provide
        lift for the aircraft 10a in addition to indirect utilization
        for such purpose wherein the engines drive the aircraft
        forwardly and the forward motion results in a stream of air
        passing through the lifting duct 34a. The direct lift capability
        is in part provided by forming a transverse duct 76 in portions
        of the channel 12a forming the floor 38a of the fuselage 12a so
        that the transverse duct 76 underlays the floor 38a of the
        lifting duct 34a near the forward end 14a of the fuselage 12a.
        The transverse duct 76 extends substantially the width of the
        lifting duct 34a and a slot 78, similarly extending
        substantially the width of the lifting duct 34a is formed in the
        floor 38a thereof to communicate the transverse duct 76 with the
        lifting duct 34a. The slot 78 is delimited by the arched portion
        40a of the floor 38a of the duct 34a and a rearwardly sweeping
        overhang 80 which is disposed generally forward of the arched
        portion 40a and extends over a nose 82 formed at the forward end
        of the arched portion 40a of the floor 38a of the duct 34a so
        that air forced into the transverse duct 76, as will be
        discussed below, is projected rearwardly over the arched portion
        40a of the floor 38a of the duct 34a by the slot 78 to provide
        lift for the aircraft 10a. </p>
      <p>In order to more clearly show the manner in which the direct
        lift capability is provided, FIG. 4 has been drawn in
        contemplation of a single engine aircraft and such engine, shown
        schematically in FIG. 4 and designated 28a therein, is
        positioned, by way of example, on the bottom 24a of the fuselage
        12a. (As will be clear from the description to follow, the
        aircraft 10a can be a multi-engine aircraft and the engines need
        not be positioned on the bottom of the aircraft for the
        provision of the direct lift capability.) The engine 28a is
        encased within a shroud 84 which underlays the transverse duct
        76 and the transverse duct has an opening 86 into the shroud 84.
        In normal flight, wherein the aircraft 10a is operated, a cover
        88 extends over the opening 86 so that an air stream is
        projected rearwardly by the engine 28a to produce thrust which
        propels the aircraft 10a. Such propulsion forces air through the
        lifting duct 34a to produce lift in the same manner that lift is
        produced in the aircraft 10. The cover 88 is pivotally attached,
        at the rear end 90 thereof, to the fuselage 12a and conventional
        positioning means; for example, a hydraulic actuating cylinder
        and suitable hydraulic circuitry, are provided for positioning
        the cover 88 over the opening 86 as has been shown in solid
        lines in FIG. 4 and, alternatively, for pivoting the cover 88
        into the shroud 84 to the position shown in phantom lines in
        FIG. 4 and designated therein by the numeral 92. Thus, the cover
        88 can be positioned so as to divert a portion of the air stream
        projected by the engine 28a into the transverse duct 76 so that
        such air stream is channeled by the slot 78 into a stream of air
        passing over the cambered portion 40a of the floor 38a of the
        duct 34a. (While the cover 88 has been drawn in FIG. 4 so that
        only a portion of the air stream projected by the engine 28a is
        diverted to the lifting duct 34a, it will be clear to those
        skilled in the art that the cover 88 and shroud 84 can be shaped
        to permit the diversion of the entirety of such air stream into
        the transverse duct 76 and, therefrom, into the lifting duct
        34a.) Thus, the aircraft 10a can be placed in a high speed
        flight configuration, by positioning the cover 88 to overlay the
        opening 86, wherein the aircraft 10a is operated in the same
        manner that the aircraft 10 is operated and, alternatively, the
        aircraft 10a can be placed in a low speed configuration, by
        pivoting the cover 88 to the position designated by the numeral
        92 in FIG. 4, wherein the air stream produced by the engine 28a
        is diverted from the shroud 84 into the transverse duct 76 and,
        therefrom, to the lifting duct 34a so that the engine 28a is
        used directly for providing lift for the aircraft 10a. The
        operation of the aircraft 10a in the high speed configuration
        thereof is substantially the same as the operation of the
        aircraft 10 and the provision of the low speed configuration
        permits a variation from the operation of the aircraft 10
        wherein the aircraft 10a is flown at a lower speed than might be
        possible with the aircraft 10. </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF FIGS. 5 AND 6 </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, shown therein is a schematic
        partial cross-section in side elevation of another embodiment of
        an aircraft, designated 10b in FIGS. 5 and 6, constructed in
        accordance with the present invention. Specifically, the portion
        of the aircraft 10b shown in FIGS. 5 and 6 includes the arched
        portion 40b of the floor 38b of the duct 34b. For purposes of
        example, it is contemplated that the aircraft 10b will be
        provided with a direct lift capability as in the aircraft 10a
        and portions of the fuselage (not numerically designated in
        FIGS. 5 and 6) which define the floor 38b and the transverse
        duct 76b have been indicated schematically in FIGS. 5 and 6.
        However, it will be clear from the discussion to follow that the
        aircraft 10b can be provided with only the indirect lift
        capability such as is the case with the aircraft 10. </p>
      <p>The aircraft 10b is provided with a variable lift capability in
        that means are provided to vary the longitudinal camber of the
        floor 38b; that is, to provide a varying degree of arching of
        the arched portion 40b of the floor 38b of the duct 34b. To this
        end, the fuselage of the aircraft 10b comprises a sheet of metal
        94 which forms the portion 40b of the floor 38b of the duct 34b.
        The sheet 94 is pivotally attached to remaining portions of the
        fuselage at the leading edge 96 thereof; that is, at the end
        thereof nearest the forward end of the fuselage of the aircraft
        10b. The sheet 94 extends toward the rear end of the fuselage of
        the aircraft 10b and terminates at a trailing edge designated 98
        in FIGS. 5 and 6. A plurality of guide rods 100 (one guide rod
        100 has been shown in the drawings) are attached to the fuselage
        of the aircraft 10b adjacent the underside 102 of the sheet 94
        and adjacent the trailing edge 98 thereof. The guide rods extend
        longitudinally of the fuselage of the aircraft 10b and a
        plurality of guide members 104 (only two guide members 104 are
        shown in the drawings) are mounted on the underside 102 of the
        sheet 94 so that two of the guide members 104 will slidingly
        engage each guide rod 100. Thus, the guide rods 100 and guide
        members 104 support the trailing edge 98 of the sheet 94 for
        longitudinal sliding movement in relation to remaining portions
        of the fuselage of aircraft 10b. (It will be noted that the
        guide rods 100 can be curved and portions thereof will, at
        times, extend through the sheet 94. Slots can be provided in the
        sheet 94 for this purpose. Such curvature is utilized to shape
        portions of the sheet 94 near the trailing edge 98 thereof as
        the camber of the floor 38b of the duct 34b is changed.) </p>
      <p>A plurality of stiffening members, including members 106 which
        have the form of metal slats and members 108 which have an
        L-shaped cross-section are attached to the underside 102 of the
        sheet 94 and extend transversely to the duct 34b across the
        underside 102 of the sheet 94. The stiffening members 106, 108
        provide the sheet 94 with sufficient rigidity to transmit lift
        produced thereby in conjunction with the roof (not shown) of the
        duct 34b to the fuselage of the aircraft 10b while,
        concurrently, permitting longitudinal flexure of the sheet 94.
        Such flexure is used to vary the camber of the floor 38b so that
        the aircraft 10b will have a variable lift capability. To this
        end, the aircraft 10b is provided with a plurality of stiffening
        member positioning assemblies and, by way of example, three
        stiffening member positioning assemblies have been shown in
        FIGS. 5 and 6 and designated 110, 112 and 114 therein. (As will
        be clear from the discussion to follow, the number of stiffening
        member positioning assemblies can be varied in accordance with
        particular applications wherein the variable lift capability of
        the aircraft 10b is utilized.) The stiffening member positioning
        assemblies 110, 112 and 114 are substantially identical; that
        is, the assemblies 110, 112 and 114 differ only in the
        dimensions of elements thereof, so that it will not be necessary
        for purposes of the present disclosure to describe each of the
        stiffening member positioning assemblies 110, 112 and 114 in
        detail. Rather, the stiffening member positioning assembly 110
        will be described and reference numerals of elements of
        stiffening member positioning assemblies 112 and 114 will be
        identified in the drawings with the numerals used to identify
        substantially identical elements of the stiffening member
        positioning assembly 110. </p>
      <p>The stiffening member positioning assembly 110 comprises a
        transverse shaft 116 which is secured by suitable bearings to
        the fuselage of the aircraft 10b so that the shaft 116 can be
        pivoted about an axis transverse to the longitudinal extent of
        the lifting duct 34b and parallel to the roof (not shown in
        FIGS. 5 and 6) thereof. A bell crank 118 is fixed to the shaft
        116 to pivot therewith and a connecting rod 120 is pivotally
        connected to the upper end of the bell crank 118. The connecting
        rod 120 extends torward one of the L-shaped stiffening members
        108 and is pivotally connected thereto via a suitable connector
        122 mounted on the stiffening member 108. The lower end of the
        bell crank 118 of each stiffening member positioning assembly
        110-114 is pivotally attached to a longitudinally extending push
        rod 124 and one end of the push rod 124 is connected to a
        suitable mechanism, such as a hydraulic actuating cylinder (not
        shown), for alternatively moving the push rod 124 in a direction
        126 toward the forward end of the fuselage and in a direction
        128 toward the rear end of the fuselage of the aircraft 10b. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 5 and 6 have been drawn to show the manner in which the
        above described structure permits the camber of the floor 38b of
        the duct 34b to be varied. That is, FIG. 5 shows one position of
        the push rod 124 and FIG. 6 shows the affect on the
        configuration of the sheet 94 of moving the push rod 124 from
        the position shown therefor in FIG. 5 toward the rear end of the
        fuselage of the aircraft 10b; that is, in the direction 128. As
        a comparison of FIGS. 5 and 6 shows, such movement of the push
        rod 124 moves the upper ends of the bell cranks 118 upwardly;
        that is, toward the duct 34b so that the connecting rods 120
        raise the stiffening members 108 toward the roof (not shown) of
        the duct 34b to provide a greater camber to the floor 38b of the
        duct 34b. (The support of the trailing edge 98 of the sheet 94
        via the guide members 104 and guide rods 100 permits the
        trailing edge 98 to shift forward as the arched portion 40b of
        the floor 38b is raised into the duct 34b so that the camber of
        the floor 38b is changed by a flexure of the sheet 94.) </p>
      <p>It will be noted that where the aircraft 10b is provided with a
        transverse duct 76b to include the direct lift capability,
        similar to that provided in the aircraft 10a, the overhang 80b,
        which serves the same purposes as the overhang 80 in the
        aircraft 10a is pivotally attached to the floor 38b forwardly of
        the transverse duct 76b. Such attachment permits the slot 78b to
        be maintained open despite changes in shape of the sheet 94 near
        the leading edge 98 thereof and, for this purpose, a
        conventional mechanical linkage (not shown) can be used to
        connect the overhang 80b to the push rod 124 to pivot the
        overhang toward and away from the sheet 94 as the configuration
        of the sheet 94 is varied by the movement of the push rod 124.
        Where the duct 76b is provided, the aircraft 10b is operated in
        substantially the same manner as is the aircraft 10a, such
        operation differing only in that the operator of the aircraft
        10b is additionally provided with the capability of further
        increasing the lift provided by the direct lift capability via
        an increase in the camber of the floor 38b of the duct 34b.
        Where the duct 76b is not provided, the aircraft 10b is
        operated, in a manner similar to the operation of the aircraft
        10, in either a high speed configuration or a low speed
        configuration. In the high speed configuration, the push rod 124
        is moved to a position such as shown in FIG. 6 wherein the
        camber of the floor 38b of the duct 34b is relatively small for
        reduced drag and, in the low speed configuration, the push rod
        124 is positioned as in FIG. 5 wherein the floor 38a has a
        larger camber for increased lift. </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF FIG. 7 </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 7, shown therein is a partial schematic
        cross-section in side elevation of another embodiment of an
        aircraft, designated 10c, constructed in accordance with the
        present invention. As does the aircraft 10b, the aircraft 10c
        exploits the capability of an aircraft having a lifting duct,
        rather than external wings, to maintain structural integrity
        despite the provision of mechanisms to reposition portions of
        the floor of the lifting duct for various purposes. In
        particular, in the aircraft 10c, the fuselage 12c comprises a
        flap 130 which forms a portion of the floor 38c of the duct 34c
        adjacent the forward end 14c of the fuselage 10c. The trailing
        side 132 of the flap 130; that is, the side thereof nearest the
        rear end (not shown in FIG. 7) of the fuselage 12c, is pivotally
        connected adjacent the upper surface 134 of the flap 130 to
        remaining portions of the fuselage 12c and a push rod 136 is
        pivotally connected to the trailing side 132 of the flap 130
        adjacent the lower surface 138 thereof. As in the case of the
        push rod 124 of the aircraft 10b, the push rod 136 is connected
        to a suitable means, such as a hydraulic actuating cylinder or
        the like (not shown), for moving the push rod 136 toward and
        away from the forward end 14c of the fuselage 12c. Thus, the
        flap 130 can be pivoted about an upper, rear edge thereof to the
        position shown by solid lines and hatching in FIG. 7 and to the
        position indicated in phantom lines and designated by the
        numeral 140 in FIG. 7. </p>
      <p>The aircraft 10c further comprises an inlet vane 142 which is
        pivotally mounted within portions of the lifting duct 34c near
        the forward end 14c of the fuselage 12c via a shaft 144 which,
        in turn, is mounted via suitable bearings (not shown) mounted in
        the walls of the lifting duct 34c. The inlet vane 142 senses the
        angle of attack of the lifting duct 34c with respect to
        surrounding air and the aircraft 10c can be provided with
        conventional mechanisms (not shown) to display such information
        to the operator of the aircraft 10c or, alternatively, the
        aircraft 10c can be provided with mechanisms (not shown) for
        automatically controlling the position of the flap 130 so that
        the flap 130 can be moved toward the position shown in solid
        lines in FIG. 7 as the angle of attack of the lifting duct 34c
        increases. Such movement provides a decreased effective angle of
        attack for the lifting duct 34c. </p>
      <p>The flap 130 can also provide an increased camber for the floor
        38c of the lifting duct 34c by lowering portions thereof, formed
        by the flap 130, forwardly of the arched portion 40c of the
        floor 38c of the lifting duct 34c. When the flap 130 is used for
        this purpose, the aircraft 10c has, as do the aircraft 10c and
        10b, both low speed and high speed configurations. In the high
        speed configuration, the flap 130 is raised to the position
        indicated at 140 in FIG. 7 and the aircraft 10c is operated in
        the same manner that the aircraft 10 is operated. In the low
        speed configuration, the flap 130 is lowered to produce, through
        the increased camber of the floor 38c of the duct 34c, a lift
        sufficient to support the aircraft 10c at low flight speeds. </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF FIG. 8 </p>
      <p>FIG. 8, wherein is shown a partial front elevational view of
        another embodiment of an aircraft, designated 10d, constructed
        in accordance with the present invention, has been included to
        show a modification of the aircraft 10. In the aircraft 10d, the
        floor 38d of the lifting duct 34d is formed into a first portion
        144 extending generally from the center of the lifting duct 34a
        to the side thereof adjacent the first side 18d of the fuselage
        12d and a second portion 146 extending between the portion 144
        and the side of the lifting duct 34d adjacent the second side
        20d of the fuselage 12d. As shown in FIG. 8, the portions 144
        and 146 meet in a positive dihedral which, in some cases, can
        add to the stability of the aircraft 10d. The aircraft 10d is
        operated in the same manner as the aircraft 10. </p>
      <p>It is clear that the present invention is well adapted to carry
        out the objects and obtain the ends and advantages mentioned as
        well as those inherent therein. While presently preferred
        embodiments of the invention have been described for purposes of
        this disclosure, numerous changes may be made which will readily
        suggest themselves to those skilled in the art and which are
        encompassed within the spirit of the invention disclosed and as
        defined in the appended claims. </p>

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>1. Field of the Invention: </p>
      <p>This invention relates to improvements in aircraft and more
        particularly, but not by way of limitation, to an internal wing
        aircraft. </p>
      <p>2. Description of the Prior Art: </p>
      <p>The usual aircraft of today normally utilizes a wing structure
        configured to take advantage of the principle that the component
        of the resultant force normal to the direction of motion of a
        body through a fluid is many times greater than the component
        resisting the motion. Generally speaking, and as set forth in
        "The Elements of Aerofoil and Airscrew Theory" by H. Glauert,
        and aircraft wing is designed with a plane of symmetry passing
        through the mid-point of its span, and the direction of motion
        and the line of action of the resultant force usually lie in
        this plane. The section of an airfoil by a plane parallel to the
        plane of symmetry is of an elongated shape, with a rounded
        leading edge and a fairly sharp trailing edge. The cord line of
        an airfoil is defined as the line joining the centers of
        curvature of the leading and trailing edges and the projection
        of the airfoil section on this line is defined as the chord
        length. The angle of incidence of an airfoil is defined as the
        angle between the chord and the direction of motion relative to
        the fluid through which the body is moving, and the center of
        pressure of an airfoil is defined as the point in which the line
        of action of the resultant force intersects the chord. The
        resultant force is resolved into two components, the lift at
        right angles to the direction of motion and the drag parallel to
        that direction but oposing the motion. It is customary to use
        the leading edge of the chord as a point of reference and the
        resultant force has a moment about this point, whose sense is
        such that a positive moment tends to increase the angle of
        incidence. The velocity of the air streaming over the top
        surface or an aircraft wing is greater than the velocity of the
        air streaming over the bottom surface thereof to provide a
        pressure differential across the wing whereby lift is exerted on
        the wing to support the aircraft in flight. Of course, there has
        been a great amount of experimentation to improve aircraft
        design to achieve both greater flight performance and economy of
        construction and operation, but there are still many problems
        existing in the industry. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention comprises an internal wing aircraft
        particularly designed and constructed in a manner to overcome
        much of the present day disadvantages in aircraft design. The
        novel craft is based on the generation of lift by the action of
        air moving through a shaped duct. The duct directs the airflow
        from an inlet at the forward end of the duct to an axis at the
        aft end of the duct. The movement of the airflow throught the
        duct and over a contoured section in the duct floor creates a
        pressure and velocity change in the air stream. The duct shape
        is such that a lower pressure is created on the lower surface of
        the duct than is created on the upper surface of the duct. The
        net difference in the pressure change results in an upward force
        or lift. This force is controlled by the shape of the duct and
        by the amount of air that moves through the duct. The
        configuration of the duct is controlled mechanically to vary the
        contour and height of the contour above the duct floor. As the
        airspeed increases through the duct, less curvature height is
        required to generate the desired vertical force or lift.
        Conversely, as the airspeed decreases, greater curvature height
        is required to maintain the desired vertical force. Of course,
        the duct size must be sufficiently large as to permit the
        airstream to flow through the contoured section without being
        overly restricted when the contoured section is configured with
        the greatest curvature height. Similarly, the size cannot be so
        large that the airstream is allowed to flow through the duct
        without being properly influenced by the contoured section. The
        duct shape and size are dependent on the considerations
        controlling the detailed design of the actual machine and the
        mission for which its use is required. The operation of the duct
        and the contained contoured section provide the characteristics
        necessary to fulfill the fundamental requirements of producing a
        lifting force. </p>
      <p>The duct extends longitudinally through the fuselage of the
        aircraft, with the inlet thereof being disposed rearwardly of
        the power plant of the craft and the outlet open in the
        proximity of the tail section of the craft. This generally
        results in a more compact construction for the aircraft than
        that possible with the more conventional external wing
        structure. In addition, the use of a duct provides a flexibility
        in the aircraft design to meet varying flight requirements since
        the shape of the exterior of the aircraft remains fixed and the
        contour of the duct is altered in accordance with required
        flight performance. In other words, changes in performance of
        the craft may be accomplished by shaping structural members
        which form the longitudinal chamber of the duct floor, and the
        effect of such shaping may be determined independently of other
        factors involved in the overall interaction of the aircraft with
        the air through which the craft moves. Furthermore, the shaping
        of the contour of the duct may be accomplished in flight without
        affecting the structural integrity of the craft as is usually
        the case where shaping is attempted in an external wing
        structure. The positioning of the inlet of the duct aft of the
        aircraft power plant permits a direct utilization of air streams
        produced by the power plant to provide lift via the forward
        movement of the aircraft through the air. The utilization of
        lifting surfaces formed internally of the craft, or in a duct,
        permits utilization of these air streams to provide a lift
        whereby the aircraft may be flown at lower speed than normally
        possible with aircraft provided with external wings. </p>
      <p>Pitch control for the aircraft is provided by movable flaps, or
        the like disposed at the trailed edge or outlet of the duct.
        When these flaps are operated in conjunction with each other,
        that is simultaneously in the same direction, they produce a
        vertical force along the trailing edge of the craft, thus
        changing the attitude of the craft. The directional control of
        the aircraft is provided by vertically mounted vanes mounted at
        the rear of the duct and provide the necessary side force to
        produce a yawing movement for the craft. For low speed
        operations, it may be desirable to provide an external
        vertically disposed control surface to work in conjunction with
        the vanes at the duct outlet. Rolling control of the craft is
        accomplished by the provision of a pair of left and right hand
        control surfaces, with the control surfaces being movable
        simultaneously, but in opposite directions. This will produce a
        rolling movement about the longitudinal axis of the aircraft,
        and modulation of this control mode will enable the pilot of the
        craft to bank, roll, and otherwise control the action of the
        craft as in a more conventional aircraft. The novel aircraft is
        simple and efficient in operation and economical and durable in
        construction. </p>

      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
      <p>Referring to the drawings in detail, and particularly FIGS. 1
        through 4 and 9 through 13, reference character 10 generally
        indicates an internal wing aircraft comprising a fuselage 12
        having a forward end 14, a rear end 16, a first side 18, a
        second side 20, a top 22 and a bottom 24, the connotations top
        and bottom being used to generally indicate the uppermost and
        lowermost surface of the aircraft 10 when the aircraft is in
        substantially level flight, or in a stationary mode. A
        vertically disposed control surface 26 is provided at the rear
        of the aircraft 10, and left and right hand control surfaces 28
        and 30 are disposed at the rear of the craft on the opposite
        sides of the vertical control surface 26, and are movable
        simultaneously, but in opposite directions, to produce a rolling
        movement about the longitudinal axis of the aircraft 10. An
        engine or suitable power plant (not shown) is mounted in the
        forward end 14 of the aircraft 10 in any suitable manner as is
        well known and the power plant may be any type which produces a
        rearward air stream so as to provide thrust for the aircraft 10.
        Of course, suitable conventional landing gear (not shown) may be
        provided for the aircraft, and conventional control devices (not
        shown) are provided for actuation of the control surfaces 26, 28
        and 30 in the usual or well known manner. </p>
      <p>A longitudinally extending internal air duct 32 is provided in
        the fuselage 12 of the craft 10, with the forward end of the
        duct 32 provided with openings 34 and 36 disposed on the
        opposite sides of the lower portion of the fuselage 12 and on
        opposite sides of the power plant or engine (not shown) of the
        craft 10. In addition, the duct 32 is provided with openings 38
        and 40 disposed on the opposite sides of the upper portion of
        the fuselage 12 and on opposite sides of the engine (not shown).
        The floor or bottom 42 of the duct 32 is of an arcuate
        configuration, and the ports or openings 34-38 and 36-40 are
        separated by a centrally disposed baffle means 44. The upper
        surface of the baffle 44 provides a floor or bottom 46 for a
        passageway 48 which communicates between the duct 32 and the
        openings 38 and 40. The bottom or lower surface of the baffle
        means 44 provides a roof or upper surface 48 for the duct 32 at
        the ports 34 and 36, and the arcuate configuration of the duct
        floor 42 and the substantially flat or straight longitudinal
        configuration of the surface 48 converge to provide a reduced
        area or throat 50 in the duct 32 disposed rearwardly or aft of
        the openings 34 and 36. As the air stream moves through the
        ports or openings 34 and 36, the velocity thereof is increased
        by the configuration of the forward section of the ducts, and
        this increased velocity at the exit of the throat 50 creates a
        suction at the converging passageway 48 for drawing in ambient
        air through the ports 38 and 40. The combined airstreams then
        move rearwardly through the duct 32 for discharge through the
        open aft end 52 thereof. </p>
      <p>Whereas the duct 32 as depicted herein is substantially
        uninterrupted throughout its length, it will be apparent that it
        may be desirable to provide a plurality of spaced vanes (not
        shown) secured to the floor 42 and extending inwardly into the
        duct 32 for controlling the direction of flow of the air stream
        moving through the duct to assure a most efficient utilization
        of the forces of the air stream during operation of the craft
        10. </p>
      <p>At least one movable flap means 54 is hingedly secured in any
        well known manner at the rear open end 52 of the duct which is
        selectively movable by the operator of the aircraft 10. In
        addition, it is preferable to provide a complimentary movable
        flap 56 secured substantially in the center of the open rear end
        52 of the duct 32 and in spaced relation with respect to the
        flap 54. The flap 56 is movable simultaneously and in the same
        direction with the flap 54 to provide a vertical force along the
        trailing edge of the aircraft 10, thus changing the attitude of
        the craft, as is well known. </p>
      <p>A vertically disposed vane means generally indicated at 58 is
        suitably mounted at the rear of the duct 32 to provide a
        directional control for the aircraft. The vane means 58
        preferably comprises a pair of substantially identical vane
        members 60 and 62 having one vertical edge thereof pivotally
        secured to a common hinge or pivot shaft 64 whereby the vales 60
        and 62 may be selectively moved either together in common
        directions or in directions toward and away from each other in
        much the same manner as butterfly wings to achieve directional
        control of the aircraft 10. </p>
      <p>Referring now more particularly to FIGS. 8 through 11, a broken
        sectional elevational view of the leading or forward portion of
        the duct 32 is shown, with FIG. 8 being a longitudinal sectional
        view therof. The cross sectional configuration of the duct 32 at
        the leading edge or opening 34 and 36 is substantially circular
        shown at 66 in FIG. 9. The cross sectional configuration of the
        duct 32 flattens or becomes substantially ovate as the duct
        progresses in the direction of the throat 50, the ovate
        configuration being shown at 68 in FIG. 10. The cross sectional
        configuration of the throat 50, as shown in FIG. 11, is
        substantially rectangular. This gradiation of the configuration
        of the duct 32 controls the movement of the air stream between
        the openings 34 and 36 and the throat 50 whereby the speed of
        the air stream is increased as it exits the throat, as
        hereinbefore set forth. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 13, contour control means
        generally indicated at 70 is suitably secured below the floor 42
        of the duct 32 and is utilized for altering the contour of the
        floor 42 in order to alter the peripheral configuration of the
        duct 32. The contour control means comprising a suitable plate
        or metallic sheet 72 may form a portion of the floor 42 and the
        forward end of the plate 72 may be pivotally secured at 74 to
        the fuselage of the aircraft. The plate 72 extends toward the
        rear end of the fuselage and terminates at a trailing edge in
        the proximity of the open rear end 52 of the duct 32. A
        plurality of guide rods (not shown) may be secured to the
        fuselage in any well known manner adjacent the trailing edge of
        the sheet 72 for supporting the plate 72 and facilitating
        guiding of a forward and rearward movement of the plate 72
        during actuation of the apparatus 70. A plurality of suitable
        stiffening members 76 are secured to the under side of the plate
        72, and are preferably provided with spaced slat members 78
        extending transversely thereacross. A plurality of angle members
        80 are interposed between adjacent or succeeding pairs of
        stiffening members 76 and extending transversely across the
        under side of the plate 72 for cooperating with the stiffening
        members 76 to provide sufficient rigidity for the sheet 72 to
        transmit lift produced thereby in conjunction with the roof or
        upper surface 82 of the duct 32 to the fuselage of the aircraft
        10 while concurrently permitting longitudinal flexing of the
        sheet 72. The flexing or changing of the contour of the sheet 72
        varies the chamber of the floor 42 whereby variable lift
        capacity is provided for the aircraft 10. </p>
      <p>A plurality of contour control devices generally indicated at
        84 are pivotally secured between each of the angle members 80
        and a longitudinally extending push rod 86. The contour control
        devices are preferably substantially identical, with the
        exception of the dimensions thereof, and each comprises a
        transversely extending pivot shaft 88 secured to the fuselage 12
        in any suitable manner for rotation about its own longitudinal
        axis. A first link member 90 has one end pivotally secured to
        the shaft 88 and the opposite end pivotally secured to a flange
        92 secured to the respectively angle members 80. A bell crank
        assembly 94 has one end pivotally secured to the pivot shaft 88
        and the opposite end pivotally secured to the push rod 86. The
        push rod 86 is operably connected to a suitable actuating
        mechanism (not shown) such as a hydraulic cylinder (not shown)
        for selective reciprocation of the push rod in forward and aft
        directions. As the push rod 86 moves in one direction, the
        contour control devices are actuated for altering the contour of
        the sheet 72 in such a manner as to provide a desired arcuate
        configuration therefor, such as that shown in FIG. 12. As the
        push rod 86 moves in another direction, the contour control
        devices are actuated for changing the contour of the sheet 72 to
        provide another configuration therefor, such as that shown in
        FIG. 13. This action alters the chamber of the floor 42 of the
        duct 32 thus altering the configuration of the inner periphery
        of the duct 32 in order to provide a control of the lift created
        by the air stream passing through the duct. </p>
      <p>Whereas the aircraft 10 shown in FIGS. 1, 2, 3 and 4 is
        provided with a pair of oppositely disposed outwardly extending
        relatively small wings 96 and 98, the aircraft 100 shown in FIG.
        5 and the aircraft 102 and 104 shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 are not
        provided with external wings. The lifting force in the craft
        100, 102 and 104 is attained entirely by the internal duct
        system 32 as hereinbefore described. The novel aircraft design
        lends itself to an efficient single engine or multiple engine
        design as desired. As shown in FIG. 6, an engine or power plant
        106 is mounted in the forward portion of the craft as in the
        case of the aircraft 10 hereinbefore set forth. The aircraft
        104, as shown herein, may be provided with at least two such
        engines (not shown) if desired. In addition, the novel aircraft
        design may be utilized in the construction of large transport of
        cargo aircraft with equal efficiency and economy of operation
        and construction. </p>
      <p>The lift for the aircraft 10 is generated by the action of air
        moving through the duct 32. The duct directs the airflow from
        the forward inlets 34 and 36 to the rearward outlet 52 for
        discharge at the rear of the craft. The movement of the air
        stream moving over the contoured section of the floor 42 creates
        a pressure and velocity change in the air stream. The
        configuration of the duct is such that a lower pressure is
        created on the floor or bottom surface 42 of the duct than is
        created on the upper surface 82 of the duct. The net difference
        in the pressure change results in an upward force or lift. This
        force is controlled by the shape of the duct or configuration of
        the inner periphery of the duct and by the amount of air that
        moves through the duct. </p>
      <p>The configuration of the duct is altered by the contour control
        mechanism 70 which not only varies the configuration or contour
        of the floor 42 of the duct 32, but also varies the height of
        the duct, or the distance between the floor 42 and upper surface
        82 of the duct. As the airspeed is increased through the duct
        32, less curvature height is needed to generate the desired
        vertical force acting against the surface 82. Conversely, as the
        airspeed is decreased, more curvature height is required to
        maintain the required vertical force or lift. Of course, the
        duct size must be sufficiently great so as to permit the air
        flow through the contoured section of the duct without undue
        restriction of the movement of the air stream with the contoured
        section is configured with the greatest or highest curvature for
        the floor 42. Similarly, the size of the duct cannot be so large
        that the air stream is allowed to pass through the duct 32
        without being properly influenced by the contoured section. The
        actual particulars of the duct shape and size are dependent on
        the considerations controlling the detail design of the aircraft
        for its anticipated mission requirements. The operation of the
        duct and the contained contoured section provide the
        characteristics necessary to fulfill the fundamental
        requirements for producing a lifting force for the aircraft. </p>
      <p>It will be readily apparent from the drawings that the plane of
        the inlets 34 and 36 of the duct 32 are angularly disposed with
        respect to the direction of the incoming airflow. The duct
        inlets 34 and 36 are sensitive to this angular alignment, as is
        well known in the nature of inlets in general. The larger the
        angular misalignment, the larger the losses in airflow
        properties as the air stream enters the ducts 32 and begins its
        movement through the duct. The radius size of the circular inlet
        portion 66 is to control and minimize the sensitivity of the
        respective inlet to this misalignment. There are some small
        practical limits to this consideration, and this is the reason
        for the incorporation of the usual pitch-attitude control which
        is much like that of a conventional aircraft, except that the
        utilization of the pitch-attitude control is more like a
        trimming device than a major control device. The pitch control
        is provided by the flaps 28 and 30 and 54. When these flaps are
        operated in conjunction with each other simultaneously and in
        the same direction, a vertical force is produced along the
        trailing edge of the aircraft 10, thus changing the attitude of
        the craft. Of course, this attitude change may be controlled or
        monitored by the pilot in order to adjust the alignment of the
        aircraft with the incoming airflow. </p>
      <p>Similarly, the directional control of the aircraft 10 may be
        maintained by the pilot of the craft. The directional alignment
        of the duct 32 is less sensitive than the pitch alignment,
        although the directional alignment plays an important role in
        the efficiency of the duct 32 and is fundamental to the
        maneuvering of the craft to a desired position or place. The
        vertically mounted vanes 60 and 62 disposed at the rear opening
        52 of the duct 32 provide the necessary side force to produce a
        yawing movement of the craft. Of course, for low speed
        operations, the external vertically disposed vane or control
        surface 26 is provided for operation in conjunction with the
        vanes 60 and 62. </p>
      <p>The rolling control of the craft is accomplished by the
        utilization of the flaps 54 and 28 and 30. It is preferable that
        the flaps 54 and 28-30 be arranged in cooperating left and right
        hand pairs, with one of each pair being disposed above the
        other. The upper and lower flaps or control surfaces of the
        right hand pair may be moved together, and the upper and lower
        flaps of the left hand pair may be similarly moved together but
        in opposite directions with respect to the movement of the right
        hand pair. This "split movement" feature produces a rolling
        movement about the longitudinal axis of the aircraft 10, and
        modulation of the operation of these control surfaces will
        enable the pilot to bank, roll, and otherwise maneuver the craft
        10 in much the manner as a conventional aircraft. Of course, as
        hereinbefore set forth, all of the control vanes and/or surfaces
        are operably connected in any suitable or well known manner (not
        shown) for actuation by the pilot of the craft. </p>
      <p>The function of the duct 32 is based on the amount of air
        moving through the contoured section thereof to produce the
        desired vertical force for the particular flight conditions of
        the aircraft 10. The movement of the air stream through the duct
        32 is the result of energy that is supplied to the air stream by
        the aircraft and its systems. This energy is supplied by moving
        the craft through the air or by pumping the air through the duct
        by some mechanical means. When all of the airflow is produced by
        the forward movement or velocity of the aircraft, the
        performance of the craft will be dependent solely upon the power
        available to move the craft through the air. When the air stream
        is pumped through the duct 32, the performance of the duct and
        the craft are greatly enhanced. Pumping of the air may be
        accomplished in any suitable manner, such as by utilization of a
        pumping fan, or the like, (not shown) which may be disposed at
        either the intake or outlet end of the duct. Under these
        conditions, more energy is usually available when the fan is
        utilized to produce a pressure rather than to produce suction.
        In other words, it may be expedient to place the fan at the
        inlet of the duct rather than the outlet thereof. </p>
      <p>The pumping of the air through the duct 32 may also be
        accomplished by pumping a percentage of the air stream through
        the duct at higher pressure and entraining the remaining air by
        viscous action, which is the principle of a jet pump. In the
        aircraft 10 this is accomplished by diverting the air from the
        power plant or engine (not shown) of the craft 10 into the
        inlets 34 and 36 of the duct 32 and discharge the air stream
        through the outlet end 52 thereof. The air stream entering the
        inlets 34 and 36 moves to the throat area 50 where the velocity
        of the air stream is increased and as the air stream exits
        through the throat 50, ambient air is pulled into the duct 32
        through the inlets 38 and 40. The generation of a lifing force
        by flowing air through an internal passage, such as the duct 32,
        is dependent upon the shaping of the passageway itself, and the
        utilization of the contoured floor portion 42 is much like the
        upper surface of an airfoil configuration wherein a velocity
        change is created in the air as it passes through the duct.
        Since the shaping is primarily on the floor 42 of the duct 32,
        the largest velocity change occurs along the floor 42 and a
        lesser velocity change occurs along the roof or upper surface 82
        of the duct 82. </p>
      <p>Proportional to the changes in velocity along the length of the
        duct 32, the pressure acting on the floor 42 and the roof 82 is
        reduced. The pressure along the floor 42 is reduced more than
        the pressure along the roof 82, thereby creating a pressure
        differential between the two surfaces. This pressure
        differential acts on the surface area of the contoured portion
        of the floor 42 to create a vertical force in much the same way
        as does an external wing structure. The relationship between the
        pressure change in the air stream passing through the passageway
        or duct 32 and the shape of the inner periphery of the duct 32
        is directly related to the co-ordinate dimensions of the contour
        size and shape, and this relationship is well defined and
        computable by conventional and well known methods. In the flying
        of an aircraft, lift has always been conventionally controllable
        by changes in the angle of attack, co-ordinated with an airspeed
        or change in airspeed of the craft. In the novel internal wing
        aircraft 10 the requirements are to produce a change in lift by
        changing the co-ordinate dimensions of the contoured section for
        the given airspeed or change in airspeed, and this is
        accomplished by the actuation of the control device 70. The
        effects of pitch attitude are not the same in the aircraft 10 as
        in conventional external wing aircraft and are not utilized in
        the production of lift in the craft 10. </p>
      <p>The mathematics surrounding the calculations of the velocity
        ratios at each given contour point are based on the conformal
        transformations of the co-ordinate airflows. As an example of
        the effects of the contour of the floor 42 on the velocity of
        the air stream passing over it, a comparison between a low
        curvature surface may be made. The low curvature surface, such
        as shown in FIG. 13, may be considered for high speed low lift
        flight conditions for the aircraft 10, whereas the high
        curvature surface as shown in FIG. 12 may be considered for low
        speed high lift flight. The velocity relationship of airflow
        along the upper surface 82 of the duct 32 is heavily dependent
        on the airflow itself. At low speeds, the difference between the
        upper surface velocity and the lower surface velocity is small.
        As the velocity of the airflow increases, the difference
        increases, and at high speeds the velocity along the upper
        surface 82 will be typically one-half to two-thirds that along
        the lower surface 42. Therefore, the reduction in pressure along
        the upper surface is typically between twenty-five percent and
        forty percent of the reduction along the lower surface. Between
        sixty and seventy-five percent of the lower surface pressure
        reduction can be utilized for lift at high speeds. </p>
      <p>As hereinbefore set forth the configuration or contour of the
        inner periphery of the duct 32 is controlled by the contour
        control means 70, and as the airspeed is increased through the
        duct, less curvature height for the floor 42 is necessary to
        generate the desired vertical force or lift. Conversely, as the
        airspeed is decreased, the greater the curvature height required
        to maintain the required vertical force or lift for the
        aircraft. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing it will be apparent that the present
        invention provides a novel aircraft utilizing an internal wing
        concept wherein an internal duct extends longitudinally through
        the fuselage of the aircraft and is provided with inlet means at
        the forward end thereof and outlet means at the aft end thereof.
        The air stream passing through the duct creates an upward force
        or lift for the craft and control vanes are provided for
        achieving the usual or desired operational characteristics for
        the craft generaly similar to more conventional external wing
        aircraft. The novel aircraft concept lends itself to application
        for single engine high speed operational craft, large transport
        or cargo craft, multi-engine craft or substantially any other
        desired inflight operational requirements.<br>

        <div align="left"><b>CONCLUSION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The AD1 aircraft has shown potential to high lifting aircraft
          even with the detriment of a small wing span. The aircraft is
          extremely light weight, making it agile but susceptible to
          high winds. During the simulations the most lift produced by
          the configuration was 1622N which is more 22 times the
          aircraft weight. This quite impressive because most cargo
          aircraft are only capable of lifting of 2 times their weight
          (that is being generous). There still needs to be more
          extensive studies into the placement of the individual wings
          on AD1 and there is plenty of room for improvement (as can be
          seen in the small L/D ratio). Most cargo aircraft manage about
          a 14~17 L/D ratio, and this should be attainable with the AD1.
          If the aircraft can be properly adjusted, its potential is
          enormous and because it is incredibly stable there is no worry
          about if the aircraft will be able to handle the loads.<br>

      Ever had a sudden flash of insight, an aha! moment? That moment
      is called a Eureka Moment thanks to the ancient Greek scholar
      Archimedes, who, the story goes, yelled Eureka (literally I
      have found it) when he stepped into his bath and saw that the
      bath water rose in proportion to the volume of his body he put in
      the water  thus discovering how to precisely measure the volume
      of irregular objects.<br>
      <br>
      Robert Carr had his Eureka Moment in 1976. After a stint in the
      Army he had returned to Oklahoma City and was earning a living as
      an instructor pilot, flying out of Wiley Post Airport. One day
      while he was flying over the zoo, on approach into Expressway
      Airpark, he realized that there could be a more efficient way to
      fly, a better way to design aircraft so that airflow and lift were
      maximized. The critical need was to increase the speed and density
      of the airflow over the airfoils  the wings. He went home that
      night and experimented in the bath with a cigar tube  a great
      place to study fluid dynamics it seems  and learned enough to
      know he was onto something. Unlike Archimedes he didnt shout
      Eureka! and run through the streets, but started designing and
      researching. He studied the physics of flying, and applied his
      inventors eye and years of flying experience  and, critically,
      an open mind  to optimal lift and the design of flying machines.<br>
      <br>
      That was the beginning of the journey  a quintessential
      inventors journey, exemplifying the spirit and energy behind the
      greatest economic engine the world has ever known: America. Edison
      comes to mind, as do the Wright Brothers, Jobs &amp; Woz. The
      courage to live the dream  and keep on slogging away. It was
      three years before Robert was introduced to the work of Henri
      Coanda and truly began to understand the science behind the
      effects he was creating, thanks to Dr. Edward F. Blick, at the
      time Professor of Aerospace, Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering,
      the University of Oklahoma. It was seven more years before Robert
      got his first two flight-related patents. His most recent patents

      <br>
      The present invention provides an improved lift system for an
      aerial crane incorporating a wing, coanda and curved surface. The
      arrangement of the wing, coanda and curved surface use and induce
      airflow to create additional lift through an increase in airflow
      mass, density and velocity. A different configuration of the wing,
      coanda and curved surface can be used to propel a vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      The present invention relates to ways to provide power to lift
      objects and propel vehicles. More specifically, it provides a wing
      configuration to provide lift for an aircraft as well as move
      vehicles in a horizontal or vertical direction<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Prior Art</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      Devices for lifting and rigging heavy equipment have been around
      for centuries. In fact the rigging used to create one of the seven
      wonders of the world, the ancient Egyptian pyramids, perplexes
      engineers and historians to this day. While there are several
      competing theories, given the technology that was available at
      that time, it is uncertain how the Egyptians were able to
      transport and lift the huge stone blocks that make up the
      pyramids.<br>
      <br>
      Since the time of the Egyptians, the crane and heavy lifting
      helicopter have emerged as the typical implements used for lifting
      heavy equipment and material. Cranes are the more cost effective
      solution of the two. However, cranes have limitations when it
      comes to height of the lift as well as reach. Cranes can only lift
      as high as their boom. The height of the boom can be adjusted to a
      certain extent by increasing the angle between the ground and the
      boom. But as this angle is increased the reach or distance between
      the base of the boom and the load being lifted is decreased, thus
      reducing the reach of the crane. The end result is that in certain
      situations the crane may be able to lift the load high enough, but
      at that point the crane is not capable of reaching far enough away
      from its base to put the load in the desired location.<br>
      <br>
      Another consideration in using a crane is the relationship between
      the weight of the load and the reach needed for the lift. In order
      to increase the reach of the crane, the angle between the boom and
      the ground can be decreased. However, as the reach is increased
      the lifting capacity of the crane is decreased. This is due to the
      fact that as the reach is increased the lever arm of the moment
      about the base of the boom is increased and in turn the moment
      about the base of the boom is also increased. In the end, the
      weight of the load as well as the height and reach of the lift
      must be within the envelope of capability of the crane.<br>
      <br>
      When the lift is outside the capability of the crane it becomes
      necessary to use a helicopter. The helicopter has the advantage of
      having an unlimited height and reach on any given lift. However,
      the weight of the load is a critical limiting factor in using a
      helicopter to lift equipment and materials. While the load weight
      limit for a helicopter varies with air density, it is generally
      not a significant change. It therefore may be necessary to locate
      and use a larger helicopter due to the weight of the load. The
      cost involved in using a helicopter can also be prohibitive.<br>
      <br>
      Another drawback of using a helicopter for lifting equipment and
      materials is that they are mechanically complex and relatively
      inefficient. They are comprised of thousands of intricate moving
      parts which are subject to failure. They also rely solely on the
      direct thrust of the rotors for lift. They do not take advantage
      of a wing configuration that would create lift from both direct
      thrust and the differences of pressure created by the Bernoulli
      principle. As such, the typical helicopter only produces 5 to 12
      pounds of lift per horsepower of its engine.<br>
      <br>
      The same power plants used to provide lift in a helicopter can
      also be used to propel other types of vehicles. Two typical
      applications would be an airboat and a hovercraft. The airboat
      floats on the water and is propelled by thrust produced by a
      reward facing propeller pushing air reward from the boat. Here, as
      in the helicopter, the force moving the boat forward is limited
      solely to the direct thrust of the propeller without using a wing
      configuration to create additional forward force using the
      Bernoulli principle.<br>
      <br>
      The hovercraft is propelled using the same principles as the
      airboat. However part of the air on the hovercraft is diverted
      downward underneath the craft to create a cushion of air on which
      the hovercraft floats. This allows the craft to move over water as
      well as land.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      The present invention is a force generating device which can be
      used to levitate lifting devices such as aerial cranes and propel
      vehicles. The present invention incorporates a wing configuration
      to create additional force from an airflow through the use of
      Bernoulli's principle and the Coanda effect.<br>
      <br>
      One of the objectives of the present invention is to apply the
      force generating device to an aerial platform which can be used to
      lift heavy objects in lieu of a helicopter or crane.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the present invention is to apply the force
      generating device to propel a vehicle such as an automobile or
      boat along a horizontal or inclined plane.<br>
      <br>
      Yet another objective of the present invention is to apply the
      force generating device to a vehicle such as an automobile or boat
      along a vertical plane.<br>
      <br>
      Other and further objects, features, aspects, and advantages of
      the present invention will become better understood with the

      <b> </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      Details of illustrative embodiments of the invention are set forth
      herein. However, it is to be understood that the embodiments
      describe and exemplify an invention that may take forms different
      from the specific embodiments disclosed. Structural and functional
      details are not necessarily to be interpreted as limiting, but
      rather as a basis for the claims.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 shows a perspective view of a crane 20 containing the
      preferred embodiment of the present invention as applied to an
      aerial crane 20. FIG. 2 is a partial cross-sectional view of the
      crane 20 taken along the line indicated in FIG. 1. The crane 20
      has a wing 22 and a coanda 24 extending radially around the
      airflow inducement mechanism 26. The wing 22 has a leading edge 21
      and a trailing edge 23. The coanda 24 also has a leading edge 25
      and a trailing edge 27. The airflow inducement mechanism 26 can be
      a prop or axial fan driven by an internal combustion engine,
      electrical motor, hydraulic motor, pneumatic motor or any other
      type of engine capable of providing mechanical force.<br>
      <br>
      The body 28 of the crane 20 is located just below the wing 22 and
      the coanda 24. The top of the body 28 forms a curved surface 30.
      The traditional rigging equipment such as hooks, lines, winches,
      blocks and tackles (not shown) can be attached in the normal
      fashion to the bottom of the body 28 of the crane 20. There is an
      opening 32 located between the wing 22 and the coanda 24. The
      opening 32 extends radially around the outer edge of the coanda
      24. The wing 22 and coanda 24 are secured to the body 28 by a
      series of structural members (not shown), which allow the air to
      flow with minimal resistance.<br>
      <br>
      When the crane 20 is in use, the airflow inducement mechanism 26
      causes a downward airflow as indicated by the arrows in FIG. 2.
      The air flows down through the center 34 of the crane 20 along the
      curved surface 30. Airflow through the opening 32 is induced by
      the airflow along the curved surface 30. The induced airflow
      causes air to travel down over the top surface 36 of the coanda
      24. The air coming through the opening 32 causes the airflow from
      the center 34 to separate from the bottom side 38 of the wing 22
      as it passes between the wing 22 and the curved surface 30. This
      separation prevents the pressure on the bottom side 38 of the wing
      22 from dropping. If the pressure on the bottom side 38 of the
      wing 22 drops too drastically, it will counteract and cancel out
      the lift generated pressure drop due to the increased airflow
      adjacent to the curved surface 30.<br>
      <br>
      The airflow from the opening 32 has a downward direction as it
      enters the airflow from the center 34. This downward direction
      helps laminate the airflow from the center 34 onto the curved
      surface 30. This causes the airflow from the center 34 to
      compress, thus doubling the mass of air flowing over the curved
      surface 30 of the body 28. This compression produces a venturi
      effect on the airflow between the curved surface 30 and the bottom
      side 38 of the wing 22, thus increasing the velocity of the
      airflow.<br>
      <br>
      Lift increases exponentially with the increased velocity of the
      airflow through the system. The increase in the mass and the
      increase in the velocity created by this arrangement allow the
      crane 20 to create 29.6 pounds of lift per horsepower, compared to
      5 to 12 pounds of lift per horsepower of a typical helicopter.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 is a perspective view of an alternate embodiment of the
      present invention. FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the
      embodiment of the crane 20 shown in FIG. 3, taken along the line
      4-4. The crane 20 shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 has a set of flaps 40
      attached to the trailing edge 23 of the wing 22 and another set of
      flaps 42 attached to the trailing edge 27 of the coanda 24. The
      wing 22 and the coanda 24 are constructed of a series of wedge
      shaped sections 29 extending around to form a complete circle.
      Both sets of the flaps 40 and 42 are located in every other
      section 29 of the wing 22 and coanda 24. The alternating sections
      of flaps 40 and 42 are necessary to avoid interference of movement
      between adjacent flaps. These flaps 40 and 42 are operated and
      attached by any means typically known in the aircraft industry,
      such as solenoids, hydraulics, pneumatics, worm gears, gears, rack
      and pinions or other mechanical linkages. The flaps 40 and 42
      allow the airflow over the curved surface 30 to be further
      restricted, as well as to direct the airflow. This control of the
      airflow through the flaps 40 and 42 can be used to cause lateral
      movement of the crane 20.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 shows yet another embodiment of the present invention which
      functions the same as the one shown if FIG. 4. The difference
      between the embodiment shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 is that the
      embodiment shown in FIG. 5 has a second interior flap 44 located
      along the trailing edge 23 of the wing 22. The interior flap 44 is
      pivotally attached to the wing 22. The exterior flap 42 is then
      pivotally attached to the interior flap 44. These flaps 42 and 44
      are located in every other section 29 of the wing 22. Having the
      two flaps 42 and 44 provides better control in restricting and
      directing the airflow. It would also be possible to add additional
      flaps in series to the trailing edge 23 of the wing 22 or the
      trailing edge 27 of the coanda 24. It would also be possible to
      attach sets of one or more moveable flaps in series along the
      trailing edge 43 of the curved surface 30 to aid in the control of
      the airflow. These flaps or sets of flaps in series would have to
      be in every other section 29 of the curved surface to avoid
      interference with adjacent flaps just as done with the flaps on
      the wing 22 and coanda 24.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 show a set of bypasses 46 which allow air to pass
      through the coanda 24 from the interior surface 45 to the exterior
      surface 47. The bypass 46 provides additional control of the
      airflow for controlling lift, stability and maneuverability. Each
      bypass 46 is equipped with a gate 48 which is used to control the
      flow of air through it. FIG. 4 shows the bypass gate 48 in the
      closed position. FIG. 5 shows the bypass gate 48 in the open
      position. The gate can be slidingly or pivotally attached to the
      bypass 46. Other forms of articulated or moveable attachment would
      also work for attaching the gates 48. The gate 48 can be operated
      by any means commonly known in the art, including solenoids,
      hydraulics, pneumatics, worm gears or other mechanical linkages.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 shows the preferred embodiment of the present invention as
      applied to a propulsion system 50 for a vehicle 52. FIG. 7 shows a
      wheeled vehicle 52 with a propulsion system 50 behind a grill 49.
      However, it should be noted that the propulsion system 50 can also
      be used on watercraft, hovercraft or other types of vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      The propulsion system 50 has a wing 54, a coanda 56 and a curved
      surface 58 similar to that found in the crane 20 shown in FIGS. 1
      through 5. However, the wing 54, coanda 56 and curved surface 58
      of the propulsion system 50 are laid out in a linear form versus
      the circular form seen in FIGS. 1 through 5. The propulsion system
      50 has an opening 60 at the center with an airflow inducement
      mechanism 62. Note the layout of the wing 54, coanda 56 and curved
      surface 58 are similar to those parts of the crane 20 shown in
      FIGS. 1 through 5, i.e. there is an opening between the wing 54
      and coanda 56 and a passageway along the curved surface 58 formed
      by the wing 54 and coanda 56 on one side and the curved surface 58
      on the other side. As such, the wing 54, coanda 56 and curved
      surface 58 all operate in the same manner as that disclosed for
      the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 through 5 to help generate a force
      to propel the vehicle 52. The wing 54 has a leading edge 51 and a
      trailing edge 53. The coanda 56 has a leading edge 55 and a
      trailing edge 57. Just as in the crane 20 application shown in
      FIG. 3, one or more flaps 59 can be attached to the trailing edge
      53 of the wing 54, the trailing edge 57 of the coanda 56 and
      curved surface 58 of the propulsion system 50 to control the
      airflow and direction of thrust.<br>
      <br>
      The propulsion system 50 can be rotatably mounted in the vehicle
      52, as indicated by the arrows 64 in FIGS. 7, 8 and 9. When the
      propulsion system 50 is in front of the vehicle 52, it creates a
      forward propelling force comprised of the "lift" and thrust to
      help move the car in a forward direction. The propulsion system 50
      creates a "lift" due to pressure differences created by the flow
      of air over the wing 54, coanda 56 and curved surface 58. Because
      the propulsion system 50 when in use is typically oriented so the
      wing 54, coanda 56 and curved surface 58 are vertical, the "lift"
      becomes a forward moving force. The thrust can be directed using
      the flaps 59, covers 66 and rotation of the propulsion system 50
      to create a forward moving force. Likewise, the propulsion system
      50 can be rotated to produce a force to lift the front end of the
      vehicle 52.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 shows a perspective view of a vehicle 52 with the
      propulsion system 50 rotatably mounted in front of the vehicle 52
      behind a grill 49. Both ends of the propulsion system 50 can be
      fitted with a cover 66 which helps redirect the flow of the air as
      indicated by the arrows 68. The flow of the intake air is
      indicated by the arrows 70. FIG. 8 shows an exploded view of the
      vehicle 52 shown in FIG. 7. The grill 49 is removed to reveal the
      propulsion system 50. FIG. 9 shows a further exploded view of the
      vehicle 52 with a propulsion system 50. One half of the propulsion
      system 50 is exploded to the side to show the various parts,
      including the curved surface 58, the coanda 56, the wing 54 and
      the cover 66. These same components have corresponding components
      laid out in a mirror image of them on the other side of the air
      inducement mechanism 62.<br>

        <b>AIRCRAFT INTERNAL WING AND DESIGN</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      An aircraft designed with three wings located on either side of
      the fuselage. The forward wing has a downward angle with a curved
      top and bottom surface. The upper wing is located towards the rear
      of the aircraft and above the forward wing. The lower wing is
      located below the upper wing and slightly forward. It is also
      located to the rear and below of the forward wing. The outer ends
      of all three wings come into contact at one point. The forward
      wing uses the Coanda effect to increase the airflow across the top
      surface of the bottom wing. The aircraft can be designed so that
      it is large enough to carry people and/or cargo, or to be small
      enough to be flown as a toy aircraft. The like design can use any
      type of aircraft engine commonly used today.; One embodiment of
      the aircraft has two turbines, shaft-coupled to a power source,
      located on either side of the forward end of the fuselage. Each
      engine has part of its thrust diverted through and directed by a
      plenum disposed internal of the coanda toward both sides of the
      fuselage so that an equal amount of thrust flows through the duct
      and over the wings on either side of the fuselage. This ensures
      equal lift on the coanda and both wings on either side of the
      fuselage in the event that one engine malfunctions.<br>

      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a wing design for an aircraft.
      The wing design can be used on aircraft capable of carrying
      passengers and cargo as well as on model aircraft built and
      designed without the capability of carrying passengers or cargo to
      be flown for recreation. The present invention can be incorporated
      into a powered aircraft or glider.<br>
      <br>
      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
      <br>
      It is common knowledge that air pressure at a point on the surface
      of a moving object is a function of the velocity with which air
      streams over the surface at that point. Indeed, this principle is
      the basis for aircraft design; that is, it is common practice to
      shape the wings of an aircraft so that the velocity of air
      streaming over the top surface of each wing is greater than the
      velocity of air streaming over the bottom surface of the wing.
      This velocity differential, achieved by the contour of the wing,
      results in a pressure differential across the wing so that a net
      force, lift, is exerted on the wing to support the aircraft in
      flight.<br>
      <br>
      Traditional modern day aircraft typically have a single wing
      located on either side of the fuselage of the aircraft. The
      airflow over these wings provides the lift required to raise the
      aircraft off of the ground. There is typically a tail located at
      the aft end of the fuselage with a vertical member and two
      horizontal members, one located on each side of the vertical
      member. The tail provides stability for the aircraft in flight.
      Also, the tail and the leading and trailing edge of the wing
      typically contain the control surfaces which are used to maneuver
      and turn the aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      The present inventor has two prior patents relating to wing
      designs which diverge from the typical modern aircraft design.
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,568,042 ("the '042 patent") issued on Feb. 4, 1986
      discloses an aircraft having a fuselage provided with an internal
      duct extending longitudinally therethrough to provide an internal
      wing for the craft, the internal duct having the forward end open
      for receiving an air stream therethrough and the aft end thereof
      open for discharge of the air stream therefrom, the internal
      contour of the duct being alterable in accordance with required
      operational conditions for the flight of the craft, and a
      plurality of control flaps and/or vanes provided at the aft end of
      the duct for providing operational controls for the craft in the
      manner of a more conventional external wing craft.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,300 ("the '300 patent") issued on Apr. 1, 1986
      discloses how lift for an aircraft is provided by forming a
      longitudinal lifting duct therethrough, said lifting duct having a
      substantially planar roof and a longitudinally cambered floor.
      When the aircraft is driven forwardly, a stream of air enters and
      passes through the lifting duct and the contouring of the floor of
      the lifting duct give rise to a pressure gradient in the air
      stream which result in a higher pressure on the roof of the
      lifting duct than on the floor thereof so that the pressure
      difference provides lift for the aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      The drawback to the aircraft design found in the '042 and '300
      patents is that the aircraft had little wing span. This in turn
      meant that the aircraft had less desirable gliding range in the
      event of loss of power.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also provides a structurally much stronger
      wing configuration than a traditional aircraft wing design with a
      single wing protruding transverse to the longitudinal axis of the
      fuselage.<br>
      <br>
      BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
      <br>
      The applicant has come up with an improved aircraft design. The
      aircraft has three wings and uses the Coanda effect to increase
      the lift available on the wings for a given speed. It also has an
      improved aspect ratio over the aircraft disclosed in the '042 and
      '300 patents and therefore provides better glide capabilities.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description
      and the following detailed description are exemplary and
      explanatory only, and are not restrictive of the invention as
      claimed. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated herein
      by reference, and which constitute a part of this specification,
      illustrate certain embodiments of the invention and, together with
      the detailed description, serve to explain the principles of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the
      invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is
      not limited in this application to the details of construction and
      to the arrangement so the components set forth in the following
      description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is
      capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried
      out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the
      phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of
      description and should not be regarded as limiting. As such, those
      skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception upon which
      this disclosure is based may readily be utilized as a basis for
      the designing of other structures, methods and systems for
      carrying out the present invention. It is important, therefore,
      that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent
      constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and
      scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the purpose of the foregoing abstract is to enable the
      U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the public generally, and
      especially the design engineers and practitioners in the art who
      are not familiar with patent or legal terms or phraseology, to
      determine quickly from a cursory inspection the nature and essence
      of the technical disclosure of the application. The abstract is
      neither intended to define the invention of the application, which
      is measured by the claims, nor is it intended to be limiting as to
      the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has a design which takes advantage of the
      Coanda effect. The Coanda effect causes fluids which are flowing
      over a curved surface to continue to follow the curvature of that
      surface. The Coanda effect is best demonstrated by holding a
      curved surface such as the side of a glass under a running stream
      of water. As the glass is held on its side, the water falls onto
      the top side of the glass and will encircle the glass as it flows
      over its circumference.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has three wings located on either side of
      the fuselage. The outer edge of all three wings are joined
      together. The leading wing or coanda is mounted forward of the
      upper and lower wing. The coanda has a downward sloping angle with
      a curved top and bottom surface. The upper wing is mounted higher
      on the fuselage and towards the rear in relation to the coanda.
      The lower wing is mounted below and slightly forward of the upper
      wing. The lower wing is also below and to the rear of the coanda.
      The upper surfaces of the upper wing and the lower wing are curved
      while the undersides of both the upper and lower wings are
      generally flat. This provides lift when the aircraft moves in the
      forward direction.<br>
      <br>
      The coanda takes advantage of the Coanda effect and pulls more air
      over the lower wing. This increases both the density of the air
      flowing over the lower wing as well as the velocity across it.
      This in turn helps increase the lift.<br>
      <br>
      The coanda helps create a split flow between the upper and lower
      wings creating a boundary layer separation from the bottom of the
      top wing and adhesion of the airflow to the wing resulting in a
      low pressure area just above the lower wing and a high pressure
      area below the upper wing. The upper and lower wings also create a
      venturi which also adds to the low pressure just above the lower
      wing. The jet-pumping action induced by the contours enhance
      thrust, lift and general stability. The synergistic effect of the
      coanda and the upper and lower wings induces a centrifugal flow
      component that provides additional stability for the aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      The centrifugal flow component creates a pair of vortices, one
      under both of the upper wings. These vortices rotate in a
      counter-clockwise direction when looking from the end of the wings
      towards the fuselage of the plane. The location of the vortices
      varies as a function of the speed of the aircraft forward. As the
      speed of the aircraft increases, the vortices tend to move in an
      aftward direction underneath the upper wing. In alternate
      embodiments of the present invention, a Kruger flap can be
      installed on the bottom side of the upper wing just aft of the
      leading edge. By extending the Kruger flap or opening the Kruger
      flap, the location of the vortices can be moved forward.<br>
      <br>
      The aircraft can be controlled by conventional control surfaces
      found on the coanda, the upper and lower wings, as well as the
      tail. In an alternative embodiment, the aircraft can be controlled
      by a variable camber aero hydronamic surface (VCAHS). The VCAHS is
      a series of collapsible and expandable honeycomb chambers located
      on the surface of the wings. These are coupled to a pressure
      manifold and a vacuum manifold. A flexible surface would then be
      used on top of the VCAHS to provide the outer surfaces of the
      coanda and upper and lower wings. The contour of the surfaces
      could then be altered to adjust the high and low pressure areas
      around the wings and provide control of the aircraft. This reduced
      the drag inherent with convention control surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention can be used on aircraft designed to
      passengers and cargo as well as model or toy aircraft designed to
      be flown as recreation or a hobby. Such model or toy aircraft are
      typically launched by throwing them by hand or in the alternative
      by powering them with a small remote controlled motor or engine.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention, when coupled with a jet propulsion system,
      can be capable of short takeoff and landing performance (STOL).
      This can be achieved by opening the saddle shunt just aft of the
      engines so that the thrust coming off of the engines flows across
      the coanda and upper and lower wing surfaces while a pair of
      thrust diverters located on either side of the aft end of the
      fuselage divert the thrust. Once airborne, the thrust diverters
      can be retracted so that the thrust coming across the coanda and
      wings of the aircraft provide a forward thrust. When the aircraft
      reaches the desired altitude, the saddle shunts can then be closed
      so that the thrust from the engines flows through the duct work
      located in the fuselage out the rear of the aircraft.<br>

      <b> </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      While the making and using of various embodiments of the present
      invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated
      that the present invention provides for inventive concepts capable
      of being embodied in a variety of specific contexts. The specific
      embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific
      manners in which to make and use the invention and are not to be
      interpreted as limiting the scope of the instant invention.<br>
      <br>
      The claims and specification describe the invention presented and
      the terms that are employed in the claims draw their meaning from
      the use of such terms in the specification. The same terms
      employed in the prior art may be broader in meaning than
      specifically employed herein. Whenever there is a question between
      the broader definition of such terms used in the prior art and the
      more specific use of the terms herein, the more specific meaning
      is meant.<br>
      <br>
      While the invention has been described with a certain degree of
      particularity, it is clear that many changes may be made in the
      details of construction and the arrangement of components without
      departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure. It is
      understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments
      set forth herein for purposes of exemplification, but is to be
      limited only by the scope of the attached claim or claims,
      including the full range of equivalency to which each element
      thereof is entitled.<br>
      <br>
      An aircraft incorporating the present invention is shown from
      various angles in FIGS. 1 through 7. The aircraft 12 has a
      fuselage 14 with a forward end 16 and an aft end 18. There is a
      tail 20 located on the aft end 18 of the fuselage 14. There are
      three wings located on either side of the fuselage 14. The forward
      wing or coanda 22 is located towards the forward end 16 of the
      fuselage 14. The upper wing 24 is located up and towards the aft
      end 18 of the fuselage 14 in relation to the coanda 22. The lower
      wing 26 is located below the upper wing 24 and slightly forward.
      The lower wing 26 is located below and toward the aft end 18 of
      the fuselage 14 in relationship to the coanda 22. The coanda 22,
      upper wing 24, and lower wing 26 are all connected at one point at
      their outer end 28.<br>
      <br>
      The coanda 22 is attached to the fuselage so that it has a
      downward rear angle. The top and bottom surfaces 30 and 32 of the
      coanda 22 are curved. Due to the Coanda effect, the air flowing
      over and under the coanda 22 will follow the curve of the top and
      bottom surfaces 30 and 32 of the coanda 22 and then flow across
      the top surface 34 of the lower wing 26.<br>
      <br>
      The top surfaces 34 and 36 of the lower and upper wings 26 and 24
      are curved while the bottom surfaces 38 and 40 of the upper and
      lower wings 24 and 26 are generally flat. The increased airflow
      across the top surface 34 of the lower wing 26 due to the coanda
      22 helps increase the density and velocity of the airflow across
      the top surface 34 of the lower wing 26. This in turn helps
      increase the lift generated by the lower wing 26. In addition, the
      upper wing 24 also generates lift.<br>
      <br>
      The aircraft can be maneuvered and controlled by manipulating
      control surfaces found on the coanda 22, upper wing 24, lower wing
      26 and tail 20. These are the types of control surfaces which are
      well known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      In an alternate embodiment, the aircraft can be maneuvered by
      changing the contour of the surfaces of the coanda 22, upper wing
      24 and lower wing 26. FIG. 8 is a perspective view of the variable
      camber aero hydrodynamic surface (VCAHS) 42. The VCAHS 42 is made
      up of a plurality of flexible cells 44. Each cell 44 is connected
      to a vacuum header 46 and a pressure header 48 via a vacuum line
      50 and a pressure line 52, respectively. The top and bottom
      surfaces 30 and 32 of the coanda 22, the top surface 34 of the
      lower wing 26, the top surface 36 of the upper wing 24, and the
      bottom surface 38 of the upper wing 24, and the bottom surface 40
      of the lower win 26 can be covered with the VCAHS 42. The contour
      of these surfaces can then be adjusted by controlling the flow to
      and from the VCAHS cells 44. By adjusting the vacuum valve 54 and
      pressure valve 56 found on each VCAHS cell 44, the change in the
      contour of the surfaces can then be used to maneuver aircraft 12.
      This enables the aircraft 12 to be maneuvered without creating any
      drag inherent with conventional controlled surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 is a cross-sectional view of an upper wing 24. The top
      surface 36 and the bottom surface 38 of the upper wing 24 are
      covered with a plurality of VCAHS cells 44. Each of the VCAHS
      cells 44 are connected to the vacuum manifold 46 via a vacuum line
      50 and the pressure manifold 48 via a pressure line 52. It should
      be noted that not all of the vacuum lines 50 and pressure lines 52
      are shown in FIG. 9, in order to provide a more understandable
      drawing. The coanda 22 and the lower wing 26 can also be covered
      by the VCAHS 42. The contour of the upper wing 24, as well as the
      coanda 22 and the lower wing 26, can then be altered by changing
      the air pressure in the VCAHS cells 44 using the vacuum and
      pressure from the vacuum manifold 46 and pressure manifold 48. Not
      all of the vacuum lines 46 and pressure lines 48 are shown in FIG.
      9, in order to provide a more legible drawing.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention can be incorporated into an aircraft which
      is propelled by any type of power plant commonly used or known in
      the art. This power plant can be mounted on the forward end 16 of
      the fuselage 14, the tail 20, or any one or more of the wings 22,
      24 and 26, as well as on the fuselage 14. The one configuration
      would be to mount an engine and propeller on the forward end 16
      and/or the tail 20. Likewise, the present invention can be
      incorporated into an aircraft which is a glider. Another
      embodiment of the present invention is to use it on an aircraft
      capable of carrying passengers and/or cargo. Yet another
      embodiment of the present invention is to use it on a model or toy
      airplane or glider of the type typically flown for recreation or
      as a hobby.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 provides a top view of the preferred engine configuration.
      FIG. 11 provides a side view of the engine configuration found in
      FIG. 10. There is an engine 58 provided on either side of the
      fuselage 14. Each engine 58 would preferably be a turbo, however,
      other types of engines known in the art could be used. Each engine
      58 has a saddle shunt 60 located just behind the outlet of the
      engine 58. The saddle shunt 60 is attached to the fuselage 14 by a
      hinge 61. When the saddle shunt 60 is in the open position, as
      shown in FIG. 12, the thrust 63 from the engines 58 flows through
      the through fuselage bypass duct 62 and out the aft end 18 of the
      aircraft 12. When the saddle shunt 60 is in the closed position,
      as shown in FIG. 13, the thrust 63 from the engines 58 are each
      diverted so that they run through the crossover duct 64 and the
      coanda duct 65. The thrust 63 running through the coanda duct 65
      exits the coanda duct 65 through an opening 67 near the trailing
      edge of the coanda 22 on the same side of the fuselage 14 as the
      engine 58 that generated the thrust 63. The portion of the thrust
      63 from each engine 58 running through the crossover ducts 64
      crosses to the opposite side of the fuselage 14 from the engine 58
      that generated the thrust 63. The thrust 63 from the crossover
      duct 64 is then injected into the coanda duct 65 where it mixes
      with the thrust 63 from the opposite engine 58 and exits out the
      opening 67 in the coanda 22 on the opposite side of the fuselage
      14. This helps provide an even lift on either side of the fuselage
      14 in the event that one of the engines 58 is lost or
      malfunctions.<br>
      <br>
      The engine configuration shown in FIGS. 10 and 11 would be capable
      of a short takeoff or landing (STOL). In order to do that there is
      a pair of thrust reversers 66 located on either side of the tail
      20 of the fuselage 14. FIG. 10 shows the top view of the aircraft
      12 with the thrust diverters 16 in the extended position. FIG. 11
      shows a side view of the aircraft 12 with the thrust diverters 66
      in the retracted position. In order to perform a short takeoff or
      landing, the saddle shunt 60 would be in the closed position as
      shown in FIG. 13. This would divert the thrust from the engines 58
      so that it ran through the crossover duct 64 and coanda duct 65,
      out the openings 67 near the trailing edge of the coandas 22 and
      over the top surface 34 of the lower wing 26. The thrust would
      then be diverted by the thrust diverters 66 located on either side
      of the aft end 18 of the fuselage 14. This allows the engines 58
      to create the lift necessary to lift the aircraft 12 off the
      ground with limited forward movement. Once the aircraft 12 was at
      the desired altitude, the thrust diverters 66 could be retracted
      into the position shown in FIG. 11 to increase the forward
      movement of the aircraft 12.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 14 shows a top view of an aircraft 12 incorporating the
      present invention in use with conventional control surfaces 68 in
      lieu of using the VCAHS 42 control surfaces. FIG. 15 shows a side
      view of an aircraft incorporating the present invention and using
      conventional control surfaces 68. It should be noted that the
      location of the control surfaces 68 shown in FIGS. 14 and 15 are
      not the sole control surfaces that could be adapted to the
      aircraft 12. The present invention could include a number of other
      conventional control surface designs.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 16 is a cross-sectional view of one embodiment of the present
      invention taken along a line indicated in FIG. 14. It has been
      simplified by not showing any of the internal structures of the
      coanda 22, upper wing 24 or lower wing 26. FIG. 16 shows the
      location of the regions of high pressure 102, the low pressure
      104, and the vortex 106. As the airspeed of the aircraft 12
      increases, the location of the vortex 106 migrates aftward
      underneath the upper wing 24. This causes change in the location
      of the high pressure under the wing and could affect the handling
      of the aircraft 12. Vortex 106 further compresses the air between
      the vortex 106 and the upper wing 24, thus increasing the density
      of the air in that region and the lift generated by the upper wing
      24.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 16 also shows one embodiment of the invention, that being a
      Kruger flap 108 located on the bottom surface 38 of the upper wing
      24 just aft of its leading edge. The Kruger flap 108 can be open
      or extended as shown in FIG. 16 to move the vortex 106 forward in
      relationship to the aircraft 12. This may be necessary to help the
      handling characteristics of the aircraft 12.<br>
      <br>
      It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various
      modifications and variations can be made in the construction,
      configuration, and/or operation of the present invention without
      departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For example,
      in the embodiments mentioned above, variations in the materials
      used to make each element of the invention may vary without
      departing from the scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended
      that the present invention cover the modifications and variations
      of the invention, provided they come within the scope of the
      appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
