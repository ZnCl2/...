        cellulose flaps like dragonfly wings in response to an
        electrical current. The material, called electroactive paper,
        may serve as wings for small flying robots. (Courtesy of
        Zoubeida Ounaies, Texas A&amp;M University. ) </span><br>
      <br>
      Researchers at Inha University in South Korea have demonstrated
      that cellulose, the main ingredient in paper, can bend in response
      to electricity. The treated cellulose is lightweight, inexpensive,
      and has low power requirements, compared with similar electrically
      active materials. The Korean researchers are now working with NASA
      to develop insect-sized, wirelessly powered flying vehicles with
      flapping paper wings. Such vehicles could fly into areas unsafe
      for humans and test for hazardous gases -- or survey the surface
      of Mars from the air. <br>
      <br>
      The researchers, led by Jaehwan Kim (http://www.eapap.com ) ,
      associate professor at the university, made the electrically
      active cellulose by dissolving paper pulp, forming it into sheets,
      and coating it with a layer of gold as an electrode. Some areas of
      the cellulose film are highly ordered, while in other areas, the
      cellulose strands are tangled like spaghetti. The movement of ions
      through the paper -- and the movement of cellulose strands
      themselves, which have negative and positively charged ends --
      causes the paper to bend in response to an electrical current. The
      bending is driven by the ordered regions, but free space in
      disordered regions allows ions to flow more freely and adds to the
      paper's ability to deform. <br>
      <br>
      Materials that move in response to electrical current are called
      piezoelectrics. Kim's cellulose is one of a new class of these
      materials, called electroactive polymers, that have generated
      excitement in the scientific community for their potential uses in
      many areas: artificial muscles, chemical sensors, visual displays,
      the moving parts of robots, and batteries. <br>
      <br>
      "The value of electrically active paper is that it's lightweight
      and has a high deflection [movement] at low voltage" compared to
      traditional electroactive polymers, says Sang Choi, senior
      research scientist at the NASA Langley Research Center. When a
      small voltage is applied to Kim's paper, it can move a relatively
      large distance; for instance, in experiments, the tip of a
      30-millimeter-long strip of electroactive paper was displaced 4.2
      millimeters. Indeed, the strength of the electric field required
      to move the tip of the paper to its maximum displacement is one to
      two orders of magnitude less than is required by other
      electroactive polymers. And the paper can change shape quickly,
      moving back and forth as fast as once every 0.06 seconds. <br>
      <br>
      NASA's Choi is interested in Kim's material because, compared with
      conventional piezoelectrics and other electroactive polymers, it
      is very lightweight and requires very little power. Together, Choi
      and Kim are designing a small flying vehicle with cellulose wings
      powered by ambient microwaves. Choi says NASA expects such robots
      to play an important role in its long-term exploratory missions.
      For example, small robots with moving parts made of paper or other
      materials might fly low over the Martian surface to monitor its
      topology. Still, it's not clear that cellulose can withstand the
      extreme conditions in outer space. --- <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> --- This paper
      introduces an electroactive paper (EAPap) prepared with cellulose
      and chitosan films. The fabrication process, performance test, and
      the effect of acetic acid dosage of the EAPap were investigated.
      For the fabrication of cellulose EAPap, cellulose fibers were
      dissolved into a solution using N,N-dimethylacetamide and lithium
      chloride. The solution was cast and immersed in water to form a
      cellulose film, followed by casting chitosan/acetic acid and
      glycerol aqueous solutions on the cellulose film. A bending EAPap
      actuator was made by depositing thin gold electrodes on both sides
      of the cellulose film. The bending displacement of the EAPap
      actuators was evaluated with respect to voltage, frequency,
      humidity, and acetic acid dosage. An optimum mole ratio of the
      acetic acid and chitosan structure unit was found. Also, the
      effects of chitosan and acetic acid on the actuation behavior of
      the cellulose-chitosan laminated films were investigated.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract --</span> This
      investigation deals with the synthesis, characterization and
      actuation behavior of conductive polyaniline-coated electroactive
      paper actuators. The actuator is made by electrochemical
      deposition of conductive polyaniline on a cellulose paper. The aim
      of the investigation was to improve the bending displacement of
      electroactive paper actuators. The displacement outputs of the
      actuators show that a trilayer is better than a bilayer
      configuration. The nature of the dopant ion used in the
      electro-generation affects the performance. A change in humidity
      plays a vital role in actuation performance of the actuators.
      Comparing the performance of electroactive paper actuators with
      and without a conductive polyaniline coating, the coating improves
      the displacement output threefold. Finally, the actuation
      principle mechanism is addressed. <br>

      Paper aeroplanes could fly by flapping their wings thanks to smart
      paper that bends when bathed in an electric field. The material
      raises the prospect of swarms of tiny lightweight aircraft
      carrying sensors that act as the eyes and ears of a surveillance
      network.<br>
      <br>
      Electroactive paper (EAPap) is ordinary cotton-based paper,
      similar to the material used to make US bank notes, coated on each
      side with a thin layer of gold. The smart paper has been made by
      researchers from Inha University, South Korea, and Texas A &amp; M
      University, US<br>
      <br>
      Unlike ordinary paper, EAPap bends as a result of two effects
      working together. When a voltage is applied, the gold coating on
      one side of the paper becomes a positively charged while the other
      side becomes negatively charged. Sodium ions in the paper move
      towards the negative electrode, taking water molecules with them.
      This makes that side of the paper expand, causing it to bend.<br>
      <br>
      At the same time, the paper's matrix of cellulose fibres have
      piezoelectric properties and change shape when a voltage is
      applied. This increases the bending. The research team have even
      improved the paper's piezoelectric properties even further by
      adding carbon nanotubes to the paper mix.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Artificial






        muscle</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The team has made strips of paper 40 millimetres long and 0.3 mm
      thick that bend by 10 mm, producing a force of more than 10
      micronewtons. That is enough to lift about 1 gram.<br>
      <br>
      "This new discovery of cellulose paper as a smart material gives
      us a lot of possibilities that we can play around with," Jaehwan
      Kim, who researches smart materials at Inha University.<br>
      <br>
      Kim's team is interested in using the material as a kind of
      artificial muscle for mobile robots. He hopes to power the robots
      remotely by fitting them with a simple electronic device called a
      "rectenna". This converts the energy of a microwave beam into a
      small voltage.<br>
      Flying sensors<br>
      <br>
      "A normal paper aeroplane just flies as it is," says Jaehwan Kim.
      "By sending microwaves we could control its wings and make it
      glide in a certain path."<br>
      <br>
      Another possibility is a robot in the form of a rippling sheet of
      EAPap that crawls along the ground. As well as working on boosting
      the power of EAPap, the Korean team is collaborating with NASA to
      develop the rectenna system to drive it.<br>
      <br>
      "This new material opens up a whole range of possible
      applications," says Djamel Azzi, a robotics researchers at
      Portsmouth University, UK. "Lightweight flying robots would be
      ideal for surveillance - they could carry cameras, microphones or
      other sensors around."<br>

      Cellulose based Electro-Active Paper (EAPap) has been reported as
      a smart material that has merits in terms of lightweight, dry
      condition, biodegradability, sustainability, large displacement
      output and low actuation voltage. However, its actuator
      performance is sensitive to humidity: its maximum bending
      performance was shown at high humidity condition. To overcome this
      drawback, we introduce an EAPap made with cellulose and chitosan
      blend. Cellulose-chitosan blend films with varied mixing ratio
      were prepared by dissolving the polymers in trifluoroacetic acid
      as a co-solvent followed by spincoating onto glass substrates. A
      bending EAPap actuator is made by depositing thin gold electrodes
      on both sides of the cellulose-chitosan films. The performance of
      the EAPap actuator is evaluated in terms of free bending
      displacement with respect to the actuation frequency, activation
      voltage, humidity level and content of chitosan. The actuation
      principle is also discussed. <br>

      Abstract&nbsp; In an earlier work we reported the discovery of
      cellulose as a smart material that can be used in sensors and
      actuators. While the cellulose-based Electro-Active Paper (EAPap)
      actuator has many merits – lightweight, dry condition,
      biodegradability, sustainability, large displacement output and
      low actuation voltage – its performance is sensitive to humidity.
      We report here on an EAPap made with a cellulose and sodium
      alginate that produces its maximum displacement at a lower
      humidity level than the earlier one. To fabricate this EAPap, we
      dissolved cellulose fibers into a aqueous solution of NaOH/urea.
      Sodium alginate (0, 5 or 10% by weight) was then added to this
      cellulose solution. The solution was cast into a sheet and
      hydrolyzed to form a wet cellulose-sodium alginate blend film.
      After drying, a bending EAPap actuator was made by depositing thin
      gold electrodes on both sides of it. The performance of the EAPap
      actuator was then evaluated in terms of free displacement and
      blocked force with respect to the actuation frequency, activation
      voltage and content of sodium alginate. The actuation principle is
      also discussed. <br>

      </span>-- This paper introduces an electroactive paper (EAPap)
      prepared with cellulose and chitosan films. The fabrication
      process, performance test, and the effect of acetic acid dosage of
      the EAPap were investigated. For the fabrication of cellulose
      EAPap, cellulose fibers were dissolved into a solution using
      N,N-dimethylacetamide and lithium chloride. The solution was cast
      and immersed in water to form a cellulose film, followed by
      casting chitosan/acetic acid and glycerol aqueous solutions on the
      cellulose film. A bending EAPap actuator was made by depositing
      thin gold electrodes on both sides of the cellulose film. The
      bending displacement of the EAPap actuators was evaluated with
      respect to voltage, frequency, humidity, and acetic acid dosage.
      An optimum mole ratio of the acetic acid and chitosan structure
      unit was found. Also, the effects of chitosan and acetic acid on
      the actuation behavior of the cellulose-chitosan laminated films
      were investigated.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Actuators
      based on cellulose paper with conducting polymer (CP-EAPap) as an
      electrode material were constructed. The bilayer and trilayer
      types of actuators were fabricated by depositing conducting
      polypyrrole on one side and two sides of cellophane paper
      respectively, which was previously gold coated. By varying the
      deposition time, the electrode thickness was manipulated. The
      performance of these two types of actuators was compared with
      respect to humidity changes and thickness variation. The electrode
      thickness plays a key role in the displacement behavior of these
      types of actuators. The best performance at higher humidity is
      also characteristic of CP-EAPap actuators. The possible mechanism
      of actuation is addressed in this paper. <br>

      -- The causes of Au-electrode damage to an electroactive paper
      (EAPap) actuator coated with Au and polypyrrole (PPy) were
      investigated with various electric field frequencies and
      strengths. The resonance frequency of 3.5 Hz was obtained for 3
      and 4 V. Electric field frequencies below (2 Hz) the resonance
      frequency yielded a faster bending displacement reduction than
      those of the higher resonance frequency. High electric field
      strength (4 V) shows a faster reduction of bending displacement
      than lower field strength (3 V). The degree of Au-electrode damage
      after a certain period of actuation is shown in field emission
      scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images. The electric field
      strength and frequency and bending displacement reduction were
      found to be closely related to the degree of Au-electrode damage.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- We studied the
      effect of chitosan blending on the electrical property of
      chitosan-blended cellulose electroactive paper (EAPap) under
      different humidity conditions. As the chitosan blending ratio
      increased, the real part of the dielectric constant of
      chitosan-blended cellulose EAPap increased while the dielectric
      loss factor decreased. From the curve fitting of the measured data
      using an electrode polarization model, it was found that
      increasing the chitosan ratio in the EAPap might promote a
      decrease in the relaxation time of the EAPap, resulting in an
      increase of the ion mobility and dc conductivity. Over 30% of the
      chitosan blending ratio, a gradual increment of the ion mobility
      of the EAPap was observed at 40% relative humidity, while a
      quadratic increment of the mobility was found at 60% relative
      humidity condition. This kind of ion-mobility-enhanced cellulose
      EAPap can be used not only for bending actuators but also for
      medical applications such as blood clotting patches.<br>
