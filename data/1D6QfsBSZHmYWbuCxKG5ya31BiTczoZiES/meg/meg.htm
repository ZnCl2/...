          12:11:01 -0500</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dear Gary,</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The five inventors of the
          MEG are as frustrated as anyone else! We’ve sunk our money and
          enormous time in this effort for some 10 to 12 years. So we
          have our own money and sweat and work where our mouth is. It
          hasn’t been funded by selling stock to the naïve public etc.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are not out of
          engineering development of the MEG yet, and to get through it
          and into full production engineering would require about $10
          to $12 million --- money we personally do not have. So far,
          we’ve not obtained the necessary financing. We did sign one
          financial deal, only to have our last working demonstrator
          promptly destroyed by the new folks in three days, against all
          our instructions. So we had to legally declare that agreement
          null and void.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Engineering the MEG, it
          should be clear, IS NOT JUST NORMAL ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING.
          We’ve made that point many times, and specified exactly how
          the machine works. Yet the biggest problem is that almost all
          of the venture capitalists are either EEs themselves, or
          employ as their second or third in command an EE, often with a
          Ph.D. in EE. And there the problem is that one cannot get
          across to the EEs that the MEG is not just a transformer, and
          that E-field radiations really do arise freely from the space
          just outside the core, re-radiating back into the core with a
          multitude of absorbed and reradiated signals of all sorts of
          phases. Unless this dense signal environment and its phasing
          is carefully adjusted so that the phases are generally
          additive, COP &gt; 1.0 is not possible, obviously, since it
          means no effective <i>NET</i> energy input occurs from the
          activated external environment, even though <i>LOTS</i> of
          excess energy is being radiated back into the MEG. One doesn’t
          seek and cannot use just a "noise" energy input from that
          external environment! One must have some coherence, so that
          the external environment inputs some <i>usable</i> free EM
          energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So to go from the business
          of slow, painful hand adjustment of the phasing to automatic
          optimization is certainly a "doable", but <i>it is not a
            simple EE problem</i>. In aerospace, our team (who are all
          aerospace engineers with substantial and lengthy experience in
          nonlinear systems) has worked for several decades on such
          problems, and we do know how to solve it and finish the
          product so that it’s ready for full production engineering.
          Bluntly, electrical engineers <i>do not</i> know how to solve
          the problem and finish the unit, unless they’ve studied and
          worked well beyond electrical power engineering. The MEG’s
          operation cannot even be modeled in the standard CEM/EE model.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But the EEs with venture
          capitalists (and some of our major national laboratories also,
          by the way) don’t seem to be able to comprehend something that
          is already well-known in aerospace, in chaotic systems work,
          and in dense signal environments work.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let me speak very plainly.
          That lack of understanding of such systems, and the use of a
          horribly fouled old electrical engineering model in our power
          engineering, is why nationally we have a horribly vulnerable
          centralized electrical power distribution and "control" system
          that violates almost every principle of multiloop
          servomechanism control theory in the book. It isn’t just an EE
          problem; it’s a multiloop servomechanism control problem. Our
          national centralized electrical power system is so fragile and
          so vulnerable that even a small portable EMP weapon (a
          "shooter", as commonly known in the trade), really good
          hackers, and many other simple things can keep it surging out
          of control and collapsing indefinitely with ridiculous ease.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If one wishes a more
          accurate grasp of the energy situation, see Matt Simmons’
          presentations downloadable from the Simmons International
          website. There you get the truth, not political fiction, and
          by one of the firms that widely funds energy projects
          worldwide. Further, a single scalar interferometer can lay the
          entire system down at will, and keep it down forever. Since
          even the Japanese Yakuza have such interferometers and have
          been using them since early 1990 to engineer the weather over
          our heads (see Scott Stevens’ website for a meteorologist’s
          beautiful presentation of the resulting weather engineering
          phenomena), obviously somewhere along the line they are going
          to devote one of those interferometers to downing the entire
          U.S. electrical power system and keeping it down. And when
          that happens, there isn’t going to be any functioning
          centralized electric power in the U.S. from then on, period.
          Easy to surmise the catastrophic economic collapse that then
          will ensue, paralyzing and defeating the United States without
          a single missile, nuclear bomber, nuclear submarine, etc.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our fellows do know about
          scalar interferometers, weather engineering, and the works ---
          but they keep it so closely locked up that most of our
          decision makers are not aware of it, even though Secretary of
          Defense Cohen was briefed on it and publicly confirmed such
          weapons in April 1997. Meanwhile, our present national power
          system and national energy policy are just a great disaster
          waiting to happen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We do continue in our search
          for the necessary funding, with a financial arrangement we can
          tolerate, and with a financial partner who can understand that
          he cannot just run in some good EEs and build a MEG and turn
          them out like pretzels. Or in fact that cannot be done with
          any other legitimate COP&gt;1.0 system, without the proper
          completion of Engineering Development and then Production
          Engineering.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We think we are again
          getting close to obtaining the necessary capitalization for
          the MEG, but will just have to wait and see how it turns out
          this time around.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An electromagnetic generator
          without moving parts includes a permanent magnet and a
          magnetic core including first and second magnetic paths. A
          first input coil and a first output coil extend around
          portions of the first magnetic path, while a second input coil
          and a second output coil extend around portions of the second
          magnetic path. The input coils are alternatively pulsed to
          provide induced current pulses in the output coils. Driving
          electrical current through each of the input coils reduces a
          level of flux from the permanent magnet within the magnet path
          around which the input coil extends. In an alternative
          embodiment of an electromagnetic generator, the magnetic core
          includes annular spaced-apart plates, with posts and permanent
          magnets extending in an alternating fashion between the
          plates. An output coil extends around each of these posts.
          Input coils extending around portions of the plates are pulsed
          to cause the induction of current within the output coils.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention relates to a
          magnetic generator used to produce electrical power without
          moving parts, and, more particularly, to such a device having
          a capability, when operating, of producing electrical power
          without an external application of input power through input
          coils.</font> </p>

            Related Art ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The patent literature
          describes a number of magnetic generators, each of which
          includes a permanent magnet, two magnetic paths external to
          the permanent magnet, each of which extends between the
          opposite poles of the permanent magnet, switching means for
          causing magnetic flux to flow alternately along each of the
          two magnetic paths, and one or more output coils in which
          current is induced to flow by means of changes in the magnetic
          field within the device. These devices operate in accordance
          with an extension of Faraday's Law, indicating that an
          electrical current is induced within a conductor within a
          changing magnetic field, even if the source of the magnetic
          field is stationary.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A method for switching
          magnetic flux to flow predominantly along either of two
          magnetic paths between opposite poles of a permanent magnet is
          described as a "flux transfer" principle by R. J. Radus in
          Engineer's Digest, Jul. 23, 1963. This principle is used to
          exert a powerful magnetic force at one end of both the north
          and south poles and a very low force at the other end, without
          being used in the construction of a magnetic generator. This
          effect can be caused mechanically, by keeper movement, or
          electrically, by driving electrical current through one or
          more control windings extending around elongated versions of
          the pole pieces 14. Several devices using this effect are
          described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,165,723, 3,228,013, and
          3,316,514, which are incorporated herein by reference.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another step toward the
          development of a magnetic generator is described in U.S. Pat.
          No. 3,368,141, which is incorporated herein by reference, as a
          device including a permanent magnet in combination with a
          transformer having first and second windings about a core,
          with two paths for magnetic flux leading from each pole of the
          permanent magnet to either end of the core, so that, when an
          alternating current induces magnetic flux direction changes in
          the core, the magnetic flux from the permanent magnet is
          automatically directed through the path which corresponds with
          the direction taken by the magnetic flux through the core due
          to the current. In this way, the magnetic flux is intensified.
          This device can be used to improve the power factor of a
          typically inductively loaded alternating current circuit.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Other patents describe
          magnetic generators in which electrical current from one or
          more output coils is described as being made available to
          drive a load, in the more conventional manner of a generator.
          For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,006,401, which is incorporated
          herein by reference, describes an electromagnetic generator
          including permanent magnet and a core member, in which the
          magnetic flux flowing from the magnet in the core member is
          rapidly alternated by switching to generate an alternating
          current in a winding on the core member. The device includes a
          permanent magnet and two separate magnetic flux circuit paths
          between the north and south poles of the magnet. Each of the
          circuit paths includes two switching means for alternately
          opening and closing the circuit paths, generating an
          alternating current in a winding on the core member. Each of
          the switching means includes a switching magnetic circuit
          intersecting the circuit path, with the switching magnetic
          circuit having a coil through which current is driven to
          induce magnetic flux to saturate the circuit path extending to
          the permanent magnet. Power to drive these coils is derived
          directly from the output of a continuously applied alternating
          current source. What is needed is an electromagnetic generator
          not requiring the application of such a current source.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">U.S. Pat. No. 4,077,001,
          which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a
          magnetic generator, or dc/dc converter, comprising a permanent
          magnet having spaced-apart poles and a permanent magnetic
          field extending between the poles of the magnet. A
          variable-reluctance core is disposed in the field in fixed
          relation to the magnet and the reluctance of the core is
          varied to cause the pattern of lines of force of the magnetic
          field to shift. An output conductor is disposed in the field
          in fixed relation to the magnet and is positioned to be cut by
          the shifting lines of permanent magnetic force so that a
          voltage is induced in the conductor. The magnetic flux is
          switched between alternate paths by means of switching coils
          extending around portions of the core, with the flow of
          current being alternated between these switching coils by
          means of a pair of transistors driven by the outputs of a
          flip-flop. The input to the flip flop is driven by an
          adjustable frequency oscillator. Power for this drive circuit
          is supplied through an additional, separate power source. What
          is needed is a magnetic generator not requiring the
          application of such a power source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">U.S. Pat. No. 4,904,926,
          which is incorporated herein by reference, describes another
          magnetic generator using the motion of a magnetic field. The
          device includes an electrical winding defining a magnetically
          conductive zone having bases at each end, the winding
          including elements for the removing of an induced current
          therefrom. The generator further includes two pole magnets,
          each having a first and a second pole, each first pole in
          magnetic communication with one base of the magnetically
          conductive zone. The generator further includes a third pole
          magnet, the third pole magnet oriented intermediately of the
          first poles of the two pole electromagnets, the third pole
          magnet having a magnetic axis substantially transverse to an
          axis of the magnetically conductive zone, the third magnet
          having a pole nearest to the conductive zone and in magnetic
          attractive relationship to the first poles of the two pole
          electromagnets, in which the first poles thereof are like
          poles. Also included in the generator are elements, in the
          form of windings, for cyclically reversing the magnetic
          polarities of the electromagnets. These reversing means,
          through a cyclical change in the magnetic polarities of the
          electromagnets, cause the magnetic flux lines associated with
          the magnetic attractive relationship between the first poles
          of the electromagnets and the nearest pole of the third magnet
          to correspondingly reverse, causing a wiping effect across the
          magnetically conductive zone, as lines of magnetic flux swing
          between respective first poles of the two electromagnets,
          thereby inducing electron movement within the output windings
          and thus generating a flow of current within the output
          windings.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">U.S. Pat. No. 5,221,892,
          which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a
          magnetic generator in the form of a direct current flux
          compression transformer including a magnetic envelope having
          poles defining a magnetic axis and characterized by a pattern
          of magnetic flux lines in polar symmetry about the axis. The
          magnetic flux lines are spatially displaced relative to the
          magnetic envelope using control elements which are
          mechanically stationary relative to the core. Further provided
          are inductive elements which are also mechanically stationary
          relative to the magnetic envelope. Spatial displacement of the
          flux relative to the inductive elements causes a flow of
          electrical current. Further provided are magnetic flux valves
          which provide for the varying of the magnetic reluctance to
          create a time domain pattern of respectively enhanced and
          decreased magnetic reluctance across the magnetic valves, and,
          thereby, across the inductive elements.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Other patents describe
          devices using superconductive elements to cause movement of
          the magnetic flux. These devices operate in accordance with
          the Meissner effect, which describes the expulsion of magnetic
          flux from the interior of a superconducting structure as the
          structure undergoes the transition to a superconducting phase.
          For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,821, which is incorporated
          herein by reference, describes an electric power generating
          device including a bundle of conductors which are placed in a
          magnetic field generated by north and south pole pieces of a
          permanent magnet. The magnetic field is shifted back and forth
          through the bundle of conductors by a pair of thin films of
          superconductive material. One of the thin films is placed in
          the superconducting state while the other thin film is in a
          non-superconducting state. As the states are cyclically
          reversed between the two films, the magnetic field is
          deflected back and forth through the bundle of conductors.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">U.S. Pat. No. 5,327,015,
          which is incorporated herein by reference, describes an
          apparatus for producing an electrical impulse comprising a
          tube made of superconducting material, a source of magnetic
          flux mounted about one end of the tube, a means, such as a
          coil, for intercepting the flux mounted along the tube, and a
          means for changing the temperature of the superconductor
          mounted about the tube. As the tube is progressively made
          superconducting, the magnetic field is trapped within the
          tube, creating an electrical impulse in the means for
          intercepting. A reversal of the superconducting state produces
          a second pulse.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">None of the patented devices
          described above use a portion of the electrical power
          generated within the device to power the reversing means used
          to change the path of magnetic flux. Thus, like conventional
          rotary generators, these devices require a steady input of
          power, which may be in the form of electrical power driving
          the reversing means of one of these magnetic generators or the
          torque driving the rotor of a conventional rotary generator.
          Yet, the essential function of the magnetic portion of an
          electrical generator is simply to switch magnetic fields in
          accordance with precise timing. In most conventional
          applications of magnetic generators, the voltage is switched
          across coils, creating magnetic fields in the coils which are
          used to override the fields of permanent magnets, so that a
          substantial amount of power must be furnished to the generator
          to power the switching means, reducing the efficiency of the
          generator.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Recent advances in magnetic
          material, which have particularly been described by Robert C.
          O'Handley in Modern Magnetic Materials, Principles and
          Applications, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp. 456-468,
          provide nanocrystalline magnetic alloys, which are
          particularly well suited forth rapid switching of magnetic
          flux. These alloys are primarily composed of crystalline
          grains, or crystallites, each of which has at least one
          dimension of a few nanometers. Nanocrystalline materials may
          be made by heat-treating amorphous alloys which form
          precursors for the nanocrystalline materials, to which
          insoluble elements, such as copper, are added to promote
          massive nucleation, and to which stable, refractory alloying
          materials, such as niobium or tantalum carbide are added to
          inhibit grain growth. Most of the volume of nanocrystalline
          alloys is composed of randomly distributed crystallites having
          dimensions of about 2-40 nm. These crystallites are nucleated
          and grown from an amorphous phase, with insoluble elements
          being rejected during the process of crystallite growth. In
          magnetic terms, each crystallite is a single-domain particle.
          The remaining volume of nanocrystalline alloys is made up of
          an amorphous phase in the form of grain boundaries having a
          thickness of about 1 nm.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Magnetic materials having
          particularly useful properties are formed from an amorphous
          Co--Nb--B (cobalt-niobium-boron) alloy having near-zero
          magnetostriction and relatively strong magnetization, as well
          as good mechanical strength and corrosion resistance. A
          process of annealing this material can be varied to change the
          size of crystallites formed in the material, with a resulting
          strong effect on DC coercivity. The precipitation of
          nanocrystallites also enhances AC performance of the otherwise
          amorphous alloys.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Other magnetic materials are
          formed using iron-rich amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys,
          which generally show larger magnetization that the alloys
          based on cobalt. Such materials are, for example,
          Fe--B--Si--Nb--Cu (iron-boron-silicon-niobium-copper) alloys.
          While the permeability of iron-rich amorphous alloys is
          limited by their relatively large levels of magnetostriction,
          the formation of a nanocrystalline material from such an
          amorphous alloy dramatically reduces this level of
          magnetostriction, favoring easy magnetization.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Advances have also been made
          in the development of materials for permanent magnets,
          particularly in the development of materials including rare
          earth elements. Such materials include samarium cobalt,
          SmCo.sub.5, which is used to form a permanent magnet material
          having the highest resistance to demagnetization of any known
          material. Other magnetic materials are made, for example,
          using combinations of iron, neodymium, and boron.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Summary of the Invention
            ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is a first objective of
          the present invention to provide a magnetic generator which a
          need for an external power source during operation of the
          generator is eliminated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is a second objective of
          the present invention to provide a magnetic generator in which
          a magnetic flux path is changed without a need to overpower a
          magnetic field to change its direction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is a third objective of
          the present invention to provide a magnetic generator in which
          the generation of electricity is accomplished without moving
          parts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the apparatus of the
          present invention, the path of the magnetic flux from a
          permanent magnet is switched in a manner not requiring the
          overpowering of the magnetic fields. Furthermore, a process of
          self-initiated iterative switching is used to switch the
          magnetic flux from the permanent magnet between alternate
          magnetic paths within the apparatus, with the power to operate
          the iterative switching being provided through a control
          circuit consisting of components known to use low levels of
          power. With self-switching, a need for an external power
          source during operation of the generator is eliminated, with a
          separate power source, such as a battery, being used only for
          a very short time during start-up of the generator.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to a first aspect
          of the present invention, an electromagnetic generator is
          provided, including a permanent magnet, a magnetic core, first
          and second input coils, first and second output coils, and a
          switching circuit. The permanent magnet has magnetic poles at
          opposite ends. The magnetic core includes a first magnetic
          path, around which the first input and output coils extend,
          and a second magnetic path, around which the second input and
          output coils extend, between opposite ends of the permanent
          magnet. The switching circuit drives electrical current
          alternately through the first and second input coils. The
          electrical current driven through the first input oil causes
          the first input coil to produce a magnetic field opposing a
          concentration of magnetic flux from the permanent magnet
          within the first magnetic path. The electrical current driven
          through the second input coil causes the second input coil to
          produce a magnetic field opposing a concentration of magnetic
          flux from the permanent magnet within the second magnetic
          path.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to another aspect
          of the present invention, an electromagnetic generator is
          provided, including a magnetic core, a plurality of permanent
          magnets, first and second pluralities of input coils, a
          plurality of output coils, and a switching circuit. The
          magnetic core includes a pair of spaced-apart plates, each of
          which has a central aperture, and first and second pluralities
          of posts extending between the spaced-apart plates. The
          permanent magnets each extend between the pair of spaced apart
          plates. Each permanent magnet has magnetic poles at opposite
          ends, with the magnetic fields of all the permanent magnets
          being aligned to extend in a common direction. Each input coil
          extends around a portion of a plate within the spaced-apart
          plates, between a post and a permanent magnet. An output coil
          extends around each post. The switching circuit drives
          electrical current alternately through the first and second
          pluralities of input coils. Electrical current driven through
          each input coil in the first plurality of input coils causes
          an increase in magnetic flux within each post within the first
          plurality of posts from permanent magnets on each side of the
          post and a decrease in magnetic flux within each post within
          the second plurality of posts from permanent magnets on each
          side of the post. Electrical current driven through each input
          coil in the second plurality of input coils causes a decrease
          in magnetic flux within each post within the first plurality
          of posts from permanent magnets on each side of the post and
          an increase in magnetic flux within each post within the
          second plurality of posts from permanent magnets on each side
          of the post.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Detailed Description of
            the Invention ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>
          is a partly schematic front elevation of an electromagnetic
          generator 10, built in accordance with a first embodiment of
          the present invention to include a permanent magnet 12 to
          supply input lines of magnetic flux moving from the north pole
          14 of the magnet 12 outward into magnetic flux path core
          material 16. The flux path core material 16 is configured to
          form a right magnetic path 18 and a left magnetic path 20,
          both of which extend externally between the north pole 14 and
          the south pole 22 of the magnet 12. The electromagnetic
          generator 10 is driven by means of a switching and control
          circuit 24, which alternately drives electrical current
          through a right input coil 26 and a left input coil 28. These
          input coils 26, 28 each extend around a portion of the core
          material 16, with the right input coil 26 surrounding a
          portion of the right magnetic path 18 and with the left input
          coil 28 surrounding a portion of the left magnetic path 20. A
          right output coil 29 also surrounds a portion of the right
          magnetic path 18, while a left output coil 30 surrounds a
          portion of the left magnetic path 20.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In accordance with a
          preferred version of the present invention, the switching and
          control circuit 24 and the input coils 26, 28 are arranged so
          that, when the right input coil 26 is energized, a north
          magnetic pole is present at its left end 31, the end closest
          to the north pole 14 of the permanent magnet 12, and so that,
          when the left input coil 28 is energized, a north magnetic
          pole is present at its right end 32, which is also the end
          closest to the north pole 14 of the permanent magnet 12. Thus,
          when the right input coil 26 is magnetized, magnetic flux from
          the permanent magnet 12 is repelled from extending through the
          right input coil 26. Similarly, when the left input coil 28 is
          magnetized, magnetic flux from the permanent magnet 12 is
          repelled from extending through the left input coil 28.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus, it is seen that
          driving electrical current through the right input coil 26
          opposes a concentration of flux from the permanent magnet 12
          within the right magnetic path 18, causing at least some of
          this flux to be transferred to the left magnetic path 20. On
          the other hand, driving electrical current through the left
          input coil 28 opposes a concentration of flux from the
          permanent magnet 12 within the left magnetic path 20, causing
          at least some of this flux to be transferred to the right
          magnetic path 18.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While in the example of <a
            href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, the input coils 26, 28 are placed
          on either side of the north pole of the permanent magnet 12,
          being arranged along a portion of the core 16 extending from
          the north pole of the permanent magnet 12, it is understood
          that the input coils 26, 28 could as easily be alternately
          placed on either side of the south pole of the permanent
          magnet 12, being arranged along a portion of the core 16
          extending from the south pole of the permanent magnet 12, with
          the input coils 26, 28 being wired to form, when energized,
          magnetic fields having south poles directed toward the south
          pole of the permanent magnet 12. In general, the input coils
          26, 28 are arranged along the magnetic core on either side of
          an end of the permanent magnet forming a first pole, such as a
          north pole, with the input coils being arranged to produce
          magnetic fields of the polarity of the first pole directed
          toward the first pole of the permanent magnet.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Further in accordance with a
          preferred version of the present invention, the input coils
          26, 28 are never driven with so much current that the core
          material 16 becomes saturated. Driving the core material 16 to
          saturation means that subsequent increases in input current
          can occur without effecting corresponding changes in magnetic
          flux, and therefore that input power can be wasted. In this
          way, the apparatus of the present invention is provided with
          an advantage in terms of the efficient use of input power over
          the apparatus of U.S. Pat. No. 4,000,401, in which a portion
          both ends of each magnetic path is driven to saturation to
          block flux flow. In the electromagnetic generator 10, the
          switching of current flow within the input coils 26, 28 does
          not need to be sufficient to stop the flow of flux in one of
          the magnetic paths 18, 20 while promoting the flow of magnetic
          flux in the other magnetic path. The electromagnetic generator
          10 works by changing the flux pattern; it does not need to be
          completely switched from one side to another.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Experiments have determined
          that this configuration is superior, in terms of the
          efficiency of using power within the input coils 26, 28 to
          generate electrical power within the output coils 29, 30, to
          the alternative of arranging input coils and the circuits
          driving them so that flux from the permanent magnet is driven
          through the input coils as they are energized. This
          arrangement of the present invention provides a significant
          advantage over the prior-art methods shown, for example, in
          U.S. Pat. No. 4,077,001, in which the magnetic flux is driven
          through the energized coils.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The configuration of the
          present invention also has an advantage over the prior-art
          configurations of U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,368,141 and 4,077,001 in
          that the magnetic flux is switched between two alternate
          magnetic paths 18, 20 with only a single input coil 26, 28
          surrounding each of the alternate magnetic paths. The
          configurations of U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,368,141 and 4,077,001 each
          require two input coils on each of the magnetic paths. This
          advantage of the present invention is significant both in the
          simplification of hardware and in increasing the efficiency of
          power conversion.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The right output coil 29 is
          electrically connected to a rectifier and filter 33, having an
          output driven through a regulator 34, which provides an output
          voltage adjustable through the use of a potentiometer 35. The
          output of the linear regulator 34 is in turn provided as an
          input to a sensing and switching circuit 36. Under start up
          conditions, the sensing and switching circuit 36 connects the
          switching and control circuit 24 to an external power source
          38, which is, for example, a starting battery. After the
          electromagnetic generator 10 is properly started, the sensing
          and switching circuit 36 senses that the voltage available
          from regulator 34 has reached a predetermined level, so that
          the power input to the switching and control circuit 24 is
          switched from the external power source 38 to the output of
          regulator 34. After this switching occurs, the electromagnetic
          generator 10 continues to operate without an application of
          external power.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The left output coil 30 is
          electrically connected to a rectifier and filter 40, the
          output of which is connected to a regulator 42, the output
          voltage of which is adjusted by means of a potentiometer 43.
          The output of the regulator 42 is in turn connected to an
          external load 44.</font> </p>

          a flip-flop 54, with the Q and Q' outputs of the flip-flop 54
          being connected through driver circuits 56, 58 to power FETS
          60, 62 so that the input coils 26, 28 are alternately driven.
          In accordance with a preferred version of the present
          invention, the voltage V applied to the coils 26, 28 through
          the FETS 60, 62 is derived from the output of the sensing and

          is a schematic view of a second version of the switching and
          control circuit 24. In this version, an oscillator 70 drives
          the clock input of a flip-flop 72, with the Q and Q' outputs
          of the flip-flop 72 being connected to serve as triggers for
          one-shots 74, 76. The outputs of the one-shots 74, 76 are in
          turn connected through driver circuits 78, 80 to drive FETS
          82, 84, so that the input coils 26, 28 are alternately driven
          with pulses shorter in duration than the Q and Q' outputs of
          the flip flop 72.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>
          is a graphical view of the signals driving the gates of FETS
          82, 84 of FIG. 4, with the voltage of the signal driving the
          gate of FET 82 being represented by line 86, and with the
          voltage of the signal driving the gate of FET 84 being
          represented by line 88.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring again to <a
            href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, power is generated in the right
          output coil 29 only when the level of magnetic flux is
          changing in the right magnetic path 18, and in the left output
          coil 30 only when the level of magnetic flux is changing in
          the left magnetic path 20. It is therefore desirable to
          determine, for a specific magnetic generator configuration,
          the width of a pulse providing the most rapid practical change
          in magnetic flux, and then to provide this pulse width either
          by varying the frequency of the oscillator 50 of the apparatus
          of <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, so that this pulse width is
          provided with the signals shown in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>,
          or by varying the time constant of the one-shots 74, 76 of <a
            href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>, so that this pulse width is
          provided by the signals of <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> at a
          lower oscillator frequency. In this way, the input coils are
          not left on longer than necessary. When either of the input
          coils is left on for a period of time longer than that
          necessary to produce the change in flux direction, power is
          being wasted through heating within the input coil without
          additional generation of power in the corresponding output
          coil.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A number of experiments have
          been conducted to determine the adequacy of an electromagnetic
          generator built as the generator 10 in <a href="#fig1">Figure
            1</a> to produce power both to drive the switching and
          control logic, providing power to the input coils 26, 28, and
          to drive an external load 44. In the configuration used in
          this experiment, the input coils 26, 28 had 40 turns of
          18-gauge copper wire, and the output coils 29, 30 had 450
          turns of 18-gauge copper wire. The permanent magnet 12 had a
          height of 40 mm (1.575 in. between its north and south poles,
          in the direction of arrow 89, a width of 25.4 mm (1.00 in.),
          in the direction of arrow 90, and in the other direction, a
          depth of 38.1 mm (1.50 in.). The core 16 had a height, in the
          direction of arrow 89, of 90 mm (3.542 in.), a width, in the
          direction of arrow 90, of 135 mm (5.315 in.) and a depth of 70
          mm (2.756 in.). The core 16 had a central hole with a height,
          in the direction of arrow 89, of 40 mm (1.575 mm) to
          accommodate the magnet 12, and a width, in the direction of
          arrow 90, of 85 mm (3.346 in.). The core 16 was fabricated of
          two "C"-shaped halves, joined at lines 92, to accommodate the
          winding of output coils 29, 30 and input coils 26, 28 over the
          core material.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The core material was a
          laminated iron-based magnetic alloy sold by Honeywell as
          METGLAS Magnetic Alloy 2605SA1. The magnet material was a
          combination of iron, neodymium, and boron.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The input coils 26, 28 were
          driven at an oscillator frequency of 87.5 KHz, which was
          determined to produce optimum efficiency using a switching
          control circuit configured as shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure
            2</a>. This frequency has a period of 11.45 microseconds.
          The flip flop 54 is arranged, for example, to be set and reset
          on rising edges of the clock signal input from the oscillator,
          so that each pulse driving one of the FETS 60, 62 has a
          duration of 11.45 microseconds, and so that sequential pulses
          are also separated to each FET are also separated by 11.45
          microseconds.</font> </p>

          Figure 6A shows a first drive signal 100 driving FET 60, which
          conducts to drive the right input coil 26. Figure 6B is shows
          a second drive signal 102 driving FET 62, which conducts to

          current driving both the FETS 60, 62 from a battery source.
          Figure 6C shows the level 104 of voltage V. While the nominal
          voltage of the battery was 75 volts, a decaying transient
          signal 106 is superimposed on this voltage each time one of
          the FETS 60, 62 is switched on to conduct. The specific
          pattern of this transient signal depends on the internal
          resistance of the battery, as well as on a number of
          characteristics of the magnetic generator 10. Similarly,
          Figure 6D shows the current 106 flowing into both FETS 60, 62
          from the battery source. Since the signals 104, 106 show the
          effects of current flowing into both FETS 60, 62 the transient
          spikes are 11.45 microseconds apart.</font> </p>

          retained at 87.5 KHz. The measurement points are represented
          by indicia 120, while the curve 122 is generated by polynomial
          regression analysis using a least squares fit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>
          is a graphical view of a coefficient of performance, defined
          as the ratio of the output power to the input power, for each
          of the measurement points shown in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>.
          At each measurement point, the output power was substantially
          higher than the input power. Real power measurements were
          computed at each data point using measured voltage and current
          levels, with the results being averaged over the period of the
          signal. These measurements agree with RMS power measured using
          a Textronic THS730 digital oscilloscope.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the electromagnetic
          generator 10 was capable of operation at much higher voltages
          and currents without saturation, the input voltage was limited
          to 75 volts because of voltage limitations of the switching
          circuits being used. Those skilled in the relevant art will
          understand that components for switching circuits capable of
          handling higher voltages in this application are readily
          available. The experimentally-measured data was extrapolated
          to describe operation at an input voltage of 100 volts, with
          the input current being 140 ma, the input power being 14
          watts, and with a resulting output power being 48 watts for
          each of the two output coils 29, 30, at an average output
          current of 12 ma and an average output voltage of 4000 volts.
          This means that for each of the output coils 29, 30, the
          coefficient of performance would be 3.44.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While an output voltage of
          4000 volts may be needed for some applications, the output
          voltage can also be varied through a simple change in the
          configuration of the electromagnetic generator 10. The output
          voltage is readily reduced by reducing the number of turns in
          the output windings. If this number of turns is decreased from
          450 to 12, the output voltage is dropped to 106.7, with a
          resulting increase in output current to 0.5 amps for each
          output coil 29, 30. In this way, the output current and
          voltage of the electromagnetic generator can be varied by
          varying the number of turns of the output coils 29, 30,
          without making a substantial change in the output power, which
          is instead determined by the input current, which determines
          the amount of magnetic flux shuttled during the switching
          process.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The coefficients of
          performance, all of which were significantly greater than 1,
          plotted in <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a> indicate that the
          output power levels measured in each of the output coils 29,
          30 were substantially greater than the corresponding input
          power levels driving both of the input coils 26, 28.
          Therefore, it is apparent that the electromagnetic generator
          10 can be built in a self-actuating form, as discussed above
          in reference to <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. In the example
          of <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, except for a brief
          application of power from the external power source 38, to
          start the process of power generation, the power required to
          drive the input coils 26, 28 is derived entirely from power
          developed within the right output coil 29. If the power
          generated in a single output coil 29, 30 is more than
          sufficient to drive the input coils 26, 28, an additional load
          126 may be added to be driven with power generated in the
          output coil 29 used to generate power to drive the input coils
          26, 28. On the other hand, each of the output coils 29, 30 may
          be used to drive a portion of the input coil power
          requirements, for example with one of the output coils 26, 28
          providing the voltage V for the FET 60 (shown in <a
            href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>), while the other output coil
          provides this voltage for the FET 62.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Regarding thermodynamic
          considerations, it is noted that, when the electromagnetic
          generator 10 is operating, it is an open system not in
          thermodynamic equilibrium. The system receives static energy
          from the magnetic flux of the permanent magnet. Because the
          electromagnetic generator 10 is self-switched without an
          additional energy input, the thermodynamic operation of the
          system is an open dissipative system, receiving, collecting,
          and dissipating energy from its environment; in this case,
          from the magnetic flux stored within the permanent magnet.
          Continued operation of the electromagnetic generator 10 causes
          demagnetization of the permanent magnet. The use of a magnetic
          material including rare earth elements, such as a samarium
          cobalt material or a material including iron, neodymium, and
          boron is preferable within the present invention, since such a
          magnetic material has a relatively long life in this
          application.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus, an electromagnetic
          generator operating in accordance with the present invention
          should be considered not as a perpetual motion machine, but
          rather as a system in which flux radiated from a permanent
          magnet is converted into electricity, which is used both to
          power the apparatus and to power an external load. This is
          analogous to a system including a nuclear reactor, in which a
          number of fuel rods radiate energy which is used to keep the
          chain reaction going and to heat water for the generation of
          electricity to drive external loads.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>
          is a cross-sectional elevation of an electromagnetic generator
          130 built in accordance with a second version of the first
          embodiment of the present invention. This electromagnetic
          generator 130 is generally similar in construction and
          operation to the electromagnetic generator 10 built in
          accordance with the first version of this embodiment, except
          that the magnetic core 132 of the electromagnetic generator 10
          is built in two halves joined along lines 134, allowing each
          of the output coils 135 to be wound on a plastic bobbin 136
          before the bobbin 136 is placed over the legs 137 of the core
          132. <a href="#fig9">Figure 9 </a>also shows an alternate
          placement of an input coil 138. In the example of <a
            href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, both input coils 26, 28 were
          placed on the upper portion of the magnetic core 16, with
          these coils 26, 28 being configured to establish magnetic
          fields having north magnetic poles at the inner ends 31, 32 of
          the coils 26, 28, with these north magnetic poles thus being
          closest to the end 14 of the permanent magnet 12 having its
          north magnetic pole. In the example of <a href="#fig9">Figure
            9</a>, a first input coil 26 is as described above in
          reference to <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, but the second
          input coil 138 is placed adjacent the south pole 140 of the
          permanent magnet 12. This input coil 138 is configured to
          establish a south magnetic pole at its inner end 142, so that,
          when input coil 138 is turned on, flux from the permanent
          magnet 12 is directed away from the left magnetic path 20 into
          the right magnetic path 18.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>
          and <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a> show an electromagnetic
          generator 150 built in accordance with a first version of a
          second embodiment of the present invention, with <a
            href="#fig10">Figure 10</a> being a top view thereof, and
          with <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a> being a front elevation
          thereof. This electromagnetic generator 150 includes an output
          coil 152, 153 at each corner, and a permanent magnet 154
          extending along each side between output coils. The magnetic
          core 156 includes an upper plate 158, a lower plate 160, and a
          square post 162 extending within each output coil 152, 153.
          Both the upper plate 158 and the lower plate 160 include
          central apertures 164.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each of the permanent
          magnets 154 is oriented with a like pole, such as a north
          pole, against the upper plate 158. Eight input coils 166, 168
          are placed in positions around the upper plate 158 between an
          output coil 152, 153 and a permanent magnet 154. Each input
          coil 166, 168 is arranged to form a magnetic pole at its end
          nearest to the adjacent permanent magnet 154 of a like
          polarity to the magnetic poles of the magnets 154 adjacent the
          upper plate 158. Thus, the input coils 166 are switched on to
          divert magnetic flux of the permanent magnets 154 from the
          adjacent output coils 152, with this flux being diverted into
          magnetic paths through the output coils 153. Then, the input
          coils 168 are switched on to divert magnetic flux of the
          permanent magnets 154 from the adjacent output coils 153, with
          this flux being diverted into magnetic paths through the
          output coils 152. Thus, the input coils form a first group of
          input coils 166 and a second group of input coils 168, with
          these first and second groups of input coils being alternately
          energized in the manner described above in reference to <a
            href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> for the single input coils 26, 28.
          The output coils produce current in a first train of pulses
          occurring simultaneously within coils 152 and in a second
          train of pulses occurring simultaneously within coils 153.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus, driving current
          through input coils 166 causes an increase in flux from the
          permanent magnets 154 within the posts 162 extending through
          output coils 153 and a decrease in flux from the permanent
          magnets 154 within the posts 162 extending through output
          coils 152. On the other hand, driving current through input
          coils 168 causes a decrease in flux from the permanent magnets
          154 within the posts 162 extending through output coils 153
          and an increase in flux from the permanent magnets 154 within
          the posts 162 extending through output coils 152.</font> </p>

            href="#fig10">Figure 10</a> and <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a>
          shows all of the input coils 166,168 deployed along the upper
          plate 158, it is understood that certain of these input coils
          166, 168 could alternately be deployed around the lower plate
          160, in the manner generally shown in <a href="#fig9">Figure
            9</a>, with one input coil 166, 168 being within each
          magnetic circuit between a permanent magnet 154 and an
          adjacent post 162 extending within an output coil 152, 153,
          and with each input coil 166, 168 being arranged to produce a

          except that an upper plate 172 and a similar lower plate (not
