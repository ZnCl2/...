        Section 3<br>
        <br>
      </b><i>The Light of the Intelligence. The Light in the knower of
        the Triune Self; in the thinker; in the doer. The Light that has
        gone into nature.</i><b><br>
        <br>
      </b>The Triune Self receives Light from the Intelligence to which
      it is related; that Light comes from the light faculty of the
      Intelligence into the noetic atmosphere of the Triune Self. The
      Light is not a part of the Triune Self and never becomes a part of
      it. It is loaned to the Triune Self so that by the use of it the
      Triune Self may become an Intelligence.<br>
      <br>
      The Light is a Conscious Light; it is conscious that it is Light,
      and is conscious as Light. The Light, that which is with the
      Intelligence and that which is loaned to the Triune Self, is one.
      The Light is indivisible, though it appears to be divided. If the
      doer sends it into nature the Light is still one, no matter into
      how many different beings and things it has gone, or where it is,
      or in how weak a being it is, or how much it is obscured by the
      matter of nature. The Light of an Intelligence is the same Light
      irrespective of the forms in which it is. It seems to be confined
      in them, but it really is not.<br>
      <br>
      The reality in the Triune Self above all else, except
      Consciousness, is the Light. The Light lets things be seen as they
      are, shows what should be done by the beings in whom it is, leads
      them to be conscious in further degrees and shows them the power
      to change, without itself being changed. It bears, as long as it
      is with the doer, the evidence of the uses to which it has been
      put by the doer. The fact that the Light is there causes these
      various processes to go on. The Light does not act, but it keeps
      beings in action by stimulating the active principle in them. It
      does not act nor does it suffer nor does it react. Its presence is
      the cause of all things spoken of as light. Starlight, sunlight,
      moonlight and earthlight are various functionings of matter made
      active by the Light of the Intelligences sent by the doers of
      their Triune Selves into nature. Human beings do not know the
      Light as such.<br>
      <br>
      The doer is in the sphere of its Intelligence and receives a
      certain amount of Light from it. This is the amount the doer
      should have in order to acquire its education through its human
      beings. The amount is at times increased or decreased, depending
      on the thinking of the doers of the human beings, and is the
      outstanding feature of their noetic destiny. The Light so loaned
      may be sent by the doer into nature and become attached to nature
      units to which the doer by its thinking ties the Light.<br>
      <br>
      In nature the Light is attached to units, that is, the Light is
      bound up and blended with them and so remains until the doer draws
      it back. The Light allows nature to unfold in every field and it
      evokes the latent sides and forces in the units. The presence of
      the Light makes the latent energy of nature active. In nature the
      Light sent out through doers is the intelligence often called God,
      who is supposed to have created the world and to carry it on. The
      doer is responsible for the Light it has sent into nature and must
      redeem it. Redeemed Light goes out again and again until it
      becomes unattachable to nature. Then it remains in the noetic
      atmosphere, is of the noetic world and is beyond and free from
      noetic destiny.<br>
      <br>
      The Light is clear in all of the noetic atmosphere that does not
      penetrate the mental and psychic atmospheres of the human. The
      Light is taken into the noetic atmosphere by the noetic breath,
      and makes the atmosphere conscious in the degree of
      I-ness-and-selfness. The matter of the noetic atmosphere has the
      characteristic that it tends to oneness. This matter is conscious
      in various phases of I-ness-and-selfness and is potentially that
      out of which will be developed the light faculty and the I-am
      faculty, when the Triune Self becomes an Intelligence. In the
      atmosphere flows the noetic breath which is the active side of a
      part of the atmosphere and connects the remaining part with the
      knower. The knower has two aspects, passively I-ness and actively
      selfness. From I-ness comes the identity of the Triune Self which
      in the human is manifest as the feeling that it is the same today
      as through all past years, notwithstanding the changes in the
      body. Selfness is knowledge. The knower of the Triune Self is
      conscious in the highest phases of the degree of
      I-ness-and-selfness; the breath and the matter of the atmosphere
      are conscious in lower phases.<br>
      <br>
      In the noetic atmosphere there is neither place nor time. The
      matter is everywhere at once. The Light is throughout, in the
      atmosphere, in the breath, and in the knower. The Light quickens
      and brings out what is potentially in the atmosphere. That which
      is in the atmosphere has no direct or special bearing upon the
      noetic destiny of the human.<br>
      <br>
      That which is noetic destiny of a human is Light which is in the
      part of the noetic that is in the mental atmosphere of the human,
      (Fig. V-B); also Light that is tied up in the physical body and
      Light in nature which will be called on by the human.<br>
      <br>
      Though Light comes in the first instance from the Intelligence,
      some Light comes back into the noetic atmosphere from nature when
      it is reclaimed and some from the mental atmosphere when a thought
      is balanced and so the Light in it is freed, and some when
      knowledge of the conscious self in the body results from thinking
      without creating a thought. There is a circulation of part of the
      Light from the noetic into the mental atmosphere, thence by means
      of thought into nature and thence back from food and thought into
      the mental and thence into the noetic atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      Light is sent by the knower into the mental atmosphere with the
      noetic breath. I-ness sends Light to be used in thinking, reason
      checks the amount that is allowed to go. Selfness sends Light to
      rightness when conscience speaks, and to reason as an intuition.
      The Light that I-ness sends becomes diffused in the mental
      atmosphere. The Light that selfness sends remains clear and
      direct. The noetic breath conveys some of the Light to the mental
      atmosphere, which receives it through its mental breath.<br>
      <br>
      When the Light is in the matter of the mental atmosphere of the
      human it is diffused, modified, dimmed, dulled. The Light itself
      is always the same and has lost none of its character, but it
      appears in the mental atmosphere as though it were in a fog. This
      is caused by the matter of the mental atmosphere. In the lower
      part of this atmosphere, which is the part the human uses to think
      with and in which the thoughts connected with his thinking
      circulate and whirl, the Light is most fogged and clouded.<br>
      <br>
      Whereas the Light itself, being of Intelligence and being Truth,
      shows in the noetic atmosphere everything as the thing is, the
      Light in the mental atmosphere must be freed from obstacles and
      interference, and must be held steadily on the subject and brought
      to a focus, before the Light as Truth can show what the thing is.
      The Light in its clear state in the noetic atmosphere cannot
      thence be sent into physical nature. The Light in the mental
      atmosphere is in a state where it can be mixed with desire and so
      may be sent into physical nature in that portion of a thought
      which is exteriorized.<br>
      The presence of the Light diffused in the mental atmosphere
      stimulates the matter of the atmosphere and keeps the mental
      breath in circulation, and the Light circulates with it and allows
      reason to act through its thinking. The Light in rightness is not
      the light of the mental atmosphere, but is clear Light that is
      sent in flashes from the noetic atmosphere by selfness.<br>
      <br>
      No Light is in the psychic atmosphere, but there is Light in those
      parts of the mental and noetic atmospheres which are in it. The
      matter of the atmosphere is conscious in the degree of
      feeling-and-desire. The matter is usually dark, heavy, gross and
      sluggish. The psychic atmosphere pulls on and weighs down the
      mental and, in a lesser degree, the noetic atmosphere of the human
      by those parts of them which pervade it. The Light therefore is
      dimmed in those parts. The noetic destiny is the absence of the
      Light from the psychic atmosphere, from feeling-and-desire and
      from the psychic breath.<br>
      The chief characteristic of the psychic atmosphere is a feeling
      for and the desiring and rushing after something it longs for, yet
      fears. That something is the Light of the Intelligence and contact
      with the thinker and the knower. The atmosphere is not conscious
      of the Light. It is never quiet, but when impressions from nature,
      elementals or desires of other doers enter through the avenues
      leading from the openings of the body, it is stirred into turmoil.
      It pulls and it pushes, it sucks in like a whirlpool and it tries
      to get into everything. It surges in these ways during eating,
      amusement, dancing, celebrations, sermons, funerals and all
      trading. The atmosphere is conscious of these its activities, but
      is not conscious of why it has them. It has them to get Light, the
      Light it once had, but which was withdrawn.<br>
      <br>
      The psychic atmosphere is represented in the feeling and the
      desire of the doer. If feeling and desire could get the Light into
      the atmosphere the doer would not desire to change its present
      condition, it would continue to seek satisfaction from nature, it
      would have a greater intensity of satisfaction because of the
      Light, and it would not advance and so it would retard the
      progress of the doer. Because the doer has no Light it is in the
      dark, it cannot tell one thing from another, cannot form a
      judgment, but can only feel and desire. When things are pleasant
      it tries to hold them and get more of them; when they are
      unpleasant it tries to get away from them. Not having
      discrimination it does this over and over again.<br>
      <br>
      The feeling or the desire is so evident in the human that it seems
      to be all there is. The doer occupies not only certain nerves of
      the voluntary nervous system, but also some which belong to the
      thinker and the knower. No noetic reactions may be felt, and
      mental reactions are felt but vaguely. If the thinker and the
      knower are noticed at all, they are interpreted as feeling and
      desire. On the other hand psychic conditions, mystic trance states
      and visions are supposed to be what is spoken of as “spiritual.”
      When a human suffers he usually seeks consolation and hope in
      religious promises, rather than an understanding of the facts. In
      the psychic atmosphere feeling and desire act without the Light.<br>
      <br>
      Because feeling-and-desire came into being through Light and had
      their greatest satisfaction while Light was with them, and because
      they can reach completeness only when they are in the Light, they
      want Light. The place where they can get it is in the mental
      atmosphere in the heart and principally in the lungs. Feeling
      cannot get beyond the heart, but desire can, and feeling gets
      satisfaction from desire. When the psychic atmosphere and the doer
      become agitated, desire rushes towards the mental atmosphere in
      the lungs to get Light. It cannot get into the atmosphere until it
      has passed rightness in the heart. Then it is in the mental
      atmosphere in the lungs. Desire cannot get that Light until it
      compels its mind to think, to gather and to focus the Light on the
      impression; the Light bonds the desire with the impression. The
      thing which is being created by thinking is a thought and is a new
      being. In the thought are desire of the doer and Light of the
      Intelligence, with which desire could not come into contact in any
      other way than by this admixture by thinking.<br>
      <br>
      The Light is not changed, though it is bound up in the combination
      until the thought is balanced. Desire pushes the thought, and the
      Light guides it toward the first exteriorization and toward every
      subsequent exteriorization. When a thought is exteriorized Light
      goes into nature, some of it is bound up in the thought and some
      is diffused in the body of the human. When Light thus goes into
      nature it is attached to units and is part of the Light which acts
      as the intelligence, order and law of nature.<br>
      <br>
      Only a doer can contain or direct Light of an Intelligence; no
      physical body, object of nature or even matter of the light world
      can deal with the Light, in the same sense.<br>
      <br>
      The Light that is in the noetic atmospheres of the doers also
      illumines the light world, which is on the nature-side, and there,
      though not mixing with the matter, keeps that matter illuminated
      and in constant action. It also shows what goes on in the light
      world and what has been done with any of its matter while that
      matter was in the lower worlds. But the light world of nature does
      not contain the Light. The Light is there because of the
      atmosphere of the Triune Selves.<br>
      <br>
      The Light in the mental atmospheres of the doers pervades the life
      world. This Light is the diffused Light in the mental atmospheres
      and is not mixed with desire. Light mixed with desire does not
      function in this way; it does not get into the life world; when it
      is mixed with desire and so is bound up in a thought, it remains
      in that thought in the mental atmosphere. The Light in the life
      world stimulates there the active side of the units and so starts
      what appears later as life on the physical plane. The Light does
      not illumine the form world, because there is no Light in the
      psychic atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      The bright lights, pictures and colors seen by psychics are matter
      of the physical world, for psychics cannot see into the form
      world, as their psychic atmospheres do not carry Light. The form
      plane of the physical world is not illumined by Light of the
      Intelligence. Its matter is lit up only in exteriorization of
      thoughts, not from the Light in the light or life worlds.<br>
      <br>
      The physical plane of the physical world is lit by starlight
      coming through human nerves, by sunlight coming through hearts and
      lungs, moonlight coming through kidneys and adrenals, and
      earthlight from the sex organs and digestive systems. Starlight is
      diffused between the stars but is focused by the sun. Starlight,
      if it could be seen directly, would be seen to penetrate and to
      bear the other three kinds and to be more powerful than any of
      them. Sunlight focuses starlight into a steady stream, as thinking
      focuses diffused Light. Moonlight adjusts the sunlight. Earthlight
      takes in or passes on or throws back the other three kinds of
      light. All four kinds of light work together in causing a tree, a
      flower or an apple to be compacted or to grow. Starlight,
      sunlight, moonlight and earthlight are not and do not possess
      light themselves; what is called their light is their property of
      showing their active side when this reflects Light of the
      Intelligence. In this sense the Light of the Intelligence, which
      is self-luminous and self-conscious in the noetic atmosphere, is
      hidden in the objects of nature which were wrought by the presence
      of the Light. The process is not physical and cannot be
      coordinated with conceptions of dimensions.<b><br>
        <br>
        Section 4<br>
      </b><br>
      <i>The intelligence in nature comes from human beings. The pull of
        nature for Light. Loss of Light into nature.</i><br>
      <br>
      Nature needs Light from Intelligences and in the human world of
      time gets it through human thinking and thoughts, which convey to
      it Light that reaches the human beings from their noetic
      atmospheres. The Light does not go directly into nature. The Light
      from the noetic atmosphere must first go into the mental
      atmosphere where it becomes diffused and mixes with desire, which
      comes into the mental atmosphere from the psychic atmosphere. The
      Light is not in the desire, but is bound to it in a thought. The
      thought is conceived or entertained in the heart and issued from
      the brain. In order that the Light of the Intelligence may go into
      nature, an act of the body is necessary to exteriorize the thought
      or part of it. Without an act of the body the Light from the
      mental atmosphere cannot go out into nature. Nature therefore
      wants acts by human bodies, to get through them Light from
      Intelligences. To that end, nature with the swing of the breath
      and by an object of sense reaches through the system of one of the
      senses into the doer, and pulls on the desire, to get the human to
      perform a physical act. The Light of the Intelligence goes into
      nature with thinking and with thoughts, through the openings of
      the body.<br>
      <br>
      Nature seeks Light, life, forms and desire, none of which it has.
      It seeks them as a dry soil seeks water, as fire seeks wood, as
      negative seeks positive. There is an urge of unfolding and growth
      by combination in all matter. Without Light and without desire
      nature must remain inert; with Light and desire nature units
      combine and advance by life through growth as forms and so become
      conscious in higher degrees.<br>
      <br>
      Nature gets the Light from human thoughts and the desire from the
      embodied portions of doers. Therefore nature pulls constantly on
      the doers in human bodies to get what will maintain it and advance
      it. Desire is the driving power within the form and structure of
      the animal and plant. Desire and the Light are in the organisms of
      nature as instinct, which guides in selecting food, in
      self-protection and in procreation…<br>
      <br>
      There are two nerve tracts or cords or tubes in the body, one for
      nature and the other for the doer, which in the perfect body were
      connected, (Fig. VI-D). In the human the nature-tract is the
      alimentary canal, from mouth to anus. The sense of smell has
      charge of this tract directly, but the three other senses are
      connected with it, act upon it and influence it. The other tract,
      the spinal cord and terminal filament, is at present for the doer
      of the Triune Self; it reaches from the first cervical vertebra to
      the tip of the terminal filament at the end of the spine; the doer
      does not use this tract as it might, but uses organs instead;
      these organs are the heart and the lungs, the kidneys and
      adrenals, and the male and female organs, which are go-betweens
      for the nature tract and the doer tract<br>
      <br>
      The sections of the body are in and connect with the four worlds;
      the head with the light, the thoracic cavity with the life, the
      abdominal cavity with the form, and the pelvic cavity with the
      physical world. However, the head is now used for the physical
      world and the pelvic cavity for the light world. That is so
      because the knower, the thinker, and the doer as a whole, have
      withdrawn from the body. The brain in the head has been usurped by
      the portion of the doer that is in the body and the pelvic organs
      are devoted to and controlled by the procreative functions in the
      body.<br>
      <br>
      The four systems are related to and run through the four sections.
      In this organization nature pulls on the doer for light, with and
      through the fourfold breath. The generative system is worked by
      the elemental functioning as the sense of sight. Through the
      generative system the sense of sight can act, indirectly, from the
      four planes of the physical world on nature, and on the three
      parts and the three atmospheres of the Triune Self, and so may get
      Light from the doer for nature. Some of the organs of the
      generative system, which connect with nature through the
      involuntary system, are: on the light plane the eyes and their
      nerves; on the life plane the heart and lungs and their nerves; on
      the form plane the kidneys and adrenals and their nerves; on the
      physical plane the generative organs and their nerves.<br>
      <br>
      The Triune Self may contact organs of the generative system
      through the voluntary nervous system; the pituitary body may be
      contacted by I-ness and the pineal body by selfness; the heart and
      cerebellum by rightness and the lungs and cerebrum by reason; the
      kidneys are used by feeling and the adrenals by desire. So the
      Triune Self may work the generative system through the cerebellum,
      the heart and the kidneys, and through three brains, the cerebrum,
      the lungs and the adrenals. It does not do this at present, but
      through these organs the sense of sight now gets Light from the
      doer for nature.<br>
      <br>
      The pull of nature is exercised from the light plane of the
      physical world, through the generative system, and by the sense of
      sight through the eyes and the male or female organs, and
      especially the testicles and ovaries. By means of the sight acting
      successively on the planes of the physical world,—on the light
      plane through the eyes, on the life plane through the heart and
      lungs, on the form plane through the kidneys and adrenals, and on
      the physical plane through the sex organs,—there is finally an
      action on the breath-form by the earth breath as it breathes out
      through the sex parts. The pull is transferred in the kidneys from
      the breath-form to the feeling of the doer, and then desire, in
      the adrenals, rushes to the heart.<br>
      <br>
      In the heart, if rightness is overcome or does not put up any
      barrier, thinking is started, which draws Light from the mental
      atmosphere. The heart and cerebellum and the lungs and cerebrum
      interact, and the brain diffuses the Light which is mixed with
      desire in the heart and lungs for thinking and thoughts. The pull
      of nature is directly on the doer. Light passes out in the
      thoughts as they are issued from the brain, and as they are
      exteriorized in acts, objects or events. Or especially when there
      is a sexual spasm, the Light leaves, being then precipitated by
      the brain and drawn along the spinal cord to the small of the back
      and along the kidneys out into nature. The sexual brain, the
      testicles or ovaries, influences the psychic brain, the adrenals;
      that influences the mental brain, the lungs; and that influences
      the noetic brain, the cerebrum; and all this causes the Light of
      the noetic atmosphere to work for nature. Such is noetic destiny
      at this time. The physical human world of nature has sex and sex
      organs; the doer has no sex and no sex organs.<br>
      <br>
      The breath-form, as the form and the breath, is used by the doer
      as the bridge by which it crosses over to nature and nature
      crosses over to it. The crossings from all planes are made on the
      physical plane in a human body and by means of the earth breath.<br>
      <br>
      The respiratory system is worked by the sense of hearing and
      through that system this elemental can act, indirectly, from the
      four planes of the physical world upon the three parts of the
      Triune Self and the three atmospheres in which they are, and so
      may get thoughts from the doer and from them forms for nature. The
      respiratory system uses substantially the same organs on the
      respective planes of the physical world as does the generative
      system, namely: on the light plane the ears; on the life plane the
      heart and lungs; on the form plane the kidneys and adrenals; on
      the physical plane the generative organs, and the involuntary
      nerves of each of these organs. The Triune Self uses the same
      organs, the cerebellum, the heart and the kidneys, and the same
      brains, the cerebrum, the lungs and the adrenals, as when it acts
      in the generative system.<br>
      <br>
      The pull of nature through the respiratory system is exercised
      from the life plane of the physical world. The pull is ultimately
      always on the doer and that draws on the mental atmosphere for
      Light. The sense of hearing cannot pull directly on the mental
      atmosphere. The sense of hearing acts with the earth breath in the
      generative parts on the breath-form; that transmits a pull, in the
      kidneys, to the doer in the body, and desire if aroused goes to
      the heart. If rightness is overcome or agrees, mental activity
      begins there and passive thinking results. In passive thinking
      there is only a playing of desire in the diffused Light of the
      Intelligence. Yet this is enough to carry some of the Light into
      nature. If the passive thinking results in active thinking or in a
      thought, more of the Light is mixed with desire and goes out into
      nature by speech or by a thought. The stages are as follows: the
      sense of hearing is on the life plane of the physical world and
      after acting on the intermediate planes and organs, acts on the
      breath-form in the sex parts, through the sense of smell and the
      earth breath; this transmits the pull to the doer, in the kidneys;
      then desire rushes to the heart. If rightness is overcome or
      agrees, thinking is started and draws Light from the mental
      atmosphere. So a thought is there generated, and is issued from
      the brain, or the Light goes out by speech through the mouth.<br>
      <br>
      The circulatory system is worked by the sense of taste. When
      nature pulls through this sense the sense acts from the form plane
      of the physical world to reach the three parts of the Triune Self
      and their atmospheres. Nature uses the sense of taste and the
      circulatory system to get forms and desire. The thoughts obtained
      through the respiratory system are the models for the forms, and
      the sense of taste gets the design, the details, and the desire
      which fills out the models. The desire is the driving power in the
      form. The circulatory system uses substantially the same organs on
      the respective planes of the physical world as does the generative
      system, namely, on the light plane the tongue; on the life plane
      the heart and lungs; on the form plane the kidneys and adrenals;
      on the physical plane the generative organs; and the involuntary
      nerves of each of these organs. The doer of the Triune Self has
      the same organs, the cerebellum, the heart, and the kidneys, and
      the same brains, the cerebrum, the lungs and the adrenals, as it
      has for action through the generative system.<br>
      <br>
      The pull of nature through the sense of taste is exercised from
      the form plane of the physical world. The pull is ultimately made
      on the mental atmosphere, if the pull is effective. The sense of
      taste exercising the pull of nature transmits it to the breath,
      which passes it on to the breath-form as the breath passes out
      through the sex parts. So the pull is passed on to the kidneys
      where the doer receives it. If there is a reaction it begins when
      the desire rushes to the heart, and the thinker receives it. If
      rightness is ignored or agrees, thinking uses the Light diffused
      in the mental atmosphere, and a thought results.<br>
      <br>
      The digestive system is worked by the elemental functioning as the
      sense of smell. When nature pulls through the digestive system,
      the sense may act through any of the four planes of the physical
      world to reach the doer and its atmosphere to get Light. Nature
      pulls through the digestive system and the sense of smell to get
      food for its bodies. The food builds up, exteriorizes and gives
      physical bodies to the forms which nature has received through the
      sense of taste. The digestive system uses substantially the same
      organs on the respective planes of the physical world as the
      generative system, namely: on the light plane of the physical
      world the nose and its nerves; on the life plane the heart and
      lungs and their nerves; on the form plane the kidneys and adrenals
      and their nerves, and on the physical plane the generative organs
      and their nerves.<br>
      <br>
      But differing from the other three systems, the digestive has a
      special set of organs in addition: the esophagus, the stomach and
      the intestinal tract, a tract which goes from the light plane, the
      head, to the physical plane, the anus. The Triune Self has the
      same organs,—the cerebellum, the heart and the kidneys, and the
      same brains, the cerebrum, the lungs and the adrenals,—as it has
      for action through the generative, respiratory and circulatory
      systems, but the Triune Self does not touch the digestive system
      with these organs and brains as directly as it uses or contacts
      the other three systems, because it is not as intimately related
      to the digestive system. In addition, the doer of the Triune Self
      touches the digestive system in two organs, the stomach and the
      liver, but it does not touch it in these organs as immediately as
      it touches the other systems.<br>
      <br>
      The pull of nature through the digestive system is exercised from
      the physical plane of the physical world. The pull ultimately
      draws on the mental atmosphere if rightness is ignored or consents
      and the pull of nature becomes effective. The sense of smell, in
      order to exercise the pull for nature, reaches from the light
      plane of the physical world through the nose, from the life plane
      through the heart and lungs, from the form plane through the
      kidneys and adrenals, and on the physical plane through the
      urinary tract, and the anus at the end of the digestive tube. The
      sense of smell transmits the pull to the breath which passes it on
      to the breath-form as the breath goes out through the sex parts
      and the excretory ducts. The pull starts at the anus and the
      opening of the urinary tract and continues up the alimentary canal
      to the mouth. From the small intestine the pull is transmitted to
      the kidneys where the doer receives it. The pull continues to the
      stomach causing various secretions from the organs along the
      tract, like the pancreas and liver. The pull is transmitted from
      the kidneys through the involuntary nervous system by the breath
      to the stomach, where it is felt as hunger. If there is response,
      it begins by desire rushing to the heart.<br>
      <br>
      There, if rightness is ignored or agrees, the doer may by thinking
      obtain some of the Light, and a thought results. The Light may
      pass out in a thought, and if food is consumed to satisfy the
      pull, some part of the thought with the Light in it is
      exteriorized in the tissue of the body; and other parts return to
      nature as excrements, which nature uses to rebuild her structure.<br>
      <br>
      The pull of nature for the Light that is in the noetic atmosphere
      of the Triune Self begins by a pull on the breath, and at a time
      when the breath swings out at the sex parts. When the pull is made
      through the digestive system there is an additional pull at the
      end of the alimentary tube. This special pull of the digestive
      system is due to the fact that this system is on the physical
      plane of the physical world, the plane where all worlds touch, and
      through which the circulation between the Triune Self and nature
      is kept up. The digestive system is on the lowest plane, but it is
      the most powerful of the systems. All worlds of nature come in
      contact with the atmospheres of the Triune Self only through the
      digestive system, that is, through the physical plane.<br>
      <br>
      The doer of the Triune Self depends on its physical body for
      progress and this body is of the same plane as the digestive
      system. The power of hunger compels the doer to furnish physical
      food; and food, maintaining the body, keeps the doer on the
      physical plane. The desire for food brings about the complex
      relations which compose civilization. The power of the digestive
      system is also shown by the fact that the alimentary tube takes up
      more space in the body than the other systems, and that the other
      systems are subsidiary to the digestion and assimilation of food,
      turning physical nature into skin, flesh, fat, blood, bones,
      marrow and nerves. The way nature works in all the systems is
      displayed more openly in the digestive system. There, in the
      working of peristalsis, it is most readily seen. Peristalsis, the
      involuntary contractile movements in the organs of the four
      systems, conveys to nature the material it needs after the
      material has in it some Light. In the digestive system this
      response to the pull of nature by the breath is most pronounced.<br>
      <br>
      The connection and interrelation between nature and the doer is
      made by the physical breath, and more particularly by that stream
      of it called the digestive or earth breath. Both nature and doer
      work on the breath-form through the fourfold physical breath.
      Nature works on it through its four senses and systems, and the
      doer works on it through its feeling and desire.<br>
      <br>
      The breath-form has two aspects, a negative and a positive. The
      negative is the form, the positive is the breath and the physical
      atmosphere. The matter of the breath of the breath-form is refined
      matter of the four worlds of the earth sphere. The breath-form is
      akin to nature and to the doer, and one side of it is the flowing
      breath that enables both to make their communication. While the
      breath-form is negative to the breath and the breath positive to
      it, the breath itself is positive in its outbreathing and negative
      in its inbreathing. This breath bathes the entire body in its
      tidal flow, which is imperceptible except where it carries air
      into and out of the lungs. Imperceptibly it moves just as much out
      of the eye, or any pore or any other part, as it does out of the
      lungs.<br>
      <br>
      The physical breath has four currents, namely, the generative,
      respiratory, circulatory and digestive breaths, and is related by
      them through the four bodies to the fire, air, water and earth in
      the earth sphere. The psychic, mental and noetic breath streams
      have to work through the fourth, the current called the earth
      breath, to reach the doer.<br>
      <br>
      When nature pulls, which she must do by one of the four senses,
      she reaches by means of the ingoing breath with the sense to the
      sense nerves, and then with the sense through its system to the
      corresponding current of the breath, and pulls on that when it is
      positive and flows out with the earth breath current through the
      sex parts into the physical atmosphere. This pull induces an
      involuntary peristaltic action in the system on which nature
      pulls, to get out of that system the matter and the Light that is
      mixed and concealed in it. The pull then goes with the breath to
      the breath-form and to the sex parts and the other parts which are
      on the physical plane, and thence to the form plane and the
      kidneys.<br>
      <br>
      So nature pulling on the fourfold physical breath causes thereby a
      peristaltic action in the four systems, by which visible and
      invisible physical matter, in which there is hidden some Light,
      goes into nature directly. The pull is ceaseless as long as the
      breath flows, but the peristaltic results do not carry Light to
      nature as regularly; sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes no
      Light is transferred. Whatever light goes out goes with the
      outgoing positive breath.<br>
      <br>
      Some of it goes through the twelve openings of the body and the
      pores of the skin. This is either Light carried out by matter
      which has while circulating in the body been impressed by
      thinking, or it is Light which is directly thought out into nature
      through the sense organs, as through the eye when one looks at a
      person or thing. The thinking is usually induced by elementals or
      by thoughts that enter with the incoming breath through the sex
      openings, the navel and nerve centers in the pelvic and abdominal
      cavities. The other Light that goes out does so in thoughts, when
      they are issued from the brain and when the person who issues them
      exteriorizes them by an act. Then the Light goes out through the
      act by sight or by word.<br>
      <br>
      Through the bodies of children no Light goes out into nature until
      they become pubescent. The Light that is taken in from food is
      built into the body, particularly the bones and brain, through the
      thymus gland, the distribution being regulated by the pituitary
      body. By puberty the thymus gland is absorbed and therefore can no
      longer act as a stopcock. At puberty a child is connected with its
      noetic atmosphere. From then on the generative system assumes the
      function of withdrawing Light from the two nervous systems,
      together with the function of seed production.<br>
      <br>
      The main channels through which Light is lost into nature are the
      sex organs. Seeing dress and movements, hearing a voice,
      especially in song, tasting rich food, smelling odors and touching
      a body of the opposite sex, all suggest sexual attraction and take
      hold of and dominate thinking on sex matters. Elementals come in.
      They are the sexual sensations. A human feels these sensations,
      but does not feel his feeling and mistakes the elementals he feels
      and nourishes, for his own feeling. The elementals excite him, he
      acts for them and he allows them to take the Light away.<br>

      <i>Automatic return of Light from nature. The lunar germ.
        Self-control.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The Light which a human has sent or allowed to go into nature is
      returned to the human. It goes out again and is returned again.
      This outgoing and incoming will continue until the Light is
      reclaimed from all admixtures and attachments and is made
      unattachable or freed Light. Then it goes out no more.<br>
      <br>
      Light is returned to the noetic atmosphere of the human either
      automatically, or through self-control. Automatic reclamation is
      started by a Light finder or gatherer, called lunar germ, and is
      accomplished by the pull of the noetic breath along the
      nature-tract. Reclamation by self-control, which is of three
      degrees, is done by thinking and is aided by another germ, called
      solar germ, which makes a path along the tract for the Triune Self
      for Light to travel on.<br>
      <br>
      Automatic reclamation of Light is the finding and the gathering by
      the lunar germ of Light that has come in with food and the
      carrying of the gathered Light as far as the kidneys, and then the
      raising of this Light to the noetic atmosphere in the head by the
      psychic, the mental and the noetic breaths. This automatic
      reclamation can be made only while the Light is in the body to
      which it has returned in food, and after it has been extracted
      from the food by organs of the four systems and by the fourfold
      physical breath.<br>
      <br>
      The Light that has gone into nature comes back automatically in
      food. The Light that has gone out in the various ways mentioned
      never leaves the noetic atmosphere of the Triune Self. Just as
      thoughts never leave the mental, and desires, even if they appear
      as animals, never leave the psychic atmosphere, so the Light never
      leaves the noetic atmosphere. Earth time and dimensions have no
      effect upon and are no hindrance to Light of an Intelligence. The
      Light of an Intelligence that is in the noetic atmosphere of its
      Triune Self, though it goes out into physical nature, returns
      thence because that Light has an identity. It retains this
      identity however long it circulates in nature and in however many
      forms and places it appears there. For the Light is a part of an
      Intelligence, which is an ultimate unit, inseparable, indivisible.<br>
      <br>
      Special parts of Light circulating in nature are summoned into
      food, to be thence extracted for reclamation. What of the Light is
      so called depends upon the thinking of the human. It may be days,
      months, years or lives before some of the Light is drawn back. But
      when it is to be reclaimed, any special part of the Light will
      return to the body of the doer that let it go out, though the
      present human is not aware of the identity and the circulation of
      the Light which his thinking summons to return to the body.<br>
      <br>
      Not all the Light that is taken in with food is the Light of the
      consumer. Light from other doers is with it and affects those who
      eat the food. Usually there is something in common between the
      foreign Light and the doer that receives it. Just as the
      atmospheres of different people intermingle according to quality,
      so the Light that is with food intermingles.<br>
      <br>
      Food is of the four elements and is taken in as solids, as
      liquids, in air and sunlight, and in starlight. The solid food
      contains the other three, just as the physical world is a
      precipitation of the other three worlds, as the physical plane is
      matter condensed from the other planes of the physical world, and
      as the structure elementals contain the form, the portal and the
      causal. The solid and liquid forms of food enter through the
      digestive system; the airy and some of the fiery foods enter
      through the respiratory system. But these are only the most
      apparent ways. Starlight enters also through the eyes and through
      the skin. With the breath food from the four elements is taken in
      directly from one’s physical atmosphere where it is held in
      suspension. No matter how the food is taken in, it all goes into
      the digestive system. There the other three systems also work on
      it.<br>
      <br>
      The fourfold physical breath, as it flows in and out of the body,
      causes a peristaltic action in the organs and tubes of each of the
      four systems. Each breath causes the peristalsis in its own
      system, and each sense stimulates the function in its system under
      that peristaltic impulse.<br>
      <br>
      As food is moved in the digestive system this fourfold stream of
      the physical breath, each stream acting with its stimulated
      peristalsis, affects the food. Seeing the food, what is said and
      heard while eating it, tasting it and smelling it, have a direct
      bearing on the digestion. The salivary glands add their
      secretions, the gastric juice is poured out from the walls of the
      stomach, the liver gives its bile, the pancreas its fluid, and the
      intestinal digestive glands their secretion. The four senses cause
      the activity of the juices and of the ferments in them. Thereby
      proper changes are made in the food, which is turned into chyme in
      the stomach and later into chyle and becomes ready for absorption
      and assimilation in the intestines.<br>
      <br>
      In the circulation the kidneys strain the blood and free it from
      impurities, and the adrenals pour out their secretion, which
      empowers the red and the white blood cells, keeps the blood and
      lymph in circulation, invigorates the sex glands and the ductless
      glands. The respiratory system takes in air as food, supplies
      oxygen to the blood and eliminates waste matter. This system is
      the channel through which starry matter flows into the generative
      system. The seat of the generative system is the pituitary body,
      and it has organs and branches in all parts of the brain and
      throughout the body.<br>
      <br>
      The generative system is the source of the other three systems. It
      begins in the fused cells as a point, grows into a line and a
      surface and becomes a circle within a sphere. The circle separates
      into the spine and the digestive tract. From some part of the
      generative system the allantois is created; that later protrudes
      through the amniotic sac and the chorion, fastens itself to the
      wall of the uterus and becomes the placenta. With the placenta are
      developed the kidneys and adrenals and the heart and lungs, and
      the circulatory and the respiratory systems are started within the
      divided circle. The kidneys working through the heart carry on the
      circulation, which is not independent until the intake of breath
      after birth.<br>
      <br>
      The generative system is the beginning of the physical body from
      the fecundated cell, the carrier of vitality during the existence
      of the body, the governor of the nervous systems and of the
      ductless glands. Seed production in the adult is but one of its
      functions. During life the generative system regulates the
      secretions of the ductless glands, such as the pituitary, thyroid,
      thymus, spleen and adrenals. By these secretions the activities of
      all four systems are maintained from the pituitary body. The
      generative system inspirits the ferments and secretions of the
      organs and thereby causes digestion, absorption and assimilation.
      At death it cuts itself off from the other three systems which are
      then unable to function.<br>
      <br>
      The generative system makes an extract of four grades of radiant
      matter from all the foods. The first is small in amount and is of
      radiant matter drawn directly by means of the nerves from food in
      the digestive system; the second grade is the largest in amount
      and is radiant matter drawn from food that has passed into the
      circulatory system; the third grade is radiant matter drawn from
      food in the respiratory system and the fourth and most potent
      grade is elaborated from starry matter that has reached the
      generative system itself.<br>
      <br>
      The four kinds of extracts are elaborated in the testicles and the
      ovaries for seed and for soil. So that in the seed and in the soil
      are represented all parts of the body in essence. After the seed
      and the soil are brought to a certain point they take on
      independent life as spermatozoa and ova.<br>
      <br>
      From these extracts of starry matter the generative system makes a
      tonic tincture and turns this tincture back into the other systems
      and into itself. The generative system is the ultimate cause of
      well-being and disease. It gives the tonic tincture to the
      involuntary and the voluntary nerves, and in this way returns to
      the digestive, circulatory and respiratory systems that which is
      made from the extract of the food that passed through them.
      Because of this tincture the other three systems are kept going, a
      life-giving quality can be taken in by respiration and sent to all
      parts of the body, the blood can be circulated and food can be
      digested.<br>
      <br>
      While these transformations are going on Light is being extracted
      from the food in its first and subsequent forms. The digestive,
      the circulatory, the respiratory and the generative breaths work
      each upon its system in the body to take up a certain part of the
      food and of the Light which is in it and carry the Light into the
      generative system. Finally the generative breath transfers a
      portion of the Light connected with the food to a lunar germ.
      Physically these processes are controlled by the pituitary body.
      It controls the four systems and the four physical breaths by
      means of the involuntary nervous system and its involuntary
      actions. Light going back to the noetic atmosphere goes through
      the generative system.<br>
      <br>
      The four grades of extract have in them Light and circulate in the
      generative system. While they are in the head the fire current of
      the fourfold breath can draw Light out. The Light that moves up
      and down in the generative system is Light that is contained in
      the radiant matter that was extracted from food.<br>
      <br>
      The automatic transfer of Light to the noetic atmosphere is made
      by the generative system naturally to the noetic breath, when
      there is enough Light in the generative system. The noetic
      atmosphere exercises by means of the noetic breath a continuous
      pull for its own Light. This attempt to raise its Light out of the
      generative system is contrary to the pull which nature makes there
      for the Light. The noetic breath contacts indirectly the
      generative physical breath, that is, the fire current of the
      fourfold physical breath, in the head and there takes some of the
      Light off and back into the noetic atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      There is in the generative system other Light, Light which does
      not come out of nature, but comes through the pituitary body from
      the noetic atmosphere. Some of this Light is sent out monthly in
      the lunar germ to gather Light that has come in from nature.<br>
      <br>
      A lunar germ is made of matter of the four worlds and has mingled
      with it essential matter of the four worlds, that is, matter which
      has circulated so long that it has reached ultimate states of
      refinement. In addition to the general matter and to this
      essential matter, a lunar germ bears the impress of the doer and
      has in it consequently Light of the Intelligence. The lunar germ
      is material but invisible.<br>
      <br>
      Both the lunar germ and the seed or soil are builders of bodies.
      With the seed and the soil the outer physical body is started;
      with the lunar germ inner bodies may be built. The spermatozoa and
      ova are both as female to the lunar germ, and it is as male to
      them. Only the gross physical elements flow through the seed and
      the soil and these are deficient in finer forces of physical
      matter. A lunar germ supplies these deficiencies and has in it
      contacts for forces of the other three worlds. A lunar germ must
      be united to the seed or the soil to produce a body which is not
      entirely deficient. There ought to be for a proper human body a
      lunar germ in the seed and a lunar germ also in the soil.<br>
      <br>
      In each month, after puberty, the generative system produces one
      of these lunar germs in the pituitary body, (Fig. VI-A, a). When
      the lunar germ has matured and has life of its own it leaves the
      pituitary. It starts from there in a rudimentary way, on the right
      side, and passes down in the involuntary nervous system, having a
      little Light, which attracts other Light as it descends in the
      nerve plexuses supplying the digestive system in the abdomen,
      until it reaches the lowest point, (Fig. VI-B). From that point
      the lunar germ, having crossed over to the left side, ascends
      along the involuntary nervous system and is carried by the
      generative breath to the region of the left kidney.<br>
      <br>
      During all this time Light from food along the digestive tract,
      Light from blood and Light from the organs in the body attaches
      itself to the Light in the lunar germ for automatic reclamation.
      While a lunar germ is in existence and carries Light, it may be
      deprived of some of the Light by an outburst of anger or state of
      jealousy, envy or revenge, but it will always carry some Light
      until the germ is lost. It is lost in outgoing seed or soil. It is
      not connected with seed or soil until that is precipitated and
      lost.<br>
      <br>
      If the lunar germ has risen with its diffused Light to the region
      of the kidneys, some of that Light is taken away by the psychic
      breath and carried upward in the involuntary nervous system. The
      psychic breath is made to do this by the mental breath acting
      within it and obeying the pull of the noetic breath for Light.
      Then the mental breath takes the Light and carries it along the
      thoracic vertebrae to the region of the cervical vertebrae. The
      mental breath is made to do this by the noetic breath acting
      within it. The noetic breath takes the Light along the pons and
      the quadrigemina to the pineal body and into the noetic
      atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      This return of Light to the noetic atmosphere is automatic. It is
      done without the knowledge of the human and usually without the
      possibility of interference by him, though certain habits like the
      consumption of alcohol or of narcotics, or excessive sexuality,
      may hinder even the automatic reclamation.<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of automatic reclamation of a certain amount of Light
      is to keep enough in the mental atmosphere to furnish the human
      with the Light necessary to continue living and carrying on his
      activities as a human.<br>
      <br>
      The returning of Light from nature goes on continually in every
      human. Only a certain amount of Light is allowed by the Triune
      Self to its doer, and the doer must husband and reclaim what Light
      is loaned to it. Without this automatic process of reclamation a
      doer would soon be bankrupt and lost. In the noetic atmosphere
      moves in regular action the noetic breath. This carries Light of
      the Intelligence by inspiration into the physical body within the
      reach of nature, and carries by aspiration the available Light
      from the body, reclaimed from nature, back into the noetic
      atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      The usual means by which Light that has been in food is raised is
      carriage by a lunar germ. Such a germ is produced once a month,
      descends on the right side and in a week reaches the region of the
      solar plexus; in another week it reaches the large intestine and
      the lowest point of its descent and during the third week ascends
      to the kidneys, on the left side. Usually the lunar germ, after it
      has ascended to the region of the kidneys with the aid of the pull
      exercised by the generative breath on account of the noetic
      breath, drops back to the sexual organs and is lost. If it were
      not for the automatic protection which the monthly germ receives
      because of the noetic breath, the germ would be lost on its path
      downward from the solar plexus and would never ascend to the left
      kidney. The run of human beings would, owing to the pull of
      nature, become idiots in one life, if it were not for the
      automatic reclamation of Light and the protection which the lunar
      germ usually receives. For this reason the lunar germ cannot be
      lost on its path from the head to the solar plexus; from the solar
      plexus downward and then upward towards the left kidney it is
      protected; but from the kidney to the head, if it goes there at
      all, it can go only as the result of self-control .<br>

      </i><br>
      Automatic reclamation is done by the psychic breath taking Light
      away from the lunar germ, and along the nerves of the digestive
      system upward from the region of the left kidney and adrenal. The
      three stages of reclamation by self-control are made by the doer,
      the thinker, and the knower. Then these three parts of the Triune
      Self take off Light from the lunar germ and take the germ itself
      up the spinal cord of the voluntary nervous system. The basis of
      all four kinds of reclamation is the automatic process by which
      Light is, from food, prepared for the lunar germ.<br>
      <br>
      The first stage of voluntary reclamation of Light that has come
      into the body, is the recovery of that Light due to desire to do
      right. This first stage has to do with taking Light away from the
      lunar germ, with carrying that Light into the blood and to the
      heart and lungs and with raising the lunar germ itself from the
      lowest point to about the junction of the first lumbar and the
      twelfth dorsal vertebrae on the left side along the voluntary
      nervous system. The first stage of the reclamation of Light in the
      body is done by a human who does not want to be led by nature into
      doing things he feels that nature wants; who wants to be led into
      doing what is best for him and who does his duties, not
      grudgingly, but cheerfully. This relates especially to eating and
      sex, to the desires for possessions, a name or fame, and for
      power.<br>
      <br>
      If such control is the endeavor of a human his desire will,
      without his being conscious of it, take away some of the Light
      which is carried by the lunar germ when it has risen as high as
      the left kidney.<br>
      <br>
      After the psychic and the mental breaths have there taken some
      Light for the noetic atmosphere, in the course of the automatic
      saving, desire living in the blood may bear some of the remaining
      Light away in the blood stream. The only time when desire can get
      this Light is during one to three days of each month when a lunar
      germ is near the kidneys. The Light which desire gets in this way
      mingles with it, but does not blend. The human does not know about
      the reclamation, except that he may feel a slight sensation of
      cheer.<br>
      <br>
      In the blood there is bound Light and free Light. Light which was
      extracted from the digestive system of the body, is bound Light
      and cannot be taken up by desire until a lunar germ has extracted
      it. Light which desire has brought into the blood is free and
      remains free, until it is either reclaimed by thinking or until
      desire unites with the Light when the breath meets the circulatory
      system in the heart and lungs, and only when a thought is
      conceived or entertained.<br>
      <br>
      The run of human beings lose their lunar germs within the month,
      and with the lunar germ goes the Light that is in it. But if some
      Light is taken from the germ by the automatic reclamation, that
      much Light is returned by the psychic breath to the atmospheres
      and is saved for the time. If in addition some Light is taken by
      desire by this unwitting reclamation into the blood, that too is
      saved when the germ is lost and the remaining Light in it goes
      back into the circulations of nature.<br>
      <br>
      The second stage of the reclamation of Light that has come back
      into the body is reached, when a human is acquiring self-control
      by thinking. Pessimism, mysticism and asceticism are of no use.
      They hinder rather than help. It is not necessary that one should
      know anything about the phrases “Light of the Intelligence” or
      “reclamation.” It is enough that he intends what his inner One,
      his Father, the Light in him, shows to be right. Every human has
      that Light within, though he does not know it as such and does not
      do what it shows to be right. The second stage requires an
      attitude of mind akin to optimism, which favors honest and clear
      thinking, and an enjoyment of the pleasures of life with
      temperance and without hate, greed or envy. It requires as to his
      duties, that he should perform them willingly and understandingly.<br>
      <br>
      With the desire that brings the first degree of reclamation and
      with this attitude of mind, he develops, though he may at times
      slip back, a mental set that will result in voluntary reclamation.
      By this mental set his thinking will without his being conscious
      of it, extract Light that is free in the bloodstream and some of
      the Light that is bound in a thought and will even balance some
      thoughts. It may also raise the lunar germ along the voluntary
      nervous system up to the highest of the thoracic vertebrae.<br>
      <br>
      Thinking can get Light from circulating blood only while it is
      heart-blood and lung-blood, and only when rightness reigns and
      desire is in agreement with it.<br>
      <br>
      The seasons in the body present a favorable condition when the
      solar germ, descending and ascending in the two hemispheres of the
      spinal cord, is opposite the heart. This occurs twice a year,
      during the three days following the twenty-first days of June and
      of December. Getting Light in thinking is, however, not restricted
      to these favorable times; it may happen at any time, provided the
      lunar germ has risen above the kidneys.<br>
      <br>
      From heart-blood and lung-blood, thinking, by means of the mental
      breath acting through the respiratory breath, raises Light from
      the heart and from the lungs to the cerebellum and cerebrum.
      Thinking raises it by an effort to hold Light on a definite
      subject, such as who one is, and who one’s knower or Father in
      Heaven is. The thinking which reclaims Light is intent upon
      learning from the errors of the past. It is different from
      ordinary, haphazard, passive thinking. It is even more than active
      thinking on a matter of religion or philosophy. It is thinking so
      intended and restrained as to be active thinking on such subjects
      as immortality, the dweller in the body, truthfulness, chastity,
      honesty, the purpose of life or service and goodwill. It is active
      thinking with the definite aim of learning for personal moral and
      mental advancement. It overrides all obstacles of desires,
      allurements and weaknesses. It is accompanied by events in the
      body. When this sort of thinking goes on it prevents the Light
      circulating in the body from flowing out, and it empowers the
      lunar germ to take up more Light.<br>
      <br>
      During this effort Light in the mental atmosphere claims and takes
      Light from the heart-blood. When the blood-Light becomes mental
      Light and is taken away from desire, desire tries to follow the
      Light and so gives force to the thinking. Thinking carries the
      Light to the cerebellum and the cerebrum. The Light remains in
      that part of the noetic atmosphere in the brain which is related
      to the subject of the thinking.<br>
      <br>
      Thinking gets Light not only from heart-blood but also from
      thoughts, yet only under certain conditions. The thought must be
      in the heart or the lungs and the thinking must either be done in
      connection with the willing and understanding performance of a
      duty or must be thinking toward repudiation of the thought. Such
      thinking may produce two kinds of results. It may take away some
      of the Light from the thought, weakening it, and restore the Light
      to the mental atmosphere, or it may take away all of the Light
      because it balances the thought. The human is not conscious of the
      result produced by his thinking, but the effects of the reclaimed
      Light will be felt by him as lightness, airiness and vitality in
      the body and mental ease and the ability to see things more
      clearly.<br>
      <br>
      Thinking may extract some of the Light that is bound in a thought
      while the thought is in the heart or the lungs. It does this when
      it disapproves of the thought, and so draws Light away from it,
      thus limiting and retarding it.<br>
      <br>
      Thinking may also take all the Light out of a thought. When a
      thought has been conceived and is not yet issued, it is being
      gestated in the cerebellum and the cerebrum. There is a
      communication between the thought and the heart in which it was
      conceived. The thought is nourished by active and by passive
      thinking. If during this time the human determines to abandon the
      aim and the object of the thought, the thought is drawn back into
      the heart, and the Light is separated from the desire by thinking
      and is returned to the mental atmosphere from the heart and lungs.<br>
      <br>
      Light may also be reclaimed from a thought after the thought has
      been issued, but before it is exteriorized. The thought has then
      left the head through the frontal sinuses and is in the mental
      atmosphere. If the human decides to abandon the aim and the
      object, the thought goes to the part of the mental atmosphere
      which is in the heart and lungs. There thinking separates the
      Light from the desire, and the Light is transferred to the mental
      and the desire to the psychic atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      It may be that the thought was not exteriorized as a whole, but
      that only the design was exteriorized wholly, partially or in a
      modified form. In this case no Light is extracted. If the thought
      as a whole is exteriorized with the first exteriorization all the
      Light is extracted, otherwise the Light is extracted when the
      thought is balanced, which may not be until after many
      exteriorizations.<br>
      <br>
      A thought is balanced by thinking when feeling-and-desire are in
      agreement with each other and both are in agreement with rightness
      and that and reason are in agreement with selfness concerning the
      act, object or event, which had been witnessed by I-ness. Then the
      thinking extracts Light from the thought and transfers it to the
      pineal body where it is restored to the noetic atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      The Light can be extracted only when the thought is in the heart
      and lungs. In the first and second cases the decision to abandon
      the aim and object sends the thought there. In the third case,
      when the thought is balanced at the first exteriorization because
      of the mental attitude, this attitude calls it to the heart and
      lungs.<br>
      <br>
      It is different in cases which are reactions to results of the law
      of thought. There the balancing is done at a time when a thought
      cycle has brought the thought back to the heart and lungs for
      balancing, or when circumstances like mental associations,
      memories or an event cause the thought to be drawn suddenly into
      the heart and lungs, or when an abstract subject is thought of,
      such as destiny, living forever, service, or being conscious of
      the desire for self-knowledge. Then something affects the heart
      and lungs and compels the human to question.<br>
      <br>
      This probing and searching is the beginning of the third stage of
      voluntary reclamation, which is intentional and knowing. Sometimes
      the searcher finds what he looks for, sometimes he discovers what
      he did not expect. His thinking opens up the thought and by the
      Light it uses and the Light that is in the thought, shows him the
      feelings and desires in the thought as they truly are. When he
      acknowledges these to be as the Light shows that they are, and
      determines that he will make them as they should be, the Light of
      that thought goes with the Light in the mental atmosphere to the
      pineal body and is thence transferred to the noetic atmosphere,
      and the thought is balanced.<br>
      <br>
      The third stage of the reclamation of Light which has come into
      the body from nature is the recovery of the Light due to knowledge
      gained in the previous two stages. This knowledge is that he
      should not by his thinking attach himself to anything or attach
      anything to himself. The third stage is reached when a human
      applies this knowledge in his living. As he continues,
      encumbrances and interferences fall gradually away. He acquires
      confidence in action, strength in purpose, penetration in looking
      at a thing or a condition. Neither friends nor strangers influence
      him. Money, possessions and attainments cease to have attraction
      for him. He eats and drinks what will keep his body in health, he
      enjoys his food although he does not eat for the pleasure of
      eating. He is not bitter or sour any more than he is a hedonist.
      He attends to his occupations because they are his work. But all
      his effort in whatever he thinks or does or omits is to reclaim
      Light and not to bind it up again.<br>
      <br>
      With such a one, too, the automatic reclamation works better and
      is more effective than with one who knows or cares nothing about
      it. The voluntary reclamation is based on a more steady desire
      which controls all other desires, and on a mental set to reclaim
      Light, intentionally and intelligently. Thoughts that are balanced
      are one of two main sources of the Light that is reclaimed,
      although this is not known to the one who balances them and so
      obtains the Light that was in them. The other source is Light that
      is carried by a lunar germ into the head.<br>
      <br>
      The automatic protection of a lunar germ ends when it has come up
      as high as the left kidney; and the germ is lost, usually through
      sexual occupations, after the psychic breath has taken off some
      Light automatically. It may, however, be raised along the spinal
      cord in the region of the dorsal and the cervical vertebrae until
      it reaches the midbrain. There it arrives as a physically matured
      germ, and can when united with seed or soil, be used in the
      generation of a physical body, superior in health and strength to
      those that crowd the world. However, if it is preserved, it will
      unite with the next monthly germ which merges into it. Then it
      will descend and make a second round through the body, being
      automatically protected up to the left kidney. It will, if it is
      not lost, arrive at the head for the second time, at the end of
      the second lunar month, strengthened by additional Light it has
      gathered.<br>
      <br>
      While it is possible for one who has developed a lunar germ of
      higher degrees, that is, one carried for two, three or four
      months, to beget a body in which a doer more perfect than those in
      the bodies of the run of human beings may enter, and while indeed
      there have been men on the earth who were born from seeds
      containing lunar germs preserved for many lunations, it is also
      possible to retain the lunar germ into which the subsequent
      monthly lunar germs have merged, for the regeneration of the body,
      for self-impregnation and for the building of three inner bodies,
      in which the three parts of the Triune Self will live also in the
      form, life, and light worlds. When all of the subsequent lunar
      germs have been merged with the first, there is a divine
      conception in the head, because of the presence of the solar germ.<br>
      <br>
      The solar germ is a portion of the doer and it represents the
      Triune Self, and has with it some of the clear Light. It has no
      body of nature-matter, such as the lunar germ has. There is only
      one solar germ for each life, though the germ renews itself every
      year. It appears at puberty, in the pituitary body and descends in
      the right side of the spinal cord until, after about six months,
      it reaches the end of the cord proper at about the first lumbar
      vertebra, (Fig. VI-A, d). Then it turns and ascends in the left
      side, during about six months, and arrives at the pineal body.
      While it is in the head it renews itself and then starts on the
      next descent. It continues this through life. At the death of the
      body it becomes again one with the doer.<br>
      <br>
      The solar germ by its journeys, south and north in the spinal
      cord, patrols The Way. It keeps open the dwelling place of the
      Triune Self, while the three parts of the Triune Self, as at
      present, do not dwell in the spinal cord. With the run of human
      beings the solar germ does nothing more.<br>
      <br>
      Its potential activities depend upon the presence of a lunar germ
      in its field of operation. Every lunar germ must pass the solar
      germ at least once a year, that is, while the lunar germ is going
      down. With the run of human beings it does not pass the solar germ
      a second time.<br>
      <br>
      If a lunar germ is not lost, but on the return path to the head
      rises higher than the station at the lumbar vertebrae where the
      psychic breath takes off Light in the course of the automatic
      reclamation, it is near the path of the solar germ and within the
      field of its influence. The solar germ then assists the lunar
      germ, by giving it strength as well as a push or pull upwards. If
      a lunar germ is preserved so as to make the second round it
      receives additional assistance. So it is in each succeeding round.
      When a lunar germ has completed thirteen rounds within twelve
      months, having of course with it the twelve successive monthly
      germs which have merged into it, and having the Light it received
      each time it passed the solar germ, and returns to the head, it is
      met there by the solar germ and receives Light from it. With that
      Light is a direct ray of Light of the Intelligence. This is a
      self-impregnation or divine, immaculate, virgin conception, and
      from it begins the rebuilding of the physical body into an
      immortal physical body. With the rebuilding of the body is
      achieved the reclamation of all Light that has gone into and was
      outstanding in nature. Reclamation of all the Light cannot be
      accomplished except in a rebuilt physical body. In the measure
      that a human reclaims Light he becomes conscious of the Light in
      him, and with that conscious of himself as the doer.<br>
      <br>
      The rebuilding is begun by the lunar germ which has been preserved
      during thirteen lunations. It is accomplished when the body is
      two-columned and sexless. Not until then can all the Light from
      nature be reclaimed, and even then some Light in thoughts will
      still be outstanding. Human beings living in one-columned bodies
      cannot reclaim all the outstanding Light because such bodies have
      not the necessary organization.<br>
      <br>
      The only indication in any school or tradition of a rebuilding of
      the physical body into an immortal body is found in the Masonic
      teachings about Hiram Abiff, which is the lunar germ; about the
      broken column, which refers to the part missing below the sternum,
      (Fig. VI-E), and about the temple not made with hands, eternal in
      the heavens, which is the rebuilt, regenerated physical body.<br>
      <br>
      It is likely that about the time the Christian teachings
      originated, one man had succeeded in retaining a lunar germ for
      thirteen lunations, had consequently reclaimed Light and had
      become conscious of and as the Light of his Triune Self, his
      “Father in Heaven.” They could have given out teachings of how
      others could achieve this result. This event probably occurred at
      a time when a lesser cycle swung in, when men’s thoughts were
      stirred by Greek philosophy, doubt and dissatisfaction, when men
      were expecting something new and were made to prepare an
      atmosphere for its appearance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>p 480</b><b><br>

      The man must himself preserve the lunar germs, as well as his
      seed. If he does not preserve his seed he cannot preserve the
      lunar germ, which will be lost after the second week. The simple
      precepts of chastity and decency are all that is required as
      subjects of thinking and rules of conduct, in order to save the
      lunar germ and the seed. The age-old and always new revelations,
      books, mystic teachings, cults, brotherhoods and sisterhoods that
      present love and sex as anything else than matters of chastity and
      decency, are blinds for corruption. They have helped to bring on
      the noetic night...<br>
      <br>
      <b>p 554</b><br>
      <br>
      The flesh body is unstable, of short life and weak, when compared
      with nature and the doer, both of whom it serves. Its time of
      service is short. Soon upon its youth and vigor follows death. It
      is too feeble to stand the strain which nature and the doer put
      upon it. The doer should use it in the reclamation of the Light of
      the Intelligence from nature. When it is no longer capable of
      reclaiming Light automatically, its days are usually numbered.
      When the Light available to a human has been used up the body
      grows weaker and dies. The Light is as a tincture that gives
      vitality. The chief cause of the shortness of life and of the
      feebleness of the body is the absence of enough Light of the
      Intelligence. In this short time the body has hardly begun its
      life before it is withered by age or destroyed by disease...<br>
      <br>
      <b>p 577</b><br>
      <br>
      It is not a misuse of Light to send it out into nature to maintain
      its higher forms as plants, trees, animals or rocks, but it is a
      desecration of the Light to appropriate it to the vermin, pests
      and scourges of nature as does the run of human beings. If one’s
      thoughts put the Light which is loaned to the doer to legitimate
      uses, it is returned and sooner or later he learns from it what it
      went through while out in nature. That Light will enlighten him
      when he is thinking upon the subject with which the Light was
      connected. It will so show him the stupendous wonders of plant
      life and the molecular and atomic marvels of organic and inorganic
      nature, the actions of which it guided. The Light reclaimed will
      also affect his destiny more quickly than any other power. The
      Light shows one his destiny, how to deal with it, how to accept it
      and thereby to make the most of it.<br>
      <br>
      Nature seeks the doer for several purposes. It tries to get Light
      of the Intelligence which the doer has the use of, and to get the
      doer into nature, so as to have an association with
      feeling-and-desire, and with thinking from which it gets forms.
      Nature seeks this association so as to keep its units in
      circulation. It does this by having the doer transform elementals
      into sensations and then identifying itself with them while they
      are sensations. Human beings would not allow themselves to be so
      used if they were conscious of the true state of facts and of the
      illusion under which they live. So the illusion is allowed to
      continue until the doer is sufficiently advanced to perform its
      duties to nature and raise it, without being under any illusion.<br>
      <br>
      The illusion is produced by letting the doer feel that the four
      senses are part of itself and that other elementals either
      entering the body through these or already in the body are also
      part of itself, when it feels them as sensations...<br>

      The essential thing in life is to preserve, reclaim and free his
      Light and to think without creating thoughts, that is, without
      attachment. He must find out what he is not. He must find out what
      and who he is. He must rebuild his body into one that is
      deathless. He cannot be lost. He is never forgotten, never
      forsaken, never without the care and protection which he will
      allow himself to receive. He can feel and think of himself through
      all discomforts and troubles as being guarded and judged by his
      administrator, the thinker, known by his knower, guided by the
      Light of the Intelligence, and loved, cared for and supported by
      the Supreme Triune Self of the worlds under the Light of Supreme
      Intelligence...<br>

        <b>THE GREAT WAY</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Section 1</b><br>
      <br>
      The “Descent” of man. There is no evolution without, first,
      involution. The mystery of germ cell development. The future of
      the human. The Great Way. Brotherhoods. Ancient Mysteries.
      Initiations. Alchemists. Rosicrucians.<br>
      <br>
      In every age a few individuals do find The Great Way. They do
      conquer death by regenerating and restoring their bodies to the
      Realm of Permanence. But this is an individual and private affair
      of each such doer. The world does not know; other human beings do
      not know it. The world does not know because public opinion and
      the weight of the world would be opposed to it, and would hold
      back the doers who choose to regenerate their bodies and restore
      them to the Realm of Permanence.<br>
      <br>
      Before a human will even agree to the idea of a “Way” to a “Realm
      of Permanence,” he will have become estranged to the concept of an
      “ascent of man” or “evolution”; that is, that man, with his great
      gifts, has ascended from a mere speck of matter. On the contrary,
      he will have become convinced of the “descent” of man, from a
      higher estate to his present low condition in a perishable human
      body.<br>
      <br>
      Evolution is preceded by involution. There cannot be an evolution
      unless there has been an involution of what is to be evolved.<br>
      <br>
      It is not merely unreasonable, it is unscientific to suppose that
      any form of life can evolve from a germ cell that was not involved
      into that cell. An oak tree cannot evolve from the germ of a
      cabbage or a fern, even through countless developments from those
      germs. There must be the involution of an oak into its acorn in
      order that there can be the evolution from that acorn into an oak
      tree.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise every man or woman has descended into this human world of
      change from an ancestral sexless being of the Realm of Permanence.
      The descent has been made by variation, modification, mutation,
      and division. The evidence of this procedure is shown by
      spermatogenesis and by ovulation, of the spermatozoon and the ovum
      into gametes, marriageable cells. Each cell must be changed from
      its original state or condition, and be modified and divided,
      until it is a distinctly male or female sex cell. These changes
      and divisions re-enact the biological records of the history of
      the cells, from the time of the ancestral type of sexlessness
      until they become male or female sex cells.<br>
      <br>
      Heretofore no definite explanation has been given to account for
      these mysterious facts, but an understanding that the development
      of the sexes is the degeneration and departure from a former state
      of deathlessness into the lower human world of birth and death and
      re-existence, will explain the facts and open the way for
      understanding that there will be the return from the human to the
      former higher state. Here is part of the evidence:<br>
      <br>
      Science has furnished evidence that in both spermatogenesis and
      ovulation the germ cells must divide twice before the spermatozoon
      can enter into the ovum and begin the generation of a new male or
      female body. The reason is that the spermatozoon is at first a
      sexless cell. By its first division it puts off that of itself
      which is sexless and is transformed into a male-female part; but
      as such it is not yet fit to marry. By its second division it
      throws off its female part and is then a gamete, a marriageable
      cell, and is ready for copulation. Similarly, the ovum is at first
      sexless; it must be changed into a sex cell before it can marry.
      By its first division it rids itself of its sexless part and is
      then a female-male cell, unfit for marriage. By its second
      division the male part is discarded and it is then the female sex
      cell ready for marriage.<br>
      <br>
      For each life the history of the transition from an ancestral
      sexless body is re-enacted by each of the two germ cells. The
      changes which take place are determined by the thinking inscribed
      on the breath-form or living soul of the body through long series
      of lives of crucifixions and resurrections, each life being a
      crucifixion, followed by a return or resurrection. The breath-form
      has on it the original type of the sexless perfect body, but is
      changed into male or female according to the thinking of
      feeling-and-desire.<br>
      <br>
      The conscious self in the body is feeling-and-desire, which is
      symbolically nailed through the body of sex to its cross.<br>
      <br>
      Its cross is the invisible breath-form of the visible body. The
      body is the fleshly material of the body-cross.<br>
      <br>
      Feeling-and-desire is bound into the body-cross by nerves, desire
      is bound into the body-cross by blood.<br>
      <br>
      Sight, hearing, taste, and smell, are the four senses which are
      themselves a cross and which are the symbolical nails with which
      the conscious self is nailed to its breath-form cross.<br>
      <br>
      By breathing, the self of feeling-and-desire is kept on its
      breath-form cross throughout the life of its body-cross.<br>
      <br>
      When the self of feeling-and-desire gives up the breath, the body
      is dead. Then the self leaves the body-cross.<br>
      <br>
      But, as the conscious self, it continues with its breath-form
      cross through its after death states, (Fig. V-D).<br>
      <br>
      With its breath-form cross, the self will take on another
      body-cross of flesh and blood:—to be prepared for it for its next
      life on earth.<br>
      <br>
      The conscious self of feeling-and-desire will again take on the
      body-cross of flesh and blood, and will be nailed to the objects
      of nature by sight and hearing, and by taste and smell.<br>
      <br>
      So the conscious feeling-and-desire must continue its crucifixions
      life after life in this world of birth and death, until it
      regenerates its body of death into an everlasting body of life.
      Then, as the Son, it ascends and unites with its thinker and
      knower as the Father, the Triune Self complete in The Realm of
      Permanence from which it originally descended.<br>
      <br>
      Teachings about the mysteries and initiations were not about The
      Great Way.<br>
      <br>
      Information about The Great Way could not be made known to the
      rulers and conquerors, and the people who have made up the
      civilizations have been too savage and brutal. The civilizations
      have been based on conquest through murder.<br>
      <br>
      This is the first time in any historic period when, it is said,
      there is freedom of speech; and that one may choose to be, to
      think, and to do what he thinks best, especially if it is for the
      benefit of others. That is why information about The Great Way is
      now given—for those who choose and will.<br>
      <br>
      When The Great Way is made known to the few, they will make it
      known to the people. When it becomes generally known, those of the
      people who are weary of the treadmill of human life, who want
      something more than the glory of possessions and fame and
      pageantry and power, will rejoice at the good news of The Great
      Way. Then the few individuals who have made their destiny for The
      Way will be free to give the information to those who desire and
      choose to be on The Way.<br>
      <br>
      In the past, growths into the inner worlds were not unusual; in
      fact, that was the normal course of progress. And unless this
      civilization is brought to an end by continued rapacity and sexual
      indulgence out of season, they will in the future become frequent
      again. Then human beings will not have to go against the whole of
      nature, because their physical bodies will be developed along the
      lines here indicated. They will begin to rebuild a vertebrate
      column in front, (Fig. VI-D), containing a front- or nature-cord.
      Into this front-cord are blended the right and the left cords of
      the present involuntary nervous system. The cord branches out
      laterally and into the pelvis, abdomen, and thorax, replacing the
      internal organs there at present; its ramifications fill these
      cavities with nervous structures somewhat as the cephalic brain
      now fills the cavity of the skull. So there will eventually be
      four brains,—a brain, each, in the pelvis for the perfect body, in
      the abdomen for the doer, in the thorax for the thinker, and in
      the head for the knower. The bodies will have forms in which
      matter will become conscious in higher degrees more easily than it
      does at present.<br>
      <br>
      The doer-in-the-body is conscious mainly of feeling-and-desire
      and, to a lesser degree, of thinking, but it is not conscious as
      feeling-and-desire, nor as thinking; still less is it conscious as
      its identity. It is conscious of a difference between feeling and
      desiring, but not conscious of a difference between
      rightness-and-reason, as two different aspects of the thinker of
      the Triune Self. Nor is it conscious of its three minds of which
      human beings use chiefly the body-mind. Of conscience, which comes
      from selfness speaking through rightness, it is not conscious as
      coming from the higher source. It is not conscious of the three
      parts of its Triune Self and is not conscious of the Light of the
      Intelligence. It is conscious of nature as reported by the four
      senses, but is not conscious as nature, or even of nature in the
      flesh in which it dwells. It feels aches or comfort in parts of
      the body, but then it is conscious of feeling a sensation and not
      conscious as nature or as feeling. When there are sensations, that
      is, elementals playing on the nerves in which the feeling aspect
      of the doer is, the human is not conscious of or as the
      elementals, or that they are elementals, or even as feeling apart
      from these elementals, but he is conscious of the feeling as
      sensations. One does not know how to distinguish between himself
      as feeling and the sensations which he feels, and he must
      therefore become conscious of himself as that which feels, as
      distinct from the impression of nature that is made on feeling. To
      overcome these limitations the human must become conscious of his
      breath-form, of the way in which it operates, and of the actions
      of the four senses. When these limitations are overcome, the doer
      portion is conscious as feeling-and-desire, but the
      feeling-and-desire are heightened and refined. They take in the
      feeling-and-desire in all humanity, in nature in the body, and
      through that in nature outside.<br>
      <br>
      In the present age the stages in which human beings are conscious
      are so low that special training is required. They themselves must
      prepare themselves; they cannot get anyone to teach them or to do
      the work for them. They do this by learning from their
      experiences, through thinking.<br>
      <br>
      But what of the teachers, initiations, brotherhoods and lodges of
      which so much is heard? What of secret symbols, cryptic language
      and “The Way”? The answer is that these are not concerned with The
      Great Way here spoken of, which is found and traveled by the aid
      of the Light of the Intelligence. They are concerned with the
      legendary path, which at its best is only a related part of what
      is The Great Way. They have to do with symbols and language
      referring to the lunar germs, though not by that name, and to
      transformations in the physical body which the preservation of
      these germs brings about..<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      From the state in which each doer is at present, it must go on
      until it opens and travels the path which will lead it to the end
      of its re-existences. To determine to find The Way is simple, but
      is a most momentous undertaking. Every doer must some day enter
      upon The Way. The Great Way is a name here given to a Threefold
      Way: a certain Way in the physical body; a Way of thinking for the
      development of the human by thinking; and a Way on which the human
      travels inside the earth during this development. These three Ways
      are traveled together and at the same time, not separately and at
      different times; but they will be treated here as though separate
      and distinct.<br>
      <br>
      Each of these three Ways has three sections, called the form path,
      the life path, and the light path. On The Way in the body, the
      form path reaches from the end of the terminal filament to the
      beginning of the spinal cord proper; the life path reaches from
      there to the seventh cervical vertebra; and the light path reaches
      from there to the first cervical vertebra, (Fig. VI-D). On The Way
      of thinking, the form path ends with the ability to use the
      feeling-mind and the desire-mind; the life path ends with the
      ability to use the minds of rightness and of reason; and the light
      path is completed with the ability to use the minds of I-ness and
      of selfness. On The Way in the earth, the form path reaches from
      the entrance into the earth to the end of the first third of half
      the circumference of the inner crust; the life path ends when the
      second third has been traveled; the light path is the completion
      of half of the circumference of the inner earth.<br>
      <br>
      The Way in the body, though it leads to immortal life, is a closed
      road and must be opened by a lunar germ bearing Light. The form
      path of The Way in the body is the hollow within the terminal
      filament, which at present is a tubular thread from the coccyx to
      the spinal cord proper. This tube is now choked and sealed wholly
      or in part and can be opened only by a light bearer, a lunar germ,
      (Fig. VI-A, d).<br>
      <br>
      When a lunar germ, after descending on the right side, in the
      involuntary nervous system, generally speaking along the digestive
      tract, is not lost and has, by way of the coccygeal ganglion,
      ascended in the left side of the involuntary system to the region
      of the kidney, and passes upward, it will go to the head and
      complete its first round. As it descends again it is, if not lost,
      accompanied by the succeeding lunar germs, and is reinforced by
      the Light they carry and by Light of the solar germ. When the
      lunar germ returns to the head at the completion of its thirteenth
      round, Light issues from the solar into the lunar germ and there
      is a divine, a true “immaculate” conception. This is the initial
      step and factual basis of the development of the three embryonic
      bodies; it is analogous to the physical process, the lunar germ—in
      the female as well as the male—representing the ovum and the solar
      germ the spermatozoon. The lunar germ developing towards an
      embryonic form body, descends again in the right side of the
      involuntary nervous system along the digestive tract. After it has
      reached the lowest point in the pelvis it does not ascend on the
      left side to the region of the kidneys. It builds a bridge from
      what is now the coccygeal ganglion at the junction of the two
      cords of the involuntary nervous system, to the tip of the
      filament of the spinal cord, by way of nerves belonging to the
      voluntary system, goes across the bridge, opens the seal of the
      terminal filament and enters the filament through the opening,
      (Fig. VI-C).<br>
      <br>
      The lunar germ then is on the form path and travels through the
      terminal filament. The path leads to the central canal of the
      spinal cord proper, about the junction of the first lumbar and
      twelfth dorsal vertebrae. When the lunar germ has reached that
      point, the solar germ which went down in the right hemisphere of
      the spinal cord, meets it and both germs blend and go through the
      central canal of the spinal cord to the head. When the lunar germ
      has entered the central canal of the spinal cord the human has
      eternal life, that is, obligatory deaths and rebirths are at an
      end.<br>
      <br>
      What is here called the lunar germ ceases to be a mere germ after
      its impregnation in the head. In its descent along the nerves of
      the digestive system it begins to develop and when it enters
      through the opened seal into the filament it is ready to become
      the embryonic form body. So what was called the lunar germ
      traveling along the path, is a living embryonic form body
      traveling in the filament towards the central canal of the spinal
      cord, that is, towards eternal life. This will become in time the
      form body, the body of the doer, the psychic part of the Triune
      Self complete. When this embryonic body has reached the central
      canal of the spinal cord at about the upper level of the first
      lumbar vertebra, it has come to the end of the form path of The
      Way in the body. It is here that it is met by the solar germ. This
      is no longer a mere germ but it began to develop during its
      downward course in the right hemisphere of the spinal cord, and,
      after it had entered the central canal of the spinal cord and met
      there the form body, finally grew up into an embryonic life body,
      the body to be, of the thinker, the mental part of the Triune
      Self. Both these entities then ascend the central canal together,
      from the first lumbar to the seventh cervical vertebra.<br>
      <br>
      When the embryonic form body and the embryonic life body enter the
      cervical part of the central canal of the spinal cord, they are
      met there at the seventh cervical vertebra by a light germ from
      the pituitary body, which is to the solar germ what the solar germ
      is to the lunar germ; this is the beginning of the light path in
      the body and of the embryonic light body. This light germ started
      from the pituitary body, descended through the third and fourth
      ventricles to the pons and medulla oblongata, and into the central
      canal of the spinal cord which runs through the canal of the
      vertebrae. The light germ is always there, but its descent and
      consequent development into the light body depend upon the rising
      and coming of the life and form bodies to meet it in the central
      canal of the spinal cord at the seventh cervical vertebra. The
      light germ developing into the embryonic light body, accompanied
      by the embryonic life and form bodies, advances through the
      medulla oblongata and pons to the pineal body, (Fig. VI-A, a).<br>
      <br>
      At that time the pituitary sends a stream of Light through the
      canal of the infundibulum to the pineal body. The Light stream
      opens the pineal, the embryonic light body enters it and the head
      is filled with Light. Later, when the embryonic form, life and
      light bodies reach their full growth, are raised and issue, and
      the three parts of the Triune Self are in them, the doer has
      reached perfection, is of the complete Triune Self in a perfected,
      sexless, immortal, physical body and is at the end of The Great
      Way. The cause of these processes is the development of the doer,
      the psychic part of the Triune Self.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Section 3</b><br>
      <br>
      <i>The Way of thinking. Honesty and truthfulness as the foundation
        of progress. Physical, psychic, mental requirements. Changes in
        the body in the process of regeneration.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The second of the three Ways of The Great Way, The Way of
      thinking, begins when the human has run the gamut and is through
      with pleasure and pain, when the doer has reached the saturation
      point of experiences, and when the human inquires into the causes
      of human action and inaction, into the purpose of living, of
      health and disease, riches and poverty, virtues and vices, life
      and death. He then discovers a futility in human effort. Though
      discontent and restlessness are experienced by everyone, and
      though at times despondency comes and weariness and indifference,
      these states are not what is meant by that discovery.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery of the vanity, the emptiness of life, the discovery
      that no human possession is worth while, is a mental insight and
      is made when the human has reached the saturation point of human
      experiences. The desire of the doer can never be satisfied with
      physical things; but it can be gorged and surfeited with
      experiences of them, so that feeling cannot get anything more out
      of experiences. Still, feeling-and-desire are not satisfied and
      continue to drive the body-mind over the range of things that
      might satisfy. Then the body-mind, still driven by desire, makes
      the discovery to the doer of the futility of human effort.<br>
      <br>
      By a flash of interior Light the human sees the world as a
      whirligig. He sees that the objects and the situations which men
      desire revolve; that they have appeared and disappeared to him
      many times. He sees that these things are toys which attract
      people and hold the attention and interests in life. One set of
      toys gives place to another. The toys, though seemingly
      innumerable, are of a few types and patterns. They return
      endlessly and seem new when they come. The types are sex and its
      four desire generals, food, possessions, fame, and power. They
      spring from feeling-and-desire, which are never satisfied. Thereby
      feeling-and-desire cause the change and keep the whirligig going,
      make the toys, give them movement and color and ruin them. This
      goes on until feeling and desire each seeks the other in itself.
      The whirligig stops.<br>
      <br>
      With the discovery the castles, dungeons, playgrounds and
      workshops of the world break down and disappear, so far as value,
      attraction or repulsion goes.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery of the futility of all efforts and the state of
      emptiness that follows, eventually force the human to question who
      he is and to search into the recesses of his being for a way out
      of the emptiness. By hearing or reading or a flash from within, he
      becomes conscious that there is a way, and he desires to find it.
      This is a distinct understanding and a choice. He discovers that
      there are many things to be done and many things that must not be
      done, before he can find the way. The saturation disappears when
      there is a desire for the new way, the true way which lies beyond,
      past human events. Singleness of desire, and purpose to find and
      walk on the true way, start the feeling-mind and the desire-mind,
      before little used, and these bring more Light of the
      Intelligence.<br>
      <br>
      In the ordinary man, feelings, started by nature, influence
      desires; these compel rightness, which starts reason, and that
      reacts to feeling. Thus the rounds continue with passive and
      active thinking. But in the case of one who desires to follow his
      knower, from whom the Light comes, the round is reversed. The
      feelings are not started by nature from the outside, but the
      desires are started by rightness acting on feeling from within.
      Therefore, the Light which selfness sends to rightness rules the
      desires which cause the feelings to appeal to reason; so that the
      desires are more passive and the feelings are more active than in
      the run of human beings. Then reason goes to I-ness for Light and
      I-ness causes selfness to send Light to rightness. And so the
      rounds continue. This is the government from within, instead of
      the government from without which obtains with the run of human
      beings, (Fig. IV-B).<br>
      <br>
      The human then lives and works by the Light from within. He does
      not get that Light, which is a direct Light from his knower,
      continuously, but only in flashes and in response to his own
      efforts. After complying with the necessary requirements he has,
      eventually, an illumination and during that, finds that he is on
      The Way.<br>
      <br>
      The period from the time when a human first discovers the futility
      of human effort for the things of the world to the time he enters
      The Way, sees many changes in his environment, in his occupation,
      in his associations, in his inner life and in his physical body.
      The period covers the time it takes to save thirteen lunar germs
      which have become one, and for it to reach the coccygeal ganglion
      for the building of the bridge. There may have to be many
      re-existences of the doer after the choice is once made.<br>
      <br>
      A human may be in any environment when he makes the great
      discovery. He may be in a vast city, a small town, a hamlet or a
      lonely place; he may be engaged in any occupation, he may be a
      pork butcher, a jail guard or a party politician; he may have all
      sorts of acquaintances, associates and friends; his family ties
      may be close or loose; and his possessions may be great or small.
      All this will change; but not by a violent effort on his part.
      That is not to say he should be unconcerned about the duties which
      these connections impose on him, but means that he must not be
      attached by liking or disliking.<br>
      <br>
      One’s surroundings, his work and his ties will change naturally,
      as his thinking changes, after he has made the choice. It is not
      for him to decide for changes and to move by his own efforts out
      of present conditions. He must wait, wait until opportunities for
      change present themselves. He should not make opportunities. He
      lives in a certain environment and is held by the various ties of
      and duties to locality, nation, race, friendship, family,
      marriage, position and possessions, because there is a purpose.
      Ties cannot be broken; they must be worn away or must fall away.
      Even possessions should not be done away with to be rid of them;
      one has them for a purpose; they mean responsibilities and trust
      and one must answer for them and his stewardship. They, too, will
      disappear naturally if they are in the way of his advance. There
      is in these outward conditions no mark, no criterion by which the
      world can distinguish from the run of human beings one who has
      made the great discovery and has made his choice for an inward
      life.<br>
      <br>
      As he progresses by thinking and by leading the life, his body
      will change and he will gradually retire from the world,
      inconspicuously and without attracting any attention.<br>
      <br>
      Though there is no standard in outward things, in the scenery in
      which he lives, there are standards to which he must have attained
      in his psychic nature, in his mental set and activities and in his
      physical make-up before he can enter The Great Way.<br>
      <br>
      The stages through which one passes before he reaches the psychic
      standard to enter The Way, vary with different persons, but this
      standard which must be reached by all is substantially the same
      for all. Honesty and truthfulness must be the foundation of his
      character. His unequivocal feeling-and-desire must be to see
      things as they are, else preferences and prejudices will unseat
      his judgment and lead him astray.<br>
      <br>
      The standard for his psychic nature is that feeling-and-desire are
      in agreement to gain The Great Way, above all things. Ordinarily
      feeling-and-desire are not in agreement; before they are in
      agreement he has to go a long way, and many things will happen to
      him.<br>
      <br>
      When after his great discovery he desires to look for the Light
      within, the saturation ceases. To be cloyed and to choose to get
      out of the world is one thing, to be free from it so that it has
      no claim, is quite another. The saturation is a saturation with
      the world, with its outward life and gifts and attractions, a
      world-sickness. It chokes up the cloyed feelings and desires. When
      they are turned towards an inward life new realms of experience
      are opened and new objects are to be attained. The cloyed feelings
      and desires go into the new realms and as they find objects there
      the saturation ceases.<br>
      <br>
      The feelings and desires had not overcome the old things which
      cloyed them. They are still slaves of nature when they go away
      from it and turn to an inward life; they are slaves, although
      slaves who demand their freedom.<br>
      <br>
      The old things have renewed attractions and new attractions;
      renewed attractions because the old ones were not overcome, and
      new ones because things are looked at from a new point of view.
      Both of these attractions are great, greater than they would be
      with an ordinary person. Formerly he went along with them and now
      he fights them; now the pull of nature behind and through its
      things is stronger, as nature can now get more Light than from the
      ordinary person. Therefore as one seeks The Way and accumulates a
      little Light he is apt to make missteps. However often he fails,
      if he continues his efforts for an inward life, he will go on.<br>
      <br>
      The psychic standard requires, second, certain moral
      qualifications. The moral aspect of his psychic nature is of
      course interlinked with the rightness of the mental part, the
      thinker. Ingratitude, malice, rancor, hatred, envy, anger,
      vindictiveness; jealousy, meanness, greed, fretfulness,
      restlessness, gloom, despondency, discontent, fear, cowardice,
      voluptuousness and cruelty must be strangers to him. He must have
      become estranged so that they are not his usual, or occasional or
      recurring visitors. It means that if they approach they are
      unwelcome because he has grown to be out of touch with them. They
      are now not natural to him, there is no room for them because he
      is surcharged with a power that comes from his new method of
      living. He is chaste, friendly, kindly, brave, temperate and firm.<br>
      <br>
      The psychic standard requires, third, with all this, a fineness of
      feeling. It also requires, fourth, that psychic powers and the
      finer side of the four senses be not employed and that though one
      be sensitive to astral impressions he is not influenced by them.<br>
      <br>
      The mental standard one must have reached before he can enter The
      Way relates to mental quality, mental attitude and a mental set,
      all of which will manifest in a certain kind of thinking which
      will produce the psychic and the physical standards. His mental
      quality must be such that dishonesty and untruthfulness are
      abhorrent to him. Deceit, hypocrisy, pride, vanity and arrogance
      must be strangers. He must be honest with himself,
      self-restrained, self-contained, and modest withal. His mental
      attitude must present friendliness generally, that is, the
      recognition that he is a related part of the whole; a readiness to
      perform his duties with joy if they relate to The Way and with
      willingness if they relate to other things; a determination to
      respond to rightness; and a reverence for and an eagerness to
      receive Light of the Intelligence. His mental set must be for one
      point only and that is, to be on The Way.<br>
      <br>
      The standard for the body is that it has preserved the germs of
      thirteen lunar months. Ordinary nerve matter cannot hold a lunar
      germ much more than one month. To preserve thirteen a new,
      special, finer, fourfold nervous structure has to be grown within
      the old. At any time while this new structure grows it may be
      broken down. Malice and malcontent encrust, rancor tears, hatred
      withers, envy rots, jealousy, greed and salaciousness eat into,
      anger consumes, vindictiveness contracts, meanness dries up,
      fretfulness and restlessness unsteady, sullenness stifles, gloom
      deadens, despondency wears away, fear paralyzes, cowardice
      shrinks, voluptuousness wastes, licentiousness softens, lust
      burns, cruelty scars the finer nervous structure, and ingratitude
      shuts off the Light and leaves one in ignorance of his relation to
      his Triune Self and to humanity.<br>
      <br>
      The body must be healthy and strong. Any food will do if it
      supplies what the body needs for health. Food should not be a fad
      and has little or nothing to do with the goal, that is, the
      preservation of the thirteen lightbearers, except that one should
      be temperate and should not eat too little or too much. Beverages,
      whatever they are, must be free from alcohol. The body must not
      sleep too much, or too little. It must not be abused by fasting,
      discomforts or other kinds of asceticism. Torturing the flesh will
      not bring anyone to or near The Great Way. The body must be kept
      healthy and strong, and all that is necessary for this is the
      steady living of a simple, temperate and chaste life. The body
      must not be governed from without by nature, but from within by
      thinking.<br>
      <br>
      During the thinking, the living and the striving, which is the
      special preparation for entrance upon The Great Way, the body
      undergoes certain changes. The thymus gland becomes active and
      works with the thyroid. The gut will be less of a sewer. The
      stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon become shorter and
      smaller. During the rounds of the lunar germs in the body the
      nervous currents are regulated by the lunar germs and gradually
      strengthened, so that a new and inner nervous structure grows up.
      The involuntary nerves of the digestive system begin to form a
      structure which eventually will be similar to that of the
      voluntary nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      The length of time it takes from the discovery that the world has
      been a whirligig for countless years and ever disappoints
      expectation, to the entering upon The Way, varies with human
      beings. After the discovery and the choice for an inward life
      there is usually a steady progress, for a time. Then the world,
      which is nature, exercises its pull effectively, because some of
      the thoughts which have not been balanced by the human, aid nature
      when their cycles tend toward exteriorization. The human may get
      discouraged and may fall back into the world. When he is again
      sick of the world, he looks again for an inward life.<br>
      <br>
      When death has intervened between his flounderings, he is reborn
      with an inclination to recognize the futility of an outward life.
      He will at some time in that or in the next life make the
      discovery again, and it will not strike him as being strange; he
      will make the choice and seek to attain to The Way and perhaps
      fail again. In a new life it is natural for him to see that life
      is empty; when the time comes he will again make the choice for
      the road that will lead to The Way. Once one has made the
      discovery and made the choice, he will be led towards The Way,
      even though he does not again make the discovery. Failures cannot
      prevent, they will only delay the finding of The Way. Failures are
      incidents, and sometimes they are unavoidable because of past
      thoughts; they are often blessings in disguise and cannot hold
      back one who is determined to strive for The Way, after he has
      once made his choice.<br>
      <br>
      Having now in it a lightbearer, that is, a lunar germ into which
      will merge the germs of the next twelve months and which has now
      begun to grow, the human eventually enters The Way when the
      lightbearer opens the seal and enters the filament, (Fig. VI-C,
      D).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Section 4</b><br>
      <br>
      <i>Entering The Way. A new life opens. Advances on the form, life,
        and light paths. The lunar, solar, and light germs. Bridge
        between the two nervous systems. Further changes in the body.
        The perfect, immortal, physical body. The three inner bodies for
        the doer, the thinker, the knower of the Triune Self, within the
        perfect physical body.</i><br>
      <br>
      When one enters The Way he is away from all his connections and
      associations. The world in which he has lived is left behind. The
      human, by the opening of the seal and entrance on The Way, feels a
      great joy, such as he has never before felt. The joy is not
      thrilling, spasmodic or ecstatic; it is steady and from a source
      within. All things seem to reflect that joy. The joy is feeling
      progressively safety, permanence and assurance that he will come
      into his own. The joy can last for months.<br>
      <br>
      Gradually a new life opens. It extends from within and reaches the
      outer world. Everything is different from what it seemed before.
      The world has not changed, but it looks different because he and
      his body are different, he knows himself to be a being distinct
      from nature and from his body. He identifies feeling, if he has
      not done so before.<br>
      <br>
      He seems to be in the heart of the world. Before, he felt its
      pull, now he feels its pulse. Before, only the outer world could
      act on him, now an inner world, the form world, begins from within
      to open to him. There is a direct interplay between the
      doer-in-the-body and the non-embodied portions of the doer. The
      psychic atmosphere is felt; and through the physical atmosphere is
      felt the form world.<br>
      <br>
      By feeling this new world he is able to feel nature in the
      physical world and how things act and move as they do.<br>
      <br>
      He feels the crystallization of minerals, the seeding, feeding,
      growing and dying of plants, the impulses and instincts of
      animals, the movements of the earth, of the water and of the air,
      the influences coming from and going to the sun and the moon, the
      interaction of the planets and the beings on the earth, and the
      relation of the stars to mankind and the universe. He feels all
      these in their four zones working within the four systems of his
      fourfold body and he feels the organs of his systems working in
      the universe.<br>
      <br>
      There comes a tendency to be clairvoyant and clairaudient. Scenes
      and persons flash across the view. If he thinks of anyone, that
      one is seen and his voice is heard, without intention or effort to
      see or hear. The tasting or smelling of objects comes without
      seeking, when they are thought of. The inner side of the four
      senses seeks to manifest. The senses begin to act in the fluid,
      airy and radiant states as they did in the subdivisions of the
      solid state. These phenomena must be disregarded; this inner side
      of the senses must not be allowed to develop, else the inner life
      will flow outward.<br>
      <br>
      At this period the wish for possessions or the wish to see or
      communicate with elementals will be fulfilled at once, because
      elemental beings which obey the powers working within him carry
      out his wishes. These elementals are hidden from him unless he
      wants to see them and command them. He has not yet transformed
      malice, anger, hatred, lust and the other vices into higher powers
      though he has control of their physical expression; if he should
      allow an old dislike to make him wish harm to anyone, or allow a
      liking to cause him to wish a gift to someone, he would unleash
      nature forces which he had controlled and they would throw him off
      The Way. Longing for or attachment to anything he has left behind
      will pull him back and away from The Way.<br>
      <br>
      The feeling-mind and the desire-mind gradually control the
      body-mind, as these develop. New mental activities develop. The
      man on The Way now deals with the constituents, combinations and
      solvents of the matter of the different planes of the physical
      world and of the planes up to the life plane of the form world. He
      can deal with this matter as it is, as a fact, and not in a
      theoretical manner. He need use no instruments other than the
      organs of his fourfold body and the three minds. By this mental
      working he changes the matter of his body and aids the growing
      form body.<br>
      <br>
      During this advance there are periods of exaltation, depression
      and illumination. They are caused by the exclusion of the
      surrounding chaos and the infusion of life into the growing form
      body. He no longer feels himself out into the world, but feels the
      outer world within his fourfold body. The beings, colors and
      sounds of thousandfold nature are within this body. The elemental
      matter of the earth, the water, the air and the starlight, flows
      through his body and he is conscious of it. He becomes accustomed
      to and intimate with nature. If he allows himself to be tempted to
      wield the forces which move through his body or to command nature
      outside of him by the power within him, he is off The Way.<br>
      <br>
      He must not feel temptation. It must be a stranger to him. When
      the fullness of nature is within him and there is no inducement
      for him to interfere with it and to exercise his power over it,
      except to exclude influences adverse to the development of the
      form body, nature falls away. Then he is alone and in darkness.<br>
      <br>
      The mental standard one must have reached before he can enter The
      Way relates to mental quality, mental attitude and a mental set,
      all of which will manifest in a certain kind of thinking which
      will produce the psychic and the physical standards. His mental
      quality must be such that dishonesty and untruthfulness are
      abhorrent to him. Deceit, hypocrisy, pride, vanity and arrogance
      must be strangers. He must be honest with himself,
      self-restrained, self-contained, and modest withal. His mental
      attitude must present friendliness generally, that is, the
      recognition that he is a related part of the whole; a readiness to
      perform his duties with joy if they relate to The Way and with
      willingness if they relate to other things; a determination to
      respond to rightness; and a reverence for and an eagerness to
      receive Light of the Intelligence. His mental set must be for one
      point only and that is, to be on The Way.<br>
      <br>
      The standard for the body is that it has preserved the germs of
      thirteen lunar months. Ordinary nerve matter cannot hold a lunar
      germ much more than one month. To preserve thirteen a new,
      special, finer, fourfold nervous structure has to be grown within
      the old. At any time while this new structure grows it may be
      broken down. Malice and malcontent encrust, rancor tears, hatred
      withers, envy rots, jealousy, greed and salaciousness eat into,
      anger consumes, vindictiveness contracts, meanness dries up,
      fretfulness and restlessness unsteady, sullenness stifles, gloom
      deadens, despondency wears away, fear paralyzes, cowardice
      shrinks, voluptuousness wastes, licentiousness softens, lust
      burns, cruelty scars the finer nervous structure, and ingratitude
      shuts off the Light and leaves one in ignorance of his relation to
      his Triune Self and to humanity.<br>
      <br>
      The body must be healthy and strong. Any food will do if it
      supplies what the body needs for health. Food should not be a fad
      and has little or nothing to do with the goal, that is, the
      preservation of the thirteen lightbearers, except that one should
      be temperate and should not eat too little or too much. Beverages,
      whatever they are, must be free from alcohol. The body must not
      sleep too much, or too little. It must not be abused by fasting,
      discomforts or other kinds of asceticism. Torturing the flesh will
      not bring anyone to or near The Great Way. The body must be kept
      healthy and strong, and all that is necessary for this is the
      steady living of a simple, temperate and chaste life. The body
      must not be governed from without by nature, but from within by
      thinking.<br>
      <br>
      During the thinking, the living and the striving, which is the
      special preparation for entrance upon The Great Way, the body
      undergoes certain changes. The thymus gland becomes active and
      works with the thyroid. The gut will be less of a sewer. The
      stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon become shorter and
      smaller. During the rounds of the lunar germs in the body the
      nervous currents are regulated by the lunar germs and gradually
      strengthened, so that a new and inner nervous structure grows up.
      The involuntary nerves of the digestive system begin to form a
      structure which eventually will be similar to that of the
      voluntary nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      The length of time it takes from the discovery that the world has
      been a whirligig for countless years and ever disappoints
      expectation, to the entering upon The Way, varies with human
      beings. After the discovery and the choice for an inward life
      there is usually a steady progress, for a time. Then the world,
      which is nature, exercises its pull effectively, because some of
      the thoughts which have not been balanced by the human, aid nature
      when their cycles tend toward exteriorization. The human may get
      discouraged and may fall back into the world. When he is again
      sick of the world, he looks again for an inward life.<br>
      <br>
      When death has intervened between his flounderings, he is reborn
      with an inclination to recognize the futility of an outward life.
      He will at some time in that or in the next life make the
      discovery again, and it will not strike him as being strange; he
      will make the choice and seek to attain to The Way and perhaps
      fail again. In a new life it is natural for him to see that life
      is empty; when the time comes he will again make the choice for
      the road that will lead to The Way. Once one has made the
      discovery and made the choice, he will be led towards The Way,
      even though he does not again make the discovery. Failures cannot
      prevent, they will only delay the finding of The Way. Failures are
      incidents, and sometimes they are unavoidable because of past
      thoughts; they are often blessings in disguise and cannot hold
      back one who is determined to strive for The Way, after he has
      once made his choice.<br>
      <br>
      Having now in it a lightbearer, that is, a lunar germ into which
      will merge the germs of the next twelve months and which has now
      begun to grow, the human eventually enters The Way when the
      lightbearer opens the seal and enters the filament, (Fig. VI-C,
      D).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Section 4</b><br>
      <br>
      <i>Entering The Way. A new life opens. Advances on the form, life,
        and light paths. The lunar, solar, and light germs. Bridge
        between the two nervous systems. Further changes in the body.
        The perfect, immortal, physical body. The three inner bodies for
        the doer, the thinker, the knower of the Triune Self, within the
        perfect physical body.</i><br>
      <br>
      When one enters The Way he is away from all his connections and
      associations. The world in which he has lived is left behind. The
      human, by the opening of the seal and entrance on The Way, feels a
      great joy, such as he has never before felt. The joy is not
      thrilling, spasmodic or ecstatic; it is steady and from a source
      within. All things seem to reflect that joy. The joy is feeling
      progressively safety, permanence and assurance that he will come
      into his own. The joy can last for months.<br>
      <br>
      Gradually a new life opens. It extends from within and reaches the
      outer world. Everything is different from what it seemed before.
      The world has not changed, but it looks different because he and
      his body are different, he knows himself to be a being distinct
      from nature and from his body. He identifies feeling, if he has
      not done so before.<br>
      <br>
      He seems to be in the heart of the world. Before, he felt its
      pull, now he feels its pulse. Before, only the outer world could
      act on him, now an inner world, the form world, begins from within
      to open to him. There is a direct interplay between the
      doer-in-the-body and the non-embodied portions of the doer. The
      psychic atmosphere is felt; and through the physical atmosphere is
      felt the form world.<br>
      <br>
      By feeling this new world he is able to feel nature in the
      physical world and how things act and move as they do.<br>
      <br>
      He feels the crystallization of minerals, the seeding, feeding,
      growing and dying of plants, the impulses and instincts of
      animals, the movements of the earth, of the water and of the air,
      the influences coming from and going to the sun and the moon, the
      interaction of the planets and the beings on the earth, and the
      relation of the stars to mankind and the universe. He feels all
      these in their four zones working within the four systems of his
      fourfold body and he feels the organs of his systems working in
      the universe.<br>
      <br>
      There comes a tendency to be clairvoyant and clairaudient. Scenes
      and persons flash across the view. If he thinks of anyone, that
      one is seen and his voice is heard, without intention or effort to
      see or hear. The tasting or smelling of objects comes without
      seeking, when they are thought of. The inner side of the four
      senses seeks to manifest. The senses begin to act in the fluid,
      airy and radiant states as they did in the subdivisions of the
      solid state. These phenomena must be disregarded; this inner side
      of the senses must not be allowed to develop, else the inner life
      will flow outward.<br>
      <br>
      At this period the wish for possessions or the wish to see or
      communicate with elementals will be fulfilled at once, because
      elemental beings which obey the powers working within him carry
      out his wishes. These elementals are hidden from him unless he
      wants to see them and command them. He has not yet transformed
      malice, anger, hatred, lust and the other vices into higher powers
      though he has control of their physical expression; if he should
      allow an old dislike to make him wish harm to anyone, or allow a
      liking to cause him to wish a gift to someone, he would unleash
      nature forces which he had controlled and they would throw him off
      The Way. Longing for or attachment to anything he has left behind
      will pull him back and away from The Way.<br>
      <br>
      The feeling-mind and the desire-mind gradually control the
      body-mind, as these develop. New mental activities develop. The
      man on The Way now deals with the constituents, combinations and
      solvents of the matter of the different planes of the physical
      world and of the planes up to the life plane of the form world. He
      can deal with this matter as it is, as a fact, and not in a
      theoretical manner. He need use no instruments other than the
      organs of his fourfold body and the three minds. By this mental
      working he changes the matter of his body and aids the growing
      form body.<br>
      <br>
      During this advance there are periods of exaltation, depression
      and illumination. They are caused by the exclusion of the
      surrounding chaos and the infusion of life into the growing form
      body. He no longer feels himself out into the world, but feels the
      outer world within his fourfold body. The beings, colors and
      sounds of thousandfold nature are within this body. The elemental
      matter of the earth, the water, the air and the starlight, flows
      through his body and he is conscious of it. He becomes accustomed
      to and intimate with nature. If he allows himself to be tempted to
      wield the forces which move through his body or to command nature
      outside of him by the power within him, he is off The Way.<br>
      <br>
      He must not feel temptation. It must be a stranger to him. When
      the fullness of nature is within him and there is no inducement
      for him to interfere with it and to exercise his power over it,
      except to exclude influences adverse to the development of the
      form body, nature falls away. Then he is alone and in darkness.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Section 5</b><br>
      <br>
      <i>The Way in the earth. The ongoer leaves the world. The form
        path; what he sees there. Shades of the dead. “Lost” portions of
        doers. The choice.</i><br>
      <br>
      Having described The Way in the body and The Way of thinking,
      there remains to be treated the third of The Threefold Way, The
      Way in the earth, on which the progress described in the foregoing
      sections is enacted.<br>
      <br>
      When the ties have fallen away, when there are no obligations to
      family, community and country, and when he feels no attachment,
      the human leaves and is lost sight of by his associates in the
      world. At that time he feels a desire to go away and has the means
      for so doing. He becomes an ongoer and prepares for the form path.
      The manner of his going is inconspicuous and natural. He goes to
      live among simple people, not to be a hermit or ascetic, but to
      lead a simple, orderly, unnoticed life. There he is in an
      atmosphere of simplicity and adjusts his body to the gradual
      changes which his thinking and feeling bring about. His work, his
      business, his study is thinking, only thinking, to obtain the use
      and control of his body-mind, feeling-mind, and desire-mind. He
      will encounter dangers, not as spectacular trials, but in the
      ordinary course of his life, to establish confidence and
      equanimity. Though he moves among the people of a tribe or
      village, he has little commerce with them. He has only one
      associate and that is a companion.<br>
      <br>
      It may be that the companion meets the ongoer before the ties have
      fallen away or after the travels have begun or while the stay
      among the simple people lasts. From the time the companion meets
      the ongoer, he is with him and travels with him.<br>
      <br>
      The companion is a human being but one acquainted with the forces
      of the four planes of the earth and with human nature. He usually
      belongs to a fraternity whose purpose is to study and use forces
      of nature and that has an understanding of the history of the
      doer. It is made up of men who live in the world, but in secluded
      places. They are outposts in different parts of the globe; some of
      them lived in America before the Spaniards came. Many of them can
      command some elemental beings and have rare psychic and mental
      powers. They know and can make use of certain laws of nature of
      which science, comparatively speaking, knows little or nothing.
      While they are secluded they may, when necessary, move among
      throngs; they have played a part in all crises in history; if
      mentioned they are usually called names meaning skill in control
      of forces or objects of nature. This fraternity, with different
      orders, is a way station and outpost where ongoers towards The
      Great Way, who cannot go on, remain and learn. Among the duties of
      a member of this fraternity is that of being a companion to an
      ongoer when necessary. The companion, though he may live hundreds
      of years, will die sometime, but the ongoer will conquer death.<br>
      <br>
      When the companion meets the ongoer and makes himself known, he
      may ask what his destination is and on being told, he may say: “I
      am here to help you on a part of the journey. Are you ready to go
      on and to have me as your guide? If you take me you must trust me
      and go where I shall lead you. If you do not, you will not find
      the way alone and you will fall back into the world.” The ongoer
      accepts the companion, understanding that he is sent by those who
      know, and with the approval of his own knower.<br>
      <br>
      The companion informs him about the form and structure of the
      outer earth crust, about states of matter, how they
      interpenetrate, about racial developments and external nature,
      about the cycles of religions and about the fraternity to which
      the companion belongs. Together the companion and the ongoer go
      from place to place. Their journeys may be less than a hundred
      miles or they may take in a large part of the surface of the earth
      and consume weeks or years, until the ongoer is familiar with the
      earth, and his nerves are so tested and under control that he can
      continue his journey.<br>
      <br>
      When the time comes the companion leads the ongoer to an opening
      into the earth. It may be in a forest, in a mountain or under a
      building where no opening is seen. It may be under water or where
      gases issue or in a volcano. The companion bids his friend, who
      knows he may never see him again, farewell, and a new guide
      appears.<br>
      <br>
      The ongoer and his guide leave the surface and enter the earth.
      That is, for the ongoer, the beginning of the form path. Shortly
      before this time or soon after, the lunar germ enters the
      filament.<br>
      <br>
      The guide has the human form, has usually a moon colored body, is
      neither man or woman. He belongs to another race of beings, speaks
      the language of the ongoer and has an understanding far beyond
      that of a human being. The ongoer feels strange and the guide
      knows it. There is no announcement. They go on together from
      daylight into darkness. Gradually the ongoer becomes accustomed to
      the darkness and sees by a new kind of light. The guide points
      out, here and there, sections through which they are passing, and
      the ongoer develops the ability to see outlines and then distinct
      forms and colors, in the dark. This requires the training of the
      eye as an instrument, of the nervous systems as a whole, and of
      the breath-form.<br>
      <br>
      They come to a new world, inside the earth crust, a world existing
      on many levels. At first the ongoer is limited by the one
      dimension, on-ness, which is a barrier to perception as on the
      outer crust, where one cannot see within surfaces. Slowly he
      develops the power to perceive a second dimension, in-ness, to see
      within and between surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      The new world is like spaces in a sponge; but some of the
      chambers, passages and labyrinths are vast in size, hundreds of
      miles long and high, and some only small pockets. The structure of
      the floors and walls ranges in density from that of metal to
      porosity and the lightness of foam. Some of them are drab, others
      are colored similarly to but often more delicately or brilliantly
      than landscapes on the outer surface. The ongoer sees great
      mountains, vast plains, cauldrons of fluids churning and lashing
      where earth currents coming in meet the outgoing earth forces. He
      sees where currents of air strike fluid substances and burst into
      flame, forming rivers of fire. He sees strange things in many
      colors, among them an immense desert of what looks like a white
      powder, amidst which cliffs, some of crystal, rise. He sees quiet
      surfaces of water and of other fluids, in lakes hundreds of miles
      in length.<br>
      <br>
      No sun, no moon and no stars are seen. There is no visible central
      source of light, but he sees either the distant roofs of the
      chambers or limitless air lit by an inner earth light, which is
      made by a mingling of transient units. There is no night and no
      day. There are no shadows, except at the outer limits of the inner
      earth light, and even they have no distinct outline.<br>
      <br>
      In some chambers are fierce winds, in others a calm. The air is
      colder in some districts than anything known on the crust. In some
      places the heat is so severe that human flesh could not endure it,
      but ordinarily the temperature is agreeable to the body. He
      travels on foot or at times in vehicles made of metal or
      compositions drawn from the air, and gliding with speed over the
      ground.<br>
      <br>
      Two regions he cannot cross, one because the ground holds him, as
      a magnet holds a needle, the other because the ground repels his
      body. The vehicle glides like a sled over the magnetic ground, but
      the repellent ground cannot be traveled by him. He has to cross
      and recross the magnetic ground in his sled until it loses its
      attraction for him. Then he approaches the repellent ground and
      attempts to cross it, returning after each failure to the magnetic
      ground to get strength, until the matter has no longer power to
      attract or repel him. The overcoming of these forces regulates the
      structure of the cells in his body so that they are neither male
      nor female.<br>
      <br>
      He travels on water in a boat propelled by a water force; he
      crosses oceans, one below the other, greater than the Atlantic and
      much deeper. The ongoer sees forests, single trees and plants,
      arranged as they grow on the earth, but there is much that would
      seem strange to human beings. Green is not the prevailing color.
      In some sections it is absent. In different districts and on
      different levels different colors predominate. The foliage is red,
      blue, green, pink, black or shining white, and some of it is many
      colored. Some leaves are geometrical in form, some are globular,
      some twenty feet long. There are edible flowers, fruits, grains;
      some are cultivated, some grow wild.<br>
      <br>
      He sees animals, some of them like those on the outer crust and
      many of strange types. On the levels nearest to the outer crust
      are some ferocious beasts. They live where there are degenerate
      tribes and fierce races. In the regions farther inside the animals
      are strange, but docile and friendly. Few of them have tails. Many
      have no teeth. In shape some of them are graceful. The types of
      the animal forms are furnished by thoughts of the human races
      inside; what animates these creatures are parts of the cast-off
      feelings and desires of those human races.<br>
      <br>
      As the eyes of the ongoer are being trained to focus, he sees that
      there are no sharp lines separating objects, but that all are
      connected by an interplay of the matter that composes them. So he
      sees the water element in the chambers and that it is flowing
      matter, and that some of it is passing through solid walls which
      retain particles of it and let go some of their own matter to be
      carried on in the flow. He thus becomes familiar with in-ness and
      his sight reaches into and he sees inside and between the surfaces
      of objects.<br>
      <br>
      In some places he sees the shades of persons whose life on the
      earth crust death has ended. The shades are such as are no longer
      attracted to their earthly haunts or decaying bodies. The shades
      are the breath-form, the four senses and the embodied portion of
      the doer, without the Light of the Intelligence. They are dreaming
      over scenes of the life that has passed. Their thoughts are the
      matrices into which the flowing matter passes and to which it
      gives body and so makes the scenery and the persons of their
      dreams. The shades move, drone, ponder and wander in their
      chambers. Sometimes they float through each other, but each is
      unconscious of the others and of everything except its dream. Now
      and then a shade disappears, when it is wakened by a strong desire
      evoked through necromancy. The shades called to mediumistic
      seances may remain a while in the atmospheres of the living,
      before they are drawn back to go on with their after death states.
      The shades disturbed by necromancy cannot return to their dream;
      they may wait in a dazed condition or go on with the after death
      states.<br>
      <br>
      In other places he sees the portions of doers working out the
      decrees which were pronounced in their Halls of Judgment. He sees
      the doers enacting the scenes of the past life according to the
      thoughts they had had. He could not see this if he were not on The
      Way and had not left the world. The thoughts of these doers are
      the molds into which the flow of matter is shaped, over and over
      again. The doers have their breath-forms, which are like the
      former personalities, and see, hear, taste, smell and feel
      somewhat as they did on the outer crust. The doers themselves
      cannot be seen, any more than they can be seen in life.<br>
      <br>
      In a special place he sees “lost” portions of doers, some lost
      untold years ago, and some who failed even within his own time.
      Some of them are ape-like forms without hair, their skin grey,
      clay-colored, their eyes bleary, their mouths big and slimy;
      others are large, whitish worms with little hands and feet; others
      are like leeches with little human heads and long arms and legs
      with which they cling; and others appear in various forms — but
      all exhibiting most disgusting features. These things are male and
      female and have periods of orgies and of deathly silence.
      Sometimes they disappear, blending into the landscape, and leave
      an atmosphere of death behind. Then they reappear with hollow
      roaring, with echoing wails and shrieks, and begin their orgies.
      But these are empty; there is no sensation.<br>
      <br>
      Among the “lost” doers he sees are those lost because of their
      selfishness and enmity to the human race. They are separated from
      the lustful. Some are like great spiders with wicked eyes, some
      like vampires or crabs with human faces and devilish eyes, some
      like snakes with legs and wings. Each of them lives separately
      among the brush or hanging from the rocky roofs or hiding among
      the stones on the ground. The spiders can leap fifty feet, the
      bats sail noiselessly, wolf-like forms with horns and bristly
      heads prowl about, cruel cat-like things with long snaky bodies
      spring, all to kill. But for some the killing is not the sole
      object; they want blood or the pleasure of torturing. Many attack
      each other. But none of them get any satisfaction. There is an
      aching, an emptiness in them at all times, which causes them to
      search for something, and that they cannot find.<br>
      <br>
      He sees other things which have come from the outer crust; doers
      lost through an unwise religious devotion, who are called the
      “ancient dead.” They have devoted themselves to a personal God or
      Gods or to nature and have wished to be absorbed in or to identify
      themselves with their deities or with nature. Most of these doers
      belong to former ages, but some belong to more recent times. They
      have worshipped their Gods devotedly, irrespective of a
      reasonable, universal moral code to which they had access in their
      religious system, and often against what reason showed and
      conscience forbade. They sought the favor of their deities from
      selfish motives. They performed nature rites and ceremonies and
      offered their thoughts in praise and flattery and in prayer for
      material gifts and for absorption in the almighty deities. They
      prayed for favors and did not conquer themselves. In their
      thinking and their thoughts went out the Light of the
      Intelligences. The deities were insatiable.<br>
      <br>
      When all the Light available in their mental atmospheres had been
      sent out, the human beings thereby cut themselves off from the
      Light of their Intelligences. After death they did not return to
      the non-embodied portions of their doers, but went into their
      nature gods. They lost their identity temporarily, because nature
      gods have no identity except such as they get from the thoughts of
      the doer portions in human bodies; and they were not absorbed
      because doer portions can never again become part of nature. So
      after death they went into a form in one of the four elements or
      they passed from form to form.<br>
      <br>
      The ongoer sees them in stones, in water, in winds and in fire.
      They are conscious and dissatisfied, like maniacs trying to find
      out who they are. Sometimes he hears cries coming from a rock or
      tree or water: “Who?,” or “Where?” or “Lost, Lost.”<br>
      <br>
      The guide takes him through many countries, in which are varieties
      of human beings. They travel along different layers and from one
      layer to others. Different conditions exist on the different
      layers. Thus the force of gravitation is strongest near the outer
      crust and after that point is passed, decreases gradually as they
      advance into the crust, and finally ceases.<br>
      <br>
      The ongoer sees many peoples. Nearest to the crust the races are
      wild and degenerate; they eat raw flesh and drink strong
      intoxicants. But farther in the people are peaceable and cultured.
      Nearly all the races are white. Some of them are acquainted with
      the earth and have power over its forces. In an instant they can
      melt, split and make or dissipate rocks. They can remove weight
      from an object or give it weight. They can develop new kinds of
      plants and fruits. In many of the layers some can fly as easily as
      they can move on a surface. Sometimes many join and rise into the
      air, where their thinking, because of the adaptability of the
      matter, tints the air in shining waves of color. Some of the
      people in some races can see into and through objects in the layer
      in which they are, but usually they cannot see into the layer on
      either side. Some can see through the earth crust and see the
      matter on either side of the crust. Others can hear in the same
      way, and still others can both see and hear.<br>
      <br>
      The people in the earth crust are human beings, but who are not
      akin to any human races now on the crust. Some have never left the
      interior. The ongoer meets people of the race to which his guide
      belongs.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the people he meets from time to time warn him against his
      guide; some invite him to leave his guide and to stay with them,
      offering him the peace, plenty and power they enjoy, or promising
      to show him wonders and reveal mysteries greater than any his
      guide will or can show him; some threaten him. The guide often
      absents himself, but if present offers no objection or inducement.
      Should any ongoer yield to the allurements he will not see the
      guide again, and he fails to reach the end of The Way.<br>
      <br>
      During these wanderings the guide explains the structure of the
      inner earth, its forces and history, the phenomena and their
      causes and reactions, and the changes as history and the nature of
      the entities encountered. He explains the illusions of time and of
      the dimensions of matter and the relative reality of all these
      things, which are seen as illusions. He explains the powers and
      behavior of feeling-and-desire, what it means to travel the form
      path and issue into the form world as a being of that world. He
      explains that the ongoer must balance his thoughts, and that the
      end of The Way is in the balancing.<br>
      <br>
      At length the ongoer is left alone. Darkness settles upon him,
      reaches into him and fills him. He would like to escape, but he
      does not. He seems to be dead, but he is conscious. His senses are
      not active. Gradually beings appear, human and non-human. He
      denounces them, but cannot drive them away. They look into him and
      reach into him and he knows they are a part of him. He sees their
      purpose. They want to continue to live by getting their life from
      him. Then he knows they are his thoughts. He balances them one by
      one as they come. More of them come. He can see that they are
      equal to physical events. He withdraws from them the power to
      become physical. He pronounces judgment upon them in relation to
      himself. This judgment dissipates them. A calm comes to him. His
      guide reappears and greets him.<br>
      <br>
      The guide says that he will help him if he wishes to enter the
      form world in the new body he has within; but that if he decides
      to take the life path, he will lead him to another guide. The
      ongoer, though sorry to part with his guide, declares he will go
      on.<br>
      <br>
      The path was hitherto within the earth crust and stretched for a
      distance which is about a third of half of the circumference of
      the earth. While the ongoer went along the form path his body
      changed in structure and in nature. It now has little or no weight
      and does not require solid food. It has lines so perfect and
      proportionate that in nobility and grace it excels any body on the
      crust. The intestinal canal has become a short columnar passage
      and the bridge has been built connecting the involuntary nervous
      structure within that columnar passage directly with the voluntary
      system at the coccyx. Within the filament has been developed an
      embryonic form body.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Section 6</b><br>
      <br>
      <i>The ongoer on the life path; on the light path, in the earth.
        He knows who he is. Another choice.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      When the ongoer has announced his choice for the life path, the
      guide and he pass through a hall. The guide leads him to a crystal
      rock from which a fountain of clearest water falls in sparkling
      sheets and spray into a basin in the rock. The guide tells him
      that these are cleansing waters; that they will fit him to draw
      from the fountain of life or will dissolve his body and wash it
      away; that one who is prepared will have no fear. “Enter the water
      if you will and it will enter you.”<br>
      <br>
      The ongoer walks into the pool under the fountain. His whole body
      drinks in the welcome draft. He feels himself gliding into the
      pool. The rock, the guide, the chamber disappear as he feels
      himself going out with the water into the great ocean where all
      the waters meet. He expands into the ocean, yet feels the current
      that carries him. The ocean is through the rocks, the water, the
      plants, the animal life and the bodies of all human beings. It is
      feeling, desiring and emotional humanity. He feels himself through
      it and as it, in the present and the past. He is conscious of
      mankind extending as the ocean to the stars. These are the
      crossings of the nerves of human beings. He is extended to the
      farthest stars. Mankind goes out to the stars and they come into
      mankind. They are like the crossings in a spider’s web. He sees
      the crossings but he does not see the lines, yet is conscious
      where they are. He draws himself together, after having been so
      spread out. He now feels the humanity which is in bodies on earth
      and that which is without bodies; these are the re-existing doers
      of Triune Selves. He went out to mankind, now mankind comes into
      him. He is conscious that he will continue on The Way. The
      feelings of human beings reaching into the form world rush into
      him and urge him to come to them, to help them and lead them out
      of their troubles. They show him that if he leaves them to
      themselves they will not find their way. The “ancient dead” in
      their nature prisons appeal to him to liberate them. “Lost”
      portions of doers are reminded by his presence in them that they
      are lost and that they want to get back. Their appeal is so strong
      and his desire to help so great that he would give himself to
      them. But the Light shows his duty to go on. He looks into the
      Light and affirms his choice for the life path. He is in the pool
      under the fountain, and steps out, cleansed. The guide is where he
      left him, and it is as if he had just stepped in and come out.<br>
      <br>
      There is no effort in moving through the hall as the body has no
      weight and will go in the direction of the desire. Desire is its
      direct motive power, as it was the indirect motive power while he
      was on the earth. When the guide has taken him as far as he can he
      departs at the end of the form path and a teacher is there to meet
      the ongoer at the beginning of the life path.<br>
      <br>
      The teacher is quite human in appearance, simple and unassuming,
      but there is the sublime in his presence. The color of his
      physical body is somewhat like that of a being of the form world,
      but he is a being of the form, life, and light worlds. Yet the
      teacher, notwithstanding his greatness, does not seem strange to
      the ongoer.<br>
      <br>
      The life path, along which the ongoer now passes, continues within
      the earth crust and extends over the second third of half of the
      inner circumference of the crust. On the life path he so increases
      his power to think with his feeling-mind and desire-mind that he
      can use the speech of thinking to speak with the thinker of the
      Triune Self through the mind of rightness and the mind of reason.
      He achieves the powers to examine, penetrate, dissect, compare,
      construct, create and dissipate by speech with his body-mind. He
      learns how to use these powers, but he does not use them. Merely
      thinking of a subject now solves the problems which were only
      perceived before. He understands the causes of forms and of types,
      as prepared from age to age. He learns the law of thought, as
      destiny; he comprehends the cycling of thoughts and the causes and
      methods of their exteriorizations. During all this growth the
      teacher has not actually instructed him. By bringing up problems
      he has merely given him the opportunity to solve them himself;
      thus the ongoer learns how to find the solution of his own
      problems. In this way the ongoer has put himself into
      communication with rightness-and-reason. So he comes to the end of
      the life path.<br>
      <br>
      As they are walking through a hall, the teacher sings:
      O-E-A-O-E-HA. Rushing wind descends, enfolds the ongoer and
      breathes into him. That air of life goes through his nerves,
      pervades him, and each unit of his body sings. It sings his own
      story from the beginning to the coming of the living air. It sings
      the songs of life. All nature units outside join in the songs. The
      doers in mortal bodies sing each its song of sorrow, bitterness
      and pain. He understands each sound and song. The air within him
      puts him in tune with all that lives, and he has understanding of
      that. He is conscious that the teacher knows that he can now hear
      and answer any call.<br>
      <br>
      The teacher tells him that this is as far as he goes and asks if
      he will issue into the life world, a being of that world, or if he
      will go on to the light path, for if so he must go on alone. The
      ongoer says: “I will go on alone.”<br>
      <br>
      What he has heretofore considered and solved has developed for him
      the mental power to know without the process of thinking, which is
      the connection to the knower of the Triune Self. When the ongoer
      said “I will go on alone,” he thereby found in himself a Light.
      That is the Light by which he knows The Way.<br>
      <br>
      He finds the light path because he knows it when he comes to it.
      The path continues still within the earth crust for the remainder
      of the half of the circumference. To reach the end he goes through
      a white fire. When he enters it the remaining fabrics of illusion
      he has made by thinking are burnt away.<br>
      <br>
      The partitions separating him from age to age, from life to life,
      from place to place, from state to state, are dissipated. The fire
      that burns down the veils within is the essential fire of the four
      elements in the earth sphere. He sees everywhere and is present in
      all parts of physical nature.<br>
      <br>
      He knows himself as being that Triune Self which is
      identity-and-knowledge in the Eternal in the presence and in the
      Light of his Intelligence.<br>
      <br>
      He knows himself, by that Light, to be the knower of a Triune Self
      in his noetic atmosphere within that Light. He knows himself to be
      the thinker, his mental part, within his mental atmosphere, and of
      the forming of the mental atmosphere by the thinking of his
      thinker. He knows of the processes of contemplation by his thinker
      concerning the things of the light world and of the life world. He
      knows of the feeling-and-desire of the psychic part, his doer, and
      of the forming of the psychic atmosphere, by the thinking of his
      thinker. He knows the twelve portions of his doer, that re-existed
      successively and yet were one.<br>
      <br>
      He knows of the first existence of the doer in the body, of
      existence in it in a happy state within the earth, and of the
      apparent separation of feeling from desire at the putting forth of
      the twin body. He knows that that should have been the beginning
      of The Way and that he wandered off The Way with the twin. He
      knows of the flight to the outer crust, of the death of his body
      and of the twin, and of all his re-existences and their incidents.
      He knows of his present embodiment and the incidents attending his
      taking The Way, the same old Way that he once failed to take and
      which has led him through the three worlds to the end of his
      re-existences. He knows of the illusion of the separateness of the
      three parts of the Triune Self. He knows that the Triune Self is
      One. He knows that he has never left the Eternal, and that his
      re-embodiments were illusions in time thrown up by the thinking of
      his feeling-and-desire. When the fire has burnt out all that can
      be consumed, it has no further effect.<br>
      <br>
      The knowledge he has gives him being into the Light. Now in his
      perfected physical body, he is at once in the form, the life, and
      the light worlds, and he is and knows himself to be a Triune Self
      complete; a being of the three worlds in the Light and the
      presence of his Intelligence, and in the presence of the Great
      Triune Self of the worlds.<br>
      <br>
      Through the Great Triune Self of the worlds acts the Supreme
      Intelligence. The Supreme Intelligence needs such a Great Triune
      Self through which to act, a Triune Self which is all-feeling,
      all-thinking and all-knowing; a Triune Self that is omnipresent,
      omnipotent and omniscient. The Great Triune Self feels through all
      grades of Triune Selves, from the beings of the light world down
      to the portions of doers in human bodies and even down to the
      portions of doers that are in the state that is called lost.<br>
      <br>
      The Great Triune Self of the worlds thinks through all these, from
      the high to the low; and it knows all that they know. Its feeling,
      its thinking and its knowledge are one. It knows the state of each
      human being and the collective state of all human beings at any
      time, that is, the state of humanity. It knows also the states of
      the super-human doers, singly and together. Human beings are not
      conscious that the Great Triune Self feels and thinks with them
      and knows what they know. The beings of the form world can feel
      it, the beings of the life world can think it, but only a being of
      the light world, one who has stood in the presence of it and has
      been attuned to it, can know it. A being of the light world is
      always in communication with it and is a high officer, a conscious
      agent of the law of thought, as destiny. The Great Triune Self is
      the coordinator for the Intelligences and of the interactions of
      their doers on the physical plane.<br>
      <br>
      The ongoer who has arrived before the Great Triune Self of the
      worlds knows that that was at one time a doer of its Triune Self,
      and knows that that has not given up its relation to humanity in
      order to pass on and become an Intelligence; and knows, further,
      that it has retained this relation so that it may be a link
      between all mankind. The ongoer knows that the Great Triune Self
      is the exemplification of relationship. He knows that there is
      this relation, the sameness in kind of all doers. They are
      actually related and connected by this sameness, on the
      unmanifested side of their knowers, though they appear as
      different when portions of them are in fleshly bodies. The
      difference is built up by thinking and feeling. During embodiments
      the differences are seen and thought about, but the sameness is
      unknown. Yet even there is found a semblance of sameness, because
      all have like feelings and desires and like thoughts, which make
      the general types in nature and fashion the world in which they
      live together.<br>
      <br>
      The ongoer sees into the Light of his Intelligence, which is an
      Intelligence of the highest order, a Knower, an Intelligence of
      the sphere of fire, and through that Light sees into the Light of
      Supreme Intelligence, whose Light is Truth. Thus he stands in the
      presence of Truth. The Intelligences partake of that Light, and
      the Light of the Intelligence which is loaned to the Triune Self
      is Truth, though it is obscured and beclouded when it is in the
      mental atmosphere of the human. This is the Light used by the
      human being, and is all that he can stand of Truth. He sees that
      nothing that has anything to conceal can stand in the undimmed
      Light which is Truth, and which dissipates deceit and darkness and
      illusion.<br>
      <br>
      The ongoer who has arrived before the Great Triune Self of the
      worlds knows the beauty in the law that works throughout the earth
      sphere adjusting the thoughts of each doer, its relations with
      other doers and the operation of all thoughts of all doers in
      nature. He comprehends the details of that law, and he feels it
      working through all doers. He knows, comprehends and feels the
      world as made by all doers and as kept in adjustment by the Great
      Triune Self of the worlds and its agents of the law. He knows he
      is free to do what he pleases, but comprehending the broad sweep
      of the action of the law, he chooses and desires to take part in
      the administration of affairs for the benefit of the doers who
      keep themselves in darkness.<br>
      <br>
      He leaves the presence of the Great Triune Self of the worlds and
      returns to his perfected physical body through the light, the
      life, the form and the physical worlds, yet he is in them all, for
      he is conscious in them, being himself in the Light. It is during
      this return that the life body and the form body cease to be
      embryonic, and issue. The thinker and the doer enter in these
      inner bodies as a being of the life world and as a being of the
      form world. The knower is in the light body.<br>
      <br>
      During these events, the perfect physical body had been left at
      the end of the path in the inner earth crust. The Triune Self
      enters through the top of the skull. It is a threefold being
      though One, in a perfected and immortal physical body. As a being
      of the form world he inhabits the abdominal region where there is
      now a brain in place of the suprarenals, the kidneys and the solar
      plexus. Below that, in the pelvis, is another brain for the
      perfect body and the physical world. As a being of the life world
      he lives in the thoracic region, where the heart and lungs have
      become a brain. As a being of the light world he is within the
      cervical vertebrae and the cephalic brain in the head. This is his
      embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      When he has entered the body he finds the teacher whom he had left
      at the end of the life path, and who had, though unseen,
      accompanied him to the place where the ongoer had left his body.
      He recognizes the teacher as being a being of the three worlds who
      had before done what the ongoer has just accomplished.<br>
      <br>
      The perfected physical body is brought to its high state so that
      it may be an instrument for the operation of the elemental forces
      in the four worlds of nature. All parts of nature can be reached
      through the nerves of such a body. Through the eye the doer that
      lives in such a body could set fire to a leaf or to a city.
      Anything that can be done by nature forces can be done by
      directing the forces through the nerves of such a body. The
      thoughts and the emotions of humans can also be reached through
      such a body, and so a riot, a war, a religious enthusiasm and a
      mental trend or attitude can be generated and sustained or abated.
      The four brains are the centers from which the nerves are
      operated.<br>
      <br>
      A perfect body, always in the Realm of Permanence, affords to the
      units passing through it, a straight road of progress, according
      to the Eternal Order of Progression, (Fig. II G, H). Each such
      unit eventually becomes an aia, then a Triune Self, and then an
      Intelligence. The doer part of every Triune Self must undergo the
      trial and test to bring its feeling-and-desire into balanced
      union, as heretofore mentioned. If it passes that test, as the
      majority of units do, the Triune Self is complete. If the doer
      fails in that test, it passes temporarily out of the straight road
      and takes a circuitous route by way of re-existences in human
      bodies in this world of change.<br>
      <br>
      When a Triune Self complete in a perfect body acts in the physical
      world it acts through the pelvic brain. When the doer acts in the
      form world it acts through the brain in the abdominal region. In a
      similar way the thinker in such a body, when acting in the life
      world, uses the brain in the thorax. When acting in the light
      world the knower in such a body uses the brain in the upper spine
      and the head. Such a Triune Self can act in each of these worlds,
      independently of the body, but it uses the body when it wants to
      relate any one of these worlds to the physical world or to affect
      doers in human bodies, because its physical body is common ground
      for all the worlds and is perfectly aligned with them.<br>
      <br>
      Such Triune Selves complete are high officers of the law of
      thought, as destiny. They have complied with its requirements
      concerning themselves, and are free from it. They have no motives
      similar to those of human beings. They feel the mass of human
      suffering; they desire only to act according to the law. They
      comprehend the thoughts, ideals and aspirations of human beings
      and carry out the law of thought in relation thereto. But they do
      not interfere with the choice or the responsibility of any human.<br>
      <br>
      Having entered its perfect body the complete Triune Self is among
      other Triune Selves who are beings of the light, life and form
      worlds. They are in the noetic world, which is a term to designate
      the knowledge which is in the noetic atmospheres of all knowers
      and is common and available to each. They are beyond time and the
      changes which are time; they are in the state of permanence which
      persists through the changes of time.<br>
      <br>
      Again a choice is open to and must now be made by the Triune Self.
      Its doer having balanced its thoughts and, therefore, being free
      from the necessity to re-exist; having reclaimed, freed and
      restored to its Intelligence the Light which had been loaned to
      it; having no claim upon or attachment to the Light of its
      Intelligence: the relation between it, as a Triune Self, and its
      Intelligence, is outgrown and ceases. The Triune Self may choose
      one of three courses. But the proper course, which it will choose,
      is: it becomes an Intelligence, evokes its own potential Light,
      raises its aia to be a Triune Self, and remains with that Triune
      Self in the earth sphere.<br>

      <i>Preparing oneself to enter upon The Way. Honesty and
        truthfulness. The regenerative breath. The four stages in
        thinking.</i><br>
      <br>
      This section is written for those who feel that they would like to
      find and be on The Way. Here first principles only are considered.
      The system of thinking at the end of the book is more extensive;
      it leads from the beginning to the end of The Way.<br>
      <br>
      The Way which leads the human to Self-conscious immortality cannot
      be traveled by everyone. It is the destiny for everyone,
      ultimately, but not immediately. Comparatively few will consider
      it before it is recognized as a public topic. It is not for the
      disbeliever. One who does not feel reasonably sure: that there is
      The Way, that there is the Triune Self, and that he is the doer
      part of such a Triune Self, ought not to undertake the quest.<br>
      <br>
      The quest is to find oneself in the body, and one’s greater Self
      when on The Way.<br>
      <br>
      To prepare oneself for The Way involves a definite decision to do
      so, and is a far reaching step. The sooner one begins the work,
      the fewer lives are needed. Once the choice is made, it acts for
      the eleven doer portions not in the body. The decision is one’s
      own private affair and should be considered as such. No one should
      advise him.<br>
      <br>
      One should not decide for The Way until he has given due
      consideration to the marriage relation; to its duties and its
      consequences. One who is married may decide to be on The Way. In
      which case the relation will be mutually and naturally adjusted in
      due time. But one who is unmarried must understand that he cannot
      go on The Way unless there is cessation of the sexual desire and
      act. The desire must be for permanent union of feeling-and-desire,
      not for spasmodic union of physical bodies. Sex indulgence is the
      continuation of births and deaths. Whereas, The Way leads to
      Self-knowledge in a perfect and everlasting physical body.<br>
      <br>
      You, the conscious doer-in-the-body, who have decided to find and
      be on The Way, may appeal to your thinker part to guide you. You
      will have the Conscious Light within to show you The Way—to the
      degree that you trust it and use it. The Conscious Light within is
      Truth, it is your degree of Truth. The Light will show you things
      truly as they are. That is what Truth does.<br>
      <br>
      You must learn to distinguish that from all other lights. The
      difference is that the lights of the senses are lights of nature.
      They make you aware of the objects of nature from the outside, but
      they are not conscious of the objects which they make visible
      outwardly. Nor are they conscious inwardly; lights of nature do
      not know anything; they are conscious as their functions only,
      nothing more. Whereas, the Conscious Light is Self-knowing; it is
      conscious that it is the Light that knows that it knows. The Light
      leads and shows the way to the knowledge of all things of nature,
      and to the knowledge of one’s greater Self. Without the Conscious
      light one could not be conscious of or as oneself.<br>
      <br>
      Without the Conscious Light you cannot find The Way. In right
      thinking you use the Light; and when you seek The Way, the Light
      will show you and keep you on The Way. But you must qualify
      yourself in two arts in order to find and to travel The Way.<br>
      <br>
      The first is the art of seeing things as they are. You may ask:
      What do I see, if I do not see things as they are? You see things
      as appearances, as they appear to be, but not as they really are.<br>
      <br>
      In acquiring the art, preference and prejudice, two treasured
      heirlooms of the human, must be done away with in order that you
      may find and travel The Way. Preference and prejudice grow on the
      mind’s eye like as cataracts do on the physical eye. Thus the
      Conscious Light is dimmed and finally obscured. Therefore they
      must be removed and forgotten. They can be removed by virtue.<br>
      <br>
      Virtue is one’s power of will in the practice of honesty and
      truthfulness.<br>
      <br>
      Honesty begins with right thought and motive in oneself, and is
      expressed by one’s actions in dealing with others. Honesty is not
      merely a passive not-taking what belongs to others; it is also an
      active refusal to consider being devious or crooked.<br>
      <br>
      Truthfulness is the purpose and practice of stating facts as the
      facts are, without intent to deceive. Truthfulness is not the mere
      negative assent to, or statement of what is so, fearful of
      misstatement or of being mistaken. It is the strict intent to not
      deceive oneself, and then be direct in statement of facts, in the
      simple words that allow no opposition.<br>
      <br>
      One may have a strong will and a general acquaintance with honesty
      and truthfulness, and yet not have virtue. Virtue does not happen
      at once. Virtue is developed, but only by the practice of honesty
      and truthfulness.<br>
      Virtue, as the power of will in the practice of honesty and
      truthfulness, develops a strong and fearless character. Dishonesty
      and falsehood are then strangers, and are foreign, undesirable to
      virtue. By virtue the scales of preference and prejudice are
      dissipated and removed, and one sees things as they are. When the
      scales of preference and prejudice are removed from the mind’s
      eye, the unobscured Conscious Light shows and makes one conscious
      of things as they are. One is then truly qualified to learn what
      not to do, and what to do.<br>
      The second art is the art of knowing what to do, and doing that;
      and knowing what not to do, and not doing that. Now you can speak
      to your thinker and ask to be guided.<br>
      <br>
      You can mentally say: My Judge and Knower!—guide me in all I think
      and do!<br>
      <br>
      Rightness of your thinker will speak to you through conscience in
      your heart, and tell you what not to do; and reason of your
      thinker will tell you what to do. Practice in the art of seeing
      things as they are, and in the art of knowing what to do and what
      not to do, will be your preparation to travel the three sections
      of The Way.<br>
      <br>
      For practicing the two great arts: of seeing things as they are,
      and of knowing what to do and what not to do, your ordinary
      everyday experiences will give you all the opportunities necessary
      for the practice. You need not be surprised at anything that
      happens, or that nothing that happens is out of the ordinary or
      beyond your duties. But whatever does happen will be for your
      training and for the development of your character, whether it be
      strange or commonplace.<br>
      <br>
      Duties are important, always; but they are most important when one
      decides to be on The Way. No duties should prevent one from
      deciding for The Way, because no human can ever be free from them
      until he has performed all his duties. All that one has to do is:
      to do that which he knows to be his duty, and to do it as well as
      he can with goodwill, without undue expectation, and without fear.<br>
      <br>
      Whether one’s position in life be lofty or lowly does not matter.
      Whether married or single, with or without family, with or without
      encumbrance, does not matter so much. But what does matter is that
      one does in good faith all that he has agreed to do, or that
      circumstances show to be necessary. Should there be any ties, they
      will not be broken; they will naturally fall away. Duties that
      would ordinarily seem insuperable will in this way be done
      naturally and properly through circumstances which will come about
      in orderly process of time: they have a purpose in your training.
      For the learning and doing, time is not the important matter. The
      essence of the doing is in the accomplishment, not in length of
      time or number of lives that may be required. You are to learn to
      think and live in the Eternal, not in time.<br>
      <br>
      There is a method of regenerative breathing which assists in
      seeing things as they are, and in knowing what to do and what not
      to do. It re-establishes the right relation between the breath and
      the form of the breath-form; it is a beginning of the
      reconstruction of the human body according to the form of its
      original perfect body. Further, this method is a way of exploring
      and examining the body by means of the breath, of knowing the
      mystery of the human body.<br>
      <br>
      The breath as it is breathed in should be of four kinds: the
      physical breath, the form breath, the life breath, and the light
      breath. Each of these is subdivided into four subsidiary breaths.
      As the four subsidiary breaths of the first kind are practiced and
      known, they prepare and initiate one into the next kind and its
      subsidiaries.<br>
      <br>
      The four subsidiaries of the physical breath are: the
      solid-physical, fluid-physical, airy-physical, and
      radiant-physical breaths; in other words, the structure of the
      physical, the form of the physical, the life of the physical, and
      the light of the physical.<br>
      <br>
      These first four subsidiary breaths build and repair the structure
      of the physical body. They should maintain a balance between the
      building material and the waste matter that cannot otherwise be
      removed. This is done by the regular inflow and outflow of the
      four substates of solid-physical matter: that is, of solid, fluid,
      airy, and radiant units.<br>
      <br>
      Breathing is intended to permeate and supply all parts and states
      and substates of the solid body with units of matter of its own
      state, so that all units in the body can perform their functions
      properly. This can be done only by regenerative breathing. At
      present, the human breathes only portions of the gross physical
      breath. These are insufficient for proper digestion and
      assimilation of the food and drink taken into the body. Therefore
      ill health and death may be consequences of improper breathing.<br>
      <br>
      Tissue is built, and a balance is maintained between the building
      material and the elimination of waste matter from the body, by the
      process of breathing. Breathing is the process of (a) building new
      material as structure onto the form of the breath-form; (b) the
      elimination of waste matter from that structure; and (c) the
      metabolizing or maintenance of balance between the building and
      elimination. This explains the age-old biological mystery of
      tissue building.<br>
      <br>
      By practicing the regenerative method of breathing until such
      breathing becomes the habitual breathing of the physical breath at
      all times, the solid-fluid-airy-radiant structure of the physical
      body will, by the four subsidiary states of the physical breath,
      be built into a properly adjusted and functioning physical body of
      health, the life of which may be prolonged indefinitely. One who
      decides to practice this system of breathing is advised not to
      practice yoga breathing, pranayama, or any other system: they
      would be interferences. The rules for the regenerative breath are
      as follows:<br>
      <br>
      1) There should be no unnecessary pause or interruption of
      breathing, between inbreathing and outbreathing. That would be an
      interference with the rhythm of breath, or a stoppage of the Light
      for thinking.<br>
      <br>
      2) One should think with and follow the breath as it comes into
      and passes through the body, to observe and actually feel where it
      naturally does go, what it does, and the results of what is being
      done by the breath in its tidal passage in and out of the body.<br>
      <br>
      3) A time should be set for the daily practice of regenerative
      breathing; it should be at first not less than ten minutes, and
      should be gradually extended to longer periods as seems consistent
      with one’s reason. But the breathing may also be practiced at any
      time of day or night, so that eventually the practice will become
      one’s regular and normal breathing.<br>
      <br>
      4) The practice of the breathing should be suspended or stopped if
      one believes there is any reason for so doing.<br>
      <br>
      5) If there is a time of panic, anger, excitement, or when one
      seems likely to be overwhelmed, then persist in the uninterrupted
      and full inbreathing and outbreathing.<br>
      <br>
      By the practice of this regenerative breathing, the breath
      rebuilds the tissues and opens new avenues for the unobstructed
      flow of the breaths through all the interstices of the body and
      its senses, its organs and its cells, molecules, atoms, and
      electrons or protons. The breath passing through the blood and
      nerves tends to relate and put into agreement desire, the active
      side of the doer-in-the-body, and feeling, its passive side, so
      that they will be in intimate relation.<br>
      <br>
      The blood vessels and the nerves in the body run side by side, the
      blood being the field of desire, and the nerves the field of
      feeling. As the breath passes through blood and nerves it puts
      feeling and desire into phase, and so they act conjointly.<br>
      <br>
      Thinking is the steady holding and focusing of the Conscious Light
      within on the subject of the thinking. The steady holding, or
      actual focusing, of the Conscious Light, by thinking, is possible
      only at the neutral moment or point between the outbreathing and
      the inbreathing, and between the inbreathing and the outbreathing.
      So that the actual results of thinking are possible only at the
      two poles or points of the complete round. The practice of so
      breathing and thinking is a method for acquiring the power to
      think.<br>
      <br>
      When the thinking is on the subject of this regenerative
      breathing, the processes of breathing in the rebuilding of the
      body will be made known, as the Conscious Light is focused at the
      neutral points between the breathings. As the practice continues,
      the thinking will make known the parts and functions of the body
      in relation to the functions of the universe; and the relation of
      the functions of the universe to the parts and functions of the
      body, and to the body as a whole, and their reciprocal action and
      reaction.<br>
      <br>
      There are four stages or degrees in thinking. First, the selection
      of the subject, and giving attention to the subject. Second,
      holding the Conscious Light on that subject. Third, focusing the
      Light on that subject. Fourth, the focus of the Light.<br>
      <br>
      The subject should be the only thing to which attention is given.
      There should be nothing else with which the attention is engaged.<br>
      <br>
      In the second, the holding of the Light steadily means that all
      the available Light in his mental atmosphere that one has to think
      with is turned on that subject. As soon as the Light is turned on
      the subject, that Light attracts one’s past thoughts, and any
      other idle or wandering thoughts. To the Light so turned, thoughts
      and subjects of thought, pests of the night, all try to crowd into
      that Light. The first effect on the thinker is that there are a
      great many subjects that would obscure or prevent his seeing his
      subject. The thinker usually tries either to get these out of his
      Light, or else to give attention to any one of the number of
      thoughts that crowd in. This is too difficult and the thinker is
      usually distracted and prevented from holding the Light on the
      subject of his selection. He will mentally see one of the subjects
      or thoughts that have crowded in, and hold the Light on that. But
      no sooner has he done so than the others try to crowd that one out
      by getting in the line of his mental vision. Fight as he will, he
      cannot seem to get back to his subject. And he turns the Light
      from one to the other of the innumerable thoughts or things that
      crowd in; and he does not get any farther; so he finally gives up
      the effort, or else falls asleep.<br>
      <br>
      He may take this same subject up again and again, for what he
      calls contemplation, or meditation, or by any other name. Then he
      will have itchings, or feelings of irritation and uneasiness,
      changing his position and beginning over and over again. He often
      tries to do away with these unwarranted intrusions. But the more
      he tries to put them out of his thinking, the less he is able to
      be rid of them. There is one way, and one way only, by which they
      are dispersed. That way is to keep on trying to think steadily on
      the subject, and to mentally refuse to see anything but the
      subject on which he is trying to hold the Light.<br>
      <br>
      However many efforts and however long this may take, it is
      necessary for him to do it. Because that is steadiness in
      thinking. Each time he thinks of things that annoy him, he turns
      the Light on that thing and the other thing, and he is not holding
      the Light on his subject. But when he refuses to see anything but
      what he wills to see as his subject, then the unwarranted subjects
      flee, and he is holding the Light steadily on the subject; he has
      completed the second stage.<br>
      <br>
      The third stage is the focusing of the Light. The Light is more or
      less diffused over an area, so to say. By looking steadily at the
      subject as a point, the Light becomes more compact and is directed
      from the area to its central point, which is the subject. The
      focusing must be continued until all the Light comes to a focus,
      to its focus on the subject. As soon as the Light is focused, the
      subject as a point opens into the fullness of the knowledge of the
      subject, which the Light shows at once in its entirety. It is a
      more complete revelation of the subject of the thinking than a
      lightning flash which illuminates a landscape in the darkest
      night. The difference is, the lightning shows what is seen by the
      senses. The Light is the knowledge of the subject accomplished by
      thinking.<br>
      <br>
      Concerning the second stage, the holding of the Light: Each time
      the Light is turned on intervening subjects, there is a change of
      distance and perspective. One subject intervening comes closer,
      another closer still; another may come still closer. Each tries to
      get closer in the line of vision, to attract attention. And the
      poor thinker is so distracted that he does not know what he is
      thinking about. And he becomes confused, ill at ease, or gives it
      up in discouragement. He does not get the knowledge until all the
      Light is focused. With each focus of the Light he acquires
      knowledge.<br>
      <br>
      When one looks at a thing it is not seen as an entirety. To see
      it, one must see the focal point of the thing that he looks at.
      And if he can see the focal point, he can see the whole through
      that point.<br>
      <br>
      How does one get the Light in thinking? The surest way of getting
      the Light is by regular breathing. Whatever Light one gets will
      come through a point, at the neutral point, between inbreathing
      and outbreathing, and between outbreathing and inbreathing. So
      there is twice in one round of complete breathing where the
      Conscious Light can be focused.<br>
      <br>
      When the Light comes in at the two neutral points between the
      inbreathing and the outbreathing, one must be thinking steadily on
      the subject, else the Light is diffused. If he has more than one
      subject while trying to think, the Light cannot be focused. So
      many subjects are hindering him in his steady thinking that he
      does not get any focus when the Light would come in; it is
      therefore diffused over the many subjects. But the continued
      practice of trying to hold his thinking steadily on the subject
      selected, allows him to so exercise his mental vision that if he
      persists long enough he will eventually be able to discover
      something about his subject, because the Light will give a little
      illumination on his subject, although it may not open it into
      knowledge.<br>
      <br>
      In this way those who think get information in business, in art,
      in any occupation or endeavor in life. The Light gives information
      about the subjects of which they believe they think. But one
      seldom thinks steadily enough to get knowledge on the subject. All
      inventions, all discoveries in science and art, or in any earnest
      endeavor in life, come either as illuminations on the subject or
      as flashes of knowledge, through the neutral point between
      inbreathing or outbreathing.<br>
      <br>
      This is thinking, human thinking; not real thinking. Real thinking
      is beyond the ordinary human. If it were necessary, when the Light
      was focused at the time of thinking on the subject, breathing
      would stop. The Light would suspend the breathing, and one would
      think into the Light, and see into any subject of his choice. That
      would be real thinking, an extension of what may be called regular
      thinking.<br>
      <br>
      Light is intelligence per se, and only that which can use Light is
      intelligent. But human beings are not Intelligences. They become
      intelligent in varying degrees, according to their ability to hold
      the Conscious Light on the subject of the thinking.<br>
      <br>
      As one goes on and persists in the thought and action of right and
      justice, the advice and guidance of one’s thinker, as Judge, can
      be mentally asked and received during breathing. So, one may gain
      strength, and act fearlessly and with confidence in any
      undertaking. So, one may from time to time have revelations in
      answer to one’s questions on the relation between the universe and
      one’s body, concerning duties, and one’s relation to the thinker
      and knower of his Triune Self.<br>
      <br>
      Each subsidiary of the physical breath is the medium which the
      next finer breath uses in the building of its matter into the
      structure of the physical body. The form breath and its
      subsidiaries begin to build out the form body when the physical
      body is developing to physical health. The breath-form will
      gradually and automatically rebuild and reconstitute and
      re-establish the physical body in its original state of
      perfection. But it can only do so as the doer empowers and directs
      it by thinking.<br>
      <br>
      The one whose regenerative breathing has prepared the body for the
      form breathing will breathe the form breath, which will gradually
      improve and reconstruct the structure towards perfection and
      extend the life of the physical body indefinitely. The form breath
      is the beginning of the rejuvenescence of bodily life; it is the
      initiator and mystery and miracle of life in all its higher forms.
      It will gradually prepare the body for the breathing of the life
      breath. Then one will receive further information from the thinker
      and the knower of his Triune Self, as indicated by the system of
      thinking in the fourteenth chapter.<br>

      <b>DIVINE, “IMMACULATE” CONCEPTION and REGENERATION OF THE

      Regeneration begins with thinking when, by self-control, the lunar
      germ is not lost after it has reached the region of the left
      kidney, (Fig. VI-C); instead, it continues its upward course and
      ascends to the brain, — thus completing the first round.<br>
      <br>
      The next month the lunar germ descends again, together with the
      succeeding lunar germ; if and when the lunar germs are saved for
      thirteen rounds, equal to one solar year, and the thirteen having
      merged into one, a divine conception takes place in the head, by
      the union of the lunar germ with the solar germ, through issuance
      of light from the pituitary and pineal bodies. So far only slight
      structural changes have taken place in the human body.<br>
      <br>
      After this divine conception the germ descends on the right side
      as far as the pelvis; now, however, instead of ascending in the
      involuntary nervous system on the left side, it connects with the
      voluntary system by building a “bridge” from the coccygeal
      ganglion to the terminal filament, (which by this time has
      developed a central canal from above down to the coccyx).<br>
      <br>
      The lunar germ then opens and enters the terminal filament and is
      thereby on the form path of The Great Way, and then passes upward
      to near the junction of the 1st lumbar and 12th dorsal vertebrae,
      within the central canal. Building the “bridge” and thus making
      the connection between the two nervous systems, marks a definite
      change in the structure of the body.<br>
      <br>
      A divine conception is the beginning of the building of a perfect
      physical body, which is to be the medium for three finer bodies;
      that is, one, each, for the form-being of the doer, the life-being
      of the thinker, and the light-being of the knower of the Triune
      Self.<br>
      <br>
      When the lunar germ has traveled upward within the filament as far
      as the 12th dorsal vertebra, it has developed into an embryonic
      form body; at that point it is met by and merges with the solar
      germ, which has descended in the right hemisphere of the spinal
      cord. Together they enter into and ascend through the central
      canal of the spinal cord, to the 7th cervical vertebra. The
      distance between the 12th dorsal and the 7th cervical marks the
      life path, and while on this path, the solar germ develops into an
      embryonic life body. Traveling up the central canal of the spinal
      cord, the embryonic form and the embryonic life bodies are met at
      the 7th cervical vertebra by a light germ from the pituitary body;
      this marks the beginning of the light path and of the embryonic
      light body. Then the embryonic light body, accompanied by the
      embryonic life and form bodies, advances through the medulla
      oblongata and the pons varolii to the pineal body, opens the
      pineal and fills all ventricles and the spaces between the
      convolutions and immediately around the brain, with light. Later,
      the three embryonic bodies reach their full development and ascend
      through the top of the head, and the doer, the thinker and the
      knower of the Triune Self are established therein. The doer has
      then reached perfection, and the Triune Self complete is in a
      perfected, sexless, regenerated, immortal physical body, and at
      the end of The Great Way. The other two of the threefold Way, The
      Way of thinking and The Way in the interior of the earth, have
      then been successfully traveled.<br>

      On the light path, extending from the 7th to the 1st cervical
      vertebra, a light body is developed for the knower, the noetic
      part of the Triune Self, the being of the light world.<br>
      <br>
      When the human physical body has been rebuilt and its
      reconstruction into a perfect, immortal body is completed, that
      body need not be sustained by the gross foods of this earth.
      Certain nerve currents come into the body chiefly by way of the
      sense organs and their nerves; they pass along the central canal
      of the front-cord, of the “bridge,” and of the spinal cord and
      upwards into what are now the ventricles of the brain. In their
      uninterrupted passage through the canal of the two cords, the
      units making up these currents are charged with power by the
      Triune Self, and so the body is enabled to serve as a powerhouse
      through which nature is energized and empowered.<br>
      <br>
      There is then no longer any need for the generative, respiratory,
      circulatory and digestive systems as they are now, and the organs
      at present serving these systems have become transformed. In their
      places, structures resembling those of the nervous systems fill
      the four body cavities: these structures are here spoken of as the
      four brains: the pelvic brain for the perfect physical body; the
      abdominal brain for the doer and its form body; the thoracic brain
      for the thinker and its life body; and the cephalic brain for the
      knower and its light body. By virtue of these brains, the three
      parts of the Triune Self can each thus act separately in its
      respective body, or together, and with or through the physical
      body.<br>
      <br>
      When the body has been regenerated many significant changes have
      taken place: The present sternum with the esophagus and what has
      remained of the stomach and intestines, have been converted into a
      resilient, tubular column, the front- or nature-column, which is
      analogous to and resembles somewhat the spinal column; within this
      tube is the front- or nature-cord, made up of what are now the two
      main trunks of the involuntary nervous system and of the nerve
      structures belonging to that system. Joined with the nature-cord
      are the two vagus nerves, which are, however, under the direct
      control of the voluntary system. From the front-column, (Fig.
      VI-D), extend half arches to both sides, similarly to the present
      ribs, with which the half-arches are joined. A “bridge,” a direct
      connection, has been established in the pelvis between the two
      nervous systems, of which even now indications may be seen in
      slender fibrils that run between the two systems. Running down
      within the nature-cord, then across the bridge and upward in the
      spinal cord is a continuous canal, which, as stated above, is for
      the passage of breath and nerve currents, and for the use of the
      doer, the thinker, and the knower.<br>
      The present ganglia and nerve plexuses of both systems are greatly
      augmented and fill the body cavities; they form the four brains
      before mentioned. The body is by that time largely a body of
      nerves.<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <b>Aia </b>: is the name here given to a unit that has
      successively progressed through each and every degree in being
      conscious as its function in a University of Laws, in a perfect,
      sexless and immortal body; which has graduated from nature, and is
      on the intelligent-side as a point or line distinguishing it from
      the nature-side.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Doer</b> : That conscious and inseparable part of the Triune
      Self which periodically re-exists in the man body or woman body,
      and which usually identifies itself as the body and by the name of
      the body. It is of twelve portions, six of which are its active
      side as desire and six are its passive side as feeling. The six
      active portions of desire re-exist successively in man bodies and
      the six passive portions of feeling re-exist successively in woman
      bodies. But desire and feeling are never separate; desire in the
      man body caused the body to be male and dominates its feeling
      side; and feeling in the woman body caused its body to be female
      and dominates its desire side.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Knower, The</b> : is that of the Triune Self which has and
      is actual and real knowledge, of and in time and the Eternal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Light, Attachable and Unattachable</b> : is the Conscious Light
      of the Intelligence loaned to the Triune Self, which the
      doer-in-the-body uses in its thinking. The attachable light is
      that which the doer sends into nature by its thoughts and acts,
      and reclaims and uses again and again. The unattachable Light is
      that which the doer has reclaimed and made unattachable, because
      it has balanced the thoughts in which the Light was. Light that is
      made unattachable is restored to one’s noetic atmosphere and is
      available to that one as knowledge.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Light, Conscious </b>: is the Light which the Triune Self
      receives from its Intelligence. It is not nature nor reflected by
      nature, though, when it is sent into nature and associates with
      nature units, nature seems to manifest intelligence, and it may be
      called the God in nature. When, by thinking, the Conscious Light
      is turned and held on any thing, it shows that thing to be as it
      is. The Conscious Light is therefore Truth, because Truth shows
      things to be as they are, without preference or prejudice, without
      disguise or pretense. All things are made known by it when it is
      turned and held on them. But the Conscious Light is fogged and
      obscured by thoughts when feeling-and-desire try to think, so the
      human being sees things as it wants to see them, or in a modified
      degree of Truth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Light in the Doer, Potential</b> : When one performs duties
      uncomplainingly, ungrudgingly and with pleasure because they are
      his duties, and not because he will profit or gain or get rid of
      them, he is balancing his thoughts which made those duties his
      duties, and the Light that he frees when the thoughts are balanced
      gives him a new sense of the joy of freedom. It gives him an
      insight into things and subjects he had not understood before. As
      he continues to free the Light he had kept bound in the things he
      craved and wanted, he begins to feel and understand the potential
      Light that is in him and which will be actual Conscious Light when
      he becomes an Intelligence.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Light of Nature</b> : is the reaction as shine, sparkle,
      brightness or glitter of combinations of nature units, to the
      Conscious Light sent into nature by the doers in human bodies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Thinker </b>: The real thinker of the Triune Self is between
      its knower, and its doer in the human body. It thinks with the
      mind of rightness and the mind of reason. There is no hesitancy or
      doubt in its thinking, no disagreement between its rightness and
      reason. It makes no mistakes in its thinking; and what it thinks
      is at once effective.<br>
      <br>
      The doer-in-the-body is spasmodic and unsteady in thinking; its
      feeling-and-desire-minds are not always in agreement, and their
      thinking is controlled by the body-mind that thinks through the
      senses and of the objects of the senses. And, instead of with the
      clear Light, the thinking is done usually in a fog and with the
      Light diffused in the fog. Yet, the civilization in the world is
      the result of the thinking and the thoughts that have made it.
      Were some of the doers in human bodies to become conscious that
      they are the immortals that they are, and to control instead of
      being controlled by, their body-minds, they could then turn the
      earth into a garden in every way superior to the legendary
      paradise.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Triune Self</b> : The indivisible self-knowing and immortal
      One; its identity and knowledge part as knower; its rightness and
      reason part as thinker, in the Eternal; and, its desire and
      feeling part as doer, existing periodically on the earth.<br>
