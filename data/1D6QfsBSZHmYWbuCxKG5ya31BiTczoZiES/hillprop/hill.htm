              Boats and Model Planes</b></big></b></div>
      <p>FOR ten years, Arthur D. Hill, Jr., a California commercial
        fisherman, has been observing and studying how the vibrating
        tails of fish enable them to dart through the water at great
        speeds. He also noted that birds, with their flapping wings,
        were still more efficient in flight than the most modern of
        airplanes with fixed wings. Puzzling out the principles
        involved, Hill determined to combine the methods of bird and
        fish, and he has finally developed an odd fishtail drive for
        Propelling model airplanes, and boats ranging from toy craft up
        to vessels thirty-five feet in length. On tiny boats having a
        single rudder, Hill’s fishtail mechanism is vibrated back and
        forth by means of an ordinary door-bell buzzer, powered by two
        dry-cell batteries. By reversing the rudder, the flutterings
        cause the craft to move backward. Dry-cell batteries also power
        the vibrating wings of Hill’s model airplane, shown in the
        photograph above. When suspended from the ceiling on a string,
        the little ship whirls around a circular course, its wings
        whirring so rapidly that they become invisible. For rowboat and
        canoe use, the inventor connects his fishtail propellers to
        handles, which the operator pumps up and down. This is said to
        drive the boat forward three feet for every foot the power
        device moves. On small toy boats and planes, such as shown in
        the accompanying illustrations, the fishtail drives are made of
        wood and silk, while for the larger craft airplane linen covered
        with creosote is used.<br>

        Inventor(s):&nbsp; HILL JR ARTHUR DEMPSEY<br>
        Applicant(s):&nbsp; ROLAND C HILL<br>
        Classification:&nbsp; - international: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A63H23/04; A63H23/00 - European: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A63H23/04<br>
      </p>
      <p>This invention relates to improvements in&nbsp; propelling
        mechanism and has particular reference to a propelling mechanism
        for a toy boat.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The principal object of this mechanism is to provide means for
        propelling a toy boat through the water with a minimum amount of
        power with a simple mechanism, and at the same time having the
        boat present the appearance common to boats.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Other objects and advantages will be apparent during the course
        of the following description.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the accompanying drawing forming a part of this
        specification and in which like numerals are employed to
        designate like parts throughout the same,<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 1</span> is a side
        elevation of my boat;<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 2</span> is a top plan
        view thereof;<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 3</span> is a modified
        form of my boat;<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 4</span> is a side
        elevation of the propeller per se;<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 5, 6, and 7</span> are
        similar views showing modified forms; and<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 8</span> is a cross
        sectional view taken on&nbsp; the line 8-8 of Fig. 5.<br>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 449px; height:
          591px;" alt="" src="fig1-8.jpg"><br>
      </p>
      <p>The ordinary toy boat is propelled by a clock work propeller
        which is very inefficient and requires a large spring, which is
        hard to wind, if the boat is to run for any length of time.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I have, therefore, devised a simple mechanism whereby a small
        battery will operate an ordinary electromagnet buzzer mechanism
        for a considerable period of time, the clapper of which buzzer
        is extended so as to vibrate a propeller within the water.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the accompanying drawing wherein for the purpose of
        illustration is shown a preferred embodiment of my invention,
        the numeral 5 designates&nbsp; the hull of the boat having cabin
        spaces, as shown at A and&nbsp; B. Within the cabin spaces I
        prefer to mount my mechanism which consists of a battery 6 and
        an electromagnet vibrator 7. This vibrator is connected to the
        battery in the customary manner, and a switch is shown at&nbsp;
        8. The armature or clapper 9 is extended outside of the cabin B
        and bent downwardly to form a curved section 11 beneath the
        water line. A member 12 serves to hold the upper end of a
        flexible flap 13.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the modified form shown in Fig. 3, I have shown the same
        construction, with the exception that I provide two clappers so
        that I have two propellers 15.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The result of this construction is that when the clapper
        vibrates back and forth, as indicate by arrows, the flexible
        portion&nbsp; 13 will belly first to one side and then to the
        other, as illustrated in Fig. 8, thus producing a vibrating or
        propulsive force. The pendulum spring action of the clapper
        makes possible the use of a comparatively small amount of power
        and saves energy.<br>
      </p>
      <p>[ <span style="font-style: italic;">N.B</span>. -- Or : The
        Milkovic Two-Stage Oscillator... <span style="font-style:
          italic;">Ed.</span> ]<br>
      </p>
      <p>The construction of the propellers is shown in Figs, 5, 6, and
        7 is substantially the same in that they consist of a supporting
        rod and flexible members secured thereto. The rods will have a
        substantially sharp leading edge and the flexible members will
        have a thin tapering following edge.</p>
      <p>The modified forms shown in Figs 6 and 7 provide means for
        increasing or decreasing the amount of sag in the flexible
        member 13 so that the pendulum action may be governed at will.
        The amount of sagginess of the flexible member 13 is regulated
        by adjusting the length of the turnbuckle arm positioned above
        the support member pivoted to the clapper arm 9, as shown in
        Figs. 6 and 7. In Fig. 7 extra pivoted support arms are provided
        to be used with larger propellers so as to provide a more
        sensitive action without undue strain upon the flexible portion
        of said propellers.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It is to be understood that the form of my invention herewith
        shown and described is to be taken as a preferred example of the
        same and that various changes relative to the material, size,
        shape and arrangement of parts may be resorted to without
        departing from the spirit of the invention or the scope of the
        subjoined claims. for instance, my invention can be used with
        large boats as well as small and can be adapted for use with
        airplanes and gliders, using a substantially similar type of
        propeller, although obviously designed to meet aerodynamic
        requirements...<br>
