            <p><i>Startup Kior has developed a process for creating
                "biocrude" directly from biomass.</i></p>
          </b></center>
        <b>
          <p align="left">Dutch biofuels startup Bioecon and Khosla
            Ventures have launched a joint venture called Kior, which
            will commercialize Bioecon's process for converting
            agricultural waste directly into "biocrude," a mixture of
            small hydrocarbon molecules that can be processed into fuels
            such as gasoline or diesel in existing oil refineries. The
            process, Kior claims, boasts numerous advantages over other
            methods of producing biofuels: it could prove relatively
            cheap, relies on a nontoxic catalyst, taps into the present
            fuel-refining and transportation infrastructure, and
            produces clean-burning fuels that can be used in existing
            engines. </p>
          <p align="left">Biofuels are widely seen as a key
            stepping-stone on the path from fossil fuels to renewable
            energy sources, particularly for transportation. Their use
            could also reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other
            greenhouse gases. But ethanol, the most widely produced
            biofuel, contains little energy compared with gasoline or
            diesel. And a great deal of energy goes into its production:
            growing the grain from which it is fermented, distilling it,
            and transporting it. Many biofuels boosters have pinned
            their hopes on finding ways to produce ethanol from
            cellulose, the tough polymer that makes up much of plant
            stems and wood. In practice, though, cellulose must be
            broken down into simple sugars before it can be fermented
            into ethanol or converted into synthetic gas and turned into
            fuels. Despite three decades of research, these remain
            difficult, expensive, and energy-intensive processes that
            are not yet commercially viable. Additionally, recent
            research shows that ethanol, which is highly volatile, may
            actually exacerbate smog problems when it evaporates
            directly into the air instead of burning in vehicle engines.
          </p>
          <p align="left">The way to make cellulosic biofuels viable,
            says Bioecon's founder, Paul O'Connor, is to use catalysts
            to convert biomass into a hydrocarbon biocrude that can be
            processed into gasoline and diesel in existing petroleum
            refineries. After decades developing catalysts for the
            petroleum industry, O'Connor started Bioecon in early 2006
            to develop methods for converting biomass directly into
            biofuels. His first success is a catalytic process that can
            convert cellulosic biomass into short-chain hydrocarbons
            about six to thirteen carbon atoms long. Khosla Ventures
            agreed to provide an undisclosed amount of series A funding
            to spinoff Kior in order to commercialize the process. Vinod
            Khosla, founder of the venture fund, believes that
            converting biomass into liquid transportation fuels is key
            to decreasing greenhouse-gas emissions and compensating for
            dwindling petroleum reserves. Khosla is funding a number of
            biofuels startups with competing technologies and says that
            Kior's approach is unique. "They have some very clever
            proprietary catalytic approaches that are pretty
            compelling," he says. "They can produce relatively cheap
            crude oi l --- that's attractive." </p>
          <p align="left">The most effective method of converting
            biomass into fuel requires subjecting it to high
            temperatures and high pressure to produce synthetic gas, or
            syngas. In the presence of a catalyst, the syngas reacts to
            produce fuels such as ethanol or methanol (used as an
            additive in biodiesel). But this is a costly process that
            often results in a product that is too low quality to be
            used as fuel without further processing. And catalysts able
            to withstand the high temperature of the syngas are
            expensive and frequently toxic. </p>
          <p align="left">Attempts to produce fuel by directly exposing
            agricultural cellulose to a catalyst have had little success
            because most of the cellulose is trapped inside plant stems
            and stalks. O'Connor says that while the Bioecon researchers
            are developing new catalysts, their "biomass cracking"
            process is the real breakthrough. Using proprietary methods,
            they have been able to insert a catalyst inside the
            structure of the biomass, improving the contact between the
            materials and increasing the efficiency of the process.
            While O'Connor won't go into details, he says that the most
            basic version of the technique might involve impregnating
            the biomass with a solution containing the catalyst; the
            catalyst would then be recrystallized. "What we're doing now
            is improving the method to make it easier and cheaper,"
            O'Connor says. </p>
          <p align="left">Such a method would eliminate the need for the
            superhigh temperatures and toxic catalysts used in other
            thermochemical methods for cellulosic-biofuel production.
            While O'Connor says that he is still improving Kior's
            catalyst, his first versions are different kinds of modified
            clays, which are both cheap and environmentally friendly.
            The product is high quality as well, containing less acid,
            oxygen, and water. These characteristics make it suitable
            for burning as heating oil or for use in petroleum
            refineries, which can use existing processes and equipment
            to convert it into the longer hydrocarbon chains of gasoline
            and diesel fuel. </p>
          <p align="left">Bioecon has produced lab-scale quantities of
            its biocrude, a few grams at a time, from materials such as
            wood shavings, sugarcane waste, and various grasses. While
            the input material affects the yield somewhat, O'Connor says
            that the output is "all very similar, so we do not have a
            real preference." This means that the process can work
            around the world, with whatever biomass is locally
            available, almost year-round. </p>
          <p align="left">Kior is already in talks with at least two oil
            companies to establish partnerships to further develop the
            technology. It is starting a pilot plant with one company
            that should produce around 20 kilograms of biocrude a day
            within six to twelve months, says Kior CEO Rob van der Meij.
            If all goes well, the process could scale up to production
            of hundreds of kilos per day by 2009, and refined versions
            of Kior's biocrude might be blended into gasoline or diesel
            by 2010. In addition to being renewable, these fuels would
            have lower sulfur and nitrogen content, which should
            decrease smog in cities such as Los Angeles and Houston. </p>
          <p align="left">Because of its ability to slide into the
            existing petroleum refining and delivery infrastructure, the
            technology has a huge cost advantage, says O'Connor. It
            could also be adopted much more rapidly, according to
            Khosla. "If you can do a solution that's compatible with the
            oil companies and their current refineries, it becomes much
            easier for them to get comfortable with it," he says.
            "Getting them into the game would be a big addition." </p>
          <p align="left">Steve Deutch, a senior research scientist at
            the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, says that the
            little information Kior has released about its process is
            plausible enough, but that until the details are available,
            the company's claims are "not really possible to evaluate."
            The main challenge for Kior, or anyone working on cellulosic
            fuels, Deutch says, is to develop a process simple enough to
            bring close to the sources of biomass-farms. "Collecting
            biomass and getting enough of it in one place to make a
            difference is a problem in the biomass world," Deutch says.
            "Trucking costs can become exorbitant. You want to
            preprocess it at the farm and then ship a high-density,
            high-energy intermediate to processing plants." </p>
          <p align="left">The answer is of course harvesting of seaweed.
            You have huge refinary ships that process the seaweed
            collected with smaller boats. You pump the ready fuel to
            tankers and the waste products can be shipped as fertilizers
            (?) Land can be used for more constructive things. e.g.
            forests. </p>
