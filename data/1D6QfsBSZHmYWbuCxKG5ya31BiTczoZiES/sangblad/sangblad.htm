      </p>
      <p>What is BLADE? </p>
      <p>BLADE attaches to your tailpipe and reduces emissions of CO2
        and toxic particulate material, and it improves fuel economy to
        save you hundreds of dollars per year on gas. </p>
      <p>It’s good for you because it saves you money on gas; and it's
        good for the environment, which is good for all of us. </p>
      <p><b>Gas Mileage &amp; Cost Savings</b> </p>
      <p>Laboratory testing using the EPA 511 Protocol shows gas mileage
        increases of as much as 6 MPG. Consumer experiences conducted on
        a wide variety of cars, light duty trucks and SUV’s in the U.S.,
        Europe, and Latin America have resulted in gas mileage increase
        up to: </p>
      <p>34% on 4-cylinder cars, e.g. Honda Civics, Toyota Corollas,
        Ford Focuses, etc. <br>
        21% on light duty trucks and SUV’s, e.g. GMC 2500s, Chevy
        Avalanches, Range Rovers, etc. <br>
        16% on dual exhaust 8-cylinder sedans, e.g. Lincoln Town Cars,
        Crown Victorias, etc. <br>
        24% on 10 cylinder Box-style trucks, e.g. U-Haul moving trucks.
      </p>
      <p><b>CO2 Reduction</b> </p>
      <p>Laboratory test results show decreases of carbon dioxide (CO2)
        up to 12%.&nbsp; CO2 is a potent greenhouse gas and is the
        primary cause of manmade global warming. </p>
      <p><b>Particulate Material (PM) Filtration</b> </p>
      <p>Particulate Material (soot) is an air pollutant known to cause
        grave environmental and human health consequences.
        Environmentalvconsequences of PM include: air pollution, water
        pollution, deforestation, crop degradation, acid rain,
        acidification of waterwaysv and smog. Health consequences of PM
        include: cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory disease,
        fibrosis, asthma, reduced pulmonary function and increased
        mortality. </p>
      <p><b>Proven Results -- EPA 511 Testing at ATDS</b> </p>
      <p><i>Testing at ATDS using The EPA 511 Protocol --&nbsp; </i>The
        Blade's laboratory fuel economy and emission testing were
        conducted by Lactec Laboratories in Curitiba, Brazil, and
        Automotive Testing and Development Services, Inc. (ATDS), a
        California based independent testing laboratory which is
        accepted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
        (EPA) and is licensed by the California Air Resources Board
        (CARB). </p>
      <p>At ATDS the Blade was tested on a 2004 Honda Civic using the
        EPA 511 Testing Protocol – is a combination of the EPA's FTP-75
        and High-way Fuel Economy Tests. The EPA 511 test Protocol is
        the most rigorous EPA recognized test procedure in existence,
        and it is the only test procedure that the EPA considers
        statistically valid. </p>
      <p>The Blade has also been tested for fuel economy and durability.
        Endurance road tests conducted in the United States, Europe and
        Latin America have shown up to 34% increases in overall fuel
        savings, while causing no adverse effects to test vehicles after
        35,000 miles. </p>
      <p><b>What About My Car?</b> </p>
      <p>The The BLADE works on a wide range of passenger cars, hybrids,
        light duty trucks and <br>
        SUVs. </p>
      <p>The BLADE is NOT a high performance product. Extreme driving
        may cause damage to <br>
        the filter carteridge which could require cartridge replacement.
      </p>
      <p><i>The BLADE will fit your vehicle if:</i> </p>
      <p>Your vehicle has a straight 1 7/8 - 2 inch tail pipe. </p>
      <p>Note: many vehicles have decorative exhaust tips which may give
        the appearance that the Blade will not fit. In most instances,
        removing the decorative tip will reveal a 1 7/8 2 inch tail
        pipe. If you need to remove your exhaust tip, we recommend that
        you see a professional for installation. A normal exhaust shop,
        i.e. Midas, Meineke, etc. can do this easily. </p>
      <p>Your vehicle has an exposed straight tailpipe measuring 1 7/8 –
        2 inches in diameter. Examples – 2004 Honda Civic </p>
      <p>You have duel exhaust pipes that are both straight 1 7/8 - 2
        inch pipes (in which case you will need two BLADEs). </p>
      <p>You have a tailpipe larger than 2 1/4 inches. In this case you
        will need to get a splitter adapter on which you can mount 2
        Blades. </p>
      <p>You have two 1 7/8 - 2 inch tail pipes coming out of the same
        muffler. In this case, you will need to make sure that these
        pipes are not too close together. </p>
      <p>Still not sure about your car? Then ask Skip. Be sure to
        provide the make, model and year of <br>
        your car as well as description of your tail pipe configuration.

            ">http://www.bladeyourride.com/howitworks.html</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>BLADE works in three ways: </p>
      <p>1. BLADE reduces emissions of Particulate Material by filtering
        them from the exhaust stream. </p>
      <p>Particulate Material (or, PM) emissions are composed of
        unburned or partially burned fuel. PM emissions vary in size and
        composition, and they are very hazardous to human health and the
        environment. </p>
      <p>BLADE’s patented bobbin and cartridge technology effectively
        reduces post-catalytic particulate emission by physically
        capturing them and removing them the exhaust stream.&nbsp; This
        reduces the emission of these particulates into the environment.
      </p>
      <p>2. BLADE reduces emissions and improves fuel economy by
        decreasing the duration of "cold start" operations. </p>
      <p>The second way that BLADE reduces emissions and improves fuel
        economy is by decreasing the duration of your vehicles period of
        “cold start” operations. Cold start is the time between when you
        start your car’s engine, and the time when your catalytic
        converter reaches its minimum operating temperature.&nbsp; Cold
        start is also the period when your vehicle emits its greatest
        amount of pollution, and when it consumes higher than normal
        amounts of fuel. </p>
      <p>Your catalytic converter is like a furnace that sits between
        your engine and your tailpipe. Its job is to burn or “oxidize”
        harmful emissions like hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and,
        nitrogen oxides into benign emissions like water vapor, carbon
        dioxide, and elemental nitrogen and oxygen. </p>
      <p>In order for your converter to do this however, it needs to be
        very hot… about 400 degrees C. So when you start your engine,
        your converter needs to heat up before it’s able to start
        working. </p>
      <p>Late model cars employ different strategies in order to
        accelerate the converter’s heating process. A common strategy is
        to use additional fuel in order to create a richer (hotter
        burning) air/fuel mixture. A richer mixture not only results in
        an increased amount of emissions being produced by your engine
        during this period, but it also results in your engine burning
        excessive amounts of fuel. </p>
      <p>Laboratory testing shows that the BLADE decreases cold start
        operation times by over 20%. Decreasing cold start times in this
        manner does three things : it decreases the amount of harmful
        emissions that escape from your tailpipe before your converter
        starts working; it decreases the amount of emissions produced by
        your engine that result from running a richer-than normal- fuel
        mixtures,&nbsp; and it decreases the amount of gas that your car
        consumes during this process. </p>
      <p>3.&nbsp; BLADE decreases emissions and increases fuel economy
        by increasing the Volumetric Efficiency (VE) of your engine. </p>
      <p>Volumetric efficiency (VE) is defined as amount of air that an
        engine ingests, relative to its theoretical maximum. </p>
      <p>An internal combustion engine can be thought of as an air
        pumping station: air is pulled in through one end and pushed out
        the other.&nbsp; During this process, the air is mixed with fuel
        and exposed to a spark to create combustion, which in turn
        generates mechanical power. </p>
      <p>An engine's control systems&nbsp; attempt to maximize the
        efficiency of combustion by carefully controlling the amount of
        air and fuel that is mixed together before exposing that mixture
        to a spark.Combustion is efficient when the mixture in the
        combustion chamber burns completely.&nbsp; The more completely
        it burns, the more energy it releases, and the less pollutive
        emissions it produces. </p>
      <p>In theory, all of the exhaust gas that is produced from
        combustion is expelled out of the combustion chamber during the
        exhaust stroke.In practice however, that isn’t what actually
        happens. When a piston pushes the exhaust gas through the
        exhaust valve, not all of the exhaust gas gets expelled from
        chamber, i.e. not all of the gas gets “pumped” out.&nbsp; As a
        result, exhaust gas is present inside the chamber during the
        following intake stroke. </p>
      <p>Not only does this residual exhaust gas distort the composition
        of the new mixture after it enters the chamber, the volume that
        this gas occupies creates resistance against the mixture that is
        being “pumped” in. This reduces the “pumping” efficiency of your
        engine.&nbsp; This phenomenon is called “pumping loss”, and it
        is an inherent inefficiency of four-stroke internal combustion
        engines. </p>
      <p>In addition, some of the exhaust gas that is actually expelled
        out of the chamber during the exhaust stroke slides back through
        the exhaust valve and into the combustion chamber immediately
        before the exhaust valve closes. This phenomenon is called
        “backsliding”; and it is a major cause of the pumping loss. </p>
      <p>When combustion occurs, it expels two things from the
        combustion chamber: 1) a pulse or “wave” of exhaust gas, and 2)
        a pulse, or “wave” of energy. </p>
      <p>A big difference between the “gas wave” and the “energy wave”
        is that the energy wave travels about 5-times faster than the
        gas wave — at a rate of approximately 1,500 feet per second.When
        the energy wave travels through the exhaust system, it
        encounters obstacles, such as bends in the manifold, or the
        catalytic converter.&nbsp; These obstacles cause the energy wave
        to “bounce” or “revert” backwards in the form of a “reversion
        wave”.Reversion waves transmit energy back towards the
        engine.&nbsp; At supersonic speeds, it doesn’t take long for a
        reversion wave to reach the engine’s exhaust valve, which is
        still in the process of releasing the much slower-traveling wave
        of exhaust gas.&nbsp; When a wave of reverted energy encounters
        the gas wave, the more energy intensive reversion wave forces
        pressure upon it — pushing, or “backsliding” some of its gas
        back into the combustion chamber.&nbsp; And this is how
        reversion waves create backsliding!&nbsp; And backsliding is a
        major cause of pumping loss. </p>
      <p>In the presence of pumping loss of backsliding, instead of
        having only clean air and fuel in the combustion chamber, you
        now have: clean air and fuel, plus dirty exhaust gas.&nbsp; This
        means that combustion is actually occurring at a CLEAN air/fuel
        ratio of less than 14.7/1, and this is inefficient. Remember
        that Volumetric Efficiency is the amount of air that an engine
        ingests relative to its theoretical maximum. </p>
      <p>In practice, “The amount of air that an engine ingests” can be
        described as the actual amount of good, clean air, plus the
        dirty exhaust gas that remains inside the chamber.&nbsp; The
        “theoretical maximum” describes the potential of having exactly
        the right amount of air in the chamber — a ratio of 14.7/1 — and
        that all of that air is CLEAN air. </p>
      <p>Therefore, the closer you are to the “theoretical maximum”, the
        greater amount of volumetric efficiency you achieve. When you
        increase volumetric efficiently, you increase the efficiency of
        internal combustion.&nbsp; And when you increase the efficiency
        internal combustion, you get better fuel economy and less
        pollutive emissions. </p>
      <p>BLADE increases volumetric efficiency by reducing pumping loss
        and backsliding. </p>

              Mileage?</font></b> </p>
        <p><i>Shiny Car Accessory Promises Reduced Emissions and Gas
            Savings. But Does it Work?</i> </p>
        <p>by <b>Jim Motavalli</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Wouldn't it be great if you could buy a device on the Internet
        for, I don't know, $200, bolt it onto your car and enjoy an
        instant reduction in emissions and an increase in fuel economy?
      </p>
      <p>Claims like that are as old as the hills. We've all heard about
        the 100-miles-per-gallon carburetor that "they" don't want you
        to have, and the scientist whose invention was mysteriously
        suppressed just as he was about to bring incredibly cheap
        people's power to the world (think Nikola Tesla). </p>
      <p>It's inevitable that when fuel prices zoomed up, these devices
        would see a revival. (Yes, I know gas has come down, but is
        anyone really happy with $3 a gallon?) </p>
      <p>Free lunches are hard to come by, however. Popular Mechanics
        tested a bunch of "fuel savers" back in 2005 and concluded that
        absolutely none of them worked. One even started a fire. These
        devices use miracle magnets, vortex generators, ionizers and
        water injection. But the only thing they reduced, PM said, was
        the cash in your wallet. </p>
      <p>And this brings us to the latest device, The Blade, which bolts
        on to the exhaust pipe. It's kind of cool looking in a retro
        way. Remember those chrome exhaust tips people put on their cars
        to create a fake hot rod? I've only seen pictures on the
        website, and I have no idea if the Brazil-sourced Blade actually
        works. But, given the history, I think caution might be in
        order. </p>
      <p>Don't worry, though, because actress Laura Dern says it works.
        "Having a Blade on my hybrid car allows me to continue driving
        with the satisfaction that I am lowering my carbon footprint and
        burning less fuel," she says. </p>
      <p>The Blade is definitely more credible than most. The company
        paid for independent testing by the respected Automotive Testing
        and Development Services (ATDS) in Canada. On a 2004 Honda
        Civic, the Blade allegedly achieved a 57 percent reduction in
        hydrocarbons, 14 percent in carbon monoxide, 34 percent in
        nitrogen oxides and six percent in carbon dioxide (the main
        global warming gas). And on the highway, the numbers show it
        achieving a five percent fuel economy improvement. </p>
      <p>ATDS Vice President Lin Farmer, who conducted the tests, said
        the Blade "seemed to be doing something on the positive side."
        He pointed out, however, that the 2004 Civic is a very
        low-emission car (the numbers for emissions of hydrocarbons, for
        instance, ranged from 0.0010 without the Blade, to 0.0004 with
        it). </p>
      <p>"It's possible that some of the large improvements in gases are
        due to test-to-test variability and the fact that we were
        working with such small numbers," Farmer said. He added,
        however, that the Blade "performed better than other devices we
        tested." And the fuel economy numbers impressed him. </p>
      <p>William J. O'Brien founded parent company Sabertec in 2005,
        after he came across the Blade on a visit to Brazil in his role
        as a venture capitalist. He's a great talker, and I can't
        pretend to understand everything he said. Luckily, there's a You
        Tube video that lets you judge for yourself. Here's some of what
        he said to me when I asked him how a device bolted on to the
        tailpipe can increase fuel economy. It's unfortunately somewhat
        paraphrased, because he talks fast: </p>
      <p>"There's a phenomenon called backsliding. When the spark goes
        off and the piston fires, there is both an exhaust wave and an
        energy or sound wave (which is five times faster than the
        exhaust wave). When the reversion wave bounces out, some of it
        goes back into the exhaust chamber, affecting fuel economy. The
        ratio of air to fuel is affected. The Blade compresses the sound
        wave, with a vacuum effect, so the exhaust is sucked more freely
        toward the tailpipe. You end up with a cleaner charge." </p>
      <p>O'Brien said it was "difficult to put all this in layman's
        terms," and related the effect to something called "exhaust
        scavenging." The website goes into great detail. O'Brien: "Talk
        to someone who says he knows a lot about engines, and they'll
        say, "No way will this work.' But if you talk to someone who's
        really knowledgeable, they say, 'Oh, sure, that's exhaust
        scavenging.'" </p>
      <p>To his credit, O'Brien says he's funding $250,000 worth of
        further testing, on several different vehicles, including a Ford
        E250 van and a Toyota Prius. The results aren't out yet. And he
        admits that some of his earlier emissions numbers are based on
        trace readings, and thus the 57 and 34 percent reductions may
        not mean a whole lot. "We're moving away from some of that," he
        said. "We want to stress the fuel economy advantages, and what
        the Blade does as a fine particulate filter and reducer of
        greenhouse gases." </p>
      <p>For further enlightenment, I went to an expert, Jim Kliesch, a
        senior engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "I wish
        them all the best, but I'm dubious," he said. "On some of those
        readings the numbers are so small that the changes are actually
        minimal. And I don't see any proof of their mileage claims. If
        they had a variety of vehicles independently tested, then I
        could take it seriously." </p>
      <p>So we await the further testing results. The mileage claims
        Kliesch was referring to are not from the test data, but are on
        the website. According to what O'Brien calls "customer
        experience," the Blade has achieved 34 percent improved fuel
        economy on four-cylinder cars, 21 percent on light-duty trucks
        and 16 percent on dual-exhaust eight-cylinder sedans. There's no
        way to verify any of that. </p>
      <p>It's hard to believe there's a free lunch, or a bolt-on device,
        that can achieve improvements like that. Popular Mechanics
        reports, "There's no ignoring the laws of physics, people. Your
        vehicle already burns over 99 percent of the fuel you pay for.
        Less than one percent is squandered as partially burned
        hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide before the exhaust hits the
        catalytic converter for the last laundering. Even if one of
        these miracle gadgets could make the combustion process 100
        percent complete, the improvement in mileage resulting would be
        one percent." </p>
      <p>So when it comes to the Blade, let's see those independent test

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] There is a need for a method and system capable of
        efficiently and effectively filtering pollutants from exhaust
        gases. Although there are a number of devices available which
        are useful for filtering exhaust gases from diesel engines, each
        of these devices is incapable of providing an effective method
        for reducing pollutants cost effectively for the reasons
        described herein. </p>
      <p>[0003] In a diesel engine, air is drawn into the cylinders and
        is compressed by the pistons at compression ratios as high as
        25:1, much higher than used for spark-ignited combustion
        engines. Near the end of the compression stroke, diesel fuel is
        injected into the combustion chamber through an injector (or
        atomizer). The fuel ignites from contact with the air that due
        to compression has been heated to a temperature of about
        700-900.degree. C. The resulting combustion causes increased
        heat and expansion in the cylinder which increases pressure and
        moves the piston downward. A connecting rod transmits this
        motion to a crankshaft to convert linear motion to rotary motion
        for use as power in a variety of applications. Intake air to the
        engine is usually controlled by mechanical valves in the
        cylinder head. For increased power output, most modern diesel
        engines are equipped with a turbocharger, and in some
        derivatives, a supercharger to increase intake air volume. Use
        of an aftercooler to cool intake air that has been compressed,
        and thus heated, by the turbocharger increases the density of
        the air and typically leads to power and efficiency
        improvements. </p>
      <p>[0004] In general, diesel emissions are bi-products of diesel
        combustion. This can be a function of injection within the
        engine. For example, advancing the start of injection (injecting
        before the piston reaches top of dead center) results in higher
        in-cylinder pressure and temperature, and higher efficiency, but
        also results in higher emissions of oxides of nitrogen oxides
        through higher combustion temperatures. At the other extreme,
        delayed start of injection causes incomplete combustion and
        emits visible black smoke made of particulate matter and
        unburned hydrocarbon. While many diesel emissions are
        problematic, the most highly regulated diesel emissions are:
        [0005] 1. Diesel Particuiate Material ("PM", or "DPM") (also
        referred to as "Diesel Particulate Matter", "Particulate
        Material", or "Particulate Matter"): Particulate matter is an
        aerosol comprised of complex physical and chemical structures.
        Particulate matter contributes to the greenhouse effect, it
        causes grave environmental damage, and it seriously affects
        human health. Particulate matter is primarily responsible for
        the black smoke normally associated with diesel exhaust. It is
        also a primary source of urban smog. [0006] 2. Nitrogen Oxides
        (NO.sub.x): Nitrogen Oxides are highly active ozone precursors
        and account for a large component of visible smog. Besides
        particulate matter, nitrogen oxides are one of the most
        pollutive diesel emissions. [0007] 3. Hydrocarbons (HC): The
        production of hydrocarbons is often a result of the inefficient
        combustion of fuel and engine lube oils. In the atmosphere,
        hydrocarbons undergo photochemical reactions with nitrogen
        oxides leading to formation of smog and ground level ozone.
        [0008] 4. Carbon Monoxide (CO): This is a highly toxic
        greenhouse gas that is poisonous to humans and is a contributor
        to global warming. </p>
      <p>[0009] Examples of non-regulated bi-products of diesel
        combustion include polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes,
        sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and metal oxide. </p>
      <p>[0010] Inefficient combustion of diesel fuel produces emissions
        that pollute the environment and harm human health. The
        environmental consequences of particulate material emissions
        include air pollution, water pollution, acid rain, acidification
        of waterways, deforestation, smog, reduced atmospheric
        visibility, crop degradation, global warming, and climate
        forcing. In addition, the human health consequences of
        particulate material emissions include cardiovascular disease,
        respiratory disease, cancer, fibrosis, allergic responses,
        reduced pulmonary function, worsening of asthmatic symptoms and
        occurrences, increased morbidity, and premature death. Moreover,
        a number of internationally publicized studies demonstrate a
        high correlation between ambient particulate material and
        increases in adverse health outcomes such as respiratory
        hospital admissions, emergency room visits, restricted activity
        days, respiratory symptoms for adults, lower respiratory tract
        illnesses for children, asthmatic attacks, chronic diseases, and
        mortality. </p>
      <p>[0011] Although conventional diesel emission filtration
        technologies are numerous, there are essentially two categories
        into which all such technologies fall: [0012] 1. Catalyzed
        Diesel Particulate Filters ("CDPFs"): catalyzed diesel
        particulate filters are referred to by many different names.
        Some of the most commonly used--and misused--are: "catalytic
        converters," "catalytic Reactors," "catalytic purifiers,"
        "exhaust purifiers," "trap filters," "diesel traps," "exhaust
        scrubbers," "catalyst filters," "catalyzed wall-flow filters,"
        "wall-flow filters," and "catalytic mufflers." [0013] 2. Diesel
        Oxidation Catalysts ("DOCs"): diesel oxidation catalysts are
        also commonly referred to as "oxidation catalysts,"
        "flow-through catalysts," and "flow-through devices." </p>
      <p>[0014] Both catalyzed diesel particulate filters and diesel
        oxidation catalysts employ the same basic method to achieve the
        reduction of particulate materials; they utilize heat to
        "oxidize" or bun the particulate material. In most cases, the
        heat from the engine's exhaust system is used to achieve
        oxidation. The reoccurring process of oxidation is also often
        referred to "regeneration" because the process of oxidation not
        only reduces particulate material emissions, it also regenerates
        the catalytic device's filtration capacity. </p>
      <p>[0015] In order for the process of regenerative oxidation to
        occur, high temperatures, normally between 250.degree. and
        350.degree. C., must be attained and preferably sustained during
        operation. In many operating conditions, attaining sufficiently
        high temperatures can prove difficult or unattainable. Catalytic
        devices (CDPF's and DOC's) employ precious metals such as
        platinum, palladium and rhodium as catalysts to lower the
        minimum temperatures necessary to achieve "light off", the point
        at which oxidation of the particulate material is initiated.
        Manufactures use these highly conductive, and very expensive,
        metals to coat or impregnate the substrate surfaces of their
        catalytic devices. </p>
      <p>[0016] The catalytic devices discussed above can generally be
        described as either active or passive. Catalytic technologies
        which rely on heat from an engine's exhaust system in order to
        achieve oxidation are frequently referred to as "passive"
        catalytic devises. Other systems may incorporate fuel burners,
        electric heating elements, and fuel-borne additives which aid in
        attaining the temperatures at which oxidation occurs.
        Technologies which employ these types of components are often
        referred to as "active" catalytic devices. </p>
      <p>[0017] For purposes of eliminating potential confusion, it
        should be noted that some manufacturers define catalyzed diesel
        particulate filters which only contain precious metal catalysts
        as "active" devices, even though these devices rely solely upon
        the heat contained in an engine's exhaust to achieve oxidation.
        This classification usually occurs when the manufacturer also
        produces a diesel particulate filter which contains no catalyst,
        i.e. a device which is in all other ways similar to a catalyzed
        diesel particulate filter, however; the device relies solely
        upon the heating of its component base metal to achieve
        temperatures sufficient to initiate oxidation. Because exhaust
        temperatures are commonly required to exceed 500.degree. C. for
        these non-catalyzed devices to affect oxidation, their
        widespread use is significantly restricted. </p>
      <p>[0018] The primary difference between catalyzed diesel
        particulate filters and diesel oxidation catalyst technologies
        is that catalyzed diesel particulate filter technologies
        physically trap and store particulate material--usually by using
        catalyzed ceramic, cordierite or silicon carbide wall flow
        monoliths, or ceramic fiber or ceramic cartridge filters. Once
        the particulate material becomes trapped, it is oxidized and
        particulate material emissions are reduced. </p>
      <p>[0019] Conversely, diesel oxidation catalyst technologies do
        not trap particulate material emissions. Rather, particulate
        materials "pass-through" the internal structures of these
        devices. When exhaust gases traverse the catalyst, carbon
        monoxide, gaseous hydrocarbons and liquid hydrocarbon particles
        are oxidized, thereby reducing total particulate material
        emissions. </p>
      <p>[0020] There are a number of other differences between
        catalyzed diesel particulate filters and diesel oxidation
        catalyst technologies as well. For example, catalyzed diesel
        particulate filters can achieve particulate material filtration
        rates of .gtoreq.90% given specific, controlled operating
        conditions. Moreover, catalyzed diesel particulate filters
        reduce each sub-category of particulate material (i.e. solid
        inorganic fractions, solid organic fraction and sulfate
        particulates). It is necessary to note however, the application
        and effectiveness of catalyzed diesel particulate filters
        technology is significantly constrained by the following
        limitations: [0021] Catalyzed diesel particulate filters are
        very expensive. The California Air Resources Board provides
        cost-range information for DPF's corresponding to the following
        engine capacitates: [0022] 100 horsepower: US$5,000-US$7,000
        [0023] 275 horsepower: US$6,900-US$9,000 [0024] 400 horsepower:
        US$10,000 average [0025] 1,400 horsepower: US$32,000+ [0026]
        Catalyzed diesel particulate filters are incapable of affecting
        particulate material emissions reductions when using fuels that
        exceed 150 ppm Sulfur. [0027] Catalyzed diesel particulate
        filters performance is adversely affected by insufficient
        operating temperatures. [0028] In less-than-optimal conditions,
        catalyzed diesel particulate filters are prone to clogging and
        failure. When failure occurs, the potential for engine damage or
        destruction is significant. [0029] Because catalyzed diesel
        particulate filters can create significant engine back pressure,
        expensive engine recalibrations are often required upon their
        installation. [0030] catalyzed diesel particulate filters often
        need to be equipped with expensive electronic back pressure
        monitoring devices, such as data loggers. [0031] Because passive
        catalyzed diesel particulate filters regeneration is entirely
        dependent on operating temperature, passive catalyzed diesel
        particulate filters do not work under "low load" conditions.
        [0032] "Active" components in catalyzed diesel particulate
        filter technologies significantly increase catalyzed diesel
        particulate filters unit price and complexity. [0033] Catalyzed
        diesel particulate filters do not work well on older engines.
        [0034] Catalyzed diesel particulate filters can become a source
        of hazardous zinc, sulfuric, calcium, and phosphorus ash
        particulate. [0035] Catalyzed diesel particulate filters can
        reduce engine performance. [0036] Catalyzed diesel particulate
        filters often produce fuel economy penalties. </p>
      <p>[0037] According to the United States Department of Energy
        (USDOE), fuel sulfur has significant effects on post-filter
        total particulate material emissions, and, as fuel sulfur levels
        increase, catalyzed diesel particulate filter reduction
        efficiencies decreases to a point where they actually becomes a
        source of particulate emissions when using fuels with sulfur
        concentrations .gtoreq.150 PPM. </p>
      <p>[0038] Tests conducted by the USDOE report that catalyzed
        diesel particulate filters that achieved 95% reductions of
        particulate material emissions when using fuels with 3 ppm
        sulfur concentrations had their filtration efficiencies reduced
        to only 74% when using fuels with 30 ppm sulfur concentrations.
        Further, these same devices were reduced to particulate material
        filtration rates of 0% to -3% when using fuels with 150 ppm
        sulfur concentrations, and they experienced total particulate
        material emissions increases of 122% to 155% when using fuels
        with sulfur concentrations .gtoreq.350 ppm. </p>
      <p>[0039] Moreover, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)
        has stated that catalytic technologies can not work properly if
        there is sulfur in the fuel--and in some cases, sulfur in the
        fuel will render the catalytic filtration equipment and even the
        vehicle inoperable. </p>
      <p>[0040] By comparison, diesel oxidation catalyst technologies
        are generally less expensive than catalyzed diesel particulate
        filter technologies, and because diesel oxidation catalysts are
        "flow through", instead of "wall flow" devises, they do not have
        the same propensity to create engine back pressure, clog and/or
        cause potential engine damage like their catalyzed diesel
        particulate filter counterparts. Diesel oxidation catalysts can
        achieve particulate material filtration rates between 19% and
        50%. However, the application of diesel oxidation catalyst
        technology is constrained by the following: [0041] Diesel
        oxidation catalysts are too expensive for wide-spread
        application. The California Air Resources Board provides cost
        average information for diesel oxidation catalysts corresponding
        to the following engine capacitates: [0042] 275 horsepower:
        US$2,100 [0043] 400 horsepower: US$20,000+ [0044] The Everett
        School District in Washington state reported an average
        per-unit-cost of US$2,500 per DOC for each bus in its fleet
        [0045] Diesel oxidation catalyst reduction of total particulate
        material is significantly reduced when using fuels with high
        sulfur fuels. [0046] Diesel oxidation catalysts do not filter
        solid organic fraction sometimes called "dry") particulate and
        dry particulates typically comprise the majority of total
        particulate material. [0047] Diesel oxidation catalysts do not
        work well on older engines. [0048] Diesel oxidation catalyst
        effectiveness is extremely dependent upon operating
        temperatures. [0049] When operating at higher temperatures,
        diesel oxidation catalysts oxidize sulfur oxides, and in doing
        so become generators of sulfuric acid. When this occurs, diesel
        oxidation catalysts create a net increase total particulate
        material emissions by increasing production of sulfate
        particulates at rates that offset soluble organic fraction
        reductions </p>
      <p>[0050] The University of Washington's Extension Energy Program
        has stated that diesel oxidation catalysts can oxidize sulfur
        dioxide to form sulfate particulates (sulfuric acid
        (H.sub.2SO.sub.4)). Therefore, high sulfur content fuels can
        increase total particulate emissions via the production of
        sulfuric acid, which can offset soluble organic fraction
        (sometimes called "wet" particulate material) reductions." </p>
      <p>[0051] The United States Department of Energy has found
        statistically significant increases in particulate material with
        high sulfur fuel due almost exclusively to the increase in the
        SO.sub.4 fraction of the total particulate material. At this
        high exhaust temperature (405.degree. C. at catalyst inlet), the
        diesel oxidation catalyst accelerates the conversion of SO.sub.2
        to SO.sub.3, thereby increasing the SO.sub.4 fraction of the
        particulate material. As expected, the effect is seen only with
        the higher sulfur (150 ppm and 350 ppm sulfur content) fuels.
        With the 350 ppm sulfur content fuel, post catalyst particulate
        material emissions were approximately 200% higher than those
        measured without an active catalyst. </p>
      <p>[0052] Despite the promoted efficiency of the methods and
        systems of the prior art, many are impracticable from the
        commercial point of view for the reasons set forth above.
        Moreover, the use of fuel with low concentration of sulphur
        (below 130 ppm) is an essential factor in the employment of
        catalytic regeneration filters. In Brazil and in the majority of
        the countries, the diesel is sold with 2000 ppm of sulphur.
        Therefore using the catalytic regeneration filters in diesel
        that contains more than 300 ppm of sulphur, turn the filters
        into a source of pollution. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0053] The system and method described herein relate to a novel
        solution for the improved use of fuel and the treatment of gases
        emitted from diesel engines and, more specifically, the gases
        that are emitted through exhaust pipes of vehicles such as
        automobile vehicles and industrial equipment. An objective of
        the present invention is to reduce environmental pollution and,
        as a result, to improve the conditions of life, including the
        quality and quantity of the flora and fauna on the planet Earth.
        The emission of pollutant gases in the atmosphere has
        significantly contributed to contamination of the environment.
        There is an overwhelming demand for a solution capable of
        curbing the alarming effects caused by worldwide environmental
        degradation. </p>
      <p>[0054] The present invention provides a variety of ecologic and
        economic advantages. For example, because the present invention
        filters particulates and greatly reduces the amount of carbon
        monoxide, hydrocarbons and other gases produced by the
        combustion of fuel, this invention has direct effect in the
        improvement of the environment. This minimizes the damaging
        effects of the environmental phenomenon known as the "greenhouse
        effect" and improves the air quality in urban centers. </p>
      <p>[0055] In one embodiment, the present invention comprises an
        outer casing which may be divided into a lower portion and an
        upper portion, the lower portion of which is removably
        attachable to the exhaust system of a diesel engine; a carcass
        for holding a bobbin wherein the carcass is attached to the
        lower portion of the outer casing at the point where the exhaust
        enters the outer casing and the carcass has a beveled opening in
        a diagonal line in its proximal part and a bobbin positioned in
        its distal part; one or more fibrous blanket cylinders; and a
        guide for arranging and securing the one or more fibrous blanket
        cylinders within the outer casing. The fibrous blanket cylinders
        may be wrapped in a wire mesh. In an alternative embodiment, a
        second fibrous blanket formed into a cone with the larger
        diameter of the cone positioned proximally may be removably
        inserted in the carcass. </p>
      <p>[0056] Results from initial tests of one embodiment of the
        present invention show that the device filters up to 69% of
        total particulate matter at a cost that is significantly less
        than either catalyzed diesel particulate filters or diesel
        oxidation catalysts. Moreover, the device is extremely effective
        with high sulfur content fuels (i.e. greater than 500 ppm
        sulfur). The device performs effectively on older engines, does
        not create engine back pressure, does not reduce engine fuel
        economy, captures both wet and dry particulate matter, is
        extremely durable, is easy to install and maintain, lasts
        indefinitely, and does not produce hazardous sulfur, lead or
        zinc bi-products. In addition, the device is effective under
        both high and low load conditions and its efficacy is not
        affected by engine operating temperatures. </p>
      <p>[0057] In addition, the invention also reduces the level of
        noises emitted from the exhaust system by acting as a sound

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>[0071] The present invention provides an efficient device and
        method for reducing the emission of harmful gases in the
        environment, reducing noise, reducing the consumption of fuel,
        and improving an engine's performance, all in a cost effective
        manner. The making and using of the presently preferred
        embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be
        appreciated, however, that the present invention provides many
        applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide
        variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed
        are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the
        invention, and do not limit the scope of the invention. </p>
      <p>[0072] In one embodiment, the present invention comprises an
        outer casing which may be divided into a lower portion and an
        upper portion, the lower portion of which is removably
        attachable to the exhaust system of a diesel engine; a carcass
        for holding a bobbin wherein the carcass is attached to the
        lower portion of the outer casing at the point where the exhaust
        enters the outer casing and the carcass has a beveled opening in
        a diagonal line in its proximal part and a bobbin positioned in
        its distal part; one or more fibrous blanket cylinders; and a
        guide for arranging and securing the one or more fibrous blanket
        cylinders within the outer casing. The fibrous blanket cylinders
        may be wrapped in a wire mesh. In an alternative embodiment, a
        second fibrous blanket formed into a cone with the larger
        diameter of the cone positioned proximally may be removably
        inserted in the carcass. </p>
      <p>[0073] Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows one
        embodiment of the lower portion of the outer casing 1 wherein an
        exhaust inlet 3 is positioned in the proximal end thereof. The
        proximal end of the exhaust inlet 3 may be affixed to the
        exhaust system of a diesel engine and the distal end of the
        exhaust inlet is affixed to, and forms an integral part of, the
        lower portion of the outer casing 1. The exhaust inlet 3 may be
        attached to the exhaust system in a variety of ways using a
        variety of attachment devices known in the art. The exhaust
        inlet 3 may be either permanently or removably attached to the
        exhaust system. The lower portion of the outer casing 1 may be
        made of any material capable of withstanding the heat and
        pressure of the application, such as for example, steel,
        aluminum, aluminized steel or stainless steel. </p>
      <p>[0074] FIG. 2 shows a side view of one embodiment of the
        carcass 5. The carcass 5 is generally cylindrical with a beveled
        opening 7 in a diagonal line in its proximal part where it is
        affixed to the distal end of the exhaust inlet. The distal end
        of the carcass 5 is configured for the passage of air, either
        through the placement of a screen or mesh at the end thereof, or
        by perforating the material used to construct the carcass 5. The
        distal end of the carcass 5 is also adapted to receive and to
        fix a bobbin 9. The carcass 1 may be made of any material
        capable of withstanding the heat and pressure of the
        application, such as for example, steel, aluminum, aluminized
        steel or stainless steel. The screen may be metallic such as,
        for example, a punched metal web or a wire mesh. The bobbin 9
        may be made of one or more metals or of other materials capable
        of withstanding the heat and pressure of an exhaust system and
        may be constructed by wrapping two metal fabrics around a
        central point. The carcass 5 may be attached to the exhaust
        inlet 3 in a variety of ways using a variety of attachment
        devices known in the art. The carcass 5 may be either
        permanently or removably attached to the exhaust inlet 3. </p>
      <p>[0075] In an alternative embodiment, a diaphragm formed by
        wrapping a fibrous blanket into a cone with the larger radius
        positioned proximally and the smaller radius positioned distally
        may be removably inserted in the carcass 5. In one embodiment of
        the invention, the diaphragm is constructed in such a manner
        that the overlapping ends at the narrow end of the cone are
        secured together and, in another configuration, the overlapping
        ends at the narrow end of the cone are allowed to overlap but
        are not secured to one another. The diaphragm may be removably
        attached to the carcass 5. The diaphragm may be made of any
        material capable of filtering particulate materials including
        one or more of an aramid, a meta-ararmid, a polyamide, a
        polyphenylene sulfide, a p-phenylene-1,3,4-oxadiazole,
        polytetrafluoroethylene, and basalt. </p>
      <p>[0076] FIG. 3 shows the carcass 5 attached to the distal end of
        the exhaust inlet 3. The bobbin 9 is visible through the
        perforations in the distal end of the carcass 5. </p>
      <p>[0077] FIG. 4 shows one embodiment of a guide 11 for arranging
        and securing fibrous blanket cylinders 13 within the outer
        casing. In the configuration shown, the guide is configured for
        the placement of seven cylinders however more or fewer cylinders
        may be used as desired. As shown, the distal end of the carcass
        5 is visible through the center hole in the guide 11 although
        that configuration is not essential to the operation of the
        device. The guide 11 may be made of any material capable of
        withstanding the heat and pressure of the application, such as
        for example, steel, aluminum, aluminized steel or stainless
        steel. </p>
      <p>[0078] FIG. 5 shows a fibrous blanket cylinder 13 being
        positioned in the center hole of the guide 11. In one
        configuration, the fibrous blanket cylinder 13 is made by
        wrapping the fibrous blanket in a punched metal web and/or metal
        mesh and overlapping the ends. Although the word cylinder is
        used in the nomenclature of the fibrous blanket cylinders 13,
        they may be configured as an oval, square, triangular or any
        other shape in which a tube may be formed. The fibrous blanket
        used to construct the fibrous blanket cylinder 13 may be made of
        any material capable of filtering particulate materials,
        including one or more of an aramid, a meta-aramid, a polyamide,
        a polyphenylene sulfide, a p-phenylene-1,3,4-oxadiazole,
        polytetrafluoroethylene, and basalt. A cap of the same or
        similar material may be placed over the distal end of the
        fibrous blanket cylinders 13. In addition, a bobbin 9 may be
        affixed at the distal end of one or more of the fibrous blanket
        cylinders 13. </p>
      <p>[0079] FIG. 6 shows a perspective view of seven fibrous blanket
        cylinders 13 configured in the guide 11 and FIG. 7 shows a side
        view of the fibrous blanket cylinders 13 configured in the guide
        11. It is important to note that, while seven fibrous blanket
        cylinders 13 are depicted, the number may be increased or
        decreases as the application may require. </p>
      <p>[0080] FIG. 8 shows a bottom view of one of the fibrous blanket
        cylinders 13 and FIG. 9 shows a bottom view of the fibrous
        blanket cylinders 13 affixed in the guide 11. </p>
      <p>[0081] FIG. 10 shows one embodiment of the device of the
        present invention with the upper portion of the outer casing 15
        attached. The upper portion of the outer casing 15 is configured
        with an exhaust outlet 17 may be made of any material capable of
        withstanding the heat and pressure of the application, such as
        for example, steel, aluminum, aluminized steel or stainless
        steel. The upper portion of the outer casing 15 may be attached
        to the lower portion of the outer casing 1 in a variety of ways
        using a variety of attachment devices known in the art. The
        upper portion of the outer casing 15 may be either permanently
        or removably attached to the lower portion of the outer casing
        1. </p>
      <p>[0082] When the device of the resent invention is installed on
        the exhaust system of a diesel engine, gas leaves the exhaust
        pipe and enters the exhaust inlet 3. The gas flows through the
        bobbin 9 or, in an alternative embodiment, flows first through
        the diaphragm and then through the bobbin 9. In either case, a
        portion of the gas is allowed to escape through the side of the
        carcass 5 due to the bevel 7. Some portion of the gas proceeds
        through the bobbin 9 and out the distal end of the carcass 5
        through the perforations or screen. The gas then proceeds
        through the fibrous blanket cylinders 13 and out the exhaust
        outlet 17. </p>
      <p>[0083] Both the bobbin 9 and the fibrous blanket cylinders 13
        act as material particle filters. In the bobbin 9, the gathering
        of material particles is accomplished by the collection of
        particles in the walls of the bobbin 9. The particles
        agglutinate as a result of the lost of speed and due to their
        own physical characterstics. The fibrous blanket cylinders 13
        collect material particles that do not pass through the
        material. These two systems of gathering of material particles
        are efficient and can be cleaned and reused. </p>
      <p>[0084] The bobbin 9 may be constructed using different metals,
        such as aluminum, zinc, copper, iron and others, to generate an
        electric or voltage differential that makes ions available to
        the system. </p>
      <p>[0085] Another important effect is the reduction of the sound
        emitted from the device resulting from the dampening of the
        shockwaves of gases against the bobbin 9 and the fibrous blanket
        cylinders 13 </p>
      <p>[0086] While the present system and method has been disclosed
        according to the preferred embodiment of the invention, those of
        ordinary skill in the art will understand that other embodiments
        have also been enabled. Even though the foregoing discussion has
        focused on particular embodiments, it is understood that other
        configurations are contemplated. In particular, even though the
        expressions "in one embodiment" or "in another embodiment" are
        used herein, these phrases are meant to generally reference
        embodiment possibilities and are not intended to limit the
        invention to those particular embodiment configurations. These
        terms may reference the same or different embodiments, and
        unless indicated otherwise, are combinable into aggregate
        embodiments. The terms "a", "an" and "the" mean "one or more"
        unless expressly specified otherwise. </p>
      <p>[0087] When a single embodiment is described herein, it will be
        readily apparent that more than one embodiment may be used in
        place of a single embodiment. Similarly, where more than one
        embodiment is described herein, it will be readily apparent that
        a single embodiment may be substituted for that one device. </p>
      <p>[0088] In light of the wide variety of possible filters, the
        detailed embodiments are intended to be illustrative only and
        should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention.
        Rather, what is claimed as the invention is all such
        modifications as may come within the spirit and scope of the

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] There is a need for a method and system capable of
        efficiently and effectively filtering pollutants from exhaust
        gases. Although there are a number of devices available which
        are useful for filtering and catalyzing combustion gases or
        chemical reactions, each of these devices is incapable of
        providing an effective method for reducing pollutants cost
        effectively for the reasons described herein. It is generally
        acknowledged that the functional efficiency of combustion
        engines is directly related to the engine's ability to discharge
        gas created during the combustion process. One key element of
        the efficient discharge of gas is the existence of an adequate
        amount of counter-pressure at the precise time during the
        combustion process. This is an issue that has largely been
        ignored in creating these devices. </p>
      <p>[0003] In general, an internal engine of combustion operates
        from the explosion of an air/fuel mixture that causes the
        expansion of the gases that move the piston of a cylinder. At
        the end of this cycle, an escape valve opens and the burnt gases
        are expelled at an extraordinary speed and sound. The
        performance of a combustion engine is affected by a variety of
        factors, including the quality of the fuel, pressure under which
        the fuel ignites, etc. </p>
      <p>[0004] Because of the importance of relationship between fuel
        and air in the combustion mixture, the engines in most vehicles
        or devices are controlled by an electronic injection system.
        When fuel and air are mixed, the spark plug ignites and causes
        the explosion that puts into motion some parts of the engine,
        thus enabling the vehicle or device to move. The result of this
        "explosion" inside the engine also produces a variety of
        pollutant gases which are eliminated through the exhaust system.
        Some of these gases are: water vapor (H.sup.2O); carbon dioxide
        (CO.sup.2); nitrogen (N.sup.2); carbon monoxide (CO);
        hydrocarbons (HxCy; nitrogen oxide (N.sup.2O); hydrogen Fit;
        methane (CH4); and oxygen (O.sup.2). The most toxic gases to
        human beings are: carbon monoxide (CO) which reduces the
        oxygenation of the blood, affects the nervous system, worsens
        cardiac and respiratory illnesses, and can cause fatigue and
        migraine in low concentrations and death in high concentrations;
        hydrocarbon (HxCy); and nitrogen oxide (N.sup.2O) which affects
        the lungs and heart, can cause bronchitis, acid deposition and
        diminishes the atmospheric visibility. </p>
      <p>[0005] Once a optimal performance of a combustion engine is
        achieved, the system metrics of the optimal system can be used
        as a reference against which to measure the effect of various
        changes to the exhaust system, such as the collector, the
        catalytic converter, the diameters of the pipe, and the systems
        for the elimination of noise. By altering characteristics of the
        system, it is possible to minimize the emission of harmful gases
        generated during combustion by increasing the periods of low
        pressure between gas emissions from the explosions. </p>
      <p>[0006] Besides the production of gases, burning fuel produces
        material particles (MP) that vary in composition in relation to,
        among other things, the type of fuel, the quality of the engine
        maintenance and also in relation to the working temperature of
        the engine. The material particles are formed from the
        agglomeration of hydrocarbons that are not combusted and water
        and impurities of the fuel to the nuclei of chemical carbon
        element. Material particulates can be inhaled and lodged in deep
        areas of the human lung, for example, and are widely considered
        to be an irritating agent for respiratory airways. These
        particles cause pulmonary illnesses that afflict the elderly and
        children mainly and in particular during the colder months of
        the year, when the temperatures are extremely low, a fact that
        increases the concentration of material particles. This process
        of contamination increases the cancerous elements that might
        possibly exist in material particles. It is also important to
        consider the other undesirable effects in the atmosphere, such
        as the reduction of visibility and the worsening of the
        "greenhouse effect". </p>
      <p>[0007] The material particles generally show a great
        dimensional variation. This variation causes any type of porous
        filter to a precocious saturation that, in turn, provokes
        functional overload to the components of the engine, resulting
        in an increase of fuel consumption, diminished power of the
        engine, increase of the volume of gases emitted during the
        combustion process, increase of temperature, and possible
        destruction of the engine. </p>
      <p>[0008] With the knowledge about problems caused by these gases,
        several components designed to assist in the emission control
        have been developed. Amongst the most important are electronic
        control unit ("E.C.U."), the lambda sensor, the EGR valve and
        the catalytic converter. The control of the air/fuel admission
        made by the E.C.U. is simply a microcontroller (microprocessor
        with embedded RAM and ROM memories, wherein the ROM already
        comes from the factory with specific program recorded on to it)
        making use of entrances of analog and digital exits, gathering
        the signals such as temperature and speed obtained from sensors.
        The E.C.U. searches in its entries for the sensors conditions.
        The software program recorded in its ROM analyses this data and,
        according to the programmed information, considers power,
        economy, and pollution factors to determine and implement the
        point of work of the valve of shock and the actuator of the
        impeller. </p>
      <p>[0009] The lambda sensor is typically located in the exhaust
        system. It measures the amount of oxygen molecules that have not
        been consumed in the combustion process and which are therefore
        expelled together with the combusted gases through the exhaust
        pipe. This way, the computer will command the injection of more
        fuel in case there are excess oxygen molecules or,
        alternatively, to inject less fuel in cases where there are
        fewer oxygen molecules. By enriching or impoverishing the
        air/fuel mixture, the engine will work more efficiently,
        polluting much less, wasting less fuel and with less
        maintenance. Lambda is the ratio of amount of air available for
        combustion to the amount of air required for combustion to be
        stoichiometric. The desired value of lambda is one (1) which
        indicates that the combustion is perfect. </p>
      <p>[0010] At the exit of the sensor is an electric signal of a
        voltage that is proportional to the amount of oxygen in the
        combusted gases and this voltage, in turn, is proportional to
        the air/fuel ratio. The ECU controls adjustments in the position
        in the actuator of the impeller and in the position of the shock
        valve, resulting in a richer air/fuel mixture (more combustible)
        or a leaner air/fuel mixture (less combustible). While the
        engine is warming up, the shock valve is kept partially closed,
        thereby allowing a richer air/fuel mixture (i.e. more fuel). In
        the neutral gear, the shock valve is adjusted to a lambda value
        of 1, while during low speed the impeller is kept partially
        closed, thus saving in fuel. In the other gears, the ECU shock
        valve is adjusted according to settings which are adopted to
        optimize power and economy and minimize pollution. In electronic
        management, this valve is controlled by the Electronic Control
        Module which uses actuators to determine the moment and the time
        where it must operate and its real performance monitored for a
        present potentiometer in the proper valve. This, in effect, will
        be part of the subject matter described herein. </p>
      <p>[0011] The EGR valve controls the flux and the moment where
        these gases must be absorbed in the combustion chamber. The
        valve must be open under each of the following conditions: warm
        engine; rotation of the superior engine to the one of the
        idling; diverse conditions of acceleration and deceleration of
        the engine. The amount of the exhaust gases existing in the
        chamber, and the time that the valve remains open, will depend
        on the changes in the vacuum and the pressure of the exhaust
        pipe gases, in accordance with the pattern of the work of the
        engine. The exhaust gases are a mixture of combusted fuels and,
        as a result, they are no longer combustible. Moreover, if they
        occupy too much space in the chamber, they will limit the
        combustion of the air/fuel mixture, consequently diminishing its
        temperature. By reducing the temperature, the level of formation
        of nitrogen oxides produced by the engine is also reduced. </p>
      <p>[0012] The catalytic converter, located in the exhaust system
        behind the lambda sensor, functions as a filter that reacts
        chemically, transforming the harmful gases that still remain in
        the exhaust stream. Behind the catalytic converter, is the
        muffler or silencer which must attenuate the sound and dampen
        the vibrations from the beat of the chain of gases (through
        bulkheads and with the flux passing through a series of punched
        pipes and chambers,) absorb the sound waves and control the
        counter-pressure. </p>
      <p>[0013] Both the catalytic converter and the muffler are
        designed to cause a certain counter-pressure in the exhaust
        system. Without the correct control of the counter-pressure, the
        exhaust system becomes extremely damaging to the performance of
        the engine. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that
        an engine at optimal performance gets the maximum power from a
        displacement of the piston, and proper discharge of the exit
        gases serves to generate maximum power and, therefore, the best
        performance. A double valve/escape system offers restrictive
        conditions, creating the counter-pressure. </p>
      <p>[0014] Even the fuel engine, with the current technology,
        presents an excess of emissions of gases and material particles
        in the atmosphere. The ability to get the maximum power and
        performance is directly linked to the exhaust of the gases from
        the exhaust pipe. The exhaust process must account for the
        emission of gases when the engine is running at maximum power.
        When the engine operates outside of this parameter, resulting in
        a super dimensioned exhaustion, it will not have the proper
        restriction of the gases to get the best power and performance
        from the engine. This causes areas of low pressure resulting in
        waves of explosion of the gases in the engine causing an
        unnecessary increase of the emissions of gases and the increase
        of fuel consumption. </p>
      <p>[0015] Mercedes-Benz of Brazil has published a report on the
        development and manufacturing of devices such as filter for
        material particles entitled "The Commercial Vehicles and the
        Environment" which verifies much of the foregoing information.
        Besides this report, it is generally known that a test using a
        filter of material particles in a fleet of vehicles that
        circulates in the urban environment was conducted by
        Mercedes-Benz GAC.--Germany. The filter in this study was made
        by means of a rolled ceramic wire net in a pipe that, in turn,
        was installed in the interior of a carcass, which replaces the
        muffler installed in the exhaust pipe of the automobile. In this
        configuration, a system of catalytic regeneration is used in the
        burning of the material particles that are deposited in the
        filter, keeping the restriction of the gases to the acceptable
        levels for the current environmental legislation once the device
        is automatically set in motion during the operation of the
        automobile. </p>
      <p>[0016] Despite the promoted efficiency of the methods and
        systems of the prior art, many are encumbered by high costs of
        manufacturing and therefore are impracticable from the
        commercial point of view, particularly for use with existing
        automobiles. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0017] The system and method described herein relate to a novel
        solution for the improved use of fuel and the treatment of gases
        emitted from combustion engines and, more specifically, the
        gases that are emitted through exhaust pipes, such as automobile
        vehicles and industrial equipment An objective of the present
        invention is to reduce environmental pollution and, as a result,
        to improve the conditions of life, including the quality and
        quantity of the flora and fauna on the planet Earth. The
        emission of pollutant gases in the atmosphere has significantly
        contributed to contamination of the environment. There is an
        overwhelming demand for a solution capable of curbing the
        alarming effects caused by worldwide environmental degradation.
      </p>
      <p>[0018] The present invention provides a variety of ecologic and
        economic advantages. For example, because the present invention
        filters particulates and greatly reduces the amount of carbon
        monoxide, hydrocarbons and other gases produced by the
        combustion of fuel, this invention has direct effect in the
        improvement of the environment. This minimizes the damaging
        effects of the environmental phenomenon known as the "greenhouse
        effect" and improves the air quality in urban centers. </p>
      <p>[0019] In one embodiment, the present invention comprises a
        cylindrical carcass with a beveled opening in a diagonal line in
        its proximal part. The carcass may be removably attached to an
        engine's exhaust system. A bobbin is affixed in or to the distal
        portion of the carcass. A cylindrical-shaped fibrous blanket may
        be inserted in the carcass and the fibrous blanket may be
        wrapped in a wire mesh. A second fibrous blanket formed into a
        cone with the larger diameter of the cone positioned proximally
        may be removably inserted in the cylindrical-shaped fibrous
        blanket. </p>
      <p>[0020] Results from initial tests of one embodiment of the
        present invention show reduction of approximately 33% of the
        emission of carbon monoxide and of approximately 43% of the
        emission of hydrocarbons and particulates, thus resulting in a
        more efficient use of fuel. In addition it is possible to
        identify operational advantages, where the application of this
        invention does not compromise the performance of the combustion
        engine due to an exclusive constructive concept of a system that
        reduces the periods of low pressure of the gas exhaustion
        proceeding from the explosions of the fuel of the combustion
        engine. The direct implications of these positive
        characteristics are the reduction of fuel consumption and in the
        emission of gases. It brings the engine closer to the point of
        peak performance avoiding overloading its components while
        working, as it has significant improvement of the burning of the
        gases of combustion. It also reduces the formation of impurities
        in the system, thus increasing the time of useful life and
        minimizing the need of corrective maintenance. </p>
      <p>[0021] Tune device also presents advantages from the point of
        view of the product itself, where the constructive concept shows
        extreme simplicity and practicality, factors that contribute to
        the reduction of fixed costs involved in its manufacture and
        therefore making the final price accessible to the consumer
        market. </p>
      <p>[0022] The economic aspect is even more evident when we take
        into account that the device can be used indefinitely, as it can
        be washed with anti-grease products, thus eliminating
        accumulated particles, and yet cleaned in compliance with
        environmental regulations. </p>
      <p>[0023] In addition, the invention also reduces the level of
        noises emitted from the exhaust system by acting as a sound
        baffle thereby reducing noise pollution. </p>
      <p>[0024] For all these reasons, and many others, the device and
        method of the present invention represents an innovation in the
        field of emission control. </p>
      <p>[0025] The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features
        and technical advantages of the present invention in order that
        the detailed description of the invention that follows may be
        better understood. Additional features and advantages of the
        invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject
        of the claims of the invention. It should be appreciated by
        those skilled in the art that the conception and specific
        embodiment disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for

        should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such
        equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope
        of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>[0036] The present invention provides an efficient device and
        method for reducing the emission of harmful gases in the
        environment, reducing noise, reducing the consumption of fuel,
        and improving an engine's performance, all in a cost effective
        manner. The engine may be any form of combustion engine such as,
        for example, an engine in a car, truck, lawnmower, or other
        vehicle or device. The making and using of the presently
        preferred embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should
        be appreciated, however, that the present invention provides
        many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a
        wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments
        discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and
        use the invention, and do not limit the scope of the invention.
      </p>
      <p>[0037] Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows one
        embodiment of the device 101 comprising a cylindrical carcass 1
        with a beveled opening 2 in a diagonal line in its proximal part
        where it is fixed by a clamp 3 for attaching the device 101 to
        an engine's exhaust system and its frontal part is adapted to
        receive and to fix a capsule 4. The carcass 1 and the capsule 4
        may be made of any material capable of withstanding the heat and
        pressure of the applications including, for example, aluminum,
        steel, stainless steel or aluminized steel. The capsule 4 is
        generally cylindrical with an internal reflux 4a in its frontal
        part to receive and to fix a screen under pressure 5. The
        capsule may also have a cylindrical lateral reflux 5a to receive
        and fix a combination of a bobbin 6 and/or a fibrous blanket
        cylinder 7. The screen 5 may be metallic such as, for example, a
        punched metal web or a wire mesh or, alternatively, may be
        constructed by perforating the material used to construct the
        capsule. The bobbin 6 may be made of one or more metals or of
        other materials capable of withstanding the heat and pressure of
        an exhaust system and may be constructed by wrapping two metal
        fabrics around a central point. </p>
      <p>[0038] In another configuration, the carcass 1 and the capsule
        4 are integrated together into one cylinder. In this case, the
        screen may be affixed, or perforations may be made, in the
        distal end of the cylinder and the bobbin may be placed inside
        the cylinder at the distal end. By configuring the cylinder in
        this manner, there is no seam where the carcass 1 and the
        capsule 4 come together. </p>
      <p>[0039] In one configuration, the fibrous blanket 7 cylinder is
        made by wrapping the fibrous blanket in a punched conductive web
        6a and/or mesh 6b and overlapping the ends to form a spiral
        spring. The fibrous blanket 7 may be made of any material which
        can withstand the heat and pressure of the application. Examples
        include the combination of one or more of an aramid, a
        meta-aramid, a polyamide, a polyphenylene sulfide, a
        p-phenylene-1,3,4-oxadiazole, polytetraflouroethylene, and
        basalt. In addition, each case where reference is made herein to
        a fibrous blanket 7, it should be understood that the material
        may be removed from the carcass for replacement and/or cleaning
        at any time. </p>
      <p>[0040] A diaphragm 8 formed by wrapping a fibrous blanket 8a
        into a cone with the larger radius positioned proximally and the
        smaller radius positioned distally. In one embodiment of the
        invention, the fibrous blanket 8a is wrapped in such a manner
        that the overlapping ends at the narrow end of the cone are
        secured together and, in another configuration, the overlapping
        ends at the narrow end of the cone are allowed to overlap but
        are not secured to one another. The diaphragm 8 may be removably
        attached to the carcass 1. The diaphragm 8 may be made of any
        material which can withstand the heat and pressure of the
        application. Examples include the combination of one or more of
        an aramid, a meta-aramid, a polyamide, a polyphenylene sulfide,
        a p-phenylene-1,3,4-oxadiazole, polytetraflouroethylene, and
        basalt. In addition, each case where reference is made herein to
        a diaphragm 8, it should be understood that the material may be
        removed from the carcass for replacement and/or cleaning at any
        time. </p>
      <p>[0041] Once assembled, the proximal end of the carcass 1 is
        attached to an engine's exhaust system. One manner in which one
        embodiment of the present invention may be attached to an
        exhaust system is show in FIG. 2 and 3. The device may be
        attached in a variety of ways using a variety of attachment
        devices known in the art. The device may be either permanently
        or removably attached to the exhaust system. In the
        configuration shown in FIG. 2 and 3, the device is attached
        using a U-bolt which wraps around the engine's exhaust pipe and
        through the carcass and is thereafter secured using machine
        bolts. </p>
      <p>[0042] The effect produced by each explosion of the fuel in a
        combustion engine provokes a high-pressure wave of gases (shown
        in FIGS. 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9) that is sent quickly to the
        collector. This wave will flow through the exhaust system until
        being expelled in the atmosphere through the exhaust pipe.
        Between the serial explosions that transform the chemical energy
        to mechanical energy, there are periods of low pressure. These
        periods of low pressure are variable in relation to the rhythm
        of the explosions. The faster the engine works, the fewer areas
        of low pressure. One result of the use of this device is the
        transformation of these variable periods of low pressure into
        small constant periods. As a result, the exhaust system is able
        to produce the necessary counter-pressure for better use in the
        system involving valves, gas escape, and fuel injection. The
        result is the reduced emission of gases and reduced fuel
        consumption. </p>
      <p>[0043] As shown in FIG. 4, the gas 402 leaves the exhaust pipe
        401 and enters the proximal end of the device 101. In the
        illustrated embodiment, the gas flows first through the
        diaphragm 8 and, because the diaphragm is formed into a conical
        shape in such a manner that a portion of the gas 402 is allowed
        to escape through the side of the diaphragm 8 because, as
        discussed above, the sides of the diaphragm 8 may not be secured
        together. Some portion of the gas 402 also passes through the
        diaphragm whereupon particulates in the gas 402 are removed and
        the cleaned gas escapes into the atmosphere. Finally, a portion
        of the gas proceeds past the distal end of the diaphragm 8 and
        enters the proximal end of the bobbin 6. </p>
      <p>[0044] FIG. 5 shows a side cut view of one embodiment of the
        device, indicating the flow of the gas waves proceeding from the
        engine's exhaust system. The serial explosions that transform
        the chemical energy to mechanical energy, there are periods of
        low pressure. These periods of low pressure are variable in
        relation to the rhythm of the explosions. </p>
      <p>[0045] As illustrated in FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, the device 101
        carries through various functions in its operation, being able
        to be installed in any part of the exhaust system, meaning,
        after the collector 601, or before, of the catalytic converter
        602, or before, of after the muffler 603, or intercalated or
        later. In short, the efficacy of the device of the present
        invention does not depend on the positioning inside the exhaust
        system. </p>
      <p>[0046] So that the device 101 can be installed in the various
        parts of the exhaust system as described in the paragraph above
        and illustrated in FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, in an alternative
        embodiment the device 101 is installed internally to a lodging
        carcass 9, endowed with entrance 9a and exit 9b for the gas 402.
        Its functioning depends on the combustion engine to be working
        and emitting gas 402 to create the explosions. Periods of low
        pressure (LP) are produced during low rotation of the engine.
        When gas 402 enters the device 101 the amplitude is reduced by
        the conical configuration of the diaphragm 8, this effect
        reduces the potential energy of the gas 402, reduces its speed,
        distributes it across the area impacted by the gas 402 in the
        bobbin 6, and spreads the energy of shock of the wave 402 across
        the bobbin 6. </p>
      <p>[0047] The bobbin 6 causes a restriction in the flow of the gas
        402 thereby restricting the necessary compression to reduce the
        periods of low pressure (LP) between the waves of gas 402. This
        effect causes a chain of events in the waves of gas 402 during
        exhaust, reducing the periods of low pressure (LP) between the
        waves. By increasing the speed of the cycle of the explosions,
        the pressure of the waves 402 on the diaphragm 8 and on the
        bobbin 6 increases. The increase of the pressure on the walls of
        the diaphragm 8 causes the fibers to allow a bigger gas outflow
        between them, balancing with the elastic energy of the fibrous
        material thereby regulating the excess of the counter-pressure
        returned to the system. The increase of the cycle of the
        explosions also increases the waves of shocks on the bobbin 6 by
        the energy stored from its spring effect. When the bobbin is
        configured by wrapping two metals together, the energy of the
        shock waves of gas 402 causes the bobbin 6 to move in the
        opposite direction to its mechanic memory, thereby producing a
        bigger gap between its parallel segments and regulating the
        counter-pressure with the increase of the permission of flow of
        the gas waves 402. With the energy in the shock of the wave, the
        elastic energy of the bobbin 6 increases, and the bobbin allows
        greater gas flow between coated plates in a circular movement.
        Once the balance of the bobbin 6 is reestablished it returns to
        its initial configuration. </p>
      <p>[0048] When the speed of the explosions reach the point when
        periods of low pressure (LP) are de minimus, it causes the
        counter-pressure offered by the diaphragm 8, in the overlapping
        of the material in its conical form, to be moved allowing extra
        flow of gases, thereby normalizing the counter-pressure of the
        exhaust system. When moving to the overlapping of the material
        of the diaphragm 8 it offers a radial increase of the proximal
        side of the cone, having its maximum opening limited by the
        fibrous blanket 7. This causes the waves of gases 402 to be
        radially shocked against the walls of the fibrous blanket 7,
        allowing a regulable counter-pressure in relation to the gases
        that enter its walls and in relation to the forced passage until
        the exit of the gases. The metallic carcass 1 concentrates and
        directs the exit of the gases through its exit in diagonal cut 2
        directed towards the ground. This effect produces a controllable
        counter-pressure in the exhaust system taking advantage of the
        system of exhaust versus valves, resulting in improvement in the
        engine's performance and reducing the consumption of fuel. </p>
      <p>[0049] Both the bobbin and the fibrous blanket 6 and 7 that are
        part of the device 101 act as material particle filters. In the
        bobbin 6, the gathering of material particles is accomplished by
        the collection of shock of particles in the walls of the mesh of
        the fibrous blanket 7a and of the bobbin 6b. The particles
        agglutinate as a result of the lost of speed and due to their
        own physical characteristics. The fibrous blanket 7 and 8a
        collects material particles that do not pass through the
        material. These two systems of gathering of material particles
        are efficient and can be cleaned and reused. </p>
      <p>[0050] The bobbin 6 may be constructed using different metals,
        such as aluminum, zinc, copper, iron and others, to generate an
        electric or voltage differential that makes available ions to
        the system. These ions generated in the bobbin 6 affect the
        catalytic capacity in the gases emitted in the fuel engines at
        low temperatures, or until the end of the process of catalyses
        of gases initiated in the catalytic system of the fuel engines
        that, due to the speed of the waves 402 in the exhaust system,
        did not provide enough time to conclude the necessary catalytic
        reactions, or even when there is deactivation, for diverse
        reasons (temperature, contamination of the oil of the engine,
        excess of SO2) in the catalytic converter. </p>
      <p>[0051] Another important effect is the reduction of the sound
        emitted from the device resulting from the dampening of the
        shockwaves of gases against the bobbin 6 and the fibrous
        blankets 7a and 8a. </p>

        according to the preferred embodiment of the invention, those of
        ordinary skill in the art will understand that other embodiments
        have also been enabled. Even though the foregoing discussion has

        <p><b>Constructive disposition in a particulate matter sealing
            device existing in gas originating from fuel burning and/or

      <p><b>Abstract -- A</b> value-adding solution to the sealing
        product both from the point of view of minimizing the impact
        caused in nature by particulate matter uncontrolled emission,
        that its application on mobile or stationary combustion engines,
        does not interfere with their good performance, thanks to an
        unpublished constructive and functional concept that in addition
        to the technical nature advantages allows it to present low
        manufacturing cost. In order to make the hereinafter-claimed
        invention feasible, a functional concept is applied to the
        particulate matter sealing device, which leads to particulate
        matter flow speed reduction (Fp), which is released in the
        exhaust pipe (1), a reduction verified thanks to mechanical
        shocks of these particles at manifold blade components (C4) and
        manifold coil (C5), causing particles to agglutinate, by
        obtaining as a practical result a reduction between 60 and 90%
        in their emission to the environment. One also considers as a
        differential of the invention the fact that it reduces the noise
        level transmitted through the exhaust pipe (1). Particularly the
        hereinafter claimed invention is shown to be extremely valuable
        to the extent that in a saturation situation of the manifold
        coil component (C5) it does not cause the back compression
        effect, preventing combustion engine overload, which in turn
        prevents fuel consumption increase, and further may in this
        saturation condition be removed for washing and reutilization.
        Its applicability shows great flexibility and it may replaced
        the muffler component, and by applying to all kinds of
        combustion engines, such as those used by automotive vehicles
        and further in stationary engines. </p>

      <p><b>&nbsp;Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] Applicant claims priority under 35 U.S.C..sctn.119 of
        European Application No. 05380147.8 filed on Jul. 1, 2005. </p>
      <p>[0002] This patent application deals with a "CONSTRUCTIVE
        DISPOSITION INTRODUCED INTO A PARTICULATE MATTER SEALING DEVICE
        EXISTING IN GAS ORIGINATING FROM FUEL BURNING AND/OR CHEMICAL
        REACTIONS WHEN RUNNING COMBUSTION ENGINES" where applicant
        presents an unpublished solution for treating gases emitted by
        combustion engines, commonly released into the environment
        through exhaust pipes of moving equipment, such as automotive
        vehicles and/or stationary equipment, for industrial use, whose
        aim is to cooperate with environmental pollution rate reduction,
        and consequently improve living conditions, as far as the flora
        and fauna of planet Earth are concerned. </p>
      <p>[0003] The demand for a solution of this nature is latent to
        the extent in which present-day mankind sees at naked eyes the
        nefarious effects caused by environmental degradation,
        worldwide, pollutant gas emission having consistent
        participation in forming the contaminated environment to which
        the entire planet population is exposed. </p>
      <p>[0004] In this manner the now claimed invention presents a
        series of advantages, which can be ranked as ecological order
        advantages, namely the invention directly implies improvements
        in the environment, because one sees significant reduction of
        high-particulate matter content gases, a fact contributing to
        minimize, for instance, the harmful effects of the environmental
        phenomenon known as "greenhouse effect", being that all
        preliminary data obtained from the particulate matter seal
        indicate a reduction ranging between 60% and 90% of particulate
        matter emission. </p>
      <p>[0005] In turn, it is possible to identify operating order
        advantages, where by using the now claimed invention the
        combustion engine performance is not compromised, thanks to an
        exclusive constructive concept that does not interfere with back
        compression in exhaust pipes, this positive feature having
        direct implication in fuel consumption saving and further it
        does not overload the engine components during its running,
        increasing its service life and minimizing the need for
        corrective maintenance. </p>
      <p>[0006] The now claimed seal also has an advantage from the
        point of view of the retaining product itself, where said
        constructive concept is shown to be of outmost simplicity and
        practicability, a factor that collaborates to reducing overhead
        involved in its manufacture and therefore make the end price
        accessible to a more popular consumer market. </p>
      <p>[0007] The economic aspect is further evidenced when one takes
        into account that the now claimed seal can be used indefinitely,
        because when it is shown to be saturated it can be removed and
        washed in a proper location, eliminating accumulated particulate
        matter, always in compliance with environmental legislation
        standards in effect, and can be reinstalled and allowed to
        return to its operation. </p>
      <p>[0008] There is still one last differential to be mentioned,
        referring to ergonomic features, in this specific case that
        translated into low-level noises and vibration of the exhaust
        pipe system. </p>
      <p>[0009] Due to all these aspects applicant understands that the
        now claimed solution represents an innovation known by the
        technical state, notoriously in the application area of the
        technology industry for sealing element devices. </p>
      <p>[0010] As already known by the technical state a wide variety
        for particulate matter present in gases generated by combustion
        and/or chemical reactions is made available. However, after a
        detailed study of results obtained from using these devices,
        applicant can, via value analysis, identify a series of faulty
        points in their constructive and functional system, that leads
        to compromise the main goal to be achieved, namely, reducing
        environmental pollution rates. </p>
      <p>[0011] For this assertion to become affirmative applicant has
        based his studies from the premise that the functional
        efficiency of combustion engines is directly related to correct
        air and fuel exhaust, or in other words, there must be a
        suitable amount of these components and at a given, precise
        time, which becomes fundamental to gas emission control, such
        gases that take with them a considerable amount of particulate
        matter. </p>
      <p>[0012] Upon defining the mandatory condition for a perfect
        combustion engine performance applicant begins to have a
        consistent reference to identify the causes of low performance
        of these engines, wherever they are in intended manner or
        further by sheer negligence in relation to preventive and
        corrective maintenance, the lack of suitable engine tune-up
        makes a difference in the ideal proportion of air and fuel,
        preventing obtaining at the precise time the mandatory condition
        for its correct operation, having as a consequence particulate
        matter gas emission increase top the environment, being that,
        poor fuel burning is also translated by the amount of oxygen in
        the air 23% remaining air is burned making final quality of fuel
        burning difficult. </p>
      <p>[0013] Particulate matter composition varies in accordance with
        the composition of the fuel to be burned, with the engine state
        of conservation and further its operating temperature, being
        that this particulate matter is formed from the agglutination of
        unburned hydrocarbons, water and impurities of this same fuel to
        a carbon chemical element core. </p>
      <p>[0014] In turn, particulate matter shows a large dimensional
        variation of particles, such variation leading any kind of
        porous filter to early saturation, which in turn cause
        functional overload on engine components, such overload
        resulting in increased fuel consumption, engine power drop and
        increase of emitted gases during the combustion process. </p>
      <p>[0015] One has further to consider the fact that particulate
        matter remains suspended in the air, because the above-mentioned
        filtering ensure its full sealing, and in this manner,
        smaller-size particles can be inhaled by the individual, lodging
        themselves in deep areas of the human lungs, for example, being
        an irritating agent to sight and the breathing system, which
        mainly afflict children and the elderly, particularly in the
        season of the year when temperatures are extremely low, a fact
        that potentializes particulate matter concentration. </p>
      <p>[0016] This entire contamination process potentializes
        carcinogenic action that possible exists in particulate matter.
        One further considers the undesirable effects observed in the
        atmosphere, such and visibility and contrast reduction, and also
        increased "greenhouse effects", where, studies show that
        particulate material when deposited on mountaintop glaciers or
        the planet's poles concentrates solar energy producing thawing
        and increased global temperature. </p>
      <p>[0017] In order to bestow more credibility on the
        above-described subject applicant mentions an official document
        issued by the renowned, trustworthy company of the automotive
        industry, Mercedes-Benz do Brasil, issuing in the form of a
        report by the Development and Experimental Engineering
        Management, upon the development of a filter type for
        particulate matter, such document being called "Commercial
        vehicles and the environment". In addition to this study, the
        existence is known of specific tests for a particulate matter
        filter version used by the vehicle fleet circulating in the
        urban area, this study, in turn, being undertaken by
        Mercedes-Benz AG. Germany, where a version of the sealing device
        is used whose filtering is performed by a ceramic wire network
        rolled in a pipe, which in turn is installed inside a housing,
        which replaces the muffling element installed in the exhaust
        pipe of the automotive vehicle. </p>
      <p>[0018] In this case a catalytic regeneration system is employed
        in particulate matter burning, which is deposited in the filter,
        keeping gas restriction within levels acceptable by
        environmental legislation in force, being that the device is
        automatically activated during the automotive vehicle operation.
        Notwithstanding the rumored efficiency of the described and
        known technical state of the seal system, it is known that it
        has high manufacturing costs, and therefore being impracticable
        from the commercial point of view, at least for its application
        in the great majority of automotive vehicles in circulation.
        Having said this, applicant, taking advantage of undeniable
        available advances and also using a serious study and
        observation of particulate matter behavior, characteristics and
        composition, a study backed by conclusive trials and tests on
        obtained effectiveness, particulate matter sealing type product
        has been developed, identified in this paper by the initials
        "R.M.P.", highly efficient, reducing its level in the
        environment, in order to cooperate with improving environmental
        conditions on planet Earth, where allied to this aspect keeps
        usual back compression conditions found in combustion engines,
        preventing fuel consumption increase and reducing the need for
        corrective maintenance, being a supplement to a feasible
        solution from the industrial and commercial point of view. </p>
      <p>[0019] Supplementing this description, in order to obtain
        better understanding of this characteristics of this invention

        embodiment of FIG. 14. </p>
      <p>[0037] With reference to the drawings illustrating this
        invention patent application, FIGS. 1, 3 and 4 respectively
        refer to the manner of preferred performance for the horizontal
        particulate matter sealing device (A), applied in
        horizontal-type exhaust outlets, which shows a constructive
        concept consisting of a frontal canopy (A1), notably with
        tubular wall and frontal cover (A1'), which is formed by hollow
        elements, forming a sieve-shaped representation, where treated
        gas outflow is possible (Fa). The frontal canopy component (Al),
        receives inside the manifold coil component (A2), which presents
        a braided mesh element (A2'), concocted in (Fp) originating from
        the gas flow (Fg). In turn, the set consisting of the frontal
        canopy components (A1) and manifold (A2) is fastened to the main
        housing component (A3), which presents a tubular shape, being
        that in its back and lower portion, a chamfer is defined (A3'),
        whose primary function resides in assisting gas outflow (Fg),
        required for relieving the saturation of the manifold coil
        component (A2) as indicated in FIG. 4. </p>
      <p>[0038] In time, the main housing component (A3) is fastened to
        the exhaust type (1) through a clamping component (A4). A first
        variant to the preferred performance manner is graphically
        represented through FIGS. 2, 5 and 6 respectively, through the
        vertical particulate matter sealing device (B), being that it
        presents the same frontal canopy components (A1) and manifold
        coil (A2), being differentiated in relation to the main housing
        component (A5), where it has a horizontal packing nozzle (A6)
        where the exhaust pipe fastening is located (1), being that in
        perpendicular position to the main body a vertical packing
        nozzle is predicted (A7), which receives the vertical exhaust
        pipe fastening (2) whereby part of the treated gas flow passes
        (Fa), as represented by FIG. 6. </p>
      <p>[0039] A second variant to the preferred performance manner is
        graphically represented through FIGS. 7, 8 and 9 respectively
        and detail 1, through the enclosed particulate matter retaining
        device C), which presents a differentiated constructive concept
        in relation to the previously described models, that obeys the
        constructive similarity criterion, and can therefore be an
        integral part of the patent claiming picture in description. The
        constructive concept of the enclosed particulate matter sealing
        device (C), is based on a front cover component (Cl),
        trapezoidal trunk-shaped, being that in its end portion the
        front fitting area is defined (C1') destined for fastening it to
        the exhaust pipe (2). </p>
      <p>[0040] This font cover component (C1) is assembled together
        with the main housing component (C2), which is in tubular shape
        with rectangular cross-section. </p>
      <p>[0041] The interior of the main housing component (C2),
        receives the manifold blade component assembly (C4), whose
        useful area is permeated by retaining holes (C4''), which are
        supported by structural rod elements (C4'), as indicated in
        detail 1 In turn, manifold blade components (C4) present a
        hollow area (C6) in their central region. </p>
      <p>[0042] Together with the manifold blade component frontal
        portion (C4) the manifold coil component is fastened (C5)
        presenting a braided mesh element (C5'), concocted in knitted
        steel-based material, as indicated in detail 2. </p>
      <p>[0043] The above-described constructive concept further results
        from the formation of a main decompression (C6'), as represented
        in FIG. 9. </p>
      <p>[0044] Finally, the back portion of the main housing component
        (C2), is contemplated with a back cover (C3), this one with a
        similar profile and structure to the one observed for the front
        cover component (C1), being that in its end portion the front
        fitting area is defined (C3') destined for fastening it to the
        exhaust pipe (1). </p>
      <p>[0045] The front cover component inner walls (C1) and the back
        cover (C3), present the trapezoidal trunk-shaped profile as in
        order to provide a suitable assembly of the manifold blade
        components (C4) through their interference with structural rod
        elements (C4'). </p>
      <p>[0046] Applicant stresses that the economic aspect refers to a
        low-cost solution for solution performance manners described in
        this paper, where the particulate matter sealing device (A),
        vertical particulate matter sealing device (B) and enclosed
        particulate matter sealing device (C) are manufactured by using
        low-cost raw material, such as steel and aluminum. The enclosed
        particulate matter-sealing device (C) can be credited with a
        last positive aspect, which resides in the fact that once it is
        installed it allows eliminating the automotive vehicle-muffling
        component. </p>
      <p>[0047] In order to bestow greater credibility to the
        constructive and functional concepts introduced in order to make
        the now claimed invention feasible, applicant now describes, in
        the following paragraphs, the scientific foundation that has
        generated the differentiated qualities previously described in
        this paper. </p>
      <p>[0048] Applicant has based his studies on the knowledge that in
        gas emission (Fg) with particulate matter (Fp), chemical element
        molecules when released from the exhaust pipe to the atmosphere,
        perceive an expansion, where particulate matter is committed by
        the release inertia, tending in this manner to make a
        straight-line route with a small dispersal degree caused by the
        mentioned gas expansion. </p>
      <p>[0049] The primary function of the enclosed particulate matter
        sealing device (C) resides in causing the particulate matter
        (Fp) released by gases (Fg), once it is involved by said
        inertia, to have its speed reduced, a reduction that should
        reach zero speed, which is justified by a series of mechanical
        shocks against the walls of the manifold blade components (C4)
        and manifold coil component (C5), retaining and agglutinating
        said particles, therefore, such agglutination is characteristic
        of carbon-based elements making up the particulate matter. </p>
      <p>[0050] Manifold blade components (C4) in turn are structured by
        structural rod elements (C4'), so that it allows them to be
        spatially positioned and parallel among them. </p>
      <p>[0051] In turn, the manifold coil component (C5) shows a
        braided mesh element (C5'), concocted in knitted steel-based
        material, but this component creates a treated gas outflow
        restriction around 27%. </p>
      <p>[0052] In order to prevent a back compression effect at the
        exhaust system, caused by the above-mentioned gas outflow
        restriction, the constructive concept of the enclosed
        particulate matter-sealing device (C) defines that manifold
        blade components (C4) present a hollow area (C6) in their
        central region. Allied to this hollow area (C6) a main
        decompression area is also defined (C6'), being that their sum
        potentializes decompression inside the enclosed particulate
        matter-sealing device (C) upon gas expansion. </p>
      <p>[0053] In order to have the desired effect feasible a mandatory
        condition is that the area resulting from the sum between the
        hollow area (C6) between the manifold blade components (C4) and
        the main decompression area (C6'), is to be at least equal to
        the area found in the exhaust pipe (1). </p>
      <p>[0054] Applicant further makes a reservation in order the make
        the nature of the particulate matter sealing device explicit (C)
        which does not have the primary function of a filter, because it
        prevents with the above-described feature loss of the combustion
        engine output, keeping fuel consumption suitable and increasing
        its service life time. </p>
      <p>[0055] The particle sealing capacity afloat the manifold coil
        component (C5), can be predicted through a simplified formula,
        upon its utilization in automotive vehicles, where:
        Ssaturation=Vr*Ts, being: </p>
      <p>[0056] Ssaturation=Space run by the vehicle until saturation of
        the manifold coil component saturation; </p>
      <p>[0057] Vr=Relative average speed of the combustion engine shaft
        transfer to the vehicle's tires; </p>
      <p>[0058] Ts=Saturation time analyzed by the particulate matter
        emission volume emitted by the combustion engine versus filling
        the total volume of the manifold coil component. </p>
      <p>[0059] The practical result observed by applying this formula
        reports to an estimated mean for an automotive vehicle emitting
        0.0048849 grams of particulate matter per minute, where
        saturation of the manifold coil component (C5) will occur after
        running approximately 13,000 kilometers, which is translated
        into high durability, allied to the fact that once saturation is
        reached the enclosed particulate matter sealing device (C) can
        be easily removed for washing in an appropriate location, where
        at the end of this washing it can be assembled again at the
        automotive exhaust system, being renewed to perform without
        problems for the next 13,000 kilometers. </p>
      <p>[0060] Finally, in relation to ergonomic use features it is
        translated into low-level noises and vibration of the exhaust
        pipe system, this vibration is obtained thanks to the
        transformation sound waves into mechanical energy at the
        manifold blade component walls (C4) and manifold coil (C5). </p>
      <p>[0061] In order to expand the scope of possible applications
        for the now claimed particulate matter seal applicant
        illustrates a third constructive variant for it, represented by
        FIG. 10, being very resembling to the model presented for the
        vertical particulate matter sealing device (B), but it presents
        as a differential the main housing (D), whose end portion is
        defined by a closed ball-shaped terminal (D1). </p>
      <p>[0062] In turn, FIGS. 11-12 are part of graphic representation
        of the fourth constructive variant, which presents a main
        housing (E) whose end portion receives the assembly of a screen
        (E1), whose function resides in providing first stage of treated
        gas release (Fa). </p>
      <p>[0063] Applicant further presents a fifth constructive variant,
        represented by FIGS. 13-15 respectively, where the particulate
        matter seal (F) is installed at the end of a vertical exhaust
        pipe (2), in the back upper portion of a collective transport
        vehicle, being defined by a main housing (F1), whose side
        presents a decompression hole (3), this housing receiving in its
        nozzle the assembly of a cover component (F2), which presents
        hollow elements (F2'). </p>
      <p>[0064] The interior of the main housing (F1) receives the
        assembly of manifold blade components (C4), which are permeated
        by sealing holes (C4'') and manifold coil (C5), this assembly
        being supported by structural rod elements (C4'), where said
        components are identical to the ones applied at the second
        constructive variant, called enclosed particulate material
        sealing device (C). Though the hereinafter-claimed invention has
        been explained with reference to the graphic representation of
        its specific drawings the hereinafter-mentioned explanation is
        of illustrative nature, the invention being limited only by the
        claims attached to this paper. </p>
      <p>[0065] Due to all that has been described and illustrated that
        it deals with a "CONSTRUCTIVE DISPOSITION INTRODUCED INTO A
        PARTICULATE MATTER SEALING DEVICE EXISTING IN GAS ORIGINATING
        FROM FUEL BURNING AND/OR CHEMICAL REACTIONS WHEN RUNNING
        COMBUSTION ENGINES", which perfectly fits into the standards
        governing the Invention Patent, in light of the Industrial
        Property Law, due to filling an important gap existing in the
        market, moreover because its provides a technical, operating
        alternative in particulate matter sealing systems, being worthy
        due to what has been exposed and as a consequence, of the
        respective privilege. </p>
