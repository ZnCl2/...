      </div>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">What's a
        skybow?</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It's a new kind of kite that acts sort of like an anti-gravity
      rope---when you and a friend at the other end hold it across the
      wind it pulls upward making a huge arch in the sky.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Who is flying
        skybows?</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      Kite enthusiasts worldwide are experimenting with skybows,
      improving flying techniques, design and materials.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">How does it
        work?</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It's not really a rope at all. It's a<span style="font-weight:
        bold;"> rapidly spinning ribbon.</span> Have you ever noticed
      that a dropped card or ticket stub can start spinning and glide
      away from you as it falls? A skybow's ribbon is attached to
      swivels that allow it to spin the same way.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">So why does
        spinning make it go up?</span><br style="font-style: italic;
        font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      That's a subtle question, but it's basically the same reason a
      spinning ping-pong ball takes a curved flight. It's called the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Magnus-Robins effect</span>.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Okay, so why
        up instead of down?</span><br style="font-style: italic;
        font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      With<span style="font-weight: bold;"> flat-ribbon skybows the
        fliers may have to help the ribbon start spinning in the correct
        direction---the top of the ribbon should spin downwind</span>. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Other skybows have creased edges and
        always spin the same direction, these skybows must be set up
        properly in relation to the direction of the wind.</span> If
      started spinning in the wrong direction a skybow is just as happy
      to spin the otherway and fly into the ground!<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Why does it
        make that eerie sound?</span><br style="font-style: italic;
        font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The aerodynamic forces always act nearly at right angles to the
      ribbon face, but the ribbon is constantly turning. This produces a
      rapidly varying reaction against the air ---sound is the natural
      result. Since the ribbon has two faces,<span style="font-weight:
        bold;"> the frequency of the sound is twice the spin rate.</span><br>
      <br>
      A skybow flying well makes a howling sound reminiscent of the
      sound of high wind in a pine woods, a skybow that is not entirely
      steady sounds like a motorcyle race, with repeated accelerations
      and sudden downshifts of pitch.<br>
      <br>
      Loudness increases drastically with wind speed. At 20 mph (32
      km/hr) the curious have been drawn from a quarter-mile (400m)
      away. The sound is very directional, with a quiet spot near the
      fliers and directly behind them.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Why are there
        sometimes swivels in the middle of the arch, not just at the
        ends?</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A skybow needs to spin faster
        where the wind is faster in order to fly high. Multiple sections
        that spin idependently can accomodate differences in windspeed
        along the skybow. Usually the fastest winds hit the high center
        of the arch. Sometimes a single-section skybow is tapered ---
        it's made wider in the center than at the ends so that the high
        windspeeds at the center can be accomodated when the whole
        ribbon is spinning at the same rpm.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">How long can
        a skybow be?</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      The record so far, 1000 ft (303 m) long is held by, Mr. Big, a six
      section skybow 5/8" wide (1.6 cm). Tony Frame and Jim Mallos flew
      Mr. Big over the Washington Monument Grounds, Washington, DC on
      November 10, 1997.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The maximum length of a skybow is
        proportional to the strength-to-weight ratio of the ribbon
        material. There are fibers made with ten times the
        strength-to-weight ratio of Mr. Big's ribbon, so skybows two
        miles long (3 km) may be possible.</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">How wide can
        a skybow be?</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      Tony Frame and I have flown skybows in <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">widths ranging from 10mm to 25mm.</span> (Tell me about
      your experiments.)<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">How do you
        launch them?</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Skybows are launched by pulling
        them taut across the wind.</span> They can be launched all at
      once, or in stages letting one section go up at a time.<br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Construction
        Materials</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Mr. Big was made from a sandwich of two outer layers of
      premium-grade box sealing tape (3M #3750), with a narrow middle
      layer of heavy-duty surveyor's flagging tape from
      blackburnflag.com . This design was prone to snap where the edges
      were damaged.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Construction
        of Mr. Big's 5/8" wide ribbon:</span><br style="font-style:
        italic; font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Polypropylene gift-wrapping ribbon is very strong and colorful,
      but it is difficult to attach centerweighting in a really
      permanent way.<br>
      <br>
      The best design so far is an unsymmetrical sandwich of 3M's #863
      tape (a transparent monofilament-reinforced polypropylene
      strapping tape), which is very strong for its weight and lets the
      color of the bottom layer show through, with a narrow middle layer
      of polyethylene adhesive tape as the centerweighting, and a bottom
      layer of 50-micron (2-mil) thick colored polyethylene bag plastic
      from bearclaw.net.<br>
      <br>
      There are apparently no retail sources for the 3M #863 tape---you
      have to order a carton of 36 from a tape wholesaler.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Centerweighting</span><br
        style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      To fly, a skybow needs a strip of stretchy material
      (centerweighting) running along the center of the ribbon. The
      centerweighting, needs to be stretchier than the rest of the
      ribbon so that it shares little of the ribbon's tension. Inelastic
      materials will not have a stabilizing effect.<br>
      <br>
      Roughly speaking, the centerweighting should increase the weight
      of the ribbon by 50% and be narrower than 75% the ribbon width.<br>
      <br>
      An adhesive vinyl tape, such as electrician's tape, can be simply
      stuck on one or both sides of a ribbon, or a non-adhesive vinyl
      tape, such as surveyor's flagging tape, can be used in a sandwich
      construction. Polyethylene adhesive tape, such as "Frost King
      Weatherseal Tape," which is used to install plastic-film storm
      windows, is better than vinyl because it is less prone to
      delaminate.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Other
        stabilization methods</span><br style="font-style: italic;
        font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It seems that the function of the centerweighting is to make
      tranverse waves move along the skybow more slowly than the
      torsional (twist) waves. There two other ways to accomplish this
      same end:<br>
      <br>
      1) carry all the tension at the very edges of the ribbon by
      placing low-stretch fibers there, or<br>
      <br>
      2) give the a ribbon a tube-like cross section so it can act a
      like a flexible shaft. <br>
      <br>
      These should be fruitful areas for research.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Weight</span><br
        style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Skybows rely on damping from aerodynamic forces to spin smoothly,
      so the skybow must be rather light. A rule of thumb is that the
      skybow should not weigh more than 15 times the weight of the air
      in the cylinder that circumscribes it. For example a 17mm wide
      skybow can spin smoothly if its weight is 4 g/m---and even lighter
      is better.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Stiffness</span><br
        style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A skybow does need a certain stiffness across its width so that
      when twisted under tension it will not buckle and twist up like
      twine.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Swivels</span><br
        style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The ends of a skybow segment must be held by very low friction
      swivels. Only high quality (e.g. SAMPO) ball-bearing fishing
      swivels will work. Use the largest size you can find, as the small
      ones will wear out in a few minutes even though the tension is
      moderate. For some reason the black swivels last longer than the
      nickel plated ones. Lubricate each swivel with a drop of sewing
      machine oil. Do everything you can to keep the swivels out of the
      dirt.<br>
      <br>
      For long-life swivels you have to take the trouble to make your
      own, using quality ball bearings with rubber seals. I am using
      MR115-2RS bearings from bocabearings.com.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Length</span><br
        style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A skybow needs to be long enough to power the spinning of its
      bearings. This minimum length depends on the width of the ribbon.
      We've had success with 30m lengths at 19mm width, and 50m lengths
      at 15mm width. When multiple segments are used in a bow (as in Mr.
      Big), the segments can be shorter since in general one segment
      only needs to power one swivel instead of two. Most recently I
      have been making 17mm-wide skybows with multiple segments just 24m
      long. In the eastern U.S. the flying fields are never big enough,
      so short segments are more convenient.<br>
      <br>
      The longest single section we've flown was about 114m, but really
      long single sections are in danger of twisting up like twine if
      the windspeed varies greatly along the length of the bow<br>

      Finally!!&nbsp; After 16 Years of Research, 7 Miles of Ribbon,
      100's of Variations of Materials and Swivel Systems, we have
      sorted out All The Best... To bring to you the Ultimate in Skybow
      Design and Performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Introducing The Original WindMueller Turbo-Jet Skybow!!! <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;The complete system was developed and is manufactured at the
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">WindMueller Aerology Laboratory</span>
      (Based in Boca Raton Florida since 1991).&nbsp; The NEW Basic
      Skybow Unit is NOW comprised of 1 Continuous 200' Section of
      Rip-Stop Airfoil Ribbon, which translates into a Top Arch Height
      of ~24Meters/77 Feet.&nbsp; Available soon from our site, we will
      have add-on, connectable sections that come in 30M/100' &amp;
      60M/200' lengths, to build an arch as high as you want to
      go.&nbsp; There is no known limit.&nbsp; The longest we have gone
      is 1000', creating an arch approximately 350-400 feet high in the
      center.&nbsp; An Incredible 33 Pounds of Pull on each end of the
      1000' Skybow was recorded.&nbsp; The Turbo-Jet Skybow now also
      comes with our Latest High Performance MEGA-Velocity Ground
      Swivel's, rated at 85 Pounds/85,000 RPM's.&nbsp; In a Light Wind,
      the Skybow Ribbon can spin at an incredible 4000 rpm's.&nbsp; With
      Higher Dead-Smooth Winds (16-22 MPH), 7000-10,000 rpm's are now
      possible...&nbsp; A hum will begin to sound once the Skybow Pops
      Up Into the Air, which is the loudest from beneath the Center of
      the arch.&nbsp; Like the sweeping motion of a (Rotary Wing
      Aircraft) Helicopter Blade, the Skybow Airfoil Ribbon has a
      Sweeping Lateral Rotation.&nbsp; This creates an Incredible Low
      Pressure towards the direction of the oncoming wind, which
      magically lifts the Skybow high into the air, based on the Magnus
      Effect Principle. (Named after the German Physicist and Chemist
      Heinrich Gustav Magnus (Photo below)).&nbsp; Although Heinrich

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A rotary arch
      kite kit may include a rotary arch kite and a system for
      connecting various segments of the kite. The connecting system may
      include ground swivels, aerial swivel connectors and static
      connectors. The ground swivels may be single independent swivels
      for attaching a handle to the rotary arch kite. The aerial swivel
      connectors may be double independent swivels for, for example,
      attaching two lengths of rotary arch kite together. The static
      connectors may also be used for joining two lengths of rotary arch
      kite together. The rotary arch kite of the present may include a
      unique folding and stitching design to permit enhanced rotation
      and lift. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to kites and, more
      particularly, to a rotary arch kite and swivel systems for
      operating rotary arch kites.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Rotary arch kites may produce a pulling force in excess of
      50-60 pounds. These kites may also rotate at high velocities,
      often upwards of 20,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) or greater.
      Current swivel systems may not be able to work with these pulling
      forces and rotational velocities.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] As can be seen, there is a need for a rotary arch kite and
      swivel system that may allow operation of the rotary arch kite at
      typical pulling forces and high rotational velocities.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0005] In one aspect of the present invention, a rotary arch kite
      kit comprises a rotary arch kite; a ground swivel adapted to
      provide a handle for the kite; and an aerial swivel connector
      optionally connecting the rotary arch kite to a second rotary arch
      kite.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In another aspect of the present invention, a ground swivel
      comprises a strap having a tube rotationally attached to the
      strap; a monofilament extending from a body of the ground swivel,
      the tube attaching to one end of the monofilament; an end casing
      permitting another end of the monofilament to pass through into
      the body of the ground swivel a spacer ring within the end casing,
      the monofilament passing through the spacer ring; and a bearing,
      wherein the monofilament fits into an inner bore hole of the
      bearing.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In a further aspect of the present invention, a rotary arch
      kite comprises a strip of material, wherein the strip of material
      is from 1 to 4 inches wide and from 100 to 300 feet long, wherein
      the kite is formed by folding the strip of material in thirds and
      stitching the folded material along its length at one side of the
      strip; and an end of the folded material being folded and stitched
      to itself to form a loop in one end of the kite; and a slit cut in
      the end of the kite.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] These and other features, aspects and advantages of the
      present invention will become better understood with reference to
      the following drawings, description and claims.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0020] The following detailed description is of the best currently
      contemplated modes of carrying out exemplary embodiments of the
      invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense,
      but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general
      principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is
      best defined by the appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Various inventive features are described below that can
      each be used independently of one another or in combination with
      other features.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Broadly, an embodiment of the present invention provides a
      rotary arch kite and system for connecting various segments of the
      kite. The connecting system may include ground swivels, aerial
      swivel connectors and static connectors. The ground swivels may be
      single independent swivels (that is, a first end may rotate
      relative to a fixed second end) for attaching a handle to the
      rotary arch kite. The aerial swivel connectors may be double
      independent swivels (that is, each end may independently rotate)
      for, for example, attaching multiple lengths of rotary arch kite
      together. The static connectors may also be used for joining two
      lengths of rotary arch kite together. The rotary arch kite of the
      present may include a unique folding and stitching design to
      permit enhanced rotation and lift.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Referring to FIGS. 1 through 4, an aerial swivel connector
      10 may include tube casing 12 having end casings 28 attached to
      each end thereof. A monofilament 20 may extend from each end
      casing 28. The extending end of the monofilament 20 may attach to
      a tube 22. The tube 22 may attach a first rotary arch kite 24 with
      a second rotary arch kite 26. Typically, two aerial swivel
      connectors 10 may attach to each end of a central rotary arch
      kite, with two additional rotary arch kites attached to each of
      these aerial swivel connectors 10. In an alternate embodiment, the
      tube from one end casing 28 may attach to a strap handle and the
      tube from the other end casing 28 may attach to the rotary arch
      kite. Within the tube casing 12, each monofilament 20 may pass
      through a bushing 14 and fit into an inner bore hole of a bearing
      16. Each monofilament 20 may have different diameters, as shown in
      FIG. 4. Alternatively, each monofilament 20 may have the same
      diameter. A bushing 18 may fit between adjacent bearings 16. The
      tube casing 12, end casings 28, and bushings 14, 18 may be made of
      any suitable material, such as PVC, CPVC, ABS, carbon composite,
      metal, and the like. The bearing 16 may be a high RPM rated
      bearing, such as a bearing rated at 10,000-500,000 RPMs.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Referring now to FIGS. 5 through 7, a ground swivel 30 may
      include a strap 32 having a tube 34 rotationally attached to the
      strap 32 to allow the tube 34 to spin freely at high velocities. A
      monofilament 36 may extend from a body 38 of the ground swivel 30.
      The tube 34 may attach to one end of the monofilament 36. The
      other end of the monofilament 36 may pass through an end casing
      40, a spacer ring 42 and fit into an inner bore hole of a bearing
      44. A first spacer 46 may attach to the end casing 40. A tube 48
      may fit over and attach to the first spacer 46. A second spacer 50
      may fit into and attach to the tube 48. As discussed below, the
      strap 32 may attach within the second spacer 50. A heat shrink
      tubing 52 may be used to cover and protect the components of the
      body 38 of the ground swivel 30. The end casing 40, tube 48, and
      spacers 46, 50 may be made of any suitable material, such as PVC,
      CPVC, ABS, carbon composite, metal, and the like. The bearing 44
      may be a shielded high RPM rated bearing, such as a bearing rated
      for at least about 85,000 RPMs, however other bearing ratings may
      be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] According to one embodiment of the present invention, the
      strap 32 may be folded in as shown in FIG. 7. The resulting four
      layers of strap 32 may be inserted into the second spacer 50. A
      hole (not shown) may be drilled in either the second spacer 50
      and/or the tube 48. The hole may also pass through the four layers
      of strap 32. A pin (not shown) may be inserted into the hole to
      hold the strap 32. Optionally, a monofilament may be inserted
      through the pin to reinforce the strap 32 onto the body 38 of the
      ground swivel 30. Other means, as may be known in the art, for
      connecting the strap 32 to the body 38 of the ground swivel 30 may
      be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The tube 34 of the ground swivel 30 may attach to one end
      of a rotary arch kite. The ground swivel 30 of the present
      invention may allow the rotary arch kite to rotate at high
      velocities, even while a pulling force is applied from the ground
      swivel 30. The spacers 46, 50 may be, for example [1/2] inch pipe
      and the tube 48 may be a [1/2] inch coupling and the end casing 40
      may be a [1/2] inch cap.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The ground swivel 30 may have other uses where a swivel
      handle may be desirable. For example, the ground swivel 30 may be
      used to connect a dog collar to a leash, thereby preventing
      twisting of the leash.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Referring to FIG. 8, a static connector 80 may be used join
      ends of a rotary arch kite. The static connector 80 may be used,
      for example, in place of the aerial swivel connector 10, described
      above. The static connector 80 may have first and second tubes 82
      attached by a monofilament 84. In one embodiment, three rotary
      arch kites may be part of a kite package, wherein the ends of the
      middle rotary arch kite connect with the other two rotary arch
      kites with two aerial swivel connectors. In another embodiment, a
      first and a second rotary arch kite may be joined with the static
      connector 80. A fourth and fifth rotary arch kite may also be
      joined with the static connector 80. A third rotary arch kite may
      have the aerial swivel connector at each end to connect to the
      first/second rotary arch kites at one end, and to the fourth/fifth
      rotary arch kites at the other end. The ground swivel 30 may be
      used as a handle for the first rotary arch kite. Such a package
      may incorporate several features of the present invention into a
      single rotary arch kite package or kit.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Referring now to FIGS. 9 through 11, a rotary arch kite 90
      may be an airfoil ribbon formed from, for example, ripstop nylon
      that is folded in thirds, as shown in FIG. 9. An exterior third 92
      may be attached with stitching 100 for the length of the kite 90.
      The length of the kite 90 may be from about 100 to about 300 feet,
      typically about 200 feet. The unfolded kite 90 may have a width
      from about 1 to about 4 inches, typically about 2 inches. Each
      kite end 94 may have a slit 96 cut therein. The slit 96 may be use
      to retain a tube of, for example, the ground swivel 30, the aerial
      swivel connector 10 or the static connector 80. The kite end 94 of
      the kite may be formed by folding about 6 inches of a material end
      98 of the kite onto itself. This material end 98 is then folded
      under itself (back toward the kite end 94) for about two inches to
      create a fold 106, resulting in a three-layer thickness 102. This
      three layer thickness may be joined with stitching 104 as an
      interior, elongated X, as shown in FIG. 11. The stitching 104 may
      not extend across the width of the kite 90, as such stitching may
      provide a perforation in the kite capable of tearing. The
      stitching 104 may extend beyond the fold 106, as shown in FIG. 11.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Reminiscences on skybows</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In the late 90's, Tony Frame and I developed a rotating ribbon
      arch kite that we called a skybow. I provided most of the
      engineering ideas, but none of it would have happened without
      Tony's driving encouragement and his part in the flight testing
      and design iterations. I wrote at the time that flying a skybow
      was like playing with "an anti-gravity rope" because, held across
      the wind between two fliers, a spinning skybow "sags" up the way
      an ordinary rope sags down. In favorable winds, a skybow can form
      a tall, leaning, horseshoe-shaped arch, typically many tens of
      meters in length. A skybow is a soft kite in the sense that there
      are no struts, and it coils up compactly after flying. The
      controversy over whether a skybow really is a kite at all is
      probably ongoing, the arguments being summarized early on in an
      article on skybows by Steve McKerrow and Valerie Govig in the
      Winter 1997-8 issue of Kite Lines magazine.<br>
      <br>
      The outstanding characteristic of a skybow is its rather absurd
      length-to-width ratio. Mr. Big, with a 16mm chord (flown on the
      Washington Monument grounds in the fall of 1997) was 300m long (as
      measured lying on the ground)—in that dimension it was probably
      one of the largest kites ever flown—at the same time, in the chord
      dimension, it was probably one of the smallest kites ever flown.
      We later flew a 17mm-chord skybow that was just over 400m long
      (one quarter of a mile) on the Washington Monument grounds during
      the 2002 Smithsonian Kite Festival. My petite girlfriend (now my
      wife) started shrieking so much at seeming to be pulled straight
      up into the air (though I doubt the tension was really much more
      than 30 pounds) that Tony, ever discrete, took himself to another
      part of the field. A skybow does not really have all that high a
      lift-over-drag ratio—magnus-effect airfoils are not very good at
      L/D in any case, and the effective aspect-ratio is reduced by the
      twisting of the ribbon—but when a skybow is misaligned to the
      wind, the downwind side of the arch can seem very steep. Hence the
      skybow flyers' rule: "up moves up, down moves down." (For example,
      if your side of the arch seems to be lying down, you need to move
      downwind.)...<br>
      <br>
      During the same late-nineties era, Roy Mueller of Wind Mueller
      Aerology Lab in Boca Raton, Florida, independently developed a
      rotating arch kite that is stabilized by a different principle. We
      were corresponding and sharing samples at the time. It is fair to
      say that Tony and I were jealous of the Mueller design's ability
      to form tall arches with short lengths, and Roy may have envied
      our design's performance in high winds. Roy's design, which had a
      cross-section that popped into classic airfoil shape when
      uncoiled, seemed more affected by aerodynamic pressure (or
      centrifugal force) in high winds. But that was years ago. I see
      that the Wind Mueller Lab is still coming out with new commercial
      skybow designs, ones that I am not familiar with.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, our skybow design was a dynamically stabilized flat
      ribbon. It did not seem to care how fast the wind was blowing, or
      how fast it was spinning, as long as the arch was shortened enough
      to keep the tension in the ribbon in a safe range. I had the
      pleasure and excitement of flying a 80m-long skybow in sustained
      50 mph winds at Jockey Ridge State Park in Nag's Head, North
      Carolina. The noise was incredibly loud—like a Harrier jet landing
      on your head—and that was in a situation where the wind itself was
      so loud you needed to yell to be heard 20m...<br>
      <br>
      A taut ribbon will not spin stably by itself. That's a fact that
      will be overly obvious to trained engineers—I say overly, because
      a skybow proves that under the right conditions a taut,
      lightweight, unsupported ribbon can spin so smoothly it seems like
      a laser beam. As a trained engineer, the effectiveness of
      aerodynamic damping was something I needed to be confronted with
      in person.<br>
      <br>
      A taut ribbon will not spin stably by itself—it will typically
      either turn wide-side to the wind, and not spin at all, or go
      through wild oscillations of spin and translation. But if twisted
      up enough, it will indeed spin stably. A demonstrator of this is
      what Tony and I called a wind-womp. Terminate both ends of a 24
      yard section of 3/8" corrugated plastic ribbon with 4 feet of
      light kite string. Hold the resulting assembly across the wind
      while twisting up the string at one end with a cordless drill (no
      swivels being used at either end.) As the increasing twist is
      shared with the ribbon, you will see its behavior in the wind
      gradually improve. Ultimately, with a lot of twist in the ribbon,
      it reaches a point where it spins smoothly, and then reverses,
      alternately flying up and then down, and making a "whomp" sound
      each time it changes direction.<br>
      <br>
      That is fun, but unfortunately this kind of twist stabilization
      cannot be maintained when swivels are added to each end to allow a
      continuous rotation in the "up" direction. We first tried a
      practical approximation to twist stabilization. Our first skybow
      was 2" wide, made out of "poly" packing tape. It had built-in
      discrete twists of 90° about every 10 chord-lengths (as I recall).
      Each 90° twist was accomplished by fabricating a hollow, elongated
      tetrahedron out of the same tape. (You could also think of the
      tetrahedra as universal joints rather than 90° twists, I am not
      sure which idea was foremost in my mind.) The results flying a 50m
      length of this sort of skybow on the Washington Monument grounds
      and the beach at Mason's Neck State Park in Virginia where
      encouraging, but it was a lot of work to make kites this way...<br>
      <br>
      I don't remember how I came to the idea that we could stabilize
      the ribbon dynamically by "mistuning" the twist-wave and
      translation-wave velocities. The key proved to be adding slack
      material (deadweight) near the center of the chord. The addition
      of this mid-chord inertia lowers the translation-wave velocity,
      but has little effect on the twist-wave because mass added at the
      mid-chord does not increase the airfoil's moment of inertia. (It
      is important that the added weight not carry tension, or the
      weighting effect will be partially or even completely
      cancelled.)...<br>
      <br>
      Our most successful skybows were razor-trimmed assemblies of
      commercial tapes. We added stabilizing weight to our skybows by
      including a stretchy, thick, narrow tape at the center. Trying to
      build a symmetrical sandwich of commercial tapes proved
      problematical as there was always enough stress at the center to
      cause unsightly local delaminations. Instead, we settled on an
      unsymmetrical three-layer design, strong on one side, weak on the
      other—the stress on the adhesive bond being limited by the weaker
      layer. The main mechanical strength came from a layer of high
      performance, clear, polypropylene strapping tape from 3M (#863
      tape trimmed in the last assembly step to 17mm chord-width), the
      weighting came from a thick, stretchy, clear polyethylene
      weathersealing tape (Frost King Weatherseal Tape, trimmed before
      assembly to 10mm width), and the color came from a thin layer of
      colored polyethylene film (2-mil Bear Claw bags from Bland Co.,
      trimmed in the same final cut with the polypropylene strapping
      tape.) The stretchy weighting tape was assembled with its unsticky
      side against the sticky side of the polypropylene strapping tape.
      That allowed the thin colored polyethylene film to be in contact
      with pressure-sensitive adhesive over its full width. The stretchy
      tape came off the roll with so much tension that a motorized
      capstan was needed to lower the pre-stress before assembly. Making
      skybows quickly becomes a matter of making tape-converting
      machines that make skybows. My homebrew tape-converters never
      worked very reliably, or without fussing over every few meters,
      and making unnecessary splices. That, and the cost of converting
      materials that were themselves at retail prices, was our big
      problem in trying to go into commercial production. That and the
      fact no customer anywhere had flown anything like it. A
      well-tested skybow went to persons who said they were going to fly
      it at Burning Man. It came back covered with beautiful pink playa
      dust and complaints that it had not flown. <br>
      <br>
      The center-weighting tape in a skybow is not entirely
      un-structural. When a taut ribbon is twisted, compression stress
      builds up across the width. The thickness of the weighting tape in
      the middle part of the chord helps reinforce the ribbon against
      buckling in compression.<br>
      <br>
      A skybow can work with swivels just at the two ends. We called
      this a single-section skybow. We flew single-section skybows that
      were as long as 114 meters with some success. There is a launching
      problem with a single-section skybow since the entire length must
      be supported off the ground to start the ribbon
      spinning—ultimately, there is a length where this is no longer
      possible. There is also a performance problem with a
      single-section skybow since the middle of the arch sees better
      wind, and lies at a better angle to it, so it wants to spin faster
      than the two ends. This problem can be avoided by tapering a
      single-section skybow to a narrower chord near each end—but that
      only makes the next problem worse. A long, single-section skybow
      can carry a lot of torque towards one end, where, if anything
      stops the ribbon from spinning, it will cause a buckling failure
      of the tape that basically turns the ribbon into twine—for good.
      For these reasons, as well as the ability to reef in the length of
      the skybow to suit the wind speed, we settled on making
      independently-swiveled sections of 20 to 24 meters in length.
      These could be easily launched or reefed, one section a time, and
      were nearly immune to the twist-up buckling failure. Swiveled
      sections of moderate length are also easier to handle on the
      ground.<br>
      <br>
      When flying a multi-section skybow, it is possible to end up with
      one section spinning in the wrong (downward) direction. Then there
      is nothing to be done short of bringing down the entire skybow to
      that section and relaunching it. To avoid this problem we would
      "train" the skybow sections to prefer spinning in a particular
      direction by strongly folding the outboard, unreinforced, portions
      of the chord in a Z-pattern. The polypropylene tape would almost
      completely "forget" this creasing, but remember it just enough to
      strongly prefer spinning in the trained direction. A trained
      skybow has, in effect, a left side and a right side (as seen
      looking downwind) that must be respected in setting the skybow up
      on the flying field.<br>
      <br>
      Under high tension a skybow will sometimes snap. Surprisingly, it
      is not rare for a skybow to snap in two places at once—some sort
      of shockwave phenomenon I guess. If that happens, the broken
      middle portion of the skybow may drift a long ways
      downwind—something to consider when choosing a flying field.<br>
      <br>
      If repairing (i.e., splicing) a skybow is necessary, anything you
      do with pressure-sensitive tape will prove temporary. We came up
      with an expedient we called squiggles. Two sections to be spliced
      are folded over double and overlapped. The squiggle, a zig-zag,
      bent piece of piano wire is woven over-and-under (the action is
      really more like wrapping) the doubled and overlapped ribbon to
      generate enough friction to hold the splice together
      permanently...<br>
      <br>
      If you fly skybows you will soon learn this truth: twisted is
      tantamount to tangled. To handle a long length of ribbon without
      tangling, it must be kept untwisted. If a length of skybow on the
      ground is being twisted up by the wind, it must be allowed to
      align downwind, and fast.<br>
      <br>
      Winding spools having cranks can store ribbon without twisting it,
      but they are dangerous. They can break your fingers with the
      crank, or friction-burn right through your clothing with the rim.
      Notice that the usual way of winding onto a crank-less spool puts
      twist in the unwound portion of the ribbon—which is only
      permissible if the twist is being freely released to an off-spool
      swivel.<br>
      <br>
      If you buy cut ribbon in a fabric shop from an experienced clerk
      she will deftly wrap it (untwisted) in a figure eight on two
      fingers of one hand. The same approach works to wrap a 24m section
      of skybow on the forearm. Once slipped off the arm, the untwisted
      ribbon can easily pay out from the inside of the figure-eight.
      Cinching these figure-eight hanks with velcro cable ties (which
      can obligingly stick to one's socks when not in use) became my
      favorite way to deal with skybows on the ground.<br>
      <br>
      Another way to handle long lengths of ribbon, useful at times, is
      to stuff the ribbon into a sack (or, indoors, into a pile on the
      floor) taking care to remove twist as it goes in. It may not seem
      likely that a chaotic pile of ribbon will remain untangled in a
      sack, but it will, if you remove all twist before it goes in, and
      never allow the tag end of the ribbon to enter the sack. This
      storage method is strictly last-in-first-out.<br>

      Five-hundred pound fish don't spin very fast. The relevance of
      that saying is this. It is easiest to start with homebrew skybows
      by exploiting ready-made fishing swivels from the tackle shops
      (only the highest-quality, e.g., SAMPO, ball-bearing swivels will
      work at all.) The ratings on these swivels are for breaking under
      tension, not spinning under tension. You need to choose a
      ball-bearing fishing swivel rated about twenty times the tension
      you expect in your skybow. Even then, if you keep the swivels out
      of the dirt, the life will only be a few outings.<br>

      <b>Jim's Skybow FAQ</b><b> // Skybow Builder's Notes</b><br>
      <b><br>
        Construction Materials</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mr. Big was made from a sandwich of two outer layers of
      premium-grade box sealing tape (3M #3750), with a narrow middle
      layer of heavy-duty surveyor's flagging tape from
      blackburnflag.com . This design was prone to snap where the edges
      were damaged.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Construction of Mr. Big's 5/8" wide ribbon:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Polypropylene gift-wrapping ribbon is very strong and colorful,
      but it is difficult to attach centerweighting in a really
      permanent way.<br>
      <br>
      The best design so far is an unsymmetrical sandwich of 3M's #863
      tape (a transparent monofilament-reinforced polypropylene
      strapping tape), which is very strong for its weight and lets the
      color of the bottom layer show through, with a narrow middle layer
      of polyethylene adhesive tape as the centerweighting, and a bottom
      layer of 50-micron (2-mil) thick colored polyethylene bag plastic
      from bearclaw.net.<br>
      <br>
      There are apparently no retail sources for the 3M #863 tape---you
      have to order a carton of 36 from a tape wholesaler.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Centerweighting</b><br>
      <br>
      To fly, a skybow needs a strip of stretchy material
      (centerweighting) running along the center of the ribbon. The
      centerweighting, needs to be stretchier than the rest of the
      ribbon so that it shares little of the ribbon's tension. Inelastic
      materials will not have a stabilizing effect.<br>
      <br>
      Roughly speaking, the centerweighting should increase the weight
      of the ribbon by 50% and be narrower than 75% the ribbon width.<br>
      <br>
      An adhesive vinyl tape, such as electrician's tape, can be simply
      stuck on one or both sides of a ribbon, or a non-adhesive vinyl
      tape, such as surveyor's flagging tape, can be used in a sandwich
      construction. Polyethylene adhesive tape, such as "Frost King
      Weatherseal Tape," which is used to install plastic-film storm
      windows, is better than vinyl because it is less prone to
      delaminate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Other stabilization methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It seems that the function of the centerweighting is to make
      tranverse waves move along the skybow more slowly than the
      torsional (twist) waves. There two other ways to accomplish this
      same end:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) carry all the tension at the very edges of
      the ribbon by placing low-stretch fibers there, or<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) give the a ribbon a tube-like cross section
      so it can act a like a flexible shaft. <br>
      <br>
      These should be fruitful areas for research.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Weight</b><br>
      Skybows rely on damping from aerodynamic forces to spin smoothly,
      so the skybow must be rather light. A rule of thumb is that the
      skybow should not weigh more than 15 times the weight of the air
      in the cylinder that circumscribes it. For example a 17mm wide
      skybow can spin smoothly if its weight is 4 g/m---and even lighter
      is better.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Stiffness</b><br>
      A skybow does need a certain stiffness across its width so that
      when twisted under tension it will not buckle and twist up like
      twine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Swivels</b><br>
      The ends of a skybow segment must be held by very low friction
      swivels. Only high quality (e.g. SAMPO) ball-bearing fishing
      swivels will work. Use the largest size you can find, as the small
      ones will wear out in a few minutes even though the tension is
      moderate. For some reason the black swivels last longer than the
      nickel plated ones. Lubricate each swivel with a drop of sewing
      machine oil. Do everything you can to keep the swivels out of the
      dirt.<br>
      <br>
      For long-life swivels you have to take the trouble to make your
      own, using quality ball bearings with rubber seals. I am using
      MR115-2RS bearings from bocabearings.com.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Length</b><br>
      A skybow needs to be long enough to power the spinning of its
      bearings. This minimum length depends on the width of the ribbon.
      We've had success with 30m lengths at 19mm width, and 50m lengths
      at 15mm width. When multiple segments are used in a bow (as in Mr.
      Big), the segments can be shorter since in general one segment
      only needs to power one swivel instead of two. Most recently I
      have been making 17mm-wide skybows with multiple segments just 24m
      long. In the eastern U.S. the flying fields are never big enough,
      so short segments are more convenient.<br>
      <br>
      The longest single section we've flown was about 114m, but really
      long single sections are in danger of twisting up like twine if
      the windspeed varies greatly along the length of the bow. <br>

      <div align="center"><b>Amazing Kite Turbine By Scottish Inventor
          Engineer Rod Read - Kite Powerplant System</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      ...Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) are not a new concept.
      However, many systems under development, such as Google’s Makani,
      tend to require complex computer controlled hardware to steer the
      flying turbines accurately, making them expensive and introducing
      operational risk.<br>
      <br>
      Hebridean engineer, Rod Read, has developed a system using
      spinning kites tethered to a ground-based turbine. (think of the
      spinning red parafoils on the BBC ident) The turbine only uses
      kite parts without needing controls, making it lightweight and
      affordable. Working in an open source hardware environment, Rod
      has spent the last five years perfecting his design and his
      company is now selling these scalable kite power systems online.
      Further R&amp;D on his system designs is being carried out in
      conjunction with the University of Strathclyde and TU Delft in the
      Netherlands.<br>
      <br>
      Rod explains “Power to weight ratio is key to the efficiency of
      flying wind turbines. The advantage of using kites is their
      lightweight construction. My system ties the kites in a simple
      rigging arrangement which can be set up quickly and easily, even
      in terrain where you couldn’t transport a regular turbine. This
      first system is designed to be affordable for personal use, for
      example when camping, but the science which guided the design
      allows it to be scaled up to provide enough power for grid and
      utility uses.”...<br>
