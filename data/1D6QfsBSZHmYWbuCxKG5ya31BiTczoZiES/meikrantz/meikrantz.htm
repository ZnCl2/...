      When Kevin Costner isn’t busy making movies or fronting his band
      Modern West, he’s spending $26 million of his own money developing
      technology designed to save the ocean from oil pollution. No joke.<br>
      <br>
      This isn’t a venture he started last month; Costner has been
      working on a way to clean up oil spills for over 15 years.&nbsp;
      Appalled by the Exxon Valdez disaster, he and his brother Dan
      invested in a company – Ocean Therapy Solutions – which has
      created a patented technology to clean up oil slicks. Costner
      brought a small prototype of the machine to Louisiana and
      showcased its ability to vacuum and separate crude-laden water
      into essentially 97-99% clean water in one tank, oil in another.<br>
      <br>
      Barges can deploy 31 of the full-sized centrifuges into the Gulf
      of Mexico to begin removing British Petroleum’s oil from the water
      before it hits delicate shorelines.&nbsp; Theoretically, that
      is.&nbsp; Inventor Wayne Bennett is waiting for BP approval but as
      of Friday, no one from BP had returned Bennett’s numerous phone
      calls.&nbsp; Local officials are eager to test Costner’s
      technology as oil from the uncapped Deepwater Horizon well drifts
      closer every day.<br>
      <br>
      What could possibly be so important that BP officials don’t have
      time to return phone calls about remediation technology that’s
      obviously worth consideration? Managing the flow of information
      and public relations, perhaps. BP should be containing the
      unchecked flow of oil before it works on its corporate image.<br>

            Promote Oil-Extracting Machine</span><br style="font-weight:

        </big></div>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      NEW ORLEANS -- Actor Kevin Costner was in New Orleans on Thursday
      with a machine that extracts oil from water.<br>
      <br>
      He said he's ready to go to work to help clean up the spill.<br>
      <br>
      The world-famous actor and environmental activist said he's not
      here to talk the talk. He's here to walk the walk.<br>
      <br>
      "We moved this through a technology that we know works, and it's
      prepared to go out and solve problems, not talk about them,"
      Costner said.<br>
      <br>
      At a demonstration surrounded by local parish leaders, Costner and
      his business partners displayed their oil extractor device for the
      local news media.<br>
      <br>
      The machine works on the principle of centrifugal force. In this
      case, diesel fuel and water enter the machine together and are
      jettisoned separately, with water on one side and diesel on the
      other. The machine will clean the water up to 97 percent, said
      officials with Ocean Therapy Solutions.<br>
      <br>
      "We're working on the technology now that will get us the other 3
      percent so that you can actually drink out of the machine," said
      OTS official John Houghtaling II.<br>
      <br>
      "I just am really happy that this has come to the light of day,"
      Costner said. "I'm very sad about why it is, but this is why it
      was developed, and like anything that we all face as a group, we
      face it together."<br>
      <br>
      Local parish leaders are excited.<br>
      <br>
      "We will be pushing for this to at least get a demonstration out
      in the open water to put this to a test," said St. Bernard Parish
      President Craig Taffaro. "If it shows what it shows here on land,
      then we may have found ourselves another tool for the tool box."<br>
      <br>
      "With these odds and percentages, it only makes sense," said
      Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nunguesser. "Let's give it a
      try."<br>
      <br>
      There are five different machines that work from 5 gallons a
      minute to 200 gallons a minute.<br>
      <br>
      Fifteen years ago, Costner funded a group of scientists headed by
      his brother to develop such a device. Local partners have been
      organized to deploy the machine for BP.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span>-- A centrifugal
      separator has a housing with a generally cylindrical inner surface
      defining an inner chamber. A hollow rotor is disposed within the
      chamber for rotation therein. At least one inlet is provided for
      introducing a liquid mixture into the annular volume between the
      rotor and the housing, where it is then directed into the rotor.
      An upper rotor assembly separates the liquid mixture by phase
      densities with the disparate components directed to respective
      outlets. In one embodiment of the invention, the upper rotor
      assembly includes an easily removable weir ring to facilitate
      "tuning" of the separation process. The rotor of the separator is
      mounted on a unitary rotor shaft that extends axially through the
      separation chamber to upper and lower bearing assemblies in the
      separator housing. The bottom surface of the housing, where the
      liquid mixture is directed from the annular mixing volume into the
      rotor, preferably includes a plurality of radial vanes that are
      curved in the direction of rotation of the rotor to assist in
      directing the liquid mixture with minimal turbulence. Collector
      rings for the separated components provided from the upper rotor
      assembly are preferably formed integrally in the wall of the
      housing with a smoothly contoured peripheral surface to reduce
      turbulence of the output streams. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Field of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      This invention relates generally to centrifugal separators for
      separating mixed liquids of different densities, and more
      particularly to an improved separator assembly for achieving
      higher separation efficiencies with a variety of process liquids.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Prior Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Centrifugal devices are widely used for separating materials of
      different densities. Such devices have been found to provide a
      highly satisfactory method of separating liquids from one another
      based on different weight phases.<br>
      <br>
      Separators, also referred to as extractors, can separate the
      individual components of a mixed component input stream, provided
      that the components remain in separate phases. In many instances,
      extraction may be facilitated with the use of a solvent that is
      injected into the device as a second input stream. In this case,
      the device is often referred to as a "contactor" since it brings
      the waste stream and the solvent stream into intimate contact. The
      solvent phase, together with the soluble specie(s), is then
      separated from the carrier phase by differentiation of the phase
      densities. Typically, the process liquids comprise a lighter (less
      dense) solvent or organic phase and a heavier aqueous phase, which
      are introduced into the centrifugal contactor through separate
      inlets that communicate with a mixing zone. The resulting liquid
      mixture then enters the rotor of the contactor where centrifugal
      force separates the heavier phase from the lighter phase by
      forcing the heavier phase to flow outwardly away from the
      rotational axis of the rotor and thereby displace the lighter
      phase closer to the rotational axis of the rotor. The two phases
      are then individually collected at the upper end of the rotor with
      the heavier phase exiting at a location adjacent to the outer
      periphery and the lighter phase exiting at a location adjacent to
      the rotational axis. Typically, one or both of the exiting phases
      is subjected to one or more subsequent stages of extraction such
      as by circulation through another contactor.<br>
      <br>
      A method of centrifugally separating the components of a
      water-petroleum mixture is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,959,158
      issued to the first-named inventor of this application. The method
      described therein utilized a centrifugal contactor developed by
      the U.S. Department of Energy for the extraction of transuranic
      elements from radioactive waste streams at nuclear processing
      plants. It was discovered that this device could be advantageously
      employ ed for the separation of a water-petroleum mixture. The
      relatively small size of the device, however, limited the
      practical applications of the method due to the relatively low
      throughput. The contactor design did not lend itself to being
      scaled up in size due to the design of the rotor, which was
      suspended from the rotor shaft into the contactor chamber. Such
      design was dictated, in part, by the robotic access to the rotor
      required in nuclear waste processing applications. In a larger
      size, a contactor of the same design would be inoperable due to
      the lack of a lower support for the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      A contactor of a similar design similar to that described above,
      also developed by the U.S. Department of Energy, is described in
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,024,647. This contactor also employs a suspended
      rotor design, which limits its useful size.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention provides a centrifugal separator that
      achieves significantly higher separation throughputs and a broader
      range of applications than similar devices heretofore known in the
      art. The separator of the present invention is readily scaled in
      size in accordance with the throughput of process liquids desired.
      The separator comprises a housing having a generally cylindrical
      inner surface defining an interior chamber. A hollow rotor is
      disposed within the chamber for rotation therein, the rotor having
      upper and lower openings and a generally cylindrical rotor wall
      with an inner and an outer surface. The outer surface of the rotor
      wall is spaced apart from the inner surface of the housing and
      thereby defines an annular mixing volume. At least one inlet is
      provided for introducing a liquid mixture into the annular volume,
      which is in communication with the lower opening in the rotor. An
      upper rotor assembly separates the liquid mixture by phase
      densities with the disparate components directed to respective
      outlets. In one embodiment of the invention, the upper rotor
      assembly includes an easily removable weir ring to facilitate
      "tuning" of the separation process. This allows the separator to
      have application to a wide range of fluid densities. The rotor of
      the separator is mounted on a unitary rotor shaft that extends
      axially through the separation chamber to upper and lower bearing
      assemblies in the separator housing. The bottom surface of the
      housing, where the liquid mixture is directed from the annular
      mixing volume into the rotor, preferably includes a plurality of
      radial vanes that are curved in the direction of rotation of the
      rotor to assist in directing the liquid mixture with minimal
      turbulence. Collector rings for the separated components provided
      from the upper rotor assembly are preferably formed integrally in
      the wall of the housing with a smoothly contoured peripheral
      surface to reduce turbulence of the output streams.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In the following description, for purposes of explanation and not
      limitation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a
      thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will
      be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention
      may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these
      specific details. In other instances, detailed descriptions of
      well-known methods and devices are omitted so as to not obscure
      the description of the present invention with unnecessary detail.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a separator 10 constructed in
      accordance with the present invention. It will be recognized that
      the general arrangement of the components is fairly typical for
      centrifugal separators known in the prior art. Therefore, details
      of the construction of the separator, apart from the particular
      subject matter of the present invention, will not be described
      herein at length.<br>
      <br>
      The housing of separator 10 comprises a lower sleeve 12 and an
      upper sleeve 14 joined together by screws 16. Separator 10 is
      supported by legs 18, which are screwed or otherwise suitably
      fastened to upper sleeve 14. In the illustrated embodiment,
      separator 10 is supported by four such legs; however, the number
      of legs may be three or greater than four, if desired. Legs 18
      rest on or are attached to base 20. Bumpers 19 on each of the legs
      bear against lower sleeve 12 to dampen precessional movement of
      the separator housing.<br>
      <br>
      The design of separator 10 is such that it can be readily scaled
      up or down in size depending upon the desired flow rate.
      Substantially the same design as illustrated may be utilized for
      separators with diameters anywhere from 5 inches to 60 inches or
      more. Regardless of the diameter of the rotor, it is preferable to
      preserve a height to diameter ratio of approximately 2.4.<br>
      <br>
      Bottom plate 22 is secured to the bottom of lower sleeve 12 with
      screws 24. Bottom bearing 26 is held in place by bearing cap 28
      which is secured to bottom plate 22 by screws 30. Bearing 26 is
      protected from contamination by liquids contained within lower
      sleeve 12 by means of oil seal 32.<br>
      <br>
      Upper bearing housing 34 is secured ;o the top of upper sleeve 14
      by screws 36. Upper bearing 38 is retained within housing 34 by
      means of bearing retainer plate 40. This is secured to bearing
      housing 34 by screws 42.<br>
      <br>
      Rotor 44 is carried on shaft 46 within the separation chamber
      defined by lower sleeve 12 and upper sleeve 14. The bottom end 48
      of shaft 46 is supported both axially and radially by bottom
      bearing 26. Shaft 44 extends through the entire separation chamber
      and is supported at its upper end 50 by upper bearing 38. The
      inner race of upper bearing 38 is retained on shaft 46 by locknut
      52.<br>
      <br>
      Rotor 44 is turned about the axis of shaft 46 by means of motor
      54, which is mounted to upper bearing housing 34 by means of motor
      mount 56. Motor shaft 58 is coupled to the upper end 50 of shaft
      46 by means of compliant coupling 60, which is keyed both to rotor
      shaft 46 and to motor shaft 58.<br>
      <br>
      A toothed wheel 170 is coupled to the upper end 50 of rotor shaft
      46. A proximity sensor 172 is installed in motor mount 56 for
      sensing rotation of toothed wheel 170. The output of proximity
      sensor 172 is coupled to control electronics (not shown) for
      regulating the speed of motor 54. Motor speed is selected as a
      function of the physical dimensions of separator 10 and the
      process liquids involved. In typical applications, such as
      separation of petroleum contaminants from water, the rotor speed
      is selected to achieve approximately 200-300 g's of centrifugal
      force. For a nominal 5 inch diameter separator, a rotor speed of
      approximately 1750 rpm is suitable.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, rotor 44 is carried on shaft 46. The outer
      sleeve 70 of rotor 44 is supported on shaft 46, in part, by axial
      vanes 72, one of which is more clearly shown in FIG. 2. In the
      illustrated embodiment of separator 10, there are four such vanes,
      although any other suitable number of vanes could be employed.
      Rotor bottom 74 is attached to rotor sleeve 70 and has a central
      aperture defining an axial opening 76 around shaft 46 through
      which a liquid mixture is admitted to the interior of rotor 44.
      Diverter plate 78 is mounted on shaft 46 just above rotor bottom
      74. A plan view of diverter plate 78 is shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      The top assembly of rotor 44, where phase separation occurs,
      comprises lighter phase slinger 80, weir plate 82, baffle plate 84
      and heavier phase slinger 86. In one embodiment of the invention,
      the heavier phase weir 88 is secured to slinger 86 by screws 90.
      This allows the weir to be easily changed, a feature that is
      particularly useful for "tuning" separator 10 for a particular
      separation process. Small variations in the aperture diameter of
      weir 88 can have a dramatic effect on the efficiency of the
      separation process. Once the appropriate aperture diameter has
      been determined, the weir may be permanently secured to slinger
      86. Alternatively, the weir may be machined integrally with
      slinger 86. In order to provide access to screws 90 and weir 88, a
      separate slinger cap 92 is provided. Slinger cap 92 is secured to
      slinger 86 by screws 94. Details of slinger 86 are shown in FIG.
      7. With weir plate 88 and cap 92 in place, a chamber 110 is
      defined which communicates with outlet ports 112. In the case
      where the weir is formed integrally with the slinger, a separate
      slinger cap is not necessary and the heavier phase slinger may be
      constructed substantially like the lighter phase slinger 80.<br>
      <br>
      Details of lighter phase slinger 80 can be better seen in FIGS. 4
      and 5. Slinger 80 comprises a hollow chamber 102 that communicates
      with outlet ports 104. Liquid is admitted into chamber 102 through
      the integral annular weir 106.<br>
      <br>
      Details of weir plate 82 are shown in FIG. 6. This is simply an
      annular plate with slots 108 to receive radial baffles 114. Baffle
      plate 84 is simply a solid disk somewhat smaller in diameter than
      rotor sleeve 70 that fits over shaft 46 and is slotted in the same
      manner as weir plate 82 Rio receive radial baffles 114.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 8, the components of rotor 44 are
      conveniently assembled with the following described process.
      First, organic slinger 80 is positioned on shaft 46 and welded
      thereto. To facilitate axial positioning of slinger 80, shaft 46
      is preferably machined with a shoulder 116 to receive the slinger.
      Next, weir plate 82 is placed over the upper end of the rotor
      shaft. Baffle plate 84 is then placed over the rotor shaft and
      preferably abuts a second shoulder 118 machined on the shaft.
      Radial baffle plates 114 are then inserted into respective slots
      in weir plate 82 and baffle plate 84 where they are tack-welded in
      place. The axial baffles are aligned with the outlet ports in
      lighter phase slinger 80 and baffle plate 84 is then welded in
      place on shaft 46. Heavier phase slinger 86', shown here with an
      integral weir, is next placed over the shaft and the outlet ports
      are aligned with the radial baffles. The slinger is then welded to
      shaft 46, thereby completing the upper rotor assembly.<br>
      <br>
      At the lower end of the rotor, diverter plate 78 is placed over
      shaft 46 against the shoulder 120. Axial vanes 72 are inserted
      into receiving grooves in shaft 46 and over diverter plate 78.
      Rotor bottom 74 is then installed against axial vanes 72 and
      clamped in place. The axial vanes are then tack-welded to the
      diverter plate and to the rotor shaft. The rotor bottom is then
      tack-welded to the axial vanes. Next the diverter plate is welded
      to the rotor shaft. After checking the alignment of all
      components, they are permanently welded in place. The internal
      components of rotor 44 are dynamically balanced by selectively
      removing material from the bottom surface of rotor bottom 74
      adjacent to its outer periphery. Rotor sleeve 70 is then installed
      and welded to axial vanes 72. Sleeve 70 is also tack-welded to
      aqueous slinger 86 and to rotor bottom 74. After a final alignment
      check, rotor sleeve 70 is finish welded to slinger 86 and rotor
      bottom 74.<br>
      <br>
      Referring again to FIG. 1, two inlet ports 140 and 142 are
      provided in lower sleeve 12 for admitting input streams to the
      annular mixing volume 144. Inlet ports 140 and 142 are
      symmetrically disposed and either one or both may be used for
      admitting the liquid mixture to be separated. An auxiliary inlet
      port 146 is provided for admitting a solvent in the case of a
      solvent-extraction process. Auxiliary inlet port 146 may also be
      used for introducing other separation agents, such as a
      surfactant, an emulsion breaker, etc. The rotation of rotor 44
      ensures thorough mixing of the process liquids in annular mixing
      volume 144. An inspection window 160 is provided in the wall of
      lower sleeve 12 for visually examining the liquid mixture within
      annular mixing volume 144. The mixed components are guided by
      vanes 148 on bottom plate 22 into the interior of rotor 44 of
      axial opening 76. The liquid mixture is centrifugally separated
      according to phase density by the rotation of rotor 44. The
      heavier phase in the liquid mixture, typically an aqueous phase,
      is forced by centrifugal action against the wall of sleeve 70.
      This displaces the lighter phase, typically an organic phase,
      radially inwardly toward shaft 46. The lighter phase is admitted
      into chamber 102 of slinger 80 through weir 106. The lighter phase
      exits through outlet ports 104 into collector ring 150. The
      heavier phase continues upwardly past slinger 80 and is routed
      into slinger 863 where it is expelled through outlet ports 112
      into collection ring 152. Collection rings 150 and 152 are formed
      as integral channels in upper sleeve 14 with smoothly curving
      peripheral walls. This construction contributes to lower
      turbulence of the output streams and facilitates a higher flow
      rate through the separator. Collector rings 150 and 152
      communicate with respective outlet ports 154 and 156.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 is a plan view of bottom plate 22 showing the preferred
      configuration of vanes 148. The vanes are curved in the direction
      of rotation of rotor 44. Curving the vanes in this fashion has the
      effect of directing the liquid mixture towards axial opening 76
      with significantly less turbulence than typically occurs with the
      straight radial vanes of prior art separators. Vanes 148 are
      preferably formed integrally with bottom plate 22 by casting or
      machining. However, vanes 148 may also be formed separately and
      subsequently attached to bottom plate 22 by welding or other
      suitable means.<br>
      <br>
