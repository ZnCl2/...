        <p>"We don't grant patents on perpetual motion machines," said
          the examiners at the U.S. Patent Office. "It won't work
          because it violates the law of Conservation of Energy," said
          one physicist after another. But because, inventor Howard
          Johnson is not the sort of man to be intimidated by such
          seemingly authoritative pronouncements, he now owns U.S.
          Patent No. 4,151,431 which describes how it is possible to
          generate motive power, as in a motor, using only the energy
          contained in the atoms of permanent magnets. That's right.
          Johnson has discovered how to build motors that run without an
          input of electricity or any other kind of external energy! </p>
        <p>The monumental nature of the invention is obvious, especially
          in a world facing an alarming, escalating energy shortage. Yet
          inventor Johnson is not rushing to peddle his creation as the
          end-all solution to world- wide energy problems. He has more
          important work to do. First, there's the need to refine his
          laboratory prototypes into workable practical devices -in
          particular a 5,000-watt electric power generator already in
          the building. His second and perhaps more difficult major
          challenge: persuade a host of skeptics that his ideas are
          indeed practical. </p>
        <p>Johnson, who has been coping with disbelievers for decades,
          can be very persuasive in a face-to-face encounter because he
          can not do more than merely theorize; he can demonstrate
          working models that unquestionably create motion using only
          permanent magnets. When this writer was urged by the editor of
          Science &amp; Mechanics to make a thousand mile pilgrimage to
          Blacksburg, Virginia, to meet with the inventor, he went there
          as an "open-minded skeptic" and as a former research Scientist
          determined not to be fooled. Within two days, this former
          skeptic had become a believer. Here's why. </p>
        <p><b>Doing the Unthinkable</b> </p>
        <p>Howard Johnson refuses to view the "laws" of science as
          somehow sacred, so doing the unthinkable and succeeding is
          second nature to him. If a particular law gets in the way, he
          sees no harm in going around it for a while to see if there's
          something on the other side. Johnson explains the persistent
          opposition he experiences from the established scientific
          community this way: "Physics is a measurement science and
          physicists are especially determined to protect the "Law" of
          Conservation of Energy. Thus the physicists become game
          wardens who tell us what laws' we can't violate. In this case
          they don't even know what the game is. But they are so scared
          that I and my associates are going to violate some of these
          laws, that they have to get to the pass to head us off!" </p>
        <p>The critics say Johnson offers a "free lunch" solution to
          energy problems, and that there can be no such thing. Johnson
          demurs, reminding repeatedly that he has never suggested that
          his invention provides something for nothing. He also points
          gut that no one talks about a "free lunch" when discussing
          extraction of enormous amounts of atomic power by means of
          nuclear reactors and atom bombs. In his mind, it's much the
          same thing. </p>
        <p>Johnson is the first to admit he doesn't actually know where
          the power be has tapped derives. But he postulates that the
          energy may be associated with spinning electrons, perhaps in
          the form of a "presently unnamed atomic particle." How do
          other physicists react to Johnson's suggestion that there may
          be an atomic particle so far overlooked by nuclear physicists?
          Says Johnson: "I guess it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that most of
          them are revolted." On the other hand, a few converted
          scientists, including some who are associated with large and
          prestigious research laboratories, are intrigued enough to
          suggest that there should be a hunt for the answer, be it a
          "particle" or some other as yet unsuspected characteristic of
          atomic structure. </p>
        <p>This article is prefaced with the foregoing brief summary of
          the ongoing controversy so that, in fairness to the inventor,
          we might all view his claims with open minds, even if it means
          temporary setting aside of cherished scientific concepts until
          more complete explanations are forthcoming. The main question
          to be answered here and now is this: Does Johnson permanent
          magnet motor work? </p>
        <p>Before providing the answer, we need to face up to another
          question that undoubtedly nags in the minds of many readers:
          Is Johnson a bona fide researcher, or merely a "garage
          mechanic" mad inventor? As the following brief summary
          suggests, the inventor's credentials appear to be impeccable.
          Following seven years of college and university training,
          Johnson worked on atomic energy projects at Oak Ridge, did
          magnetics research for Burroughs company, and served as
          scientific consultant to Lukens Steel. He has participated in
          the development of medical electrical products, including
          injection devices. For the military he invented a ceramic
          muffler that makes a portable motor generator silent at 50
          feet; this has been in production for the past 18 years. His
          contributions to the motor industry include: a hysteresis
          brake; non-locking brake materials for anti- skid application,
          new methods of curing brake linings; and a method of
          dissolving asbestos fibers. He has also worked on silencers
          for small motors, a super charger, and has perfected a 92-pole
          no-brush generator to go in the wheel of Lincoln automobiles
          as a skid control; that last item reduced the cost to
          one-eighth of the cost of an earlier design by utilizing
          metal-filled plastics for the armature and field. In all,
          Johnson is connected with more than 30 patents in the fields
          of chemistry and physics. </p>

        <p><b>Figures 2, 3 &amp; 4: Magnet Motor Models ~ Pictured here
            are three of the inventor's early models. Top left is a
            linear motor which propels a magnetic vehicle at high speeds
            through a series of rings. Top right is rotary motor upon
            which the prototype will be built. The 8-ounce manget, hand
            held to the large ring weighing 40 pounds, provides enough
            force to spin the entire assembly. In the third assembly
            above, the vehicle is propelled, in either direction, by the
            force of the large magnets arranged below tracks.</b> </p>
        <p><b>Sticky Tape Scientist</b> </p>
        <p>Despite his impressive credentials, this amiable and
          unpretentious inventor likes to characterize himself as a
          "Sticky tape" scientist. He sees no virtue in wasting time
          building fancy, elaborate equipment when more simple
          assemblies serve as well to test new ideas. The prototype
          devices shown in the photographs in this article were
          assembled with sticky tape and aluminum foil, the later
          material being used mainly to keep individual, permanent
          magnets packaged together so that they do not fly apart. </p>
        <p>Perhaps the best way to describe what these three gadgets do
          is by reciting this writer's personal experiences during the
          interview demonstration. That way I will not merely be telling
          what the inventor says they do, but I will reveal what
          happened when I tried the experiments myself. When we start
          talking about how and why the things work as they do, well
          have to rely on the inventor&amp;rsquo;s explanations. </p>
        <p>The first item consists of more than a dozen foil-wrapped
          magnets assembled to form a broad arc. Each magnet is extended
          upward slightly at each end to form a low U-shape, the better
          to concentrate magnetic fields where they are needed. The
          overall curvature of the mass of magnets apparently has no
          particular significance except to show that the distance
          between these stator magnets and the moving vehicle is not
          critical. A transparent plastic sheet atop this magnet
          assembly supports a length of plastic model railroad track.
          The vehicle, basically a model railroad flatcar, supports a
          foil-wrapped pair of curved magnets, plus some sort of weight,
          in some cases merely a rock. The weight is needed to keep the
          vehicle down on the track, against the powerful magnetic
          forces that would otherwise push it askew. That 'is all there
          is to the construction of this representation of a "linear
          motor." </p>
        <p>I was prepared to develop eye strain in an effort to detect
          some sort of motion in the vehicle. I need not have been
          concerned. The moment the inventor let go of the vehicle be
          carefully placed at one end of the track, it accelerated and
          literally zipped from one end to the other and flew onto the
          floor! Wow! </p>
        <p>I tried the experiment myself, and could feel the powerful
          magnetic forces at work as I placed the vehicle on the track.
          I gently eased the vehicle to the critical starting point,
          taking great care not to exert any kind of forward push, even
          inadvertently. I let go, Zip! It was on the floor again, at
          the other end of the track. Knowing that I would be asked if
          the track might have had a slant, I reversed the vehicle and
          started it from the opposite end of the track. It worked just
          as effectively in the reverse direction. In fact, the vehicle
          can even navigate a respectable upgrade. In light of these
          tests, and considering the remarkable speed of the vehicle,
          you can discount any notion that this was a simple "coasting"
          effect. </p>
        <p>Incidentally, the photograph shows the vehicle about half
          ways along the track. It was "frozen" there by the electronic
          flash used to make the picture; there is no way of "posing"
          the vehicle in that position short of tying it down. </p>
        <p>The second device has the U-shaped magnets standing on end in
          a rough circular arrangement oddly reminiscent of England's
          Stonehenge. This assembly is mounted on a transparent plastic
          sheet supported on a plywood panel pivoted, underneath, on a
          free turning wheel obtained from a skateboard. As instructed,
          I eased the 8-ounce focusing magnet into the ring of larger
          magnets, keeping it at least four inches away from the ring.
          The 40 pound magnet assembly immediately began to turn and
          accelerated to a very respectable rotating speed which it
          maintained for as long as the focusing magnet was held in the
          magnetic field. When the focusing magnet was reversed, the
          large assembly turned in the opposite direction. </p>
        <p>Since this assembly is clearly a crude sort of motor, there's
          no doubt that it is indeed possible to construct a motor
          powered solely by permanent magnets. </p>
        <p>The third assembly, which looks like the bones of some
          prehistoric sea creature, consists of a tunnel constructed of
          rubber magnet material that can be easily bent to form rings.
          This was one of the demonstration models Johnson took to the
          U.S. Patent Office during his appeal proceedings. Normally the
          patent examiners spend only a few minutes with each patent
          applicant, but played with Johnson&amp;rsquo;s devices for the
          better part of an hour. As the inventor was leaving, he
          overheard one sideline observer remark: "How would you like to
          follow that act?!" </p>
        <p>It took Johnson about six years of legal hassling to finally
          obtain his patent, and he has been congratulated for his
          ultimate victory over patent office bureaucracy as well as for
          his inventiveness. One sign that he left the patent office
          more than a little shaken by the experience was the inclusion
          of diagrammatic material in the printed patent that does not
          belong there. So if you look up the patent, pay no attention
          to the "ferrite" graph on the first page; it belongs in some
          other patent! </p>
        <p>The tunnel device of course worked very well in the
          inventor's office during my visit although Johnson observed
          that the rubber magnets are perhaps a thousand times weaker
          than the cobalt samarium magnets used the other assemblies.
          There's just one big problem with the more powerful magnets:
          they cost too much. According to the inventor, the magnets
          used to construct the Stonehenge rotating model are
          collectively worth more than one thousand dollars. But there's
          no need to depend solely on mass-production economies to bring
          the cost down to competitive levels. Johnson and U.S. Magnets
          and Alloy Co. are in the process of developing alternative,
          relatively low cost magnetic materials that perform very well.
        </p>
        <p><b>How do they work?</b> </p>
        <p>The drawing that shows a curved "arcuate" armature magnet in
          three successive positions over a line of fixed stator magnets
          provides at least highly simplified insights into the theory
          of permanent magnet motive power generation. Johnson says
          curved magnets with sharp leading and trailing edges are
          important because they focus and concentrate the magnetic
          energy much more effectively than do blunt-end magnets. These
          arcuate magnets are made slightly longer than the lengths of
          two stator magnets plus the intervening space, in Johnson's
          setups about 3-1/8 inches long. </p>
        <center>
          <p><img src="1sm4.gif" height="506" width="378"></p>
        </center>
        <p>Note that the stator magnets all have their North faces
          upward, and that they are resting on a high magnetic
          permeability support plate that helps concentrate the force
          fields. The best gap between the end poles of the armature
          magnet and the stator magnets appears to be about 3/8 inch. </p>
        <p>As the armature north pole passes over a magnet, it is
          repelled by the stator north pole; and there's an attraction
          when the north pole is passing over a space between the stator
          magnets. The exact opposite is of course true with respect to
          the armature South pole. It is attracted when passing over a
          stator magnet, repelled when passing over a space. </p>
        <p>The various magnetic forces that come into play are extremely
          complex, but the drawing shows some of the fundamental
          relationships. Solid lines represent attraction forces, dashed
          lines represent repulsion forces, and double lines in each
          case indicate the more dominant forces. </p>
        <p>As the top drawing indicates, the leading (N) pole of the
          armature is repelled by the north poles of the two adjacent
          magnets. But, at the indicated position of the armature
          magnet, these two repulsive forces .(which obviously work
          against each other), are not identical; the stronger of the
          two forces (double dashed line) overpowers the other force and
          tends to move the armature to the left. This left movement is
          enhanced by the attraction force between the armature north
          pole and the stator south pole at the bottom of the space
          between the stator magnets. </p>
        <p>But that's not all! Let's see what is happening
          simultaneously at the other end (S) of the armature magnet.
          The length of this magnet (about 3-1/8 inches) is chosen, in
          relation to the pairs of stator in magnets plus the space
          between them, so that once again the attraction/repulsion
          forces work to move the armature magnet to the left. In this
          case the armature pole (S) is attracted by the north surfaces
          of the adjacent stator magnets but, because of the critical
          armature dimensioning, more strongly by the magnet (double
          solid line) that tends to "pull" the armature to the left. It
          overpowers the lesser "drag" effect of the stator magnet to
          the right. Here also there is the added advantage of, in this
          case, repulsion force between the south pole of the armature
          and the south pole in the space between the stator magnets. </p>
        <p>The importance of correct dimensioning of the armature magnet
          cannot be over-emphasized. If it is either too long or too
          short, it could achieve an undesirable equilibrium condition
          that would stall movement. The objective is to optimize all
          force conditions to develop the greatest possible off-balance
          condition, but always' in the same direction as the armature
          magnet moves along the row of stator magnets. However, if the
          armature is rotated 180 degrees and started at the opposite
          end of the track, it would behave in exactly the same manner
          except that it would, in this example, move from left to
          right. Also note that once the armature is in motion, it has
          momentum that helps carry it into the sphere of influence of
          the next pair of magnets where it gets another push and pull,
          and additional momentum. </p>
        <p><b>Complex Forces</b> </p>
        <p>Some very complex magnetic forces are obviously at play in
          this deceptively simple magnetic system, and at this time it
          is impossible to develop a mathematical model of what actually
          occurs. However, computer analysis of the system, conducted by
          Professor William Harrison and his associates at Virginia
          Polytechnic Institute (Blacksburg, VA), provide vital feedback
          information that greatly helps in the effort to optimize these
          complex forces to achieve the most efficient possible
          operating design. </p>
        <p>As Professor Harrison points out, in addition to the obvious
          interaction between the two poles of the armature magnet and
          the stator magnets, many other interactions are in play. The
          stator magnets affect each other and the support plate. Magnet
          distances and their strengths vary despite best efforts of
          manufacturers to exercise quality controls. In the assembly of
          the working model, there are inevitable differences between
          horizontal and vertical air spaces. All these interrelated
          factors must be optimized, which is why computer analysis in
          this refinement stage is vital. It's a kind of information
          feedback system. As changes are made in the physical design,
          fast dynamic measurements are made to see whether the expected
          results have actually been achieved. The 'new computer data is
          then used to develop new changes in the design of the
          experimental model. And so on, and on. </p>
        <p>That very different magnetic conditions exist at the two ends
          of the armature is shown by the actual experimental data
          displayed in the table and associated graph. To obtain this
          information, the researchers first passed the probe of an
          instrument used to measure magnetic field strengths over the
          stator magnets and the intervening spaces. We shall call this
          the "Zero" level although there is a very tiny gap between the
          probe and the tops of the stator magnets. These measurements
          in effect indicate what each pole of the armature magnet
          "sees" below as it passes over. the stator magnets. </p>
        <p>Next the probe is moved to a position just beneath one of the
          armature poles, at the top of the 3/8-inch armature-to-stator
          air gap. Another set of magnetic flux measurements is made.
          The procedure is repeated with the probe positioned just
          beneath the other armature pole. </p>
        <p>Now "Instinct" might suggest, and correctly so, that the flux
          measurements at the top and bottom of the air gap will differ.
          But if "instinct" also suggests that these differences are
          pretty much the same at the two armature pole positions, you
          would be very much in error! </p>
        <center>
          <p><img src="1sm5.gif" height="500" width="339"></p>
        </center>
        <p>First study the two tables that show actual flux density
          measurements. Note that in this particular experiment the
          total magnetic flux amounted to 30,700 Gauss (the unit of
          magnetic strength) when the probe was held at the "Zero" level
          under the north pole of the magnet, and a total of 28,700
          Gauss when the probe was moved to the top of the 3/8-inch air
          gap. The difference between these total 'measurements is 2,000
          Gauss. </p>
        <p>Similar readings made at the air gap between the south pole
          of the armature and the stator magnets indicates a total flux
          at "Zero" level of 33,725 Gauss, and 24,700 Gauss at the top
          of the air gap. This time the difference is a much larger
          9,025 Gauss, or four and one half times greater than for the
          north pole! Clearly, the magnetic force conditions are far
          from identical at the two ends of the armature magnet. </p>
        <p>The middle five pairs of figures from each table hive been
          plotted in graphic form to make these differences more
          obvious. In the top "South Pole" graph the dashed line
          connects, the "Zero" level readings made over the stator
          magnets and over the intervening air spaces. Points along the
          solid line indicate comparable readings made with the probe
          just beneath the armature south pole. It is easy to see that
          there is an average 43% reduction of the attraction between
          the armature and stator magnets created by the air gap.
          Equally true, but perhaps not so obvious, is the fact that
          there is an average 36% increase of repulsion when the south
          pole of the armature passes over the spaces between the stator
          magnets. The percentage increase only seems smaller because it
          applies to a much smaller "Zero" level value. </p>
        <p>The second graph shows that the changes are much less
          dramatic at the north pole of the armature. In this case
          there's an average 11.7% decrease of attraction over the
          spaces, and a 2.4% increase, of repulsion when the armature
          north pole passes over the stator magnets. </p>
        <p>As you study the data, be sure to note that the columns are
          labeled differently. In the case of the north pole data, the
          stator magnet areas repulse the armature north pole while the
          spaces between the stator magnets attract. The conditions are
          exactly the opposite for the south pole of the armature
          magnet. When the south pole passes over a magnet, there is
          strong attraction; when it passes over a space, there is
          repulsion. </p>
        <p><b>The Ultimate Motor</b> </p>
        <p>A motor based on Johnson's findings would be of extremely
          simple design compared to conventional motors. As shown in the
          diagrams developed from Johnson&amp;rsquo;s patent literature,
          the stator/base unit would contain a ring of spaced magnets
          backed by a high magnetic permeability sleeve. Three arcuate
          armature magnets would be mounted in the armature which has a
          belt groove for power transmission. The armature is supported
          on ball bearings on a shaft that either screws or slides into
          the stator unit. Speed control and start/stop action would be
          achieved by the simple means of moving the armature toward and
          away from the stator section. </p>
        <p>There is a noticeable pulsing action in the simple prototype
          units that may be undesirable in a practical motor. The
          movement can be smoothed, the inventor believes, by simply
          using two or more staggered armature magnets as shown in
          another drawing. </p>
        <p><b>What&amp;rsquo;s Ahead?</b> </p>
        <p>For inventor Howard Johnson and his permanent magnet power
          source there's bound to be plenty of controversy, certainly,
          but also progress. A 5000 watt electric generator powered by a
          permanent magnet motor is already on the way, and Johnson has
          firm licensing agreements with at least four companies at this
          writing. </p>
        <p>Will we see permanent magnet motors in automobiles in the
          near future? Johnson wants nothing to do with Detroit at this
          time because, as he puts it: "It';s too emotional - we'd get
          smashed into the earth!" The inventor is equally reluctant to
          make predictions about other applications as well, mainly
          because he just wants time to perfect his ideas and,
          hopefully, get the scientific establishment to at least
          consider his unorthodox ideas with a more open mind. </p>
        <p>For example, Johnson argues that the magnetic forces in a
          permanent magnet represent superconductance that is akin to
          phenomena normally associated only with extremely cold
          superconducting systems. He argues that a magnet is a room
          temperature superconducting system because the electron flow
          does not cease, and because this electron flow can be made to
          do work. And for those who pooh- pooh the idea that permanent
          magnets do work, Johnson has an answer: "You come along with a
          magnet and pick up a piece of iron, then some physicist says
          you didn't do any work because you used that magnet. But you
          moved a mass through a distance. Right? That's work that
          requires energy. Or you can hold one magnet in the air
          indefinitely by positioning it over another magnet with like
          poles facing. The physicist will argue that because it
          involves magnetic repulsion, no work is done. Yet if you
          support the same object with air, they will agree in a minute
          that work is done!" </p>
        <p>There's no doubt in Johnson's mind that he has succeeded in
          extracting usable energy from the atoms of permanent magnets.
          But does that imply that the electron spins and associated
          phenomena that he thinks provide this power will eventually be
          used up? Johnson makes no pretense of knowing the answer: I
          didn't start the electron spins, and I don't know any way to
          stop them - do you? They may eventually stop, but that is not
          my problem." </p>
        <p>Johnson still has many practical problems to solve to perfect
          his invention. But his greater challenge may be to win general
          acceptance of his ideas by an obviously nervous scientific
          community in which many physicists remain compulsive about
          defending the law of Conservation of Energy without ever
          wondering whether that "law" really needs defending. </p>
        <p>The dilemma facing Johnson is not really his dilemma but
          rather that of other scientists who have observed his
          prototypes. The devices obviously do work. But the textbooks
          say it shouldn't work. And all that Johnson is really saying
          to the scientific community is this: here is a phenomenon
          which seems to contradict some of our traditional beliefs. For
          all our sakes let's not dismiss it outright but take the time
          to understand the complex forces at work here.<br>

          Research ) Conference on Long-Term Energy Resource, Montreal,

          &nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>I. Introductory remarks (by Mr. Johnson)</b> </p>
        <p>Today when energy is so expensive, it is not hard to drum up
          interst for most any avenue that offers a breath of hope or a
          way of escape, but this was not necessarily so in 1942.&nbsp;
          We were somewhat satisfied and convinced that we had the main
          sources of energy in view. So it took a pure act of faith to
          try to develop a new un-named source. </p>
        <p>It took faith to spend time on it. It took faith to spend
          money on it. And it took faith to consider facing the
          opposition later when I made my work known and faced all the <i>status








            quo</i> people. </p>
        <p>So, in 1942 using the Bohr model of the atom, and knowing
          that unpaired electron spins created a permanent magnet
          dipole, I kept wondering why we couldn't use these fields to
          drive something. I was sure that the magnetic effect of the
          spins was similar enough to the field of a current in a wire
          to do the same thing. I had no knowledge of electron spins
          stopping and knew no method that I could exert to stop them,
          so I decided to try to work out a method to use them. </p>
        <p>At the same time there were no good hard magnetic materials
          that I knew of, materials that could be opposed with strong
          magnetic fields and not be demagnetized enough to damage them.
          Not only that, they would not give the thrust that I desired.
        </p>
        <p>Having a chemical background, I thought it would be nice to
          use the best magnetic materials I could find in combination
          with an interstitial material that was highly diamagnetic to
          force the electron spin to stay in place. </p>
        <p>The U.S. Navy later made such a compound using bismuth and
          good magnetic materials, but the internal coercive forces were
          so great that this strong magnet would fall apart if not
          encased in glass. It was also expensive. </p>
        <p>So I kept checking magnetic materials while I worked on
          designs that I thought should be implemented. It was a quiet,
          sometimes lonely job over the years, for I didn't share my
          plans with my associates. My self-imposed security would not
          permit it, and I knew of few people who would be interested
          anyway. </p>
        <p>In the fifties, as ceramic magnets became better and harder,
          and long-field metal magnets appeared on the scene, I began to
          freeze some designs and to have magnets custom made to fit
          them. </p>
        <p>It was about this time that I mentioned the fact that just as
          I believed electron spins made permanent magnets, I also
          believed that they were responsible for the 60° angles in the
          structure of snowflakes giving the six-spoked wheel, the
          six-sided spokes, etc. The dean of the school where I was
          teaching said, "Maybe so" and ask me if I knew that snowflakes
          were mentioned in the Bible as being important. I told him,
          "No, I didn't know that," but I looked it up. It said: "Hast
          thou entered into the treasures of the snow? Or hast thou seen
          the treasures of the hail? Which I have reserved against the
          time of trouble, against the day of battle and war." </p>
        <p>My comment was, "Well, maybe this is more important than I
          thought." So I went ahead and worked on it another ten years.
        </p>
        <p>I went to the Library of Congress and looked up snowflakes. I
          found a wonderful book there by Dr. Bentley of New Hampshire.
          He has spend many years making these studies, and he had
          learned a lot, as well as turning out one of the world's most
          beautiful books. He had found that snowflakes have gas pockets
          oriented on 60° angles and that the gas has a higher
          percentage of oxygen than air. That's one reason why snow
          water rusts so well. This higher concentration of oxygen also
          interested me because oxygen is more attracted to a magnetic
          field than other gases. </p>
        <p>Finally, using the best ceramic magnets I could find and the
          best metal magnets, I worked out a scheme for a linear motor.
          The stator would be laid out as if it were unwound from around
          a motor. The parts of the armature would ride just above the
          stator and have the same beveled angular orientations I have
          just mentioned. </p>
        <p>Dies were made for the curved armature magnets, and an order
          was placed for these shapes, despite the objections of magnet
          manufacturers who said it was a bad design. They didn't know
          what it was for, but they were sure it was a bad design. They
          wanted to make horseshoe magnets. They even begged me to
          content myself with half an order. I did not agree --- and
          once again you have that little matter of faith; faith to try
          to implement a new theory; faith to spend your own limited
          funds when you have a a family and other financial
          responsibilities staring you in the face; faith to buck the
          recognized authorities and manufacturers in the field; faith
          to believe that your work is good and that some day, despite
          all the hazards, you will apply for and receive patent rights
          in your own country and perhaps throughout the rest of the
          world; and finally, faith that you can resist being smashed
          into dust by industrial giants and/or being robbed by others
          who know only how to steal. </p>
        <p>Believe it or not, my first motor assembly showed about two
          pounds of thrust. The little toy car on which I fastened the
          armature magnets for support ran in both directions over the
          stator, showing that the focusing and timing of the
          interactions was not too bad. </p>
        <p>This was the first light at the end of a rather dark tunnel I
          had been traveling for many years. I breathed a real sign of
          relief as my young son played with this "new toy," and was
          able to operate it as easily as I could. </p>
        <p>After much testing of linear and circular designs, and
          looking for an attorney for years suited to securing a patent
          on the new theoretical work, I was led to Dunkan Beaman of
          Beaman &amp; Beamon in Jackson, Michigan. It took some time to
          prepare the patent.&nbsp; The attorney built some models
          himself to check certain parameters. Finally, we entered the
          case in the patent office expecting a lot of opposition. We
          were correct. We got it. But again, faith saved the day as we
          battled for many years to gain a rather complete victory. </p>
        <p>Now the work requires different kinds of faith: faith in
          those who have taken cut licenses and who will license; faith
          to continue the research to replace scarce materials in the
          magnets; and faith that this work will continue to progress
          and that it will eventually fulfill its goal. </p>
        <p>For a number of reasons, the permanent magnet motor has not
          received much consideration. In fact, nothing too radical has
          been done since Faraday took some very crude materials and
          showed the world that it was possible to make a motor.&nbsp;
          This work of his largely influenced the thinking of Clerk
          Maxwell and others who followed. </p>
        <p>Today, the two greatest obstacles to using a permanent magnet
          motor are, first, the belief that it violates the conservation
          of energy law; and, secondly, that the magnetic fields of
          attraction and repulsion decrease according to the inverse
          square law then the air gap is increased. </p>
        <p>In fact, both contentions are quite wrong because they are
          based on wrong considerations. </p>
        <p>The permanent magnet is a long time energy source.&nbsp; This
          has been shown for many years in the rating of magnets as <u>high</u>
          or <u>low</u> energy sources for many applications over long
          usage. </p>
        <p>A loudspeaker composed entirely of electromagnets would be
          unreal in size and energy consumption.&nbsp; Yet, despite
          examples of this type, many hesitate to apply the same
          principles to motors and extend them even further by using
          permanent magnets for both the stator and armature. </p>
        <p>The elements of all electric and permanent magnet motors are
          similar. A field imbalance must be <u>created</u>, the fields
          must be <u>focused</u> and <u>timed</u>, and <u>magnetic
            leakage</u> must be controlled. </p>
        <p>In the wound motor, brushes and contact rings give the
          timing, the size and shape of the wound fields and poles gives
          the focusing, and the motor case and kind of iron used help to
          limit the leakage. </p>
        <p>In our permanent magnet motors the timing is built into the
          motors by the <u>size</u>, <u>shape</u>, and <u>spacing</u>
          of the magnets in the stator and armature. The <u>focusing</u>
          is controlled by the <u>shape</u> of the <u>magnets</u>, <u>pole








            length</u>, and the <u>width</u> of the air gap. This air
          gap, through which magnets oppose and attract each other, is a
          rare phenomenon.&nbsp; Usually when a magnetic air gap is
          increased, the field decreases inversely as the square. </p>
        <p>When the air gap of the permanent magnet motor is increased,
          a curious but definite change takes place.&nbsp; There is a
          large decrease in the reading at <u>south pole</u> of the
          armature and an increase in the reading at the <u>north pole</u>.
          Thus, a Hall-effect sensing probe will give a higher gauss
          reading at the north pole and a decreasing count at the south
          pole. This helps explain why the thrust is better with a
          larger air gap than a smaller one. The attracting field is
          minimized and will not produce a locking force, while the
          repulsion of the crescent magnet is great enough to generate a
          thrust vector component that will drive the armature. </p>
        <p>As I tried to explain in the patent, I believe that the
          permanent magnet is the first room temperature super
          conductor. In fact, I believe that super conductors are simply
          large wound magnets. The current in a super conductor is not
          initiated by a strong emf, such as a battery, but is instead
          actually induced into existence by a magnetic field. Then, in
          order to determine how much current may be flowing in the
          super conductor coil, we measure its magnetic field. This
          appears to be something like going out the door and coming
          back in the window. </p>
        <p>Another rather unique feature of super conductors is the fact
          that their magnetic lines of force experience a change in
          direction. No longer do these lines flow at right angles to
          the conductor, but they now exist parallel to the conductor.
          Theoretically, the heavy conductor currents exist in the fine
          filaments of niobium within each small wire of niobium tin
          from which such super conductors are made. Isn't it
          interesting that the finer the wire the less the resistance
          until eventually there is no resistance at all? </p>

        <p><b>1. Introduction</b> </p>
        <p>Despite the fact that the linear version of the permanent
          magnet motor (Johnson, 1979) may appear conceptually simple
          (see Fig. 1), the complex interactions of the fields alone
          place it in a class with other quite sophisticated motive
          systems. </p>

        <p>Many parameters play an important part in making possible the
          successful design of a permanent magnet motor. A number of
          these variables relate directly to the geometry of the system
          and its components.&nbsp; Mathematical models for both the
          linear and circular versions of Mr. Johnson's motors are
          presently under development, and include such controllable
          parameters as stator-to-armature air gap, stator element air
          gap spacing, armature pole length, stator magnet dimensions,
          magnet material variations, magnetic permeability and geometry
          of backing metals, and multiple armature couplings, to mention
          only a few. However, much of the early work involved quit
          simple mathematical investigations, and even at this level
          some remarkable revelations resulted. Also, as often is true
          with simple models, considerable insight into the mechanisms
          that might prove predominant was gained.&nbsp; Therefore, it
          is our intention to share with you some of those early
          analytical investigations and findings. </p>
        <p>Even though Coulomb's Law, embodying the inverse square
          relationship as it does, may yet prove suspect, it
          nevertheless provides an exceedingly simple yet viable form
          upon which to base an elementary model of the linear version
          of the permanent magnet motor. Describing the interaction
          between two magnetic monopoles, Coulomb's Law in vector form
          is recalled as </p>
        <p>(1)&nbsp;<img src="2ppeq1.gif" height="44" width="70"> </p>
        <p>where M and M' are the pole strengths (positive if north,
          negative if south), <i>u</i> [mu] is the permeability of the
          medium in which the poles are located, <i>r</i> is the
          straight-line separation distance between the two poles, and<u>
            <i>f</i></u> [ <i>f</i> with line over top] is the vector
          of force (see Fig. 2) acting at each pole (positive in
          magnitude for repulsion and negative for attraction). </p>
        <p><b>Figure 2: Coulomb's Law</b> </p>
        <center>
          <p><img src="2ppfig2.gif" height="207" width="269"></p>
        </center>
        <p>The vector nature of Eq. (1), the fact that f's line of
          action is colinear with the straight-line distance <i>r</i>
          between poles, its superposition properties when applied to
          multiple poles, and its restriction to static systems fixes in
          space are all well known conditions on Eq. (1).&nbsp; We will
          use the superposition property of Eq. (1) to extend its
          application to a spatial domain containing many more poles
          than the two shown in Fig. 2.&nbsp; However, Eq. (1) will
          first be resolved into scalar components so that analytical
          expressions can be more easily developed. </p>
        <p>Our analysis will be two-dimensional and coplanar, restricted
          to the vertical x-y plane.&nbsp; It should be noted that the
          horizontal stator "track" of H.R. Johnson's linear model
          comprises a plurality of flat magnets, rectangular in cross
          section, each having an aspect ratio (length-to-thickness
          ratio) of 16.&nbsp; This high value contributes to the
          two-dimensional nature of the model and helps to minimize and
          effects in the z direction.&nbsp; Thus there is some
          justification for a two-dimensional analysis, at least in the
          case of the linear model we are considering here. </p>

        <p>To illustrate some of the assumptions and extensions of
          Coulomb&amp;rsquo;s Law that will be made, the simple example
          of a magnetic sheet lying along the x-axis will be considered
          first (see Fig. 4). The sheet, of finite length L, is a
          permanent magnet magnetized across its y-direction thickness
          and having a high aspect ratio (to eliminate z-direction edge
          effects). The south-pole face will be oriented up, with north
          facing downward on the underside of the sheet. Underside
          effects will be ignored as though the sheet represented a
          continuous distribution of only south monopoles along the
          x-axis. To incorporate such distributions into Eq. (1) we
          replace M&amp;rsquo; with the differential dM&amp;rsquo; and
          introduce the function B(x) so that </p>
        <p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dM&amp;rsquo; = B(x) dx </p>
        <p>Then the magnitude of the total force vector, F, acting on an

        <p>where x is the ratio x/L. Assuming that the magnetic density
          along the sheet can be represented by the southern constant <i>-B</i>,
          and neglecting end effects at x = 0 and x = L, Eq (5) reduces

        <p>If the north monopole is placed directly above the center of

          and the vertical air-gap separation distance n taken as
          arbitrary, the symmetrical distribution of incremental force
          vectors acting at (<i>E,n</i>) will appear as shown in Fig. 5.
          Note that a shift of the north monopole to the left results in
          a force imbalance which tends to pull the pole back to the
          right, as shown in Fig. 6. So considering now only the

          is the gravitational acceleration constant and <i>W</i> is
          the downward weight force of the moving monopole above the
          sheet. For magnetic force terms (r<sub>x</sub>)<sub>mag</sub>
          and (r<sub>y</sub>)<sub>mag</sub> we substitute directly Eq
          (11) and Eq (12), respectively. </p>
        <p>Several of the trajectories resulting from the integration of
          Eq (13) and Eq (14) are shown in Fig.9. They all exhibit the
          expected behavior. As already implied in the discussion of
          Fig. 7, the function (r<sub>x</sub>)<sub>mag</sub> given by Eq
          (11) has a stable point of equilibrium at X = ½ and therefore
          drives the free-falling monopole towards the sheet center,
          regardless of the initial drop-point location. The function (r<sub>y</sub>)<sub>mag</sub>
          from Eq (12) is equally persuasive in pulling the monopole
          down towards the sheet itself, and manifests that attraction
          quite pervasively throughout the integration of Eq (14), even
          when the <i>G</i> term may be omitted (as it was in the
          trajectories of Fig. 9). Actually, the computer integration
          procedure will not carry the monopole all the way to surface
          contact with the sheet at Y = 0 because of the infinite
          condition which exists there as reflected by Eq (12). Thus,
          tailings of these trajectories (Fig 9) have been completed by
          manually overriding the plotter. </p>

        <p>As we would anticipate in working with this type of central
          field, where <i>B</i> in Eq (4) is a simple constant, the
          field is conservative with curl of F vanishing. Also, the
          reverse symmetry of (r<sub>x</sub>)<sub>mag</sub> about X = ½,
          as seen in Fig. 7, confirms that the energy integral for this
          function will vanish without any appropriate limit pairs of X.

        <p><b>3. The Repulsive Sheet</b> </p>
        <p>By substituting <i>+B</i> instead of <i>-B</i> for <i>B</i>
          in Eq (4), the sheet of length L lying along the x-axis
          becomes repulsive, with its northern face directed upward,
          opposing the north monopole above it at location (<i>E,n</i>).
          Of course the sign in Eq (6) becomes positive and the
          functions (r<sub>x</sub>)<sub>mag</sub> and (r<sub>y</sub>)<sub>mag</sub>
          reverse their behavior accordingly, as illustrated in Fig. 10.
          Again (r<sub>x</sub>)<sub>mag</sub> will have an equilibrium
          point at X = ½, but now it is destabilizing. As a consequence,
          resulting trajectories for the north monopole are much more
          interesting in this case than they were with the attractive
          sheet. Several paths are shown in Fig 11 with different values
          used for the W/<i><strike>J</strike></i> trajectory in Eq
          (17). Parameter G was included, and in each example the

          influence parameter M&amp;rsquo; generated by the flat stator
          track of Mr Johnson&amp;rsquo;s linear model. An
          experimentally determined distribution, shown in Fig 13, was
          obtained by moving a Hall-effect probe over the stator track
          of one of Mr Johnson&amp;rsquo;s early linear models having
          seven flat ceramic magnet elements. The figure shown was
          produced by a plotter connected directly to the monitor
          computer controlling positioning of the Hall probe and
          processing its output signal. Ordinate values on the graph are
          magnetic flux density in gauss measured relative to a

          a more challenging test of what might be gleaned from this
          simple Coulomb model we have been discussing. It should be
          noted that one of the important differences between the
          function (18) and that shown in Fig 12 is that in Eq (18) the
          period length parameter xp is double that shown in Figure 12.

        <p>With this expression substituted into Eq (13), integration
          becomes straightforward and yields the typical oscillatory
          type of trajectory path shown in Fig 14. As Mr Johnson has
          brought out, the focusing armature magnet of his linear model
          will start at either end of the stator track simply by
          insuring that the north end of this bipoled crescent is
          leading the south (see Fig. 1). So, in Fig. 14, we are showing
          the X-direction motion from right to left instead of from left
          to right as in our previous examples. Also, by simply rotating
          the figure clockwise through 90 degrees, it becomes easy to
          follow the behavior of dimensionless velocity, V<sub>x</sub>,
          in Fig 11, since Vx is defined as </p>
        <p>(21)&nbsp;<img src="2ppeq21.gif" height="39" width="69"> </p>
        <p>It will be noted in Fig 14 that the north monopole has been
          allowed to self-start its motion at the origin with V<sub>x</sub>
          initially zero. </p>
        <p>We now discuss out final adjustment which proved to be an
          exciting revelation at the time it was first investigated
          several months ago. Johnson (1979, col. 5, line 39) states
          that the horizontal air-gap spacing between the magnet
          elements which the stator track comprises should vary slightly
          from normal in order to smooth out movement of the armature.
          Introducing this type of variation into a two-dimensional
          model, provided the charge is nonuniform, would certainly
          transform the field from conservative to nonconservative. It
          should by now be apparent that only a nonconservative model
          has any chance at all of even partially explaining the
          phenomena of the permanent magnet motor. </p>
        <p>With these thoughts in mind, an attempt was made to drive the
          armature monopole of Fig 14 on to the second stator magnet and
          beyond by varying the horizontal gap parameter xp during the
          integration process (i.e., during the motion). The results are
          shown in Fig 15. It was found that through small variations in
          <i>xp</i> in Eq (20), as the monopole advanced along its
          trajectory path from one X position to another, sufficient
          control over the moving pole could be exercised to carry it
          over the full length of the stator and beyond. </p>

        <p><b>Description</b> </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span>
        </p>
        <p>The invention pertains to the field of permanent magnet motor
          devices solely using the magnetic fields created thereby to
          product motive power. </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span>
        </p>
        <p>Conventional electric motors employ magnetic forces to
          produce either rotative or linear motion. Electric motors
          operate on the principle that when a conductor is located in a
          magnetic field which carries current a magnetic force is
          exerted upon it. </p>
        <p>Normally, in a conventional electric motor, the rotor, or
          stator, or both, are so wired that magnetic fields created by
          electromagnetics may employ attraction, repulsion, or both
          types of magnetic forces, to impose a force upon the armature
          to cause rotation, or to cause the armature to be displaced in
          a linear path. Conventional electric motors may employ
          permanent magnets either in the armature or stator components,
          but in the art heretofore known the use of permanent magnets
          in either the stator or armature require the creation of an
          electromagnetic field to act upon the field produced by the
          permanent magnets, and switching means are employed to control
          the energization of the electromagnets and the orientation of
          the magnetic fields, to produce the motive power. </p>
        <p>It is my belief that the full potential of magnetic forces
          existing in permanent magnets has not been recognized or
          utilized because of incomplete information and theory with
          respect to the atomic motion occurring within a permanent
          magnet. It is my belief that a presently unnamed atomic
          particle is associated with the electron movement of a
          superconducting electromagnet and the lossless current flow of
          Amperian currents in permanent magnets. The unpaired electron
          flow is similar in both situations. This small particle is
          believed to be opposite in charge and to be located at right
          angles to the moving electron, and the particle would be very
          small as to penetrate all known elements, in their various
          states as well as their known compounds, unless they have
          unpaired electrons which capture these particles as they
          endeavor to pass therethrough. </p>
        <p>Ferro electrons differ from those of most elements in that
          they are unpaired, and being unpaired they spin around the
          nucleus in such a way that they respond to magnetic fields as
          well as creating one themselves. If they were paired, their
          magnetic fields would cancel out. However, being unpaired they
          create a measurable magnetic field if their spins have been
          oriented in one direction. The spins are at right angles to
          their magnetic fields. </p>
        <p>In niobium superconductors at a critical state, the magnetic
          lines of force cease to be at right angles. This change must
          be due to establishing the required conditions for unpaired
          electronic spins instead of electron flow in the conductor,
          and the fact that very powerful electromagnets that can be
          formed with superconductors illustrates the tremendous
          advantage of producing the magnetic field by unpaired electron
          spins rather than conventional electron flow. </p>
        <p>In a superconducting metal, wherein the electrical resistance
          becomes greater in the metal than the proton resistance, the
          flow turns to electron spins and the positive particles flow
          parallel in the metal in the manner occurring in a permanent
          magnet where a powerful flow of magnetic positive particles or
          magnetic flux causes the unpaired electrons to spin at right
          angles. Under cryogenic superconduction conditions the
          freezing of the crystals in place makes it possible for the
          spins to continue, and in a permanent magnet the grain
          orientation of the magnetized material results in the spins
          permitting them to continue and for the flux to flow parallel
          to the metal. </p>
        <p>In a superconductor, at first the electron is flowing and the
          positive particle is spinning; later, when critical, the
          reverse occurs, i.e., the electron is spinning and the
          positive particle is flowing at right angles. These positive
          particles will thread or work their way through the electron
          spins present in the metal. </p>
        <p>In a sense, a permanent magnet may be considered the only
          room temperature superconductor. It is a superconductor
          because the electron flow does not cease, and this electron
          flow can be made to do work because of the magnetic field it
          supplies. Previously, this source of power has not been used
          because it was not possible to modify the electron flow to
          accomplish the switching functions of the magnetic field. Such
          switching functions are common in a conventional electric
          motor where electrical current is employed to align the much
          greater electron current in the iron pole pieces and
          concentrate the magnetic field at the proper places to give
          the thrust necessary to move the motor armature. In a
          conventional electric motor, switching is accomplished by the
          use of brushes, commutators, alternating current, or other
          known means. </p>
        <p>In order to accomplish the switching function in a permanent
          magnet motor, it is necessary to shield the magnetic leakage
          so that it will not appear as too great a loss factor at the
          wrong places. The best method to accomplish this is to use the
          superconductor of magnetic flux and concentrate it to the
          place where it will be the most effective. Timing and
          switching can be achieved in a permanent magnet motor by
          concentrating the flux and using the proper geometry of the
          motor rotor and stator to make most effective use of the
          magnetic fields generated by the electron spins. By the proper
          combination of materials, geometry and magnetic concentration,
          it is possible to achieve a mechanical advantage of high
          ratio, greater than 100 to 1, capable of producing a
          continuous motive force. </p>
        <p>To my knowledge, previous work done with permanent magnets,
          and motive devices utilizing permanent magnets, have not
          achieved the result desired in the practice of the inventive
          concept, and it is with the proper combination of materials,
          geometry and magnetic concentration that the presence of the
          magnetic spins within a permanent magnet may be utilized as a
          motive force. </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span>
        </p>
        <p>It is an object of the invention to utilize the magnetic
          spinning phenomenon of unpaired electrons occurring in ferro
          magnetic material to produce the movement of a mass in a
          unidirectional manner as to permit a motor to be driven solely
          by magnetic forces as occurring within permanent magnets. In
          the practice of the inventive concepts, motors of either
          linear or rotative types may be produced. </p>
        <p>It is an object of the invention to provide the proper
          combination of materials, geometry and magnetic concentration
          to utilize the force generated by unpaired electron spins
          existing in permanent magnets to power a motor. Whether the
          motor constitutes a linear embodiment, or a rotary embodiment,
          in each instance the "stator" may consist of a plurality of
          permanent magnets fixed relative to each other in space
          relationship to define a track, linear in form in the linear
          embodiment, and circular in form in the rotary embodiment. An
          armature magnet is located in spaced relationship to such
          track defined by the stator magnets wherein an air gap exists
          therebetween. The length of the armature magnet is defined by
          poles of opposite polarity, and the length of the armature
          magnet is disposed relative to the track defined by the stator
          magnets in the direction of the path of movement of the
          armature magnet as displaced by the magnetic forces. </p>
        <p>The stator magnets are so mounted that poles of like polarity
          are disposed toward the armature magnet and as the armature
          magnet has poles which are both attracted to and repelled by
          the adjacent pole of the stator magnets, both attraction and
          repulsion forces act upon the armature magnet to produce the
          relative displacement between the armature and stator magnets.
        </p>
        <p>The continuing motive force producing displacement between
          the armature and stator magnets results from the relationship
          of the length of the armature magnet in the direction of its
          path of movement as related to the dimension of the stator
          magnets, and the spacing therebetween, in the direction of the
          path of armature magnet movement. This ratio of magnet and
          magnet spacings, and with an acceptable air gap spacing
          between the stator and armature magnets, will produce a
          resultant force upon the armature magnet which displaces the
          armature magnet across the stator magnet along its path of
          movement. </p>
        <p>In the practice of the invention movement of the armature
          magnet relative to the stator magnets results from a
          combination of attraction and repulsion forces existing
          between the stator and armature magnets. By concentrating the
          magnetic fields of the stator and armature magnets the motive
          force imposed upon the armature magnet is intensified, and in
          the disclosed embodiments such magnetic field concentration
          means are disclosed. </p>
        <p>The disclosed magnetic field concentrating means comprise a
          plate of high magnetic field permeability disposed adjacent
          one side of the stator magnets in substantial engagement
          therewith. This high permeability material is thus disposed
          adjacent poles of like polarity of the stator magnets. The
          magnetic field of the armature magnet may be concentrated and
          directionally oriented by bowing the armature magnet, and the
          magnetic field may further be concentrated by shaping the pole
          ends of the armature magnet to concentrate the magnet field at
          a relatively limited surface at the armature magnet pole ends.
        </p>
        <p>Preferably, a plurality of armature magnets are used which
          are staggered with respect to each other in the direction of
          armature magnet movement. Such an offsetting or staggering of
          the armature magnets distributes the impulses of force imposed
          upon the armature magnets and results in a smoother
          application of forces to the armature magnet producing a
          smoother and more uniform movement of the armature component.
        </p>
        <p>In the rotary embodiment of the permanent magnet motor of the
          invention the stator magnets are arranged in a circle, and the
          armature magnets rotate about the stator magnets. Means are
          disclosed for producing relative axial displacement between
          the stator and armature magnets to adjust the axial alignment
          thereof, and thereby regulate the magnitude of the magnetic
          forces being imposed upon the armature magnets. In this manner
          the speed of rotation of the rotary embodiment may be
          regulated. </p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
            EMBODIMENTS</span> </p>
        <p>In order to better understand the theory of the inventive
          concept, reference is made to FIGS. 1 through 4. In FIG. 1 a
          superconductor 1 is illustrated having a positive particle
          flow as represented by arrow 2, the unpaired electrons of the
          ferrous conducting material 1 spin at right angles to the
          proton flow in the conductor as represented by the spiral line
          and arrow 3. In accord with the theory of the invention the
          spinning of the ferrous unpaired electrons results from the
          atomic structure of ferrous materials and this spinning atomic
          particle is believed to be opposite in charge and located at
          right angles to the moving electrons. It is assumed to be very
          small in size capable of penetrating other elements and their
          compounds unless they have unpaired electrons which capture
          these particles as they endeavor to pass therethrough. </p>
        <p>The lack of electrical resistance of conductors at a critical
          superconductor state has long been recognized, and
          superconductors have been utilized to produce very high
          magnetic flux density electromagnets. FIG. 2 represents a
          cross section of a critical superconductor and the electron
          spins are indicated by the arrows 3. </p>
        <p>A permanent magnet may be considered a superconductor as the
          electron flow therein does not cease, and is without
          resistance, and unpaired electric spinning particles exist
          which, in the practice of the invention, are utilized to
          produce motor force. FIG. 3 illustrates a horseshoe shaped
          permanent magnet at 4 and the magnetic flux therethrough is
          indicated by arrows 5, the magnetic flow being from the south
          pole to the north pole and through the magnetic material. The
          accumulated electron spins occurring about the diameter of the
          magnet 5 are represented at 6 in FIG. 4, and the spinning
          electron particles spin at right angles in the iron as the
          flux travels through the magnet material. </p>
        <p>By utilizing the electron spinning theory of ferrous material
          electrons, it is possible with the proper ferromagnetic
          materials, geometry and magnetic concentration to utilize the
          spinning electrons to produce a motive force in a continuous
          direction, thereby resulting in a motor capable of doing work.
        </p>
        <p>It is appreciated that the embodiments of motors utilizing
          the concepts of the invention may take many forms, and in the
          illustrated forms the basic relationships of components are
          illustrated in order to disclose the inventive concepts and
          principles. </p>
        <p>The relationships of the plurality of magnets defining the
          stator 10 are best appreciated from FIGS. 5 through 8. The
          stator magnets 12 are preferably of a rectangular
          configuration, FIG. 8, and so magnetized that the poles exist
          at the large surfaces of the magnets, as will be appreciated
          from the N (North) and S (South) designations. The stator
          magnets include side edges 14 and 16 and end edges 18. The
          stator magnets are mounted upon a supporting plate 20, which
          is preferably of a metal material having a high permeability
          to magnetic fields and magnetic flux such as that available
          under the trademark Netic CoNetic sold by the Perfection Mica
          Company of Chicago, Illinois. Thus, the plate 20 will be
          disposed toward the south pole of the stator magnets 12, and
          preferably in direct engagement therewith, although a bonding
          material may be interposed between the magnets and the plate
          in order to accurately locate and fix the magnets on the
          plate, and position the stator magnets with respect to each
          other. </p>
        <p>Preferably, the spacing between the stator magnets 12
          slightly differs between adjacent stator magnets as such a
          variation in spacing varies the forces being imposed upon the
          armature magnet at its ends, at any given time, and thus
          results in a smoother movement of the armature magnet relative
          to the stator magnets. Thus, the stator magnets so positioned
          relative to each other define a track 22 having a longitudinal
          direction left to right as viewed in FIGS. 5 through 8. </p>
        <p>In FIGS. 5 through 7 only a single armature magnet 24 is
          disclosed, while in FIG. 8 a pair of armature magnets are
          shown. For purposes of understanding the concepts of the
          invention the description herein will be limited to the use of
          single armature magnet as shown in FIGS. 5 through 7. </p>
        <p>The armature magnet is of an elongated configuration wherein
          the length extends from left to right, FIG. 5, and may be of a
          rectangular transverse cross-sectional shape. For magnetic
          field concentrating and orientation purposes the magnet 24 is
          formed in an arcuate bowed configuration as defined by concave
          surfaces 26 and convex surfaces 28, and the poles are defined
          at the ends of the magnet as will be appreciated from FIG. 5.
          For further magnetic field concentrating purposes the ends of
          the armature magnet are shaped by beveled surfaces 30 to
          minimize the cross-sectional area at the magnet ends at 32,
          and the magnetic flux existing between the poles of the
          armature magnet are as indicated by the light dotted lines. In
          like manner the magnetic fields of the stator magnets 12 are
          indicated by the light dotted lines. </p>
        <p>The armature magnet 24 is maintained in a spaced relationship
          above the stator track 22. This spacing may be accomplished by
          mounting the armature magnet upon a slide, guide or track
          located above the stator magnets, or the armature magnet could
          be mounted upon a wheeled vehicle carriage or slide supported
          upon a nonmagnetic surface or guideway disposed between the
          stator magnets and the armature magnet. To clarify the
          illustration, the means for supporting the armature magnet 24
          is not illustrated and such means form no part of invention,
          and it is to be understood that the means supporting the
          armature magnet prevents the armature magnet from moving away
          from the stator magnets, or moving closer thereto, but permits
          free movement of the armature magnet to the left or right in a
          direction parallel to the track 22 defined by the stator
          magnets. </p>
        <p>It will be noted that the length of the armature magnet 24 is
          slightly greater than the width of two of the stator magnets
          12 and the spacing therebetween. The magnetic forces acting
          upon the armature magnet when in the position of FIG. 5 will
          be repulsion forces 34 due to the proximity of like polarity
          forces and attraction forces at 36 because of the opposite
          polarity of the south pole of the armature magnet, and the
          north pole field of the sector magnets. The relative strength
          of this force is represented by the thickness of the force
          line. </p>
        <p>The resultant of the force vectors imposed upon the armature
          magnet as shown in FIG. 5 produce a primary force vector 38
          toward the left, FIG. 5, displacing the armature magnet 24
          toward the left. In FIG. 6 the magnetic forces acting upon the
          armature magnet are represented by the same reference numerals
          as in FIG. 5. While the forces 34 constitute repulsion forces
          tending to move the north pole of the armature magnet away
          from the stator magnets, the attraction forces imposed upon
          the south pole of the armature magnet and some of the
          repulsion forces, tend to move the armature magnet further to
          the left, and as the resultant force 38 continues to be toward
          the left the armature magnet continues to be forced to the
          left. </p>
        <p>FIG. 7 represents further displacement of the armature magnet
          24 to the left with respect to the position of FIG. 6, and the
          magnetic forces acting thereon are represented by the same
          reference numerals as in FIGS. 5 and 6, and the stator magnet
          will continue to move to the left, and such movement continues
          the length of the track 22 defined by the stator magnets 12. </p>
        <p>Upon the armature magnet being reversed such that the north
          pole is positioned at the right as viewed in FIG. 5, and the
          south pole is positioned at the left, the direction of
          movement of the armature magnet relative to the stator magnets
          is toward the right, and the theory of movement is identical
          to that described above. </p>
        <p>In FIG. 8 a plurality of armature magnets 40 and 42 are
          illustrated which are connected by links 44. The armature
          magnets are of a shape and configuration identical to that of
          the embodiment of FIG. 5, but the magnets are staggered with
          respect to each other in the direction of magnet movement,
          i.e., the direction of the track 22 defined by the stator
          magnets 12. By so staggering a plurality of armature magnets a
          smoother movement of the interconnected armature magnets is
          produced as compared when using a single armature magnet as
          there is variation in the forces acting upon each armature
          magnet as it moves above the track 22 due to the change in
          magnetic forces imposed thereon. The use of several armature
          magnets tends to "smooth out" the application of forces
          imposed upon linked armature magnets, resulting in a smoother
          movement of the armature magnet assembly. Of course, any
          number of armature magnets may be interconnected, limited only
          by the width of the stator magnet track 22. </p>
        <p>In FIGS. 9 and 10 a rotary embodiment embracing the inventive
          concepts is illustrated. In this embodiment the principle of
          operation is identical to that described above, but the
          orientation of the stator and armature magnets is such that
          rotation of the armature magnets is produced about an axis,
          rather than a linear movement being achieved. </p>
        <p>In FIGS. 9 and 10 a base is represented at 46 serving as a
          support for a stator member 48. The stator member 48 is made
          of a nonmagnetic material, such as synthetic plastic,
          aluminum, or the like. The stator includes a cylindrical
          surface 50 having an axis, and a threaded bore 52 is
          concentrically defined in the stator. The stator includes an
          annular groove 54 receiving an annular sleeve 56 of high
          magnetic field permeability material such as Netic Co-Netic
          and a plurality of stator magnets 58 are affixed upon the
          sleeve 56 in spaced circumferential relationship as will be
          apparent in FIG. 10. Preferably, the stator magnets 58 are
          formed with converging radial sides as to be of a wedge
          configuration having a curved inner surface engaging sleeve
          56, and a convex outer pole surface 60. </p>
        <p>The armature 62, in the illustrated embodiment, is of a
          dished configuration having a radial web portion, and an
          axially extending portion 64. The armature 62 is formed of a
          nonmagnetic material, and an annular belt receiving groove 66
          is defined therein for receiving a belt for transmitting power
          from the armature to a generator, or other power consuming
          device. Three armature magnets 68 are mounted on the armature
          portion 64, and such magnets are of a configuration similar to
          the armature magnet configuration of FIGS. 5 through 7. The
          magnets 68 are staggered with respect to each other in a
          circumferential direction wherein the magnets are not disposed
          as 120.degree. circumferential relationships to each other.
          Rather, a slight angular staggering of the armature magnets is
          desirable to "smooth out" the magnetic forces being imposed
          upon the armature as a result of the magnetic forces being
          simultaneously imposed upon each of the armature magnets. The
          staggering of the armature magnets 68 in a circumferential
          direction produces the same effect as the staggering of the
          armature magnets 40 and 42 as shown in FIG. 8. </p>
        <p>The armature 62 is mounted upon a threaded shaft 70 by
          antifriction bearings 72, and the shaft 70 is threaded into
          the stator threaded bore 52, and may be rotated by the knob
          74. In this manner rotation of the knob 74, and shaft 70,
          axially displaces the armature 62 with respect to the stator
          magnets 58, and such axial displacement will very the
          magnitude of the magnetic forces imposed upon the armature
          magnets 68 by the stator magnets thereby controlling the speed
          of rotation of the armature. </p>
        <p>As will be noted from FIGS. 4-7 and 9 and 10, an air gap
          exists between the armature magnet or magnets and the stator
          magnets and the dimension of this spacing, effects the
          magnitude of the forces imposed upon the armature magnet or
          magnets. If the distance between the armature magents, and the
          stator magnets is reduced the forces imposed upon the armature
          magnets by the stator magnets are increased, and the resultant
          force vector tending to displace the armature magnets in their
          path of movement increases. However, the decreasing of the
          spacing between the armature and stator magnets creates a
          "pulsation" in the movement of the armature magnets which is
          objectionable, but can be, to some extent, minimized by using
          a plurality of armature magnets. The increasing of the
          distance between the armature and stator magnets reduces the
          pulsation tendency of the armature magnet, but also reduces
          the magnitude of the magnetic forces imposed upon the armature
          magnets. Thus, the most effective spacing between the armature
          magnets. Thus, the most effective spacing between the armature
          and stator magnets is that spacing which produces the maximum
          force vector in the direction of armature magnet movement,
          with a minimum creation of objectionable pulsation. </p>
        <p>In the disclosed embodiments the high permeability plate 20
          and sleeve 56 are disclosed for concentrating the magnetic
          field of the stator magnets, and the armature magnets are
          bowed and have shaped ends for magnetic field concentration
          purposes. While such magnetic field concentration means result
          in higher forces imposed upon the armature magnets for given
          magnet intensities, it is not intended that the inventive
          concepts be limited to the use of such magnetic field
          concentrating means. </p>
        <p>As will be appreciated from the above description of the
          invention, the movement of the armature magnet or magnets
          resultsfrom the described relationship of components. The
          length of the armature magnets as related to the width of the
          stator magnets and spacing therebetween, the dimension of the
          air gap and the configuration of the magnetic field, combined,
          produce the desired result and motion. The inventive concepts
          may be practiced even though these relationships may be varied
          within limits not yet defined and the invention is intended to
          encompass all dimensional relationships which achieve the
          desired goal of armature movement. By way of example, with
          respect to FIGS. 4-7, the following dimensions were used in an
          operating prototype: </p>
        <p>The length of armature magnet 24 is 31/8", the stator magnets
          12 are 1" wide, 1/4" thick and 4" long and grain oriented. The
          air gap between the poles of the armature magnet and the
          stator magnets is approximately 11/2" and the spacing between
          the stator magnets is approximately 1/2" inch. </p>
        <p>In effect, the stator magnets define a magnetic field track
          of a single polarity transversely interrupted at spaced
          locations by the magnetic fields produced by the lines of
          force existing between the poles of the stator magnets and the
          unidirectional force exerted on the armature magnet is a
          result of the repulsion and attraction forces existing as the
          armature magnet traverses this magnetic field track. </p>
        <p>It is to be understood that the inventive concept embraces an
          arrangement wherein the armature magnet component is
          stationary and the stator assembly is supported for movement
          and constitutes the moving component, and other variations of
          the inventive concept will be apparent to those skilled in the
          art without departing from the scope thereof. As used herein
          the term "track" is intended to include both linear and
          circular arrangements of the static magnets, and the
          "direction" or "length" of the track is that direction
          parallel or concentric to the intended direction of armature
          magnet movement. <br>

          magnetic fields along said path, each of said assemblies
          including stator magnets interconnected in surrounding
          relation to said path and having pole faces of opposite
          polarity aligned with parallel planes intersected by said path
          and magnetic means fixed to the pole faces aligned with one of
          the parallel planes for interaction of the armature magnet
          with said stationary magnetic fields for unidirectional
          propulsion of the armature along said path, said magnetic
          means being an annular magnet having a radially inner pole
          surface of one polarity enclosing a magnetic flux zone through
          which said path extends. </p>
        <p><b>Description</b> </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span>
        </p>
        <p>This invention relates in general to the use of permanent
          magnets to generate unidirectional propelling forces. </p>
        <p>The generation of unidirectional propelling forces by
          permanent magnets is already known and recognized in U.S. Pat.
          Nos. 4,151,431 and 4,215,330 to Johnson and Hartmen,
          respectively, by way of example. According to applicant's own
          prior Pat. No. 4,151,431, such forces are generated by
          magnetic interaction between a curved magnet bar of an
          armature guided for movement along a circular path and an
          arrangement of spaced stator magnets having pole faces of one
          polarity facing the armature on one side thereof parallel to
          the path of movement. </p>
        <p>It is therefore an important object of the present invention
          to provide certain improved stator arrangements of permanent
          magnets interacting with a permanent magnet armature for
          unidirectional propulsion thereof in a novel manner believed
          to be more efficient. </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span>
        </p>
        <p>In accordance with the present invention, the armature magnet
          is guided along a path through a magnetic flux zone limited on
          opposite sides of the path by an arrangement of magnetic pole
          surfaces of one polarity on stator magnets. According to one
          embodiment, the flux zone is formed by spaced gate assemblies
          of magnets having exposed pole faces of one polarity in a
          plane perpendicular to the armature path from which a magnetic
          field extends to the opposite pole faces and a ring magnet
          fixed to such opposite pole faces of the other polarity, with
          a radially inner pole surface of the same polarity producing a
          magnetic field perpendicular to the first mentioned field to
          their opposite radially outer pole surfaces. </p>
        <p>According to another embodiment, the flux zone is formed
          between continuous confronting pole surfaces of one polarity
          on stator magnets arranged to produce a magnetic field of
          varying intensity along the armature path. </p>
        <p>In yet another embodiment, at least two curved bar magnets
          are interconnected to form the armature with two pairs of pole
          faces spaced along the armature path. </p>
        <p>These together with other objects and advantages which will
          become subsequently apparent reside in the details of
          construction and operation as more fully hereinafter described
          and claimed, reference being had to the accompanying drawings

        <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </p>
        <p>Referring now to the drawings in detail, FIG. 1 illustrates
          one embodiment of the invention in which a magnetic armature
          generally referred to by reference numeral 10 is
          unidirectionally propelled along a predetermined path
          established by a motion guiding track 12 fixed to a frame or
          support 14. The path is represented by a line 16 extending
          through pole faces 18 and 20 of opposite polarity at the
          longitudinal ends of a curved armature bar magnet 22. The
          armature 10 in the illustrated example includes a wheeled
          vehicle mount 24 to which the armature magnet 22 is fixedly
          secured with the pole faces 18 and 20 converging toward the
          guiding track 12. The pole faces 18 and 20 are furthermore
          orientated so that the magnetic field extending between pole
          faces 18 and 20 is movable therewith within a flux zone 26
          limited in surrounding relation to the guided path at spaced
          locations by stator gate assemblies 28 formed by permanent
          magnets fixed to the frame support 14. </p>
        <p>Each of the stator gate assemblies 28 as shown in FIGS. 1-3,
          includes four bar magnets 30 interconnected at corners by
          non-magnetic elements 32, such as triangular wooden blocks as
          more clearly seen in FIG. 3, to form a rectangular enclosure
          in surrounding relation to the track 12. Pole faces 34 and 36
          between which a stationary magentic field extends are formed
          on the bar magnets substantially aligned with parallel spaced
          planes in perpendicular intersecting relation to the path line
          16. The pole face 34 of one polarity (north) is effective
          through its magnetic field to magnetically interact with the
          magnetic field of the armature magnet 22 causing
          unidirectional propulsion of the armature 10 as actually
          observed during tests. Such magnetic interaction is obviously
          influenced by the pole face 36 of opposite polarity (south)
          abutting and fixed to an annular or circular ring magnet 38
          magnets 30. The interconnected and 38 may be held in assembled
          relation by an outer skin or sheathing 40 as shown in FIG. 3.
        </p>
        <p>The ring magnet 38 has a radially inner pole surface 42 of
          the same polarity (north) as that of the pole faces 34 to
          interact with the other pole faces 36 as aforementioned, to
          the exclusion of the radially outer pole surface 44. The
          obvious effect of said arrangement is to exert a net magnetic
          force on the armature magnet 22 causing the observed
          continuous, unidirectional propulsion thereof through the gate
          assemblies 28. Such assemblies 28 are spaced apart distance
          dependent on the magnetic field intensity or strength of the
          permanent magnets 30 and 38 which dictate the effective axial
          extent of the aforementioned magnetic fields associated with
          the assemblies 28 and the armature magnet 22. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 4-7 illustrate another embodiment of the invention
          utilizing the same type of movable armature 10 guided along a
          predetermined path by a frame mounted track 12 extending
          through a flux zone 46 established by another type of
          permanent magnet stator arrangement, generally referred to by
          reference numeral 48. The stator 48 includes a pair of
          permanent magnet assemblies 50 extending in parallel spaced
          relation to each other on opposite sides of the armature path
          established by the track 12. Each assembly 50 is a mirror
          image of the other so as to expose continuous confronting pole
          surfaces formed by a magnetic layer material 52 such as
          Neodynium, mounted on interconnected ceramic bodies 54. The
          confronting pole surfaces of the magnetic layers 52 are of
          like polarity (north), opposite to the polarity of the pole
          surface of magnetic layer sections 56 and 58 made of Samarium
          Cobalt, for example, and carried on the ceramic bodies 54. The
          bodies 54 have transversely extending flange portions 60 at
          the abutting ends so as to mount the layer sections sections
          58 laterally outwardly of layer sections 56 as more clearly
          seen in FIGS. 4 and 6 to thereby vary the magnetic field
          intensity along the guided armature path within the limited
          flux zone 46 in which the magnetic fields of the stator
          assembly 48 interact with the magnetic field of bar magnet 22.
        </p>
        <p>The curved armature magnet 22 is orientated within the flux
          zone 46 between the confronting pole surfaces on 52 as
          depicted in FIG. 7, with the pole faces 18 and 20 converging
          toward the track 12 as previously described in connection with
          FIGS. 1-3. However, it was found that maximum propelling
          thrust is produced by optimum location of the path line 16
          through the pole faces 18 and 20 a distance 62 closer to the
          upper edge of surface layer 52 than the lower edge on the
          frame support 14. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate yet another embodiment of the
          invention involving the same type of permanent magnet stator
          arrangement 50 as described with respect to FIGS. 4-7. a
          modified form of armature 10' is featured in FIGS. 8 and 9,
          including two curved armature magnets 64 that are mirror
          images of each other with respect to an intermediate abutting
          portion 66. The magnets 64 are interconnected at the abutting
          portion 66 in alignment with a plane containing the path line
          16 centrally between the confronting pole surfaces on 52. The
          end pole faces 68 and 70 for each magnet 64, are aligned with
          a plane in parallel spaced relation between the path line 16
          and the pole surface on 52. With the number of pole faces
          thereby doubled for the armature, a higher and more efficient
          propelling thrust may be achieved. </p>
        <p>The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the
          principles of the invention. Further, since numerous
          modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled
          in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the
          exact construction and operation shown and described, and
          accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be
          restorted to, falling within the scope of the invention. <br>

        <p><b>Abstract --- </b>A magnetic propulsion system including a
          plurality of specifically arranged permanent magnets and a
          magnetic vehicle propelled thereby along a path defined by the
          permanent magnets. The magnetic vehicle which is to be
          propelled includes a rigidly attached armature comprising
          several curved magnets. The propulsion system further includes
          two parallel walls of permanent magnets arranged so as to
          define the lateral sides of a vehicle path. Preferably, the
          walls are identical to one another except that the polarities
          of the magnets which define one wall are opposite from the
          polarities of the corresponding magnets in the opposite wall.
          A first wall, for example, includes a series of generally
          rectangular magnets, each magnet arranged with a
          North-to-South axis pointing longitudinally down the wall in
          the intended direction of vehicle travel. Each of the
          rectangular magnets is separated from the next successive
          rectangular magnet by a thinner magnet, which thinner magnet
          is arranged with its North-to-South axis pointing laterally
          toward the opposite wall and therefore perpendicular with
          respect to the North-to-South axis of the rectangular magnets.
          The opposite (or second) wall includes the same general
          arrangement of magnets, except that the North-to-South axis
          for each of the generally rectangular magnets is in a
          direction opposite from the direction of vehicle travel and
          the North-to-South axis of the thinner magnets points away
          from the first wall. In addition, the propulsion system
          includes several spin accelerators. </p>

        <p>FIELD OF THE INVENTION </p>
        <p>The present invention relates to a magnetic propulsion system
          including a plurality of specifically arranged permanent
          magnets and a magnetic vehicle propelled thereby along a path
          defined by the permanent magnets. </p>
        <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
        <p>The generation of unidirectional propelling forces by
          permanent magnets is already known and recognized in U.S. Pat.
          Nos. 4,151,431 and 4,877,983 to Johnson, and U.S. Pat. No.
          4,215,330 to Hartmen, by way of example. According to
          applicant's first patent (U.S. Pat. No. 4,151,431), such
          forces are generated by magnetic interaction between a curved
          magnet bar of an armature guided for movement along a circular
          path and an arrangement of spaced stator magnets having pole
          faces of one polarity facing the armature on one side thereof
          parallel to the path of movement. </p>
        <p>According to applicant's second patent (U.S. Pat. No.
          4,877,983), the armature magnet is mounted on a vehicle and
          guided along a path through a magnetic flux zone limited on
          opposite sides of the path by an arrangement of magnetic pole
          surfaces of one polarity on stator magnets. According to one
          embodiment of the second patent, the flux zone is formed by
          spaced gate assemblies of magnets having exposed pole faces of
          one polarity in a plane perpendicular to the armature path
          from which a magnetic field extends to the opposite pole faces
          and a ring magnet fixed to such opposite pole faces of the
          other polarity, with a radially inner pole surface of the same
          polarity producing a magnetic field perpendicular to the first
          mentioned field to their opposite radially outer pole
          surfaces. Several other embodiments are illustrated including
          variations in the armature structure and in the stator
          structure; however, all of the embodiments teach use of an
          annular stator assembly. </p>
        <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
        <p>It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide
          an improved magnetic propulsion system having a plurality of
          permanent magnets and a magnetic vehicle propelled thereby
          along a path defined by the permanent magnets, wherein the
          permanent magnets need not encircle the path of the magnetic
          vehicle. </p>
        <p>In order to achieve this and other objects, the present
          invention comprises two parallel walls of permanent magnets
          arranged so as to define the lateral sides of a vehicle path.
          The walls are identical to one another except that the
          polarities of the magnets which define one wall are opposite
          from the polarities of the corresponding magnets in the
          opposite wall. </p>
        <p>A first wall, for example, includes a series of generally
          rectangular magnets, each magnet arranged with a
          North-to-South axis pointing longitudinally down the wall in
          the intended direction of vehicle travel. Each of the
          rectangular magnets is separated from the next successive
          rectangular magnet by a thinner magnet, which thinner magnet
          is arranged with its North-to-South axis pointing laterally
          toward the opposite wall and therefore perpendicular with
          respect to the North-to-South axis of the rectangular magnets.
        </p>
        <p>The pole-to-pole length of each thinner magnet is preferably
          no more than half the width of the generally rectangular
          magnets. Accordingly, a gap on the inside surface of the wall
          is defined by the presence of each thinner magnet. </p>
        <p>The opposite (or second) wall includes the same general
          arrangement of magnets, except that the North-to-South axis
          for each of the generally rectangular magnets is in a
          direction opposite from the direction of vehicle travel and
          the North-to-South axis of the thinner magnets points away
          from the first wall. </p>
        <p>In addition, the propulsion system of the present invention
          includes several spin accelerators for crowding the magnetic
          fields at predetermined positions along the length of the
          walls. This crowding of the magnetic fields serves to
          intensify the fields and causes the vehicle's armature to be
          accelerated faster than would otherwise be the case without
          the spin accelerators. </p>
        <p>The spin accelerators project laterally outward from each of
          the walls at predetermined positions along the longitudinal
          length of each wall. Each spin accelerator comprises a
          generally rectangular permanent magnet which is preferably
          identical to that of the first and second walls. Each spin
          accelerator further includes a shorter magnet having a smaller
          pole-to-pole length than that of the generally rectangular
          magnet and a wedge separating the generally rectangular magnet
          of the spin accelerator from the shorter magnet. </p>
        <p>The orientation of the generally rectangular magnet in the
          spin accelerator is determined by which pole of the wall's
          thinner magnet is facing outwardly. The rectangular magnet's
          orientation is such that face-to-face contact is established
          between opposite poles of the generally rectangular magnet in
          the spin accelerator and the thinner magnet in the wall.
          Accordingly, the North-to-South axis of the generally
          rectangular magnet in the spin accelerator points in the same
          direction as the North-to-South axis of the thinner magnet in
          the wall. The shorter magnet in the spin accelerator is
          likewise arranged with its North-to-South axis pointing in the
          same general direction as that of the thinner magnet in the
          wall; but here, an acute angular tilt away from the
          North-to-South axis of the thinner magnet is established by
          the wedge. In particular, the angle of the wedge determines
          the acute angle which exists between the North-to-South axis
          of the shorter magnet in the spin accelerator and the
          North-to-South axis of the thinner magnet in the wall. </p>
        <p>The magnetic vehicle which is to be propelled by the instant
          propulsion system includes a rigidly attached armature
          comprising several curved magnets. Each curved magnet is
          arranged on the vehicle such that its North-to-South axis is
          parallel with respect to that of the other curved magnets. In
          particular, the North-to-South axes of all the curved magnets
          point in the same direction as the North-to-South axes of the
          thinner magnets in each wall. The vehicle itself is preferably
          a wheeled vehicle mounted on a track; however, it is
          understood that other vehicle structures will suffice so long
          as the vehicle is maintained between the walls of the
          propulsion system. </p>
        <p>In operation, the magnetic fields created by the two walls
          exert a propelling force on the armature of the vehicle in the
          desired direction of travel. Since the armature of the vehicle
          is rigidly attached to the vehicle, the vehicle itself begins
          to accelerate and is hence set in motion by the propulsion
          system. </p>
        <p>Preferably, the curved magnets of the vehicle armature are
          "Alnico 8" magnets tipped with neodymium magnets. The magnets
          which constitute the walls and spin accelerators are
          preferably made of neodymium and ceramic material, except for
          the thinner magnets. The thinner magnets are preferably made
          of rubber or plastic, and each can comprise a plurality of
          magnetic rubber or plastic layers. </p>
        <p>Although the present invention has been described with regard
          to generally rectangular magnets, it is understood that other
          permanent magnet shapes will suffice, including but not
          limited to generally cylindrical shapes. </p>

          system in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the
          present invention. </p>

        <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
        <p>With reference to FIG. 1, a preferred embodiment of the
          inventive magnetic propulsion system and vehicle propelled
          thereby will now be described. </p>
        <p>FIG. 1 schematically illustrates a propulsion system 10
          comprising two parallel magnetic walls 12,14 which are
          stationary, and an armature 16 rigidly attached to a vehicle
          18. The two parallel walls 12,14 are formed from several
          permanent magnets arranged so as to define the lateral sides
          of a vehicle path. The desired direction of vehicle travel is
          indicated by an arrow A in FIG. 1. The two walls 12,14 are
          identical to one another except that the polarities of the
          magnets which define one wall 12 are opposite from the
          polarities of the corresponding magnets in the opposite wall
          14. A first wall 12, for example, includes a series of
          generally rectangular magnets 20, each magnet arranged with a
          North-to-South axis pointing longitudinally down the wall in
          the intended direction of vehicle travel (indicated by arrow
          A). Each of the magnets 20 preferably comprises a ceramic
          magnet with a neodymium north pole. In addition, each of the
          generally rectangular magnets 20 is separated from the next
          successive rectangular magnet 20 by a thinner magnet 22. The
          thinner magnets 22 are arranged with their North-to-South axes
          pointing laterally toward the opposite wall 14 and therefore
          perpendicular with respect to the North-to-South axis of the
          rectangular magnets 20. Each thinner magnet 22 is preferably
          made from rubber or plastic permanently magnetic material.
          Also, the pole-to-pole length of each thinner magnet 22 is
          preferably no more than half the width of the generally
          rectangular magnets 20. Consequently, a gap 24 on the inside
          surface of the wall 12 is defined by the presence of each
          thinner magnet 22. </p>
        <p>The opposite (or second) wall 14 includes the same general
          arrangement of magnets 20,22, except that the North-to-South
          axis for each of the generally rectangular magnets 20 points
          in a direction opposite from the direction of vehicle travel,
          while the North-to-South axes of the thinner magnets 22 point
          away from the first wall 12. </p>
        <p>By arranging the thinner magnets 22 between the generally
          rectangular magnets 20 in the foregoing manner, there is a
          pole shading effect on the magnets 20 of the walls 12,14. </p>
        <p>In addition, the propulsion system 10 of the preferred
          embodiment includes several spin accelerators 26 for crowding
          the magnetic fields at predetermined positions along the
          length of the walls 12,14. This crowding of the magnetic
          fields serves to intensify the fields and causes the vehicle's
          armature to be accelerated faster than would otherwise be the
          case without the spin accelerators. </p>
        <p>The spin accelerators 26 project laterally outward from each
          of the walls 12,14 at predetermined positions along the
          longitudinal length of each wall 12,14. According to the
          preferred embodiment, the spin accelerators 26 are positioned
          along the walls 12,14 at every other thinner magnet 22 (as is
          shown in the middle of FIG. 1). Each spin accelerator 26
          comprises a generally rectangular permanent magnet 28 which is
          preferably identical or very similar to that of the first and
          second walls 12,14. Each spin accelerator 26 further includes
          a shorter magnet 30 having a smaller pole-to-pole length than
          that of the generally rectangular magnet 28 and a wedge 32
          separating the generally rectangular magnet 28 of the spin
          accelerator 26 from the shorter magnet 30. The orientation of
          the generally rectangular magnet 28 in the spin accelerator 26
          is determined by which pole of the wall's thinner magnet 22 is
          facing outwardly. The rectangular magnet's orientation is such
          that face-to-face contact is established between opposite
          poles of the generally rectangular magnet 28 in the spin
          accelerator 26 and the thinner magnet 22 in the wall 12,14.
          Accordingly, the North-to-South axis of the generally
          rectangular magnet 28 in the spin accelerator 26 points in the
          same direction as the North-to-South axis of the thinner
          magnet 22 in the wall 12,14. The shorter magnet 30 in the spin
          accelerator 26 is likewise arranged with its North-to-South
          axis pointing in the same general direction as that of the
          thinner magnet 22 in the wall 12,14; but here, an acute
          angular tilt away from the North-to-South axis of the thinner
          magnet 22 is established by the wedge 32. In particular, the
          angle .alpha. of the wedge determines the acute angle which
          exists between the North-to-South axis of the shorter magnet
          30 and the North-to-South axis of the thinner magnet 22 in the
          wall 12,14. The shorter magnet 30 preferably consists of
          neodymium. </p>
        <p>The magnetic vehicle 18 which is to be propelled by the
          instant propulsion system 10 includes a rigidly attached
          armature 16 comprising several curved magnets 34. Each curved
          magnet 34 is arranged on the vehicle 18 such that its
          North-to-South axis is parallel with respect to that of the
          other curved magnets 34. In particular, the North-to-South
          axes of all the curved magnets 34 point in the same direction
          as the North-to-South axes of the thinner magnets 22 in each
          wall 12,14. The vehicle 18 itself, according to the preferred
          embodiment, is a wheeled vehicle mounted on a track 36. It is
          understood, however, that other vehicle structures will
          suffice so long as the vehicle is maintained between the walls
          12,14 of the propulsion system 10. </p>
        <p>In operation, when the vehicle 18 is positioned as is shown
          in FIG. 1, the magnetic fields created by the two walls 12,14
          exert a propelling force on the armature 16 of the vehicle 18
          in the desired direction of travel (arrow A). Since the
          armature 16 is rigidly attached to the vehicle 18, the vehicle
          18 itself begins to accelerate and hence is set in motion by
          the propulsion system 10. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, since the spin accelerators 26 serve to crowd
          and thereby intensify the magnetic fields at predetermined
          positions along the walls 12,14, the acceleration of the
          vehicle is enhanced as the vehicle passes these predetermined
          positions. </p>
        <p>The spin accelerators 26 can be reversed in order to lessen
          their effectiveness at crowding the magnetic fields. Reversing
          of the spin accelerators 26 can be accomplished by rotating
          the spin accelerators 26 so that the shorter magnets 30 tilt
          away from the intended direction of vehicle travel, rather
          than in the direction of travel as is the case for the
          illustrated embodiment. </p>
        <p>Preferably, the curved magnets 34 of the vehicle armature 16
          are "Alnico 8" magnets tipped with neodymium magnets, while
          the wedges 32 comprise wood or similar material and an angle
          .alpha. of 45 to 90 degrees. </p>
        <p>The width w.sub.20, height, and pole-to-pole length 1.sub.20
          of the generally rectangular magnets 20 in each wall 12,13 are
          0.75 inches to 1.25 inches, 3.75 to 4.25 inches, and 1.25
          inches to 1.75 inches, respectively. The width w.sub.22,
          height, and pole-to-pole length 1.sub.22 of the thinner
          magnets 22 in the walls 12,14 are 1 inch to 1.5 inches, 3.75
          inches to 4.25 inches, and no more than one half the width
          w.sub.20 of the generally rectangular magnets, respectively.
          In the spin accelerators 26, the width w.sub.28, height, and
          pole-to-pole length 1.sub.28 of the generally rectangular
          magnets 28 are 1.125 to 1.625 inches, 3.75 to 4.25 inches, and
          0.875 inches to 1.375 inches, respectively, while the width
          w.sub.32, height, and pole-to-pole length 1.sub.32 of the
          shorter magnets 30 are 0.75 inch to 1.25 inches, 3.75 inches
          to 4.25 inches, and 0.125 inch to 0.375 inch, respectively. </p>
        <p>Preferably, the distance separating the walls 12,14, is such
          that each wall 12,14 is 0.5 inch to 1.25 inches away from the
          tips of the armature magnets 34, both walls 12,14 being
          equidistant from the tips of the armature 16. Also, the curved
          magnets 34 of the armature 16 are preferably 0.375 inch to
          0.625 inch apart from one another. </p>
        <p>Testing of the foregoing prototype propulsion system resulted
          in the vehicle moving 2 feet in one second. </p>
        <p>Although the present invention has been described with
          reference to a preferred embodiment, it is understood that
          various modifications to this embodiment will become
          subsequently apparent to those having ordinary skill in the
          art. In this regard, the scope of the invention is limited
          only by the claims appended hereto, and not by the illustrated
          embodiment. <br>

          <b>Subject</b>: Truth about Howard Johnson and his motor </p>
        <p>Sterling, </p>
        <p>Just a quick note to let you know I spoke to Tom Bearden
          today and, regarding the statement on your webpage by your
          "anonymous source" who said "Howard Johnson never was able to
          get the rotary version to work.&nbsp; He was only able to get
          the linear version working, and there were some questions
          about its viability.", Tom said such a person doesn't know
          what they are talking about.&nbsp; I'd say Tom is in the best
          position to know, since he and Howard have been friends for
          decades and Howard has personally brought a functional, rotary
          PMM to Tom's house, and they've played with it for
          hours.&nbsp; Next to Howard himself, I'd consider Tom to be
          the best resource on the subject of HJ's PMM. </p>
        <p>He also said that Howard is still working on getting another
          functioning unit constructed (he's had numerous setbacks over
          the years after his working unit was vandalized by thieves
          that broke into Howard's shop and stole only the magnets off
          that model, leaving many $K worth of other material nearby
          untouched).&nbsp; Howard is still plugging away every day, at
          over 70 years old, but his wife's health problems are keeping
          him busy.&nbsp; However, he has gotten hooked up with a
          respectable, honest businessman who is financing him and
          Howard also now has some younger help to do the grunt work
          that is becoming tougher for him.&nbsp; All in all, Tom hopes
          to see some real progress being made for Howard in the next
          year or so. </p>
        <p>Tom mentioned that there are a few critical things that
          anyone who wants to successfully build a working HJ PMM needs
          to know, some of which are probably obvious to the more
          experienced builders: </p>
        <p>1) The most critical element is the precise machining of the
          magnets.&nbsp; Joe Q. Public, with his diamond saw, cutting
          his own magnets by hand has little chance of succeeding in
          shaping the magnets to the aerospace-critical specs that are
          the minimum necessary, much less duplicating that feat several
          times for each necessary part. </p>
        <p>2) Alignment of the parts is highly important too.&nbsp; One
          slight misalignment and the motor will not run continuously. </p>
        <p>3) All magnets aren't the same.&nbsp; This application
          requires expensive, extremely high quality magnets.&nbsp;
          Howard, in order to get them cheaper, was buying them in $50K
          lots from China, where high quality and a lower price can be
          had. </p>
        <p>I also spoke with a gentleman named Gary Hanson who had been
          in touch with Howard years ago when Gary was trying to build
          Howard's motor.&nbsp; Howard told him, as I think most
          researchers on this know now, that the motor *can* be build
          directly from the patent but that there needs to be 5 or 6
          armtures and not just the one that is shown as an illustration
          in the patent.&nbsp; Just want to make sure any newbies
          understand this. </p>
        <p>I hope some of this has helped clear up any misunderstandings
          for those of us interested in building a functional HJ
          PMM.&nbsp; My opinion is that, if you want to do it right, go
          to the horse's mouth (Howard) or else as close as you can
          possibly get (Tom).&nbsp; Hopefully, doing so will enable us
          to make this motor a reality. </p>
        <p>Regards, Karl <br>

              [</font></b>Excerpts from www.cheniere.org ] </p>
        <p>Howard Johnson is also a respected colleague, whom I very
          much admire. (See Figure 23). Howard has continued to work
          quietly and patiently upon his patented permanent magnet
          motor, [note 31] including patenting various magnetic gates,
          etc. that are necessary to make such a motor work in a rotary
          configuration. [note 32] Howard employs a two-particle theory
          of magnetism; i.e., each magnetic flux line is envisioned as
          having a particle traveling from the north pole to the south
          pole, and also a particle traveling from the south pole to the
          north pole. The particles are spinning; the forward-time
          particle spins in one direction, and the antiparticle spins in
          the other direction. Howard then slightly separates the two
          particle flows. [note 33] In other words, Johnson splits the
          flux lines themselves, into two different pieces. When so
          separated, the component lines are now curls, so their paths
          curve. The paths of the two "curl particles" are different;
          one curls in one direction and the other curls in the opposite
          direction. Further, a predominance of one form of curl
          particle gives a "time-forward" aspect, while a predominance
          of the other form of curl particle gives a "time-reversed"
          aspect. Johnson is thus able to employ a deeper kind of
          magnetism than the textbooks presently contain. He
          demonstrates that a "spin-altered" magnetic assembly
          exhibiting (to a compass or other such detector) a north
          polarity can attract another unaltered magnetic assembly
          exhibiting a north polarity. In short, he can make a north
          pole attract a north pole. We will give you further insight
          into Johnson's two-particle theory in a future article. [note
          34] We will also explain how and why the physicists missed
          that antiparticle in the magnetic field's flux lines, and
          thereby failed to advance the theory of magnetism to a deeper
          level. Make no mistake, one day when the new theory is done,
          Johnson may well be awarded a Nobel Prize for his epochal
          discovery of a deeper structure of magnetism. </p>
        <p><i>Footnotes:</i> </p>
        <p>[32] I personally saw and closely examined one demonstration
          rotary Johnson permanent magnet motor some years ago, and
          toyed with it for about one hour. It would definitely self-
          rotate as long as you wished to permit it to turn. It was not
          a powerful device at all, but just a small laboratory "proof
          of principle" prototype. It had cost Johnson an enormous
          amount of time, labor, and optimization to get the critical
          adjustment required of his two magnet assemblies. But the
          device had no power source other than the permanent magnet
          assemblies themselves. Johnson's nonlinear rotor and stator
          magnets interacted with each other in a manner to break local
          symmetry. So his machine was an open system and therefore a
          permissible overunity device; it was not a perpetuum mobile. </p>
        <p>[33] As I have pointed out repeatedly in the past, photons
          also carry time, not just energy. We have previously shown the
          process and the photon interaction mechanism that creates the
          flow of time itself; we will discuss this mechanism in the
          future. So when Johnson separates the particles and
          antiparticles, not only does he partially separate them
          according to spin, but he also alters the local character of
          time flow during which the resulting magnetic field forces
          must appear. In other words, he accomplishes a partial
          separation of time-forward and time- reversed polar
          interactions. A south pole is just a time- reversed magnetic
          north pole, in the first place! So a north pole of a bar
          magnet that is slightly time reversed on one side will
          partially act on that side just like a south pole. On the
          other side it will continue to act like a normal north pole.
          By partially time-reversing (phase conjugating) one side of
          the north magnetic pole piece, Johnson makes that side look
          and act like a south pole. that way Howard is able to create
          two north poles, one on a stator and the other on a rotor, and
          time-reverse part of one face of the stator's north magnetic
          pole-piece. Therefore when the proper sides of the stator and
          rotor north poles are facing, they attract each other,
          contrary to the conventional textbook. The two poles then
          repel each other normally as soon as the north rotor poles
          passes the north stator pole. Hence Johnson can make a
          surrounding north pole stator assembly "draw in" an
          approaching north pole rotor assembly, and then kick it on out
          the other side, because he has broken the local magnetic
          symmetry. In short, Johnson's magnetic gate can provide a
          legitimate component of unidirectional magnetic thrust, which
          means that he can indeed make a rotary permanent motor. Simply
          put, this "partially separating the spin particles," and
          thereby partially phase conjugating one face of a magnet, is
          what Johnson calls a "gate," and this is the patented secret
          by which his magnet assemblies can be made self-powering. The
          entire process is still very meticulous, and assembly and
          adjustments are extremely critical. With Johnson's blessings
          we hope to shed more light on this subject in coming articles.
