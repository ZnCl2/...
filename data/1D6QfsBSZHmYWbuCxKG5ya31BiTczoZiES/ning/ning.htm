            Existing Rechargeable Batteries and Supercapacitors</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      A team from the National University of Singapore's Nanoscience and
      Nanotechnology Initiative (NUSNNI), led by principle investigator
      Dr Xie Xian Ning, has developed a novel energy-storage membrane.<br>
      <br>
      Electrical energy storage and its management are becoming urgent
      issues due to climate change and energy shortage. Existing
      technologies such as rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors
      are based on complicated configurations including liquid
      electrolytes, and suffer from difficulties in scaling-up and high
      fabrication costs. There is also growing public concern and
      awareness of the impact of traditional energy sources on the
      environment, spurring a continued search for alternative, green,
      sustainable energy sources.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cost-effective and
        environmentally-friendly</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Recognising the issue, Dr Xie and his team have developed a
      membrane that not only promises greater cost-effectiveness in
      delivering energy, but also an environmentally-friendly solution.
      The researchers used a polystyrene-based polymer to deposit the
      soft, foldable membrane that, when sandwiched between and charged
      by two metal plates, could store charge at 0.2 farads per square
      centimeter. This is well above the typical upper limit of 1
      microfarad per square centimetre for a standard capacitor.<br>
      <br>
      The cost involved in energy storage is also drastically reduced.
      With existing technologies based on liquid electrolytes, it costs
      about US$7 to store each farad. With the advanced energy storage
      membrane, the cost to store each farad falls to an impressive
      US$0.62. This translates to an energy cost of 10-20 watt-hour per
      US dollar for the membrane, as compared to just 2.5 watt-hour per
      US dollar for lithium ion batteries.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Xie said: "Compared to rechargeable batteries and
      supercapacitors, the proprietary membrane allows for very simple
      device configuration and low fabrication cost. Moreover, the
      performance of the membrane surpasses those of rechargeable
      batteries, such as lithium ion and lead-acid batteries, and
      supercapacitors."<br>
      <br>
      The research is supported by grants from the Singapore-MIT
      Alliance for Research &amp; Technology (SMART), and National
      Research Foundation. Dr Xie and his team started work on the
      membrane early last year and took about 1.5 years to reach their
      current status, and have successfully filed a US patent for this
      novel invention.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery was featured in Energy &amp; Environmental Science
      and highlighted by the international journal Nature.<br>
      <br>
      Potential applications: From hybrid vehicles to solar panels and
      wind turbines<br>
      <br>
      The membrane could be used in hybrid vehicles for instant power
      storage and delivery, thus improving energy efficiency and
      reducing carbon emission. Potentially, hybrid cars with the
      membrane technology could be powered by the energy stored in the
      membranes in conjunction with the energy provided by fuel
      combustion, increasing the lifespan of car batteries and cutting
      down on waste.<br>
      <br>
      The membrane could also be integrated into solar panels and wind
      turbines to store and manage the electricity generated. Energy
      provided through these sources is prone to instability due to
      their dependence on natural factors. By augmenting these energy
      sources with the membrane, the issue of instability could
      potentially be negated, as surplus energy generated can be
      instantly stored in the membranes, and delivered for use at a
      stable rate at times when natural factors are insufficient, such
      as a lack of solar power during night-time.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Next Step</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The research team has demonstrated the membrane's superior
      performance in energy storage using prototype devices. The team is
      currently exploring opportunities to work with venture capitalists
      to commercialise the membrane. To date, several venture
      capitalists have expressed strong interest in the technology.<br>
      <br>
      "With the advent of our novel membrane, energy storage technology
      will be more accessible, affordable, and producible on a large
      scale. It is also environmentally-friendly and could change the
      current status of energy technology," Dr Xie said.<br>

      In the fight against environment pollution and global warming,
      clean energy generation and storage is vital to the sustainability
      of Singapore. Supercapacitors are the major energy storage devices
      due to their extremely high capacity in storing electric charges
      and energy. They are superior to batteries because their power
      density is up to 100 times that of batteries. As clean energy
      sources, supercapacitors have important applications in electric
      vehicles and consumer electronic devices including iPods and
      iPhones. The increasing concerns on energy and environment call
      for new generation supercapacitors with improved performances and
      reduced costs.<br>
      <br>
      This project aims to use the research team’s patent-pending
      nanomaterial to develop novel supercapacitors for energy storage
      and management. In contrast to commercial supercapacitors
      containing liquid electrolyte, our recently invented
      superhydrophilic nanomaterial allows for a different mechanism of
      energy storage, and thus create the possibility of a new type of
      solid-state supercapacitor. According to our background IP, the
      preliminary performance of the proposed supercapacitor is
      comparable to that of commercial carbon-based devices. Moreover,
      it has a lot of space for further improvement by optimizing the
      chemical compositions of the active nanomaterials. To convert the
      background IP into a commercial reality, further R&amp;D work is
      proposed in this project to deliver a new generation
      supercapacitor which has market viability owing to its simpler
      configuration, lower cost, and higher performances. image<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Technology Overview</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A highly polarizable ion-conducting energy-storage membrane
      capacitor demonstrates simplicity, easy device scaling up and low
      fabrication cost for electrical energy storage.&nbsp; This
      material system also presents a high cycle life at maintained
      performance. <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;The membrane-based capacitor can have an average capacitance
      of ~0.2 F/cm2, energy of 0.33 J/cm2 and charge of 0.39 C/cm2
      across various constant resistances from 1.2 to 8.0 k?.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;It can be seen that a linear increase of membrane area
      corresponds to a scaling factor of 0.2 F/cm2 in capacitance. This
      demonstrates that simple massive device scalability is readily
      achieved due to the linear relationship as established in Fig 1.<br>

        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      A new type of electrode material for supercapacitors that, for the
      first time, predominantly exploits ionic conductivity is reported
      online in the Journal of Polymer Science: Polymer Physics.
      Compared to conventional electrode materials, which require large
      surface areas and high porosities, lead researcher Xian Ning Xie
      explains that the new hydrophilized polymer network uses
      ion-conducting channels for fast ion transport and charge storage.<br>
      <br>
      Supercapacitors have an extremely high energy density compared to
      regular capacitors and can be charged and discharged repeatedly
      without degrading like batteries do. Their high capacitance and
      stability in electrolyte solutions could make them ideal for
      applications like uninterruptable power supplies and hybrid cars.<br>
      <br>
      The polymer network that Xie and his colleagues use includes PSSH
      (poly(styrene sulfonic acid)). PSSH has a high density of sulfonic
      SO3- groups, which attract a large amount of water, creating
      hydrated paths with increased ionic conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      According to the authors, previous publications emphasized only
      the importance of electronic conductivity and surface area in high
      capacitance charge storage. For supercapacitor electrode material,
      “both electronic and ionic conductivity of the material are
      important in terms of high capacitance charge storage. It is this
      work that, for the first time, points out the significance of
      ionic conductivity in supercapacitive energy storage,” says Xie.<br>
      <br>
      In their experiments, the researchers prepared PEDT:PSSH films on
      a graphite substrate and tested both their capacitive behavior as
      well as their stability in electrolyte solutions. Since electrode
      materials for supercapacitors are often soaked in liquid
      electrolyte, good stability is needed. The authors explain that
      the network exhibits excellent stability due to the cross-linking
      of sulfonic groups in PSSH, which stops it from dissolving. From a
      practical standpoint, Xie says “This is an added advantage in
      device fabrication and operation, as in current supercapacitors,
      insulating binders have to be added to ensure the adhesion of
      electrode materials on the collector surfaces.”<br>
      <br>
      In this work, Xie and coworkers demonstrate that
      hydrophilizer-based ionic conductivity can greatly improve
      supercapacitor performance. In the future, they plan to “combine
      the ionic-conduction network to other electronic-conduction
      materials, and thus to develop composite materials for better
      device performance”.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A simple and economical approach to the preparation of
      superhydrophilic and water-capturing surfaces is reported. In this
      method, a common polymer aqueous blend is drop-cast onto a
      substrate, and the natural drying of the aqueous drop allows for
      the formation of phase-segregated nanosegregants between the bulk
      film and substrate surface. The nanosegregant is then exposed by
      dissolving the bulk film using water. The nanosegregant is stable,
      water-insoluble and optically transparent, and exhibits
      superhydrophilicity with a minimum contact angle below 10°. It
      also displays strong water-attracting ability. The mechanism of
      superwettability and water-capturing behavior is discussed in
      terms of the self-organization and functional group of the
      nanosegregant.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Typically, superhydrophilic surfaces have a water contact angle of
      less than 25[deg.] and water-capturing surfaces retain water as a
      uniform film having a thickness of millimeters.<br>
      <br>
      Many techniques have been developed to prepare superhydrophilic
      surfaces. See I.P. Parkin et. al., J. Mater. Chem. 2005, 15, 1689.
      For example, superhydrophilic surfaces are obtained by
      UV-irradiation of oxide semiconductor films such as Ti02 and ZnO.
      In this method, the superhydrophilicity, induced by
      photon-generated short-lived charges, gradually disappears without
      continuous UV illumination. See, e.g., X.M. Li et. al., Chem. Soc.
      Rev. 2007, 36, 1350, A. Lafuma et. al., Nat. Mater. 2003, 2, 457.<br>
      <br>
      A method has been devised for producing water-capturing surfaces
      that mimic the water harvesting wing surfaces of the Namib Desert
      beetle. See L. Zhai, Nano Lett. 2006, 6, 1213. This method is not
      suitable for large-scale production as it involves layer- by-layer
      multi-step patterning and deposition of both hydrophilic and
      hydrophobic components.<br>
      <br>
      Of note, superhydrophilic surfaces do not necessarily possess
      water-capturing capacity.<br>
      <br>
      Surfaces that are superhydrophilic and/or water-capturing have
      many industrial applications. Superhydrophilicity prevents fog
      formation, as condensed water spreads across a superhydrophilic
      surface. On the other hand, water-capturing surfaces can be used
      to draw water from dew in arid areas. A surface that possesses
      both superhydrophilicity and water-capturing capacity is ideal for
      use in a solid-state supercapacitor.<br>
      There is a need for cost-efficient methods of preparing enduring
      superhydrophilic and/or water-capturing surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      One aspect of this invention relates to a coated substrate having
      a surface that possesses both superhydrophilicity and
      water-capturing capacity. The coated substrate includes (i) a
      coating having a water insoluble polymer and a water soluble
      polymer, and (ii) a substrate covered by the coating.<br>
      <br>
      The two polymers, due to their different water affinity, form a
      nanosegregant having a thickness of 1-10 nm (e.g., 1-5 ran). More
      specifically, in the nanosegregant, the water insoluble polymer
      adheres onto the substrate and the water soluble polymer adheres
      onto the adhered water insoluble polymer. The nanosegregant has a
      water contact angle of 0-25[deg.] (e.g., 5-20[deg.]) and a
      capability to capture a water film having a thickness of 0.1-10 mm
      (e.g., 0.5-3.0 mm).<br>
      <br>
      The coating can further include, on top of the nanosegregant, a
      conductive non- nanosegregant film containing the same water
      soluble polymer and the same water insoluble polymer. Unlike the
      nanosegregant, this film, having a thickness of<br>
      <br>
      0.4-500 [mu][pi][iota], does not exhibit either
      superhydrophilicity or water-capturing capacity.<br>
      <br>
      The water soluble polymer contains identical or different
      hydrophilic and hygroscopic groups, e.g., carboxylic groups or
      sulfonic groups. An example of such a water soluble polymer is
      poly(styrene sulfonic acid) ("PSSH"). The water insoluble polymer,
      on the other hand, contains identical or different electrically
      conductive groups, e.g., aniline groups or thiophene groups. An
      example of such a water insoluble polymer is
      poly(3,4-ethelynedioxythiophene ("PEDT"). In one embodiment of the
      above- described coated substrate, PSSH and PEDT are used as a
      water soluble polymer and a water insoluble polymer, respectively,
      at a ratio of 2.5 : 1 to 20: 1 by weight (e.g., 6:1 by weight).<br>
      <br>
      Another aspect of this invention relates to a method of preparing
      the coated substrate depicted above. The method includes at least
      three steps: (i) providing an aqueous dispersion containing a
      water soluble polymer and a water insoluble polymer, (ii) applying
      the aqueous dispersion onto a surface of a substrate, and (iii)
      allowing the applied aqueous dispersion to dry to form on the
      surface of the substrate a nanosegregant, due to different water
      affinity of the two polymers. The excess applied polymers form a
      non-nanosegregant film, which is mentioned above. The method can
      further include, after step (iii), a step of removing the excess
      applied polymers to expose the nanosegregant.<br>
      <br>
      The coated substrate of this invention can be a positive electrode
      having a coating that includes both a nanosegregant and a
      non-nanosegregant film. This coated positive electrode can be used
      to make a solid-state supercapacitor. Such a solid-state
      supercapacitor includes (i) a positive electrode, (ii) a negative
      electrode, (iii) a nanosegregant, as described above, formed from
      an aqueous dispersion that contains an ionizable water soluble
      polymer and a water insoluble polymer due to their different water
      affinity of the two polymers, and (iv) a conductive film, as
      described above, containing the water soluble polymer and the
      water insoluble polymer. The nanosegregant is disposed between the
      positive electrode and the film, and the film is disposed between
      the negative electrode and the nanosegregant.<br>

      in the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Within the scope of this invention is a substrate having a coating
      made of a water soluble polymer and a water insoluble polymer. The
      coating includes a nanosegregant (with a thickness of 1-10 nm)
      containing the two polymers and, optionally a conductive
      non-nanosegregant film (with a thickness of 0.4-500
      [mu][iota][eta]) also containing the two polymers. The
      nanosegregant unexpectedly exhibits both superior
      superhydrophilicity and superior water-capturing capacity. The
      substrate can be a metal, an insulator, a semiconductor, a
      polymer, or a combination thereof. Examples of a metal include
      gold, silver, copper, iron, aluminum, lead and alloy (i.e.,
      stainless steel). Examples of an insulator include Si02, wood,
      porcelain, clay, alumina, silicon, and paper. Examples of a
      semiconductor include silicon, silicon carbide, gallium arsenide,
      silicon nitride, indium sulfide, zinc oxide, and diamond. Examples
      of a polymer include P VC, Teflon, polycarbonate, polyester,
      nitrocellulose, polyethersulfone, and polypropylene.<br>
      <br>
      To prepare a coated substrate of this invention, one applies onto
      the surface of a substrate an aqueous dispersion including a water
      soluble polymer and a water insoluble polymer. An artisan can mix
      the two polymers in water to obtain this dispersion, or purchase
      it from a commercial supplier.<br>
      <br>
      The term "water soluble polymer" refers to a polymer that contains
      identical or different hydrophilic and hygroscopic groups (e.g.,
      carboxylic groups and sulfonic groups), which make the polymer
      soluble or dispersible in water. Each of the groups can exist in
      the form of an acid (e.g., carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid), or
      in the form of a salt (e.g., carboxylate and sulfonate). Note that
      when the water soluble polymer is used to prepare a supercapacitor
      as discussed below, such a polymer must also be ionizable.<br>
      <br>
      The term "water insoluble polymer" refers to a conductive polymer
      that does not contain ionizable or strong polar groups, but
      contains identical or different electrically conducting groups
      (e.g., aniline groups and thiophene groups). Each of the groups
      can exist in the form of an unsubstituted group (e.g., aniline and
      thiophene), or in the form of a substituted group (e.g.
      substituted aniline and substituted thiophene).<br>
      It is critical that the two polymers can be well dispersed in
      water as nanoparticles (e.g., a diameter of 20-120 nm) so as to
      form an aqueous dispersion.<br>
      <br>
      The ratio between the water soluble polymer and the water
      insoluble polymer varies. It affects the properties of the
      nanosegregant and the film prepared from the two polymers, e.g.,
      superhydrophilicity, conductivity, and water-capturing capacity.<br>
      <br>
      One can apply the aqueous dispersion onto a substrate by
      drop-casting. Other methods include, but are not limited to, spin
      coating, spray coating, roller coating, flow coating, roll-to-roll
      coating, and electrospinning. Once an aqueous dispersion has been
      applied onto a substrate, it is left to dry. During this process,
      the water soluble polymer and the water insoluble polymer undergo
      phase segregation. As a result, a nanosegregant forms on top of
      the substrate and a conductive non-nanosegregant film forms on top
      of the nanosegregant. The conductive film can be washed away to
      expose the nanosegregant. Due to the intermolecular
      reorganization, the nanosegregant adheres strongly to the
      substrate surface.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that nanosegregants formed on various substrates
      remain on the substrates surfaces even after boiling in water or
      other common solvents.<br>
      <br>
      The phase segregation is driven by the different water affinity of
      the water soluble polymer and the water insoluble polymer. The two
      polymers segregate themselves on the substrate surface to reach a
      thermodynamic equilibrium in order to minimize the Gibbs free
      energy of the whole system.<br>
      <br>
      The nanosegregant thus formed, not soluble in water, has a
      thickness of 1-10 nm. Optionally, it also has a nanometer length
      and a nanometer width, e.g., 20-150 nm. These dimensions can be
      measured by an atomic force microscope (AFM). See X. N. Xie, et.
      al., Macromol. Chem. Phys, 2010, 211, 2187. It exhibits two
      unexpected superior features. First, it transforms various
      substrate surfaces into superhydrophilic surfaces with water
      contact angles of 0-25[deg.], regardless of the water wettability
      of the substrate surfaces. Second, the nanosegregant demonstrates
      a strong water-capturing capacity. With a thickness of nanometers,
      it is capable of capturing a water film having a thickness of
      0.1-10 mm.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the density of the hydrophilic and hygroscopic
      groups contained in the water soluble polymer are in the order of
      10 groups/cm in the segregant and the density of the electrically
      conducting groups contained in the water insoluble polymer are
      also in the same order.<br>
      <br>
      When PEDT is used as a water insoluble polymer and PSSH is used as
      a water soluble polymer, the nanosegregant thus formed contains
      both PEDT and PSSH. The sulfonic acid groups contained in PSSH are
      distributed on the nanosegregant surface and provide the strong
      hydration force for water-capturing after the above-described
      phase segregation. Previous calculations have shown that one
      sulfonic acid group can capture five water molecules to form a
      [Eta]502&lt;+&gt; hydronium nanocluster. See H. M. Li, et. al.,
      Polymer International, 2001, 50, 421-428. The hydronium
      nanocluster is much more stable than bulk water because the
      hydrogen bond length of the nanocluster is significantly shorter
      than that of bulk water. The [Eta]502&lt;+&gt; nanocluster forms
      the first hydration shell surrounding the sulfonic acid group and
      provides the base for further water uptake through proton
      derealization and hydrogen bonding. Thus, a nanometer- thick
      nanosegregant can transform various substrate surfaces into
      superhydrophilic surfaces, and it can also capture a water film
      having a thickness of millimeters.<br>
      <br>
      The conductive non-nanosegregant film contains the same water
      soluble polymer and the same water insoluble polymer in the
      nanosegregant. As the two polymers in the film do not undergo
      phase segregation, the film, does not exhibit either
      superhydrophilicity or water-capturing capacity. The thickness of
      the film (0.4-500 [mu][pi][iota]) can be determined based on
      measurement by an AFM or surface profiler.<br>
      When the above-described coated substrate is used as a positive
      electrode having a coating that includes both the nanosegregant
      and the conductive non-nanosegregant film, a negative electrode is
      attached to the film to form a supercapacitor with an
      electrode/film/electrode sandwich configuration.<br>
      <br>
      Both the nanosegregant and the water absorbed in the film
      contribute to the supercapacitive behavior, which can be explained
      by a nanosegregant-mediated charge storage mechanism. The
      nanosegregant is superhydrophilic as it is negatively charged,
      attributable to the ionizable and hygroscopic groups (e.g.,
      S03&lt;"&gt; sulfonic groups) in the water soluble polymer. The
      nanosegregant containing immobile hygroscopic groups is surrounded
      by mobile H&lt;+&gt; ions (due to electrostatic interactions), and
      also by hydration water (due to its superhydrophilicity). When the
      positive electrode is charged, H&lt;+&gt; cations are forced to
      move through the film towards the negative electrode. At the same
      time, the absorbed hydration water is dissociated into H&lt;+&gt;
      and OH&lt;"&gt; ions by the charging voltage, which move in
      opposite directions. When the supercapacitor is fully charged,
      H&lt;+&gt; cations accumulate near the negative electrode, while
      OH&lt;"&gt; (and S03&lt;"&gt;) anions are located in the vicinity
      of the positive electrode. This ionic relocation generates an
      internal field that holds the positive charge near the negative
      electrode and the negative charge near the positive electrode,
      thus achieving charge storage in the supercapacitor. According to
      this mechanism, the negatively charged nanosegregant (e.g.
      OH&lt;"&gt; and SO3&lt;"&gt;) on the positive electrode dictates
      that the electrode is positively charged. This is in agreement
      with the observation that the supercapacitive behavior only takes
      place on the positive electrode and the influence that small
      H&lt;+&gt; cations can move through the film due to their high
      mobility in the film. In contrast, negatively charging the
      electrode coated with a nanosegregant requires the movement of
      OH&lt;"&gt; anions through a thick film, which is not favorable
      due to the poor mobility of OH&lt;"&gt; anions in the film. The
      film, which does not contain a nanosegregant, just acts as a
      typical conducting media for its electronic and ionic
      conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      The high Cs (e.g., about 65 mF/cm&lt;2&gt; as shown in an example
      below) of the supercapacitor is related to the large surface area
      of the nanosegregant. The nominal surface area of the
      nanosegregant is estimated to be at least &gt;10 m /g. The density
      of the hygroscopic groups on the nanosegregant surface is also
      very high, which explains the strong hydration force for the
      water-capturing behavior. The strong electrostatic field of the
      nanosegregant generates a large counter-ion (H&lt;+&gt;) zone and
      attracts thick shells of hydration water. Therefore, the
      supercapacitive characteristic of the supercapacitor is
      attributable to the formation of an electric double layer around
      the nanosegregant under a charging voltage. The absorbed hydration
      water provides mobile H&lt;+&gt; cations for charge storage. Thus,
      the supercapacitive behavior disappears when the absorbed water is
      removed.<br>
      <br>
      A supercapacitor of the invention can further include in the
      nanosegregant and the film, a carbon-based nanomaterial that has a
      high surface area (e.g., 2000 m&lt;2&gt;/g) and a high electric
      conductivity (e.g., 10&lt;4&gt; S/cm). Graphene is an example of
      such a nanomaterial. Specifically, graphene powders or flakes can
      be added into an aqueous dispersion of a water soluble polymer and
      a water insoluble polymer. This aqueous dispersion is then used to
      form a supercapacitor by the same method described above. The
      supercapacitor thus prepared exhibits even higher energy storage
      capacity.<br>
      <br>
      The coated substrate provides numerous other industrial
      applications, e.g., anti- fogging mirrors and traffic signs,
      self-cleaning devices and water-harvesting devices.<br>
      <br>
      Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in
      the art can, based on the disclosure herein, utilize the present
      invention to its fullest extent. The following specific examples
      are, therefore, to be construed as merely descriptive, and not
      limitative of the remainder of the disclosure in any way
      whatsoever. All publications cited herein are incorporated by

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Preparation of superhydrophilic
        and water-capturing surfaces</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      A PEDT:PSSH polymer blend (CLEVIOS(TM) P, Heraeus Clevios Gmbh,
      Germany, w/w 1:6), as an aqueous dispersion, was used to prepare
      superhydrophilic and water-capturing surfaces. In the dispersion,
      the two polymers form nanoparticles, each having a diameter of
      20-110 nm. It had a combined polymer concentration of 1.0-3.0 % by
      weight.<br>
      <br>
      As illustrated in Fig. 1, a PEDT:PSSH aqueous drop was first cast
      onto the surface of a Si substrate and left to dry at ambient
      temperature for about 3 hrs. During the drying process, the two
      polymers formed a PEDT:PSSH nanosegregant on the substrate and a
      PEDT:PSSH film on top of the nanosegregant. As discussed below,
      AFM methodology confirmed the formation of both the nanosegregant
      and the film. The film was then removed by gently rinsing it with
      deionized water to expose the nanosegregant.<br>
      <br>
      The water contact angles of the Si surface, both bare and
      nanosegregant-covered, were measured in a manner similar to that
      described in S. H. Lu, et. al., Langmuir 2009, 25, 12806. The
      water capturing capacity of the nanosegregant was estimated by
      measuring the average thickness of the absorbed water film. The
      average thickness was obtained by measuring both the weight of the
      water captured film and the size of the water captured film. The
      measurements show that the nanosegregant was superhydrophilic
      (exhibiting a minimum water contact angle of 8[deg.]) and
      possessed a great water-capturing capacity (retaining a water film
      as thick as 3.0 millimeters.<br>
      <br>
      When the drying process was expedited, i.e., fast drying in vacuum
      for several minutes, no nanosegregant could be observed after the
      film was rinsed off. This indicated the importance of the drying
      process during the nanosegregant formation. When the PEDT:PSSH
      aqueous drop was left to dry at ambient temperature for more than
      3 hrs, e.g., 4.0 or 5.0 hrs, the superhydrophilicity and
      water-capturing capacity of the nanosegregant remained about the
      same. AFM images revealed that the nanosegregant had a round or
      elongated shape. The average width and height of the nanosegregant
      were -70.0 and -2.4 ran,<br>
      respectively. The maximum length of the elongated nanosegregant
      was -165 nm. The thickness of the film was determined to be -1.2
      [mu][pi][iota] based on measurement of the height difference
      between the film-covered Si surface and the nanosegregant-covered
      Si surface. The film had the same width and the length as the
      segregant. See X. N. Xie, et. al., Macromol. Chem. Phys, 2010,
      211, 2187.<br>
      <br>
      The film was removed by water in seconds. The nanosegregant, on
      the other hand, remained on the Si substrate after immersion in
      water for half a year.<br>
      <br>
      S 2p core level spectra were compiled from the film and
      nanosegregant by using photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) in the
      manner described in X. N. Xie, et. al., ACS NANO 2009, 3, 2722; X.
      N. Xie, et. zX.Macromol. Chem. Phys, 2010, 211, 2187.<br>
      <br>
      For the film, there were two peaks located at 163.5 and 167.8 eV.
      The peak at 163.5 eV arose from the thiophene ring of PEDT, and
      the peak at 167.8 eV originated from the sulfonic group
      (R-S(=0)2-OH) of PSSH. See G. Grecaynski, et. al., Thin Solid
      Films, 1999, 354, 129-135.<br>
      <br>
      The S 2p core level spectrum of the nanosegregant also consisted
      of two peaks corresponding to the PEDT and PSSH. However, the two
      peaks of the nanosegregant were systematically shifted towards
      higher binding energy (by -1.4 eV). This was attributable to the
      charging of the nanosegregant, as such a shift was also observed
      in the PES measurement for other core levels including C I s and
      Si 2p. The charging phenomenon indicated that the nanosegregant
      was more insulating than the film.<br>
      <br>
      Other than Si, four additional substrates, i.e., Au, glass, mica
      and plastic transparency, were also used to prepare a
      nanosegregant on their surfaces by the same method described
      above. The water contact angles of bare and nanosegregant-covered
      substrate surfaces were measured and the measurement results are
      listed in Table 1 below.<br>
      <br>
      Table 1 below shows that, regardless of water wettability of the
      surfaces of these substrates, the nanosegregant transformed all of
      them into superhydrophilic surfaces with water contact angles in
      the range of 7[deg.] to 20[deg.]. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Table 1</span><br>

      <br>
      Due to its superhydrophilicity, the nanosegregant showed an
      anti-fogging effect. A glass substrate with a nanosegregant on its
      surface was placed above a water boiler that generated water
      steam. When the water steam condensed onto the glass substrate, it
      formed a uniform water layer on the nanosegregant-covered surface
      and droplets on the bare glass surface. In other words, the
      nanosegregant-covered surface remained transparent and the bare
      glass surface was foggy.<br>
      <br>
      Other than the superhydrophilic feature, the water-capturing
      capacity of the PEDT:PSSH nanosegregant was also tested. A Si
      substrate with a nanosegregant on its surface was dipped into
      water for a few seconds. A water film, having a thickness of
      millimeters, was formed exactly where the nanosegregant was
      located, indicating that the nanosegregant retained a great amount
      of water. Similar water-capturing behavior was also observed for a
      nanosegregant on a Au surface. The shape of the nanosegregant was
      purposely made irregular. After being dipped into water, the
      nanosegregant captured a water film that had exactly the irregular
      shape. The other three coated substrates listed in Table 1 also
      exhibited such water-capturing capacity.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Preparation of solid-state
        supercapacitors</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 2, an aqueous drop of PEDT:PSSH blend described
      above was cast onto a Au substrate and left to dry at ambient
      temperature. As a result, a PEDT:PSSH film and a PEDT:PSSH
      nanosegregant were formed, with the nanosegregant disposed between
      the Au substrate and the film. AFM images showed that the
      nanosegregant had an elongated structure, packed densely on the Au
      surface and having a length of 50-120 nm and a height of 1.5-3.8
      ran. In contrast, surface profiling indicated that the film was
      much thicker, i.e., having a height of about 100 [mu][iota][eta].
      Finally, Ag glue was pasted on the film, thus forming a
      Ag/PEDT:PSSH/Au supercapacitor.<br>
      <br>
      Current-voltage (IV) curves were compiled from this supercapacitor
      by scanning the Au electrode voltage in the form of 0-&gt;8-&gt;0
      V at different scan rates. The IV curves were characterized by
      strong hysteresis between the forward (0-&gt;8 V) and reverse
      (8-&gt;0 V) currents. The hysteresis depended on the voltage scan
      rate v; namely, the higher the v, the greater the hysteresis. This
      behavior is indicative of charge storage in the supercapacitor. By
      integrating the area Aj, (the active area of Ag electrode was ~1.0
      mm&lt;2&gt;) of the hysteresis and employing the equation Q =
      ^&lt;h&gt;/v, the typical amount of charges Q stored in the
      supercapacitor was estimated to be about 14.4 mC.<br>
      <br>
      The supercapacitor was also charged by a constant current of 2.0
      mA for 20 minutes with a charging voltage of 5.0 - 8.0 V applied
      to the Au electrode. It was then discharged to measure the power
      and the energy delivered by the supercapacitor. The fully charged
      supercapacitor showed a typical open-circuit voltage Voc of 1.85 -
      2.2 V. Under a discharge current of 1.0 mA, the voltage of the
      supercapacitor dropped from 2.0 V to 0.02 V within 1.2 s. The
      discharge time increased to 1335 s when a much smaller discharge
      current of 0.001 mA was used. The discharge current was also
      detected with a constant resistance R connected with the
      supercapacitor. When R was 5.0 I D, the initial current was -0.4
      mA and the discharge completed in 9.2 s. When R was 1000
      i-[Omega], the initial current was in the order of several
      [mu][Alpha] and the discharge took -2000 s.<br>
      <br>
      A Ragone plot was constructed for the supercapacitor using data
      obtained in the constant current and resistance methods described
      above. The Ragone plot shows that the energy density was quite
      stable (-3.5 W.h/g) during the entire discharge period. The
      maximum power density was 1 1000 W/kg, comparable to that reported
      for electrolyte solution-based supercapacitors. See, e.g., B. E.
      Conway, Electrochemical<br>
      Supercapacitor s: Scientific Fundamentals and Technological
      Applications, Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publisher, New York, 1999; A.
      S. Arico, et. al, Nature Mater. 2005, 4, 366. Table 2 below lists
      the capacitance C, output energy E, specific capacitance Cm
      specific capacitance Cs, and energy density Em of the
      supercapacitor using the data obtained by the above-described
      constant current and resistance methods. The Cm, Cs, and Em were
      obtained by normalizing the C and E to the PEDT:PSSH film mass of
      the supercapacitor. The mass of the film was determined by peeling
      off the film and weighing it with a microbalance. It was about 0.1
      mg for the film with an area of 1.0 mm . The m and Em were about
      6.5 F/g (or Cs was 65 mF/cm ) and 3.5 W.h/kg, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the fully charged supercapacitor was used as an
      energy source to power a digital thermometer (1.5 V, 0.06 mA) for
      durations of up to 60 s. As listed in Table 2, the energy
      delivered to the thermometer and the corresponding capacitances
      were in agreement with those obtained in constant current and
      constant resistance methods.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Table 2</span><br>
      <br>

      <br>
      This supercapacitive behavior was found to depend on presence of
      water in the film. Some water remained in the film as the
      supercapacitor was prepared and measurement were performed both at
      ambient temperature. When the supercapacitor was placed in a
      vacuum chamber to remove absorbed water, it was found to lose the
      charge storage function; namely, the IV curve of the film showed
      no hysteresis. Only a negligible open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.3
      V and a short circuit current (7SC) of 0.2 [mu][Alpha] were
      observed after fully charging the supercapacitor at 2.0 mA for 20
      minutes. These results were in sharp contrast to a V[infinity] of
      1.89 - 2.2 V and a 7SC of 0.8 - 3.0 mA as observed with the film
      having absorbed water.<br>
      <br>
      The supercapacitive behavior was found to also depend on presence
      of a nanosegregant. In a control experiment, a thin layer (~20 nm)
      of PEDT:PSSH was first formed on a Au surface by fast drying the
      layer in vacuum for several minutes. No nanosegregant was formed
      as the drying process was too short. This was confirmed by lack of
      the superhydrophilicity of the surface covered by the thin layer.
      An aqueous drop of PEDT:PSSH blend was then cast on top of the
      thin layer to form a control film. The control film also did not
      contain a nanosegregant. IV curve compiled from the control film
      showed almost no hysteresis due to absence of a nanosegregant.
      After charging the supercapacitor at 2.0 mA for 20 minutes, a Voc
      of 0.30 - 0.40 V and a Isc of 0.1 - 1.0 [mu][Alpha] were observed,
      indicating the lack of the supercapacitive behavior in the device
      containing the control layer and the control film.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to Au, transparent fluorinated tin oxide (FTO)
      conducting glass and graphite were also used as the positive
      electrodes to prepare supercapacitors. Table 3 below lists the
      capacitance C, output energy E, specific capacitance Cm, Cs and
      energy density Em of these three supercapacitors having different
      substrates.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Table 3</span><br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Table 3 shows that Cs was in a range of 65 - 68 mF/cm and Em was
      about 3.5 W.h/kg for all three different supercapacitors,
      indicating that they had consistent supercapacitor performance.<br>
      More supercapacitors were made by the following method. Graphene
      powders or flakes were added into the PEDT:PSSH aqueous
      dispersion, this aqueous dispersion was then used to form a
      supercapacitor by the same method described above. This new
      supercapacitor showed an increase of energy storage capacity by
      5-15%. <br>
