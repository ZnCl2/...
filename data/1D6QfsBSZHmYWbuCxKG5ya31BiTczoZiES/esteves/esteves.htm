      <div align="center"><b>Fog-catching fabric could improve water
          collection in deserts</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A novel and affordable fabric may improve the efficiency of water
      collection from fog, helping to provide freshwater in desert
      areas.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers from the Eindhoven University of Technology (EUT), in
      the Netherlands, and Hong Kong Polytechnic University, China,
      turned a&nbsp; cotton fabric into a water-collecting material by
      coating it with a polymer called PNIPAAm.<br>
      <br>
      The fabric switches between absorbing moisture directly from the
      air when it is foggy and cold, and releasing it as water at warmer
      temperatures, according to a paper to be published on 21 February
      in Advanced Materials.<br>
      <br>
      Every kilogramme of the sponge-like fabric can absorb around 3.4
      litres of water from the air.&nbsp; When the ambient temperature
      rises, the material's microstructure changes and the water is
      released. These processes are repeatable, raising hopes the fabric
      could act as an autonomous water-collecting device.<br>
      <br>
      The team hopes the material could be used to harvest water in dry
      coastal areas, such as the Namib Desert, in Namibia, where
      rainfall is scarce but ocean air currents frequently bring
      vapour-carrying fogs.<br>
      <br>
      The temperature range within which the fabric collects, and then
      releases, water is similar to the typical daytime highs and
      night-time lows seen in deserts.<br>

      <br>
      Researchers TU/e together with researchers at the Hong Kong
      Polytechnic University (PolyU), have developed a special treatment
      for cotton fabric that allows the cotton to absorb exceptional
      amounts of water from misty air: 340 % of its own weight. What
      makes this 'coated cotton' so interesting is that the cotton
      releases the collected water by itself, as it gets warmer. This
      property makes of the coated cotton materials a potential solution
      to provide water to the desert regions, for example for
      agricultural purposes. The results of this research will be
      published next month in the scientific journal Advanced Materials.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers applied a coating of PNIPAAm, a polymer, to the
      cotton fabric. At lower temperatures, this cotton has a
      sponge-like structure at microscopic level. Up to a temperature of
      34°C it is highly hydrophilic, in other words it absorbs water
      strongly. Through this property the cotton can absorb 340 % of its
      own weight of water from misty air – compared with only 18%
      without the PNIPAAm coating.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Totally pure water</b><br>
      <br>
      In contrast, once the temperature raises the material becomes
      hydrophobic or water-repellant, and above 34°C the structure of
      the PNIPAAm-coated cotton is completely closed. When these high
      temperatures are reached the cotton has released all the absorbed
      water, which is totally pure. The research shows that this cycle
      can be repeated many times.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Inspiration from Nature</b><br>
      <br>
      Beetles in desert areas can collect and drink water from fogs, by
      capturing water droplets on their bodies, which roll into their
      mouths. Similarly, some spiders capture humidity on their silk
      network. This was the inspiration for this new coated-cotton
      material, which collects and releases water from misty
      environments simply as the temperature changes throughout the day.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Low-cost material</b><br>
      <br>
      This property implies that the material may potentially be
      suitable for providing water in deserts or mountain regions, where
      the air is often misty at night. According to TU/e researcher dr.
      Catarina Esteves a further advantage is that the basic material –
      cotton fabric – is cheap and can be easily and locally produced.
      The polymer coating increases the cost slightly, but with the
      current conditions the amount required is only about 12%. In
      addition, the polymer used is not particularly costly.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Placed directly on the soil</b><br>
      <br>
      Fine-mesh ‘fog harvesting nets’ are already being used in some
      mountains and dry coastal areas, but these use a different
      principle: they collect water from misty air, by droplets that
      gradually form on the nets and fall to the ground or a suitable
      recipient. But this system depends on a strong air flow, wind. The
      coated cotton developed the research team can also work without
      wind. In addition, cotton fibers coated with this polymer can be
      laid directly where the water is needed, for example on cultivated
      soil. The researchers are also considering completely different
      applications such as camping tents that collect water at night, or
      sportswear that keeps perspiring athletes dry.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Further optimization</b><br>
      <br>
      The research was led by professor John Xin at PolyU and dr.
      Catarina Esteves at TU/e. They now intend to investigate further
      how they can optimize the quality of the new material. For example
      they hope to increase the amount of water absorbed by the
      coated-cotton. Moreover they also expect to be able to adjust the
      temperature at which the material changes from water-collecting to
      the water-releasing state, towards lower temperatures. <br>

      A sponge-like cotton fabric autonomously collects and releases
      water from fogs triggered by typical day-and-night temperature
      variations. The reversible switching between
      absorbing-superhydrophilic/releasing-superhydrophobic states
      results from structural changes of a temperature-responsive
      polymer grafted on the very rough fabric-surface. This material
      and concept presents a breakthrough into simple and versatile
      solutions for collection, uni-directional flow, and purification
      of water captured from the atmosphere.<br>

      The present invention relates to a water obtaining apparatus and,
      more specifically, to a water obtaining apparatus capable of
      easily obtaining water and being used even in a place difficult to
      receive electricity by collecting fog with a simple configuration
      and absorbing, storing, and discharging water. According to the
      present invention, the water obtaining apparatus includes: a
      support means; a fog collecting means connected to the support
      means to be supported and having a mesh body woven from cotton
      fabrics coated with a heating wire and poly-N- isopropyl
      acrylamide (PNIPAAm); a weight sensor measuring the weight of the
      fog collecting means; a temperature sensor measuring the
      temperature of the fog collecting means; a power supply means
      supplying power to the heating wire; a water collecting means
      arranged under the fog collecting means and collecting water
      discharged and falling from the fog collecting means; a filter
      means filtering the water collected in the water collecting means;
      a storing means storing the water passing through the filter
      means; and a control means changing the temperature of the fog
      collecting means by controlling the operation of the power supply
      means according to the weight of the fog collecting means measured
      by the weight sensor. The fog collecting means absorbs and stores
      the water of the fog passing through the fog collecting means, and
      power is supplied to the heating wire according to the control of
      the control means. If the temperature of the fog collecting means
      excesses the determined temperature, the fog collecting means
      discharges the stored water.<br>
