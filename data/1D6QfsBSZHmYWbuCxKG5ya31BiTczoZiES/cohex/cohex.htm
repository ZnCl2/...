      We have been exploring the potential of the simple Werner complex,
      cobalt hexammine "Cohex" for use as a broad spectrum antiviral and
      antibacterial therapeutic. Cohex is a coordinatively saturated
      complex of Co(III) surrounded by six ammonia ligands, is air and
      water stable and has low toxicity. We have have reported on its
      antiviral activity against both Sindbis virus (SV) and adenovirus.
      Due to its kinetic inertness, Cohex interacts principally with its
      environment via outer-sphere coordination and through simple
      electrostatic interaction. One consequence is that, unlike
      previously studied Co(III) systems, Cohex does not hydrolyze
      nucleotides, but does show potent inhibition of protein synthesis
      and dose-dependent antiviral properties. Our recent studies on the
      activity of Cohex against Ebola and HIV will be discussed.<br>

      Artificial endonucleases based on a parent cobalt(III) cyclen
      complex have been used as artificial endonucleases and have
      demonstrated activity for the hydrolysis of DNA and RNA.<br>
      <br>
      Using a cell-free translation system, we propose that cobalt
      cyclen complexes inhibit protein synthesis via a steric blockade
      and additionally through a<br>
      hydrolytic mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      We have shown that a related cobalt(III) complex, cobalt hexammine
      shows broad spectrum anti-viral activity against Sindbis, HIV-1
      and Zaire Ebola virus.<br>

          The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is developing a
          hexamminecobalt(III) (CoHex) based anti-viral compound for
          both clinical and first responder use.<br>
          <br>
          Initial results with a variety of viruses (± ssRNA, -dsRNA,
          dsDNA, enveloped, non-enveloped) indicate that this compound
          is a very broad spectrum anti-viral agent.<br>
          <br>
          Cohex is a small, stable, water-soluble, and inexpensive
          compound that can potentially be used as a therapeutic when
          there is no known drug therapy available, such as the case
          with H1N1 or an Ebola outbreak.<br>
          <br>
          It can also be used with existing anti-viral drugs to provide
          an additive effect, which can reduce cost, as can be the case
          of HIV treatment, where less of a more expensive drug, such as
          AZT, is advantageous.<br>
          <br>
          CoHex can also be used with current drugs against drug
          resistant strains, and may reduce the probability of drug
          resistance development.<br>
          <br>
          Initial small animal testing also shows that CoHex has a much
          lower cytotoxicity than FDA approved cis-Platin making it a
          good source as a therapeutic agent<br>

      <br>
      Hexaamminecobalt(III) chloride is the chemical compound with the
      formula [Co(NH3)6]Cl3. This coordination compound is considered an
      archetypal "Werner complex", named after the pioneer of
      coordination chemistry, Alfred Werner. This salt consists of
      [Co(NH3)6]3+ trications with three Cl- anions. The term "ammine"
      refers to ammonia in its metal complexes, and the prefix hex
      (Greek: six) indicates that there are six ammonias per cation.<br>
      <br>
      Originally this compound was described as a "luteo" (Latin:
      yellow) complex, but this name has been discarded as modern
      chemistry considers color less important than molecular structure.
      Other similar complexes also had color names, such as purpureo
      (Latin: purple) for a pentammine complex, and praseo (Greek:
      green) and violeo (Latin: violet) for two isomeric tetrammine
      complexes. [1]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Properties and structure</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [Co(NH3)6]3+ is diamagnetic, with a low-spin octahedral Co(III)
      center. The cation obeys the 18-electron rule and is considered to
      be a classic example of an exchange inert metal complex. As a
      manifestation of its inertness, [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 can be
      recrystallized unchanged from concentrated hydrochloric acid: the
      NH3 is so tightly bound to the Co(III) centers that it does not
      dissociate to allow its protonation. In contrast, labile metal
      ammine complexes, such as [Ni(NH3)6]Cl2, react rapidly with acids
      reflecting the lability of the Ni(II)-NH3 bonds. Upon heating,
      hexamminecobalt(III) begins to lose some of its ammine ligands,
      eventually producing a stronger oxidant.<br>
      <br>
      The chlorides in [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 can be exchanged with a variety of
      other anions such as nitrate, bromide, and iodide to afford the
      corresponding [Co(NH3)6]X3 derivative. Such salts are bright
      yellow and display varying degrees of water solubility.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Preparation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Since CoCl3 is not available, [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 is prepared from
      cobalt(II) chloride. The latter is treated with ammonia and
      ammonium chloride followed by oxidation. Oxidants include hydrogen
      peroxide or oxygen in the presence of charcoal catalyst.[2] This
      salt appears to have been first reported by Fremy.[3]<br>
      <br>
      The acetate salt can be prepared by aerobic oxidation of
      cobalt(II) acetate, ammonium acetate, and ammonia in methanol.[4]
      The acetate salt is highly water-soluble to the level of 1.9M (20
      °C), vs. 0.26M for the trichloride.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Uses</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [Co(NH3)6]3+ is a component of some structural biology methods
      (especially for DNA or RNA, where positive ions stabilize tertiary
      structure of the phosphate backbone), to help solve their
      structures by X-ray crystallography[5] or by nuclear magnetic
      resonance.[6] In the biological system, the counterions would more
      probably be Mg2+, but the heavy atoms of Cobalt (or sometimes
      Iridium, as in PDB file 2GIS) provide anomalous scattering to
      solve the phase problem and produce an electron-density map of the
      structure.[7]<br>

      ... This is a synthesis of a Coordination Compound.<br>
      <br>
      The synthesis is relatively easy, but the procedure also involves
      some very interesting science.<br>
      <br>
      The orange brown crystals of Co(NH3)6Cl3 shown above were grown
      slowly over a period of several days.&nbsp;&nbsp; This slow
      crystal growth created the large crystals.<br>
      <br>
      The material you will produce in this experiment will be an orange
      powder.&nbsp; Faster crystallization produces smaller crystals.
      Because the smaller crystals reflect more light, they appear to be
      lighter in color.<br>

      The present invention is generally directed to a method of
      prophylaxis against viral infection of a cell or subject or a
      method of treating a subject infected with a virus including
      administering an antiviral composition having the general
      Structure III, wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 is the
      same or different and includes an N-based ligand donor atom
      selected from the group consisting of ammonia, primary amine or
      secondary amine, or salt thereof. The present invention is also
      generally directed to a method of preparing an antiviral agent
      including providing a cobalt pentammine salt having a non-amine
      coordination site and mono-substituting the non-amine coordination
      site with a functional group incorporating a strong coordinator
      atom to cobalt to form a CoHex structure of Structure III, in
      which R1 incorporates the functional group having the strong
      coordinator atom coordinated with the cobalt atom, or a salt
      thereof. <br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention is generally directed to the use of a
      cobalt-amine based metal complex as an antiviral compound and a
      method for the preparation thereof.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Unlike antibiotics, there are significantly fewer antiviral
      drugs available. For example, for influenza there are only four:
      amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir. These
      four drugs can be divided into two categories, the adamantane
      derivatives (amantadine, rimantadine) and the neuraminidase
      inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), on the basis of their
      chemical properties and activities against influenza viruses.
      Adamantanes inhibit influenza propagation by blocking the viral M2
      protein ion channel, which prevents fusion of the virus and
      host-cell membranes and release of viral RNA into the cytoplasm of
      infected cells. Neuraminidase inhibitors, on the other hand, block
      the process of release of influenza virus from infected cells and,
      thereby, inhibit virus transmission to the neighboring cells.
      Another example of an antiviral drug is cidofovir, which has been
      found to be effective for treatment against cytomegalovirus, a
      virus that puts babies and people with HIV at risk. As with
      antibiotics, these antiviral agents exhibit problems with either
      resistance or toxicity, thereby limiting options for treatment of
      viral infection. Thus, there is some urgency in the development of
      new classes of antiviral drugs.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Certain metal-ion based antiviral complexes, such as the
      CTC series of cobalt(III)-based compounds has been shown to
      possess anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity. Structure I is a
      general formula for a CTC complex.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI2.0<br>
      <img alt="" src="003.jpg" height="209" width="388"><br>
      <br>
      [0000] As illustrated, CTC complexes are generally complex chelate
      structures, with interconnected cobalt coordination sites, leaving
      only axial coordination cites accessible for activity. In
      particular, these axial positions contain labile, or easily
      altered or broken down, axial ligands. For example, in CTC-96
      (also known as DOXOVIR, commercially available from Redox Pharm.
      Corp.), the most effective of the series, the labile axial ligands
      are 2-methyl-imidazoles.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Several CTC complexes have moderate in vitro and in vivo
      activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2,
      varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus.
      While the therapeutic activity of the CTC series has been known
      for several years, the mechanisms and the stage of the virus life
      cycle at which many of these compounds are effective are only
      beginning to be understood. For example, several CTC compounds can
      bind strongly to, and inhibit, Sp1, a DNA binding Zn finger
      protein, implying that the locus of inhibition may be through the
      group of metalloproteins that depend on the Zn finger motif. More
      recently, alternative mechanisms of inhibition have been
      postulated based on the inhibition of virus-mediated cell fusion.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Another type of Cobalt(III)-based compounds, based on the
      macrocyclic cyclen chelator, have been shown to bind very tightly
      to DNA/RNA, to hydrolyze the phosphodiester bonds of the
      nucleotides, and to inhibit protein translation in cell-free
      translation lysates. These cyclen complexes were of particular
      interest because they have only four out of six possible
      coordination sites on the Co(III) ion bound, leaving two
      cis-equatorial positions open for hydrolysis by the complex. For
      example, structure II below is a CoCyclen (or 1,4,7,10
      tetraazacyclododecane) molecule illustrating the two
      cis-equatorial positions open for hydrolysis by the complex.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI3.0<br>
      <img alt="" src="005.jpg" height="179" width="160"><br>
      <br>
      [0000] These cyclen complexes have been used for mechanistic
      studies of phosphodiester cleavage for both its efficient
      hydrolysis rates and kinetic inertness. That is, the complexes
      promote fast hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond but are
      kinetically "slow" in letting go of the hydrolyzed phosphate. The
      kinetic inertness of the Co(III) may be overcome (i.e., at
      elevated temperatures) but, for gene-silencing, this property has
      the added advantage of disruption of gene function, particularly
      disruption of protein translation. However, even potent hydrolytic
      catalysts take much longer to degrade nucleic acids than enzymes.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Other antiviral approaches include "antisense" technology
      which includes the synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN's) that
      bind to their complementary sequences on the mRNA, thereby
      blocking translation and inhibiting the production of the target
      protein. However, binding to the RNA is often not stable.
      Ribosomes can effectively compete with the oligonucleotides to
      bind with the RNA and consequently ensure continuous production of
      the target protein. The competitive edge of ribosomes is
      facilitated by their intrinsic "unwindase" activity, which allows
      them to read tangled messages, thus overcoming the effect of the
      antisense ODN.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] One solution to this "unwindase" activity relies on the
      ability of the antisense oligonucleotides to employ the enzyme
      RNase H. RNase H recognizes the DNA:RNA duplex and acts as a DNA
      dependent RNA hydrolysis catalyst. This degrades the RNA leaving
      the antisense ODN free to bind to other mRNA molecules, where the
      RNA hydrolysis cycle is repeated. However, RNase H itself poses a
      drawback because DNA:RNA duplexes as short as 5 base pairs may be
      cleaved by RNase H, leading to poor specificity of the antisense
      ODN's.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The lack of stability of the antisense ODN is also a
      drawback for anitsense technology. Conventional ODN's are prone to
      nuclease degradation inside the cell. Modified ODN's have been
      synthesized with different backbones to improve their stability
      but they either fail to recruit RNase H or exhibit non-sequence
      specificity. A classical example of synthesized stable antisense
      oligos is S-DNA (phosphorothioate) oligos that possess enhanced
      stability but exhibit low sequence specificity because of their
      weak binding. In addition, they promiscuously bind cellular
      protein molecules thus reducing their effectiveness as antisense
      agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Alternatively, peptide nucleic acids, in which the backbone
      consists of N-(2-aminoethyl)-glycine units linked by peptide bonds
      instead of a sugar and phosphate groups, have gained considerable
      importance by virtue of their being nuclease resistant and their
      ability to form stable complexes with nucleic acids. More
      recently, morpholino oligos have also been reported to afford high
      efficacy, specificity, and resistance to nucleases. However, they
      fail to recruit RNase H relying only on the binding specificity of
      the oligo.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Another approach includes RNA interference (RNAi)
      therapeutics. The major difficulties with RNAi technology lie with
      the lack of a reliable method of targeting and delivery of
      double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Issues, such as activation of the
      cells' antiviral defense mechanisms by long strand dsRNA,
      identification of a viable target region, and uncontrolled global
      changes in gene expression of cells when dsRNA strands are
      introduced into the cells, complicate any potential RNAi
      applications using short, interfering RNA (siRNA). While
      activation of cellular antiviral mechanisms may be desirable for
      antiviral applications, many viruses can shut down the defenses
      once entry is achieved. This natural viral defense strategy can be
      an impediment for siRNA therapeutics.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Since only short RNA strands can be used for siRNA,
      specificity of the target also can be an issue. Additionally,
      determining which sequences will work for siRNA still remains a
      problem to be solved for each target gene. Therefore, multiple
      regions are generally screened for each target. The screening
      requires using either synthetic RNAs, which are expensive, or with
      cloned DNA sequences, which is time consuming. Furthermore, the
      activity of the siRNA is not well understood at present-not all
      sequences will work and it is still a hit-and-miss proposition to
      find an active sequence.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>

      potent inhibition of virus replication without possessing free
      cobalt(III) coordination sites and without hydrolyzing
      oligonucleotides.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0032] Preferred embodiments of the present invention are now
      described with reference to the Figures. While specific details of
      the preferred embodiments are discussed, it should be understood
      that this is done for illustrative purposes only. A person skilled
      in the relevant art will recognize that other configurations and
      arrangements can be used without departing from the spirit and
      scope of the invention. It will also be apparent to a person
      skilled in the relevant art that this invention can also be
      employed in other applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The identification of new antiviral drugs is a challenging
      endeavor that is often built upon the balance between potent
      antiviral activity and minimal toxicity against host tissues. The
      present invention is generally directed to positively charged
      cobalt(III) complexes or salts thereof in octahedral ligand
      environments in which the ligands have strong coordinator atoms to
      Cobalt (i.e., CoHex complex), for example, where the ligand donor
      atoms are nitrogen (N)-based and/or interact either
      electrostatically or via hydrogen bonding, particularly ammonia,
      primary amines or secondary amines. The present invention may be
      demonstrated by the general formula of structure III, wherein R1
      through R6 is the same or different and includes N-based ligand
      donor atoms of ammonia, primary amines or secondary amines.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI5.0<br>
      <br>
      [0034] A few examples of CoHex complexes of the present invention
      are found below. Structure IV has all six positions coordinated
      with a nitrogen atom of ammonia ligands, i.e., Co(NH3)6. Structure
      V is similar to the CoCyclen of Structure II, however, with all
      six positions coordinated with a N atom and with ammonia ligands
      at the cis-equatorial positions, rather than having these
      positions open for hydrolysis. In Structure V, some of the N-based
      ligand donors are chelating ligands. The CoHex complexes of the
      present invention are highly positively charged compounds. For
      example, the net charge for the complex of Structure IV of
      3&lt;+&gt; at neutral pH. Preferably, they are prepared so as to
      be administered to a cell or subject as an acceptable salt.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI6.0<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Neither UV-VIS nor NMR shows evidence that Co(NH3)6 (i.e.,
      Structure IV) has an ability to exchange its ammonia groups with
      free histidine, even at a ratio 100:1 histidine to Co(NH3)6
      (results not shown). In other words, Co(NH3)6 does not appear to
      have labile ligands as does the conventional CTC complexes.
      Surprisingly though, the CoHex complexes of the present invention
      provide potent antiviral activity and relatively minimal toxicity
      against host tissues.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Preparation of Cobalt Complexes</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0036] While Co(NH3)6 is available commercially, the synthesis of
      its chlorine salt is fairly straight forward and using easily
      available reagents, for example using air to oxidize Co(II) to
      Co(III) according to the following formula.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      CoCl2+4NH4Cl+20NH3+O2-&gt;4[Co(NH3)6]Cl3+2H2O<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The example discussed below is for Co(NH3)6, but one
      skilled in the art can appreciate that other CoHex complexes of
      the present invention may be commercially available or synthesized
      using similar methods. To prepare this Co(NH3)6 example, or more
      specifically the chlorine salt thereof, 9.6 g of CoCl2.6H2O (0.06
      mol) and 6.4 g of NH4Cl (0.12 mol) were added to 40 mL of water in
      a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask with a side arm. The mixture was shaken
      until most of the salts are dissolved. Then, 1 g of fresh
      activated decolorizing charcoal and 20 mL concentrated ammonia
      were added. The flask was next connected to the aspirator or
      vacuum line and air drawn through the mixture until the red
      solution became yellowish brown (about 2-3 hours). The air inlet
      tube was of fairly large bore (about 10 mm) to prevent clogging
      with the precipitated Co(NH3)6&lt;3+&gt; salt.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The crystals and charcoal were filtered on a Büichner
      funnel and then a solution of 6 mL of concentrated hydrochloric
      acid (HCl) in 75 mL of water was added, the mixture heated on a
      hot plate to effect complete solution and filtered while hot.
      Crystallization of the CoHex chloride was done by cooling to
      0[deg.] C. and then slowly adding 15 mL of concentrated HCl. The
      crystals were washed with 60% and then with 95% ethanol and dried
      at 80-100[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cytotoxicity of CoHex</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0039] The cytotoxicity of Co(NH3)6 (Structure IV) was assessed by
      monitoring its ability to inhibit proliferation of baby hamster
      kidney (BHK) cells. BHK cells were cultured as exponentially
      growing subconfluent monolayers in complete growth medium,
      particularly Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)
      supplemented with 1% (v/v) antibiotic/antimycotic agent and 10%
      (v/v) heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown
      in either T25 or T75 flasks (Acton, Mass.) and incubated at
      37[deg.] C. under 5% CO2 atmosphere. A subculture was performed
      every 3-4 days.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The in vitro toxicity of Co(NH3)6 was determined using the
      CellTiter96(R) Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.). This
      quantitative calorimetric assay is based upon the enzymatic
      conversion of a tetrazolium salt substrate into a blue formazan
      product with a maximum absorbance at 570 nm. When incubated with
      this substrate, only viable cells convert the substrate into a
      blue product while nonviable cells do not. At the assay endpoint,
      the absorbance at 570 nm is directly proportional to the number of
      viable cells. To assess compound toxicity, BHK cells were seeded
      into the wells of a 96-well tissue culture microtiter plate
      (2*10&lt;4 &gt; cells/well) and cultured overnight at 37[deg.] C.
      in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The next day,
      Co(NH3)6 was diluted into tissue culture media (at final
      concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 mM) and incubated with the
      cells for 72 hrs. Triplicate wells were included for each
      concentration. To control for any contaminating absorbance due to
      the compounds, control wells containing no cells were included at
      each compound concentration ("no cell" wells). At the end of the
      72 hour culture period, 15 [mu]L of tetrazolium substrate was
      added to each well and the plate was returned to the incubator for
      4 hours to allow viable cells to convert the substrate into the
      formazan product. At the end of the 4 hour incubation period, 100
      [mu]L of solubilization solution was added to each well and the
      plate was subsequently incubated overnight to completely
      solubilize the contents of each well to a homogeneous color. The
      absorbance within each of the "no cell" wells was subtracted from
      the absorbance measured in the corresponding wells containing
      cells for each concentration of Co(NH3)6.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] FIG. 1 illustrates cell viability with increasing
      concentrations of Co(NH3)6 as compared with a conventional
      cis-Platin complex. cis-Platin is an FDA approved and commercially
      available medicament used as an anti-cancer agent. As shown in
      FIG. 1, Co(NH3)6 elicited a dose-dependent inhibition of cellular
      proliferation in which concentrations below 2.5 mM were only
      mildly toxic, with no significant toxicity at concentrations below
      0.3 mM. At concentrations above 2.5 mM, however, Co(NH3)6
      increasingly inhibited cellular proliferation. At 2.5 mM Co(NH3)6
      mediated about 80% cell viability, while achieving a maximum
      toxicity at 5 mM, the highest concentration tested. Also as
      demonstrated by FIG. 1, Co(NH3)6 is much less toxic than that of
      the FDA approved anti-cancer agent, cis-Platin. Lower toxicity
      makes a CoHex complex of the present invention a good source as a
      therapeutic.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] From FIG. 1, a 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) for
      CoHex, i.e., the concentration at which approximately 50% cell
      death occurs due to the administration of CoHex, was determined to
      be about 3.2 mM.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Activity of the CoHex Complex in Preventing Translation</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0043] The highly positively charged CoHex complex has built-in
      "stickiness" for highly-dense, negatively charged
      polyelectrolytes, such as DNA/RNA, such that it is tightly bound
      and does not easily release the nucleotides. This tight binding
      encourages blocking of translation and is similar in concept to
      "antisense" and RNAi technologies, but does not include some of
      the limitations inherent to the other approaches. In particular,
      because the CoHex complex itself binds strongly to nucleotides via
      static charges and hydrogen bonding, the tight binding overcomes
      any attempts by the cellular machinery to "unwind" the
      hybridization site.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] CoHex complexes have been previously studied for its
      ability to "condense" double stranded DNA into toroidal-like
      superstructures under low salt conditions. Nonetheless, without
      the hydrolytic open binding sites, the CoHex complex of the
      present invention is not a potent gene-silencing agent.
      Surprisingly, however, a hydrolytic function is not necessary for
      suppressing protein translation. The CoHex complex has the
      characteristic of binding very tightly to nucleotides and has
      demonstrated that such a tight ionic-binding property is
      sufficient for the inhibition of protein expression and thus
      antiviral activities.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] CoHex complexes, with their high positively charged
      density, are ideal for binding nucleotides and other
      polyelectrolytes. Although Cobalt(III) is not stable, by itself,
      in aqueous solutions, it can be stabilized by coordinating with
      donor atoms (preferably N-based ligands and chelators) that make
      strong contributions to the ligand field. While it is not clear
      why CoHex complexes are particularly useful for antiviral
      activity, the kinetic inertness, i.e., the inability of the close
      and tightly bound N atoms to easily disassociate from the Cobalt
      atom, may play a role in the particularly good antiviral activity
      of CoHex complexes. The role of close and tightly bound N atoms in
      CoHex's antiviral activity is particularly surprising, since it is
      the labile axial ligands, as in Structure II, and/or the
      availability of coordinating positions, as in Structure I, that is
      the apparent mode of antiviral activity of the conventional
      antiviral compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Suppressing protein translation is to inhibit the ability
      of either DNA or RNA to act as templates for transcription and
      translation, respectively. This is done by blocking the site of
      transcription/translation or by hydrolyzing the DNA/RNA template.
      The CoHex complex of the present invention does not hydrolyze
      nucleotides, but nonetheless demonstrates potent
      protein-inhibition and dose-dependent antiviral properties by
      blocking the site of transcription/translation. For purposes of
      gene knock-out or antiviral applications, it is not necessary to
      fully digest a DNA or RNA strand to deactivate an organism or a
      gene, as long as the critical sites remain permanently blocked.
      The strong affinity of the CoHex complexes of the present
      invention for the bases and the phosphate groups of the
      nucleotides, therefore, is a critical advantage to the general
      goal of deactivating genetic materials. As such, the CoHex complex
      of the present invention can function as non-specific gene
      silencing compounds or general antiviral applications.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0047] CoHex is capable of preventing translation of a messenger
      RNA (mRNA) in vitro. The ability Co(NH3)6 to inhibit translation
      of an mRNA luciferase template was assessed using the Rabbit
      Reticulocyte Lysate Translation System (Promega) according to the
      manufacturer's instructions. In the example discussed below,
      Co(NH3)6 in various concentrations was incubated with the mRNA for
      10 minutes before the addition of the mRNA template to the
      translation lysate. Translated luciferase protein was run on a 10%
      SDSPAGE gel for 45 min at 130 V and detected by Western blot on a
      PVDF membrane. Proteins were detected using a streptavidinalkaline
      phosphatase conjugate and Western Blue substrate according to the
      instructions in the Transcend Non-Radioactive Translation
      Detection System (Promega). The results are provided in FIG. 2. In
      FIG. 2, Lane 1 represents the incubation of 0.01 mM Co(NH3)6. Lane
      2 represents the incubation of 0.02 mM Co(NH3)6. Lane 3 represents
      the incubation of 0.05 mM Co(NH3)6. Lane 4 represents the
      incubation of 0.1 mM Co(NH3)6. Lane 5 represents the incubation of
      0.2 mM Co(NH3)6. Lane 6 is a positive control in which no Co(NH3)6
      is added. Lane 7 is a negative control in which no translation
      occurs. The lanes marked M are molecular weight marker lanes. As
      shown in FIG. 2, Co(NH3)6 blocks the RNA translation of luciferase
      protein at around concentrations of about 0.1 to 0.2 mM Co(NH3)6.
      Further, when compared to the same test using a conventional
      CoCyclen structure similar to Structure II rather than Co(NH3)6
      (data not provided), Co(NH3)6 inhibits protein translation about
      an order of magnitude (or about 10 times) more than the
      conventional CoCyclen structure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Antiviral Activity of the CoHex Complexes-Sindbis Virus</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> EXAMPLE 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b>[0048] In order to provide an example of antiviral
      activity, an in vitro model of a positive single stranded RNA
      (+ssRNA) virus, recombinant Sindbis virus (633-EGFP strain),
      infection was used. In this construct, the gene encoding enhanced
      green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is placed under the control of
      the identical promoter sequence found upstream of the viral
      structural proteins. Thus, upon replication, virally-infected
      cells produce soluble EGFP at levels that are proportional to the
      amount of virus. The virus seed stock was expanded on BHK cells
      under serum free conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] BHK cells were grown in T-150 tissue culture flasks (Acton,
      Mass.) until 90% confluent. Subsequently, the cells were washed
      twice with Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and infected
      with the recombinant Sindbis virus at a multiplicity of infection
      of five plaque forming units (pfu) per cell in 2 ml of virus
      production serum free medium (VP-SFM). After 1 hour of incubation
      at 37[deg.] C., with rocking of flasks every ten minutes, an
      additional 13 ml of VP-SFM media was added to bring the volume to
      15 ml. The next day, the cells were observed under light
      microscopy for signs of cytopathic effects and the presence of
      EGFP expression in infected cells was confirmed via fluorescence
      microscopy. Cellular debris was centrifuged and the supernatant
      was collected, aliquoted, and stored at -80[deg.] C. The majority
      of cells (greater than 70%) were positive for EGFP fluorescence.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Plaque Formation Assay</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> EXAMPLE 5</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0050] BHK cells (1*10&lt;5 &gt; cells) were seeded to the wells
      of a 24-well plate and grown overnight to a confluent monolayer.
      The next day, the cells were infected with the Sindbis virus at a
      ratio of about five plaque forming units (pfu) per cell in DMEM
      containing 2% FBS in the absence or the presence of increasing
      concentrations of Co(NH3)6. Infection was allowed to proceed for
      48 hours, at which time the supernatants were collected and stored
      at -80[deg.] C. until further use.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] For quantization of viral infection and replication, the
      sampled supernatants were thawed and serially diluted in 1% FBS
      DMEM. The diluted virus was used to infect monolayers of BHK cells
      grown in 6-well clustered plates. An aliquot (200 [mu]L) of virus
      from each selected dilution was incubated with BHK monolayers for
      1 hr at 37[deg.] C. with rocking of plates every 10 min to prevent
      drying of the monolayers. After 1 hr, the cells were overlayed
      with warm melted 1.2% Bacto agar in water mixed with an equal
      volume of 2* Minimum Essential Medium (MEM). The overlay agar was
      allowed to solidify at room temperature. Then the plates were
      incubated at 37[deg.] C. for 48 hr to allow plaque formation. Two
      days later, the cells were stained with neutral red. The exact
      staining solution per well was 0.5 ml of 2*MEM, 0.5 ml distilled
      water, 0.11 ml of 0.33% neutral red solution (i.e., 3.3 g/L in
      PBS). After 1-2 hrs of staining, the remaining staining solution
      was aspirated off and plaques were observed as clear foci within
      the cell monolayer. Via this method the amount of virus in the
      cells (i.e., plaque counts) can be ascertained by visual counting
      the number of plaque formation units (pfu) per well and
      multiplying by the dilution factor to determine the concentration
      of pfu in the original supernatant.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] FIG. 3A is a graph illustrating a dose dependent decrease
      in the plaque counts, in log pfu, for each increasing
      concentration of Co(NH3)6 used at 48 hours. A maximal inhibition
      of virus replication (i.e., about a 2.5 log decrease in pfu over
      the control with no Co(NH3)6) was seen at about 2.5 mM Co(NH3)6.
      FIG. 3A shows that Co(NH3)6 decreases plaque formation by almost 2
      to 3 log units. These same general trends were observed in at
      24-hours post infection (data not provided).<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In FIG. 3B, the degree of inhibition of plaque formation
      units measured in FIG. 3A is plotted as a function of Co(NH3)6
      concentration. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for
      Co(NH3)6 inhibition of Sindbis virus plaque formation was
      determined to be about 0.10+-0.04 mM.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The reductions in viral pfu of these magnitudes in vitro
      suggest in vivo significance. Previous studies have shown that a
      one log unit decrease in viral load in murine brains correlates
      with survival of infected animals. However, FIG. 3A does not take
      into consideration a significant decrease in cell proliferation
      due to increased cytotoxicity of Co(NH3)6 at concentrations over
      2.5 mM or even a slight decrease in cell proliferation at
      concentrations less than 2.5 mM, as illustrated in FIG. 1. Nor
      does FIG. 3A account for the decrease in cell proliferation due to
      the virus replication itself.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 6</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0055] Since the use of a CoHex complex of the present invention
      reduces but does not eliminate cell death due to the viral
      activity, the viability of BHK cells during Sindbis virus
      infection must also be determined as a function of the
      concentration of the CoHex complex. Because live cell counts will
      decrease with increasing CoHex complex due to cytotoxicity of the
      cells and virus replication, but increase due to the anti-viral
      protection of CoHex, the plaque counts may have decreased due to
      the fact that there were less live cells available to count. FIG.
      3C is a graph depicting the fraction of cell survival of BHK cells
      during Sindbis viral infection as a function of Co(NH3)6
      concentration at 48 hours after infection, in which cell survival
      is expressed as a "fraction cell survival" relative to
      Sindbis-infected cells that received no Co(NH3)6 treatments. The
      data of FIG. 3C was obtained using the CellTiter96 cell
      proliferation assay described above for the CoHex cytotoxicity
      data (i.e., with respect to FIG. 1) in which the cells were
      further infected with 5 plaque forming units per cell of Sindbis
      virus in DMEM containing 2% FBS in the absence or presence of
      various concentrations of Co(NH3)6, then assayed periodically.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Therefore, the fraction cell survival data of FIG. 3C was
      combined with the log pfu data of FIG. 3A to generate a ratio,
      Log(PFU) per percent cell survival, which although not a physical
      measure, is a general model of viruses in surviving cells. FIG. 4
      shows this ratio for the various concentrations of Co(NH3)6 used
      during the infection of the BHK cells. As illustrated in FIG. 4,
      there has been a significant decrease in viral infection for the
      surviving cells with an increase in concentration of Co(NH3)6.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cell Viability Study</b><b><br>

      [0057] Additional cell viability studies were done using a

      or visual inspection of cell viability, and plasma membrane
      integrity measurements using a Trypan blue dye-exclusion assay.
      Specifically, BHK cells were seeded to the wells of a 96-well
      plate (2*10&lt;4 &gt; cells/well) and cultured overnight in
      complete growth medium. The cells were then incubated with
      increasing concentrations of Co(NH3)6 for 6 hours prior to the
      addition of Sindbis virus (1*10&lt;5 &gt; pfu/well). After a 48
      hour infection period, the cells were resuspended and an aliquot
      of cells (10 [mu]L) was mixed with 90 [mu]L 0.2% trypan blue. The
      number of viable cells was determined by counting with a
      hemocytometer.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] FIG. 5 illustrates the results of this viable cell count as
      a function of Co(NH3)6 concentration. FIG. 5 reflects that after
      48 hours, cell membrane viability was only about 65% for the
      uninfected control and was down to 30% with virus but no Co(NH3)6
      added. The initial addition of 0.15 mM Co(NH3)6 further decreased
      viability, but higher concentrations revived cell viability up to
      80% at 1.2 mM, beyond which point, survivability dropped
      drastically. Due to the large scatter in the range of data values,
      there is not a significant difference between the 65% uninfected
      and the 80% 1.2 mM Co(NH3)6 values.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Also, a corresponding set of wells was identically prepared
      exclusively for observation using Trypan blue staining and light
      microscopy. FIGS. 6A-6H are light microscopy images showing cell
      morphology at various concentrations of Co(NH3)6 at 48 hours post
      infection following 6 hours of pretreatment with Co(NH3)6.
      Specifically, FIG. 6A shows healthy BHK cells in the absence of
      both Sindbis virus and Co(NH3)6. FIG. 6B shows BHK cells infected
      with the Sindbis virus but no Co(NH3)6. FIG. 6C shows BHK cells
      infected with the Sindbis virus and 0.15 mM Co(NH3)6. FIG. 6D
      shows BHK cells infected with the Sindbis virus and 0.3 mM
      Co(NH3)6. FIG. 6E shows BHK cells infected with the Sindbis virus
      and 0.6 mM Co(NH3)6. FIG. 6F shows BHK cells infected with the
      Sindbis virus and 1.2 mM Co(NH3)6. FIG. 6G shows BHK cells
      infected with the Sindbis virus and 2.5 mM Co(NH3)6. FIG. 6H shows
      BHK cells infected with the Sindbis virus and 5 mM Co(NH3)6.
      Viable cells remain attached to the tissue culture substrate and
      have an elongated, epithelial cell-like appearance. The arrows in
      FIGS. 6E-6G indicate examples of cells that have retained an
      elongated and adherent morphology. Non-viable cells are detached
      from the tissue culture substrate and are rounded. FIGS. 6B-6H
      illustrate that pronounced cell death is apparent in the presence
      of no Co(NH3)6 (FIG. 6B) and at lower concentrations of Co(NH3)6
      (FIGS. 6C and 6D). However, viable cells appeared more pronounced
      at concentrations of 0.6 and 1.2 mM Co(NH3)6 (FIGS. 6E and 6F,
      respectively), again decreasing at 2.5 mM and 5.0 mM Co(NH3)6
      (FIGS. 6G and 6H, respectively).<br>
      <br>
      [0060] It is interesting to note that both the light microscopy
      results (FIGS. 6A-6H) and the cell viability count (FIG. 5) show
      similar results, and both suggest indicated that 1.2 mM
      concentration of Co(NH3)6 provides an optimal protection against
      Sindbis virus.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Flow Cytometry-EGFP Reporter Assay</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> EXAMPLE 8</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0061] Additional studies of antiviral activity were quantified by
      flow cytometry, a more sensitive fluorometric assay, to further
      validate the plaque assay and cell viability results. In these
      assays, Sindbis virus replication was assessed by monitoring viral
      structural protein synthesis using a recombinant Sindbis virus
      construct. In this construct, the gene encoding enhanced green
      fluorescent protein (EGFP) was placed under the control of the
      same promoter sequence that drives transcription of viral
      structural proteins. Thus, upon Sindbis virus replication, virally
      infected cells produce intracellular EGFP at levels that are
      proportional to the level of viral structural proteins.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] BHK cells (1*10&lt;5&gt; ) were plated into the wells of
      24-well plates in 1 mL of complete media and incubated with
      increasing concentrations of Co(NH3)6 for 6 hours prior to
      infection with Sindbis virus at a multiplicity of infection (moi)
      of 5 pfu per cell. The infection was allowed to proceed for 48
      hours. In preparation for analysis by flow cytometry, cells from
      each well were removed and pelleted, washed with PBS, and
      resuspended in 500 [mu]L of PBS. One half of each sample was
      analyzed directly to determine the percentage of EGFP-positive
      cells (percent infected cells). The other half of each sample was
      incubated with 5 [mu]M propidium iodide for 1 minute prior to the
      determination of the percentage of non-viable cells. In all cases,
      analysis was performed on 1*10&lt;4 &gt; cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] BHK cells were pretreated with Co(NH3)6 for 6 hours prior
      to infection with Sindbis virus. After 48 hours post infection,
      both the percentage of Sindbis-infected cells (as evidenced by
      EGFP fluorescence) and the percentage of viable cells (as
      determined by the exclusion of propidium iodide (PI)) were
      determined as a function of Co(NH3)6 concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] FIGS. 7A and 7B are representative raw data plots of
      simultaneous analysis of SV protein synthesis during SV infection
      in the absence of Co(NH3)6 (FIG. 7A) and in the presence of 0.15
      mM Co(NH3)6 (FIG. 7B). The area marked 'R1' corresponds to
      EGFP-positive (SV-infected) cells. In the presence of Co(NH3)6, a
      distinct decrease in the percentage of EGFP-positive (i.e.,
      Sindbis-infected) cells was apparent. FIGS. 7C and 7D are
      representative flow cytometry data for the viability of
      SV-infected BHK cells in the absence of Co(NH3)6 (FIG. 7C) and in
      the presence of 0.15 mM Co(NH3)6 (FIG. 7D). The area marked 'R2'
      corresponds to propidium iodide (PI)-positive (non-viable) cells.
      In all cases, the x-axis corresponds to forward scatter (FSC).
      Quantification of cell viability revealed that during Sindbis
      infection, relative to infected cells that were not treated with
      Co(NH3)6 (FIG. 7C, region R2), cells treated with 0.15 mM Co(NH3)6
      exhibited a significantly lower percentage of PI-positive
      (non-viable) cells (FIG. 7D, region R2).<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Data demonstrating the dose-dependent nature of the
      Co(NH3)6-mediated increase in cell viability and inhibition of
      EGFP expression (i.e. inhibition of SV replication) as a function
      of Co(NH3)6 concentrations are presented in FIGS. 8A and 8B,
      respectively. In FIG. 8A, data are shown for the dose-dependent
      increase in cell viability in SV-infected cells (solid square) as
      a function of Co(NH3)6 concentrations relative to control,
      uninfected cells (open circle). In FIG. 8B, data are shown for the
      dose-dependent inhibition of EGFP expression in SV-infected cells
      (solid square) as a function of Co(NH3)6 concentration compared to
      control, uninfected cells (open circle). In FIGS. 8A and 8B,
      asterisks on the plots for the SV-infected cells correspond to
      levels of significance relative to the untreated infected control
      (as determined by a two-tailed Student's t-test): *(p&lt;0.05);
      **(p&lt;0.005); ***(p&lt;0.001). When the data in FIG. 8B were
      fitted to a standard dose-response curve using a one-site dose
      response logistic curve fit function, an IC50 of 0.13+-0.04 mM was
      determined. This value agrees well with the IC50 value determined
      by the plaque assay above, (0.10+-0.04 mM).<br>
      <br>
      [0066] A selectivity ratio may be calculated by comparing CC50 to
      IC50: CC50/IC50=about 25. This selectivity ratio measures the
      selectivity of Co(NH3)6 for Sindbis virus over BHK cells. Thus,
      Co(NH3)6 is about 25 times more selective for the virus than for
      the host cell.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Timing of CoHex Administration on Antiviral Activity</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0067] The flow cytometry assay discussed above was repeated with
      various concentrations of Co(NH3)6 administered as a pretreatment
      to Sindbis viral infection, as co-infection and at 2, 4 and 24
      hours post-infection. FIG. 9 is a chart illustrating survival
      rates for BHK cells for the various concentrations of Co(NH3)6 for
      each administration timing. As seen in FIG. 9, timing of the
      Co(NH3)6 treatment has very little effect on the survivability of
      the cells. As such, Co(NH3)6 is an effective antiviral agent
      whether administered prior to viral infection, contemporaneously
      with viral infection, or after viral infection. However, it
      appears that early treatment of Co(NH3)6 generally increases the
      percentage of cell survival.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Similarly, FIG. 10 is a chart illustrating the effects of
      timing of Co(NH3)6 administration on EGFP expression by Sindbis
      virus in BHK cells. The chart measures percent inhibition of EGFP
      expression as a function of Co(NH3)6 concentration. As
      illustrated, Co(NH3)6 is equally effective when administered as a
      pretreatment, co-infection or early post-treatment. Even at 24
      hours post-treatment, inhibition of EGFP expression is apparent,
      but not apparently as significantly as with earlier treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Antiviral Activity of the CoHex Complexes-Adenovirus</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> EXAMPLE 10</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0069] Another example of antiviral activity is an in vitro model
      of a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus infection, Adenovirus. As
      with Sindbis virus, effective antiviral activity was demonstrated
      with Adenovirus in A549 cells. The same flow cytometry procedure
      discussed above for Sindbis viral infection in BHK cells was used
      for Adenovirus viral infection in A549 cells. In other words, the
      cells were incubated with 5 [mu]M propidium iodide for 1 minute
      prior to the determination of the percentage of non-viable cells.
      The percentage of viable cells (as determined by the exclusion of
      propidium iodide (PI)) were determined as a function of Co(NH3)6
      concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] FIG. 11 illustrates survival rates for A549 cells
      uninfected and infected with Adenovirus assayed at 48 hours post
      infection with increasing concentration of Co(NH3)6 administered
      as a 6 hour pretreatment. As such, the presence of increasing
      concentration of Co(NH3)6, up to 0.0621 mM Co(NH3)6, demonstrates
      an increase in survival rate of A549 cells. A continued increase
      in survivability of A549 cells was found at a concentration of
      1.25 mM Co(NH3)6, despite the fact that the toxicity began to take
      effect at this high concentration as evidenced by the reduction in
      cell survivability of the uninfected cells at 1.25 mM Co(NH3)6
      (FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0071] As illustrated in FIGS. 12 and 13, the normalized
      survivability rates of Co(NH3)6 treated cells is similar whether
      the viral infections are Adenovirus infections or Sindbis virus
      infections. In both cases, Co(NH3)6 increases cell survivability
      of virally infected cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Sequence Specific CoHex System</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0072] To be specific for a particular protein, the CoHex system
      of the present invention will need to possess an ability to
      recognize sequences of nucleotides that code for that protein.
      Thus, a full sequence-recognizing, artificial nuclease can be
      thought to consist of a very tight binding component and a
      sequence-recognition nucleotides component.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Thus, the present invention also includes the addition of
      nucleotide-binding groups, such as hybridization-capable
      oligonucleotides, or other nucleotide-binding groups (e.g.,
      peptide nucleic acids, modified nucleic acids, triple-helix
      formers, or nucleotide-binding proteins and drugs), which are
      attached to functionalized CoHex complexes. The resulting system
      will be able to identify and bind to specific genes in order to
      silence transcription/translation of specific genes and/or attack
      specific viruses. Further, the attachment of a hybridizing
      oligonucleotide sequence to a CoHex complex may enable the CoHex
      complex to recognize nucleotide sequences that are longer than
      those typically used for RNAi applications. Therefore, CoHex
      complexes can potentially be used for both non-sequence-specific
      and sequence-specific inhibition of transcription/translation of
      viral proteins, as well as for other molecular biology tasks. The
      molecular recognition potential of the chemical nucleases,
      furthermore, means that these chemical nucleases can potentially
      be used in a novel approach to interdict whole classes of
      organisms (e.g., the filoviruses).<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 10</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0074] Although a variety of nucleotide-binding groups that
      identify and bind to a particular sequence may be added to the
      CoHex complexes of the present invention, one method for doing so
      includes starting with a copentammine salt, such as a
      chloropentammine cobalt(III) salt and mono-substituting the
      non-ammine coordination site with a functional group, which can
      bind to the CoHex complex. The functional group can subsequently
      be attached to an oligonucleotide or oligonucleotide sequence
      designed to identify and bind with specific viral DNA or RNA. For
      example, FIG. 14 illustrates a schematic method for synthesizing a
      CoHex complex having a mono-substituted functional group in the R1
      position of Structure III, as shown in Structure VI below. In
      Structure VI and in FIG. 14, "OTf" refers to a triflate anion,
      CF3SO3&lt;-&gt; .<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      EMI7.0<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Structure VI was synthesized by mono-substitution of
      chloropentamminecobalt(III) chloride with trifluoromethanesulfonic
      acid. The brick red product was collected, then treated with
      (N-[[epsilon]-Maleimidocaproic acid]hydrazide) in dry acetone and
      stirred for 24 hrs. The pink solution was washed with
      dichloromethane to remove any organic impurities and then dried to
      give Structure VI as a pink powder. Structure VI, for example, may
      be particularly useful to bond with oligonucleotide or
      oligonucleotide sequences having a thiol functional group.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] One skilled in the art can appreciate synthesis of CoHex
      complexes with a variety of functional groups as would be
      appropriate for a particular application either using the above
      described method or an appropriate alternative method. Such a
      CoHex complex would be capable of targeting and inhibiting
      translation of a particular sequence or virus.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002]In this specification where a document, act or item of
      knowledge is referred to or discussed, this reference or
      discussion is not an admission that the document, act or item of
      knowledge or any combination thereof was at the priority date,
      publicly available, known to the public, part of common general
      knowledge, or otherwise constitutes prior art under the applicable
      statutory provisions; or is known to be relevant to an attempt to
      solve any problem with which this specification is concerned.<br>
      <br>
      [0003]Hexaamminecobalt(III) chloride, also called Cohex, is
      notable for its ability to "condense" dsDNA into toroidal-like
      superstructures under low salt conditions. The metal ion itself,
      Co(III), with its high positive charge density, is an ideal
      candidate for binding nucleotides with their high negative charge
      density. Although Co(III) is not stable by itself in aqueous
      solutions, it is stabilized by coordinating with donor atoms
      (usually N) that make strong contributions to the ligand field.
      These coordinating donors could either be monodentate ligands,
      e.g., NH3, or polydentate chelators, such as cyclen, C8H20N4. The
      Co(III)-chelator complexes (e.g., cobalt cyclen complexes) have
      been used for mechanistic studies of phosphodiester cleavage for
      both its efficient hydrolysis rates and kinetic inertness, whereby
      the kinetic inertness of Co(III) ions results in the continued
      binding of the complex to the hydrolyzed phosphate.<br>
      <br>
      [0004]Due to the kinetic inertness of Co(III) ions, the Cohex
      complex sequesters the "inner-sphere" ammonia ligands from most
      exchange-reactions in solution; therefore, the usual interactions
      with solution molecules are by "outer-sphere" coordination via
      water bridges to the ammonia ligands and via the high
      charge-density of the Co(III) ion. These two characteristics play
      an important role in the strong attachment of Cohex to either DNA
      or RNA and in enabling Cohex to often substitute for hydrated
      Mg2+(aq) as a cofactor in nucleic acid biochemistry.<br>
      <br>
      [0005]For example, Cohex complexation with 5S RNA--where Cohex was
      used in place of Mg2+(aq)--was found to provide no significant
      shifts in the ?max of the absorption bands of Cohex, indicating
      that Cohex interaction with RNA was through outer-sphere
      complexation (and, of course, opposing charge attraction). It has
      also been reported that the number of binding sites on RNA was
      similar for Cohex and Mg2+(aq) and that the number was greater
      than expected for simple charge neutralization of the RNA
      backbone. These observations demonstrate that Cohex has a great
      propensity to bind to nucleotides at sites similar to Mg2+-binding
      sites and either inhibit or slow down the bio-functions of DNA and
      RNA.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]While certain aspects of conventional technologies have been
      discussed to facilitate disclosure of the invention, Applicants in

      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007]Cohex can inhibit viral transcription/translation via
      interference with viral RNA. This interference can be either via
      general "blockade" of the nucleotide strands from
      transcription/translation or may be made more overt by attaching
      hybridizing oligonucleotide strands to the Cohex. It has been
      shown that Cohex does not hydrolyze nucleotides, but does show
      potent antiviral properties against the Sindbis virus and
      Adenovirus, which are positive single-stranded (ss) RNA,
      double-strand (ds) DNA, respectively, and furthermore can act as
      an antibiotic. See US Patent Application Publication Nos.

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021]Hexaamminecobalt(III) (Cohex; FIG. 1), in particular the
      chloride salt thereof, is notable for its ability to "condense"
      dsDNA into toroidal-like superstructures under low salt
      conditions. The metal ion itself, Co(III), with its high
      (+)charge-density, is an ideal candidate for binding nucleotides
      with their high (-)charge density. Although Co(III) is not stable
      by itself in aqueous solutions, it is stabilized by coordinating
      with donor atoms (usually N) that make strong contributions to the
      ligand field. These coordinating donors could either be
      monodentate ligands, e.g., NH3, or polydentate chelators, such as
      cyclen, C8H20N4. The Co(III)-chelator complexes (e.g., cobalt
      cyclen complexes) have been used for mechanistic studies of
      phosphodiester cleavage for both its efficient hydrolysis rates
      and kinetic inertness, whereby the kinetic inertness of Co(III)
      ions results in the continued binding of the complex to the
      hydrolyzed phosphate.<br>
      <br>
      [0022]Due to the kinetic inertness of Co(III) ions, the Cohex
      complex sequesters the "inner-sphere" ammonia ligands from most
      exchange-reactions in solution; therefore, the usual interactions
      with solution molecules are by "outer-sphere" coordination via
      water bridges to the ammonia ligands and via the high
      charge-density of the Co(III) ion. These two characteristics play
      an important role in the strong attachment of Cohex to either DNA
      or RNA5 and in enabling Cohex to often substitute for hydrated
      Mg2+(aq) as a cofactor in nucleic acid biochemistry. For example,
      Cohex complexation with 5S RNA--where Cohex was used in place of
      Mg2+(aq)--was examined and found to provide no significant shifts
      in the ?max of the absorption bands of Cohex, indicating that
      Cohex interaction with RNA was through outer-sphere complexation
      (and, of course, opposing charge attraction). It has also been
      reported that the number of binding sites on RNA was similar for
      Cohex and Mg2+(aq) and that the number was greater than expected
      for simple charge neutralization of the RNA backbone. These
      observations demonstrate that Cohex has a great propensity to bind
      to nucleotides at sites similar to Mg2+-binding sites and either
      inhibit or slow down the bio-functions of DNA and RNA.<br>
      <br>
      [0023]Cohex may function as a new type of broad-spectrum antiviral
      compound. For example, Cohex can be effective in significantly
      enhancing cell viability and in depressing viral expression for
      Sindbis infected BHK cells, with similar significant effects of
      Cohex against adenovirus in A549. See US Patent Application
      Publication No. 2008/0182835. These observations point to the
      potential broad-spectrum nature of Cohex against viruses.<br>
      <br>
      [0024]As disclosed herein, Cohex demonstrates antiviral properties
      against two additional viruses. Ebola virus is a negative-strand,
      filamentous, enveloped microorganism that belongs to the
      filoviridae family of viruses. Cohex can decrease the viral
      expression levels in a dose-dependent manner, in a variety of
      cells infected with the Ebola virus. Cohex also demonstrates
      antiviral properties against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      HIV is a member of the genus lentivirus and belongs to the
      Retroviridae family. It has a single-strand (-)RNA genome, which
      is transcribed into a complementary DNA (cDNA) inside the host
      cell by an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. The sense cDNA serves as
      a template for DNA-dependent DNA polymerase to make an antisense
      DNA copy, which forms a double-stranded viral DNA (dsDNA). The
      dsDNA is then transported into the cell nucleus where it gets
      integrated into the host cell's genome. Virus replication is
      initiated when the integrated DNA provirus is transcribed into
      mRNA.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DEFINITIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0025]As used herein, the term "reduce an extent of the viral
      infection" with regard to a patient means that the ability of
      viruses to multiply within a patient is at least partially
      reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0026]As used herein, a "patient" can be a human or other mammal.<br>
      <br>
      Antiviral Uses of Cohex<br>
      <br>
      [0027]It is contemplated that Cohex could be used to treat a viral
      infection in a patient. In one embodiment, an effective amount of
      Cohex is administered to a patient suspected or known to have a
      viral infection. Optionally, a method of treatment includes
      identifying a patient who is or may be in need of such treatment.
      The patient can be a human or other mammal, including without
      limitation a primate, dog, cat, cow, pig, or horse.<br>
      <br>
      [0028]In an embodiment, Cohex is administered to a patient known
      or suspected of being infected by a virus. In a further
      embodiment, Cohex is administered prior to exposure of the patient
      to a virus. In another embodiment, Cohex is administered
      subsequent to exposure of the patent to a virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0029]The Cohex may be administered by any of various means
      including orally or nasally, or by suppository, or by injection
      including intravenous, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal
      injection, or combinations of any of these.<br>
      <br>
      [0030]In an embodiment, equipment for injection of Cohex in a
      pharmaceutically acceptable comprises at least one of a container
      for the compound (such as a tube, bottle, or bag), injection
      tubing, or an injection needle.<br>
      <br>
      [0031]The quantity of Cohex effective to treat an infection can be
      ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art. Exemplary amounts
      of Cohex include 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or 20 mg/kg,
      or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0032]Viral infections that can be treated include, but are not
      limited to, those associated with human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV), human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV), Papillomavirus (e.g.,
      human papilloma virus), Polyomavirus (e.g., SV40, BK virus, DAR
      virus), orthopoxvirus (e.g., variola major virus (smallpox
      virus)), EBV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis virus,
      Rhabdovirus (e.g., Ebola virus), alphavirus (e.g., Sindbis virus),
      adenovirus, and/or cytomegalovirus (CMV). In preferred
      embodiments, the viral infection is by HIV or Ebola virus.<br>
      <br>
      Preparation of Co(III) Hexammine<br>
      <br>
      [0033]While Cohex is available commercially, its synthesis is
      fairly straight forward, using air to oxidize Co(II) to Co(III):<br>
      <br>
      CoCl2+4NH4Cl+20NH3+O2?4[Co(NH3)6]Cl.s- ub.3+2H2O<br>
      <br>
      [0034]9.6 g of CoCl2.6H2O (0.06 mol) and 6.4 g of NH4Cl (0.12 mol)
      were added to 40 ml of water in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask with a
      side arm and shaken until most of the salts are dissolved. Then 1
      g of fresh activated decolorizing charcoal and 20 ml concentrated
      ammonia were added. Next the flask was connected to the aspirator
      or vacuum line and air drawn through the mixture until the red
      solution becomes yellowish brown (usually 2-3 hours). The air
      inlet tube if preferably of fairly large bore (˜10 mm) to prevent
      clogging with the precipitated Co(NH3)63+ salt.<br>
      <br>
      [0035]The crystals and charcoal were filtered on a Buchner funnel
      and then a solution of 6 ml of concentrated HCl in 75 ml of water
      was added. The mixture was heated on a hot plate to effect
      complete solution and filtered while hot. The hexamminecobalt
      (III) chloride was crystallized by cooling to 0° C. and by slowly
      adding 15 ml of concentrated HCl. The crystals were filtered,
      washed with 60% and then with 95% ethanol, and dried at 80-100° C.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cohex Activity Against HIV</b><br>
      <br>
      [0036]There are two known strains of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2, of
      which HIV-1 is the more virulent virus and is the major cause of
      HIV infections. The first clinically useful drugs developed for
      HIV-1 were the nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors.
      AZT, or 3-azido-3-deoxythymidine, is a synthetic pyrimidine analog
      of thymidine was actually initially developed as an anticancer
      drug before it became known as a popular anti-HIV compound. The
      active form of AZT is its phosphorylated triphosphate (TP) form,
      which is a competitive inhibitor of RT because AZT-TP binds to the
      HIV-1 RT better than to the natural substrate deoxythymidine
      triphosphate (dTTP).<br>
      <br>
      [0037]Cohex was tested in a standard PBMC cell-based microtiter
      anti-HIV assay against one CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolate and one
      CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolate. For this study peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were pre-treated with the compound for
      two hours prior to infection.<br>
      <br>
      [0038]Cohex was stored at 4° C. as a powder and solubilized for
      tests. The solubilized stock was stored at -20° C. until the day
      of the assay. Stocks were thawed at room temperature on each day
      of assay setup and were used to generate working drug dilutions
      used in the assays. Working dilutions were made fresh for each
      experiment and were not stored for re-use in subsequent
      experiments performed on different days. Cohex was evaluated using
      a 3 mM (3,000 µM) high-test concentration with 8 additional serial
      half-log dilutions in the PBMC assays.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PBMC Assay</b><br>
      <br>
      [0039]Freshly prepared PBMCs were centrifuged and suspended in
      RPMI 1640 with 15% FBS, L-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin,
      non-essential amino acids (MEM/NEAA; Hyclone; catalog
      #SH30238.01), and 20 U/ml recombinant human IL-2. PBMCs were
      maintained in this medium at a concentration of 1-2×106 cells/ml,
      with twice-weekly medium changes until they were used in the assay
      protocol. Monocyte-derived-macrophages were depleted from the
      culture as the result of adherence to the tissue culture flask.<br>
      <br>
      [0040]For the standard PBMC assay, the cells were plated in the
      interior wells of a 96 well round bottom microplate at 50 µL/well
      (5×104 cells/well) in a standard format developed by the
      Infectious Disease Research department of Southern Research
      Institute. Each plate contains virus control wells (cells plus
      virus) and experimental wells (drug plus cells plus virus). Test
      drug dilutions were prepared at a 2× concentration in microtiter
      tubes and 100 µL of each concentration was placed in appropriate
      wells using the standard format. 50 µL of a predetermined dilution
      of virus stock was placed in each test well (final MOI ˜0.1).
      Separate plates were prepared identically without virus for drug
      cytotoxicity studies using an MTS assay system (described below;
      cytotoxicity plates also include compound control wells containing
      drug plus media without cells to control for colored compounds
      that affect the MTS assay). The PBMC cultures were maintained for
      seven days following infection at 37° C., 5% CO2. After this
      period, cell-free supernatant samples were collected for analysis
      of reverse transcriptase activity and compound cytotoxicity was
      measured by addition of MTS to the separate cytotoxicity plates
      for determination of cell viability. Wells were also examined
      microscopically and any abnormalities were noted.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Reverse Transcriptase Activity Assay</b><br>
      <br>
      [0041]A microtiter plate-based reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction
      was utilized (detailed in Buckheit et al., AIDS Research and Human
      Retroviruses 7:295-302, 1991). Tritiated thymidine triphosphate
      (3H-TTP, 80 Ci/mmol, NEN) was received in 1:1 dH2O:Ethanol at 1
      mCi/ml. Poly rA:oligo dT template:primer (Pharmacia) was prepared
      as a stock solution by combining 150 poly rA (20 mg/ml) with 0.5
      ml oligo dT (20 units/ml) and 5.35 ml sterile dH2O followed by
      aliquoting (1.0 ml) and storage at -20° C. The RT reaction buffer
      was prepared fresh on a daily basis and consisted of 125 µl 1.0 M
      EGTA, 125 µl dH2O, 125 µl 20% Triton X100, 50 µl 1.0 M Tris (pH
      7.4), 50 µl 1.0 M DTT, and 40 µl 1.0 M MgCl2. The final reaction
      mixture was prepared by combining 1 part 3H-TTP, 4 parts dH2O, 2.5
      parts poly rA:oligo dT stock and 2.5 parts reaction buffer. Ten
      microliters of this reaction mixture was placed in a round bottom
      microtiter plate and 15 µl of virus-containing supernatant was
      added and mixed. The plate was incubated at 37° C. for 60 minutes.
      Following incubation, the reaction volume was spotted onto DE81
      filter-mats (Wallac), washed 5 times for 5 minutes each in a 5%
      sodium phosphate buffer or 2×SSC (Life Technologies), 2 times for
      1 minute each in distilled water, 2 times for 1 minute each in 70%
      ethanol, and then dried. Incorporated radioactivity (counts per
      minute, CPM) was quantified using standard liquid scintillation
      techniques.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MTS Staining for PBMC Viability to Measure Cytotoxicity</b><br>
      <br>
      [0042]At assay termination, the uninfected assay plates were
      stained with the soluble tetrazolium-based dye MTS (CellTiter 96
      Reagent, Promega) to determine cell viability and quantify
      compound toxicity. MTS is metabolized by the mitochondria enzymes
      of metabolically active cells to yield a soluble formazan product,
      allowing the rapid quantitative analysis of cell viability and
      compound cytotoxicity. This reagent is a stable, single solution
      that does not require preparation before use. At termination of
      the assay, 20-25 µL of MTS reagent is added per well and the
      microtiter plates are then incubated for 4-6 hrs at 37° C., 5% CO2
      to assess cell viability. Adhesive plate sealers were used in
      place of the lids, the sealed plate was inverted several times to
      mix the soluble formazan product and the plate was read
      spectrophotometrically at 490/650 nm with a Molecular Devices
      SPECTRAmax plate reader.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Assay Results</b><br>
      <br>
      [0043]The PBMC data were normalized by dividing by either the
      average control, infected, untreated value for the infection
      measurements (% Viral Control) or by the control, uninfected,
      untreated value for the cytotoxicity measurements (% Cell
      Control). The normalized values were then analyzed for IC50 (50%
      inhibition of virus replication), CC50 (50% cytotoxicity), and
      therapeutic index values (TI=CC/IC; also referred to as Antiviral
      Index or AI).<br>
      <br>
      [0044]Cohex was tested for antiviral efficacy against one
      CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolate and one CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolate in
      PBMCs. For this study PBMCs were pre-treated with the compound for
      two hours prior to infection. FIG. 2 illustrates the decrease in
      RT activity (left), as a measure of viral activity, or uninfected
      cell viability (right) for HIV-1 NL4-3 isolate. FIG. 3 illustrates
      of the decrease in RT activity (left), as a measure of viral
      activity, or uninfected cell viability (right) for HIV-1 Ba-L
      isolate. In these Figures, "% VC" means "% Virus Control" and "%
      CC" means "% Cell Control." The results of the testing are
      summarized in Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0045]Cohex displayed definite antiviral activity against the
      virus isolates evaluated in this study, with an average IC50 value
      of 31.2 µM. There did not appear to be any difference in the
      activity of the compound based on co-receptor tropism, as the
      compound had approximately equal activity against both virus
      isolates tested. Cytotoxicity was observed with the compound at
      concentrations above 100 µM (TC50=833 µM), resulting in an average
      Therapeutic Index value of 26.7. These results can be summarized
      with IC50, CC50, and TI values given in Table 1.<br>

      <br>
      [0046]The results show that Cohex displays very similar activity
      against HIV as against other types of viruses, attesting to the
      very broad-spectrum nature of the compound. The antiviral activity
      is not as high as specific antiviral drugs, like AZT, but there
      are situations where the use of Cohex can be an advantage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cohex Activity Against Ebola Virus</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0047]Ebola was first discovered simultaneously in 1976 in Sudan
      and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire).
      While its origins are still not firmly established, Ebola likely
      came from the rain forests of Africa. The primary reservoir is
      likely not nonhuman primates, but rather that the virus is
      zoonotic, transmitted to humans from ongoing life cycles in
      animals or arthropods.<br>
      <br>
      [0048]Ebola viruses belong to the filoviridae family and has five
      known strains (subtypes): Bundibugyo, Cote d'Ivoire, Sudan, Zaire,
      and Reston. The Bundibugyo, Sudan, and Zaire strains have caused
      outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever among humans in Africa,
      killing up to 90% of those infected. Of the Ebola viruses, the
      Zaire strain is the most virulent and the Reston strain is the
      least virulent.<br>
      <br>
      [0049]The Ebola virus is transmitted via contact with bodily
      fluids of infected persons and can take from two days to three
      weeks for symptoms to appear. Disease symptoms start with fever,
      muscle aches and a cough before progressing to severe vomiting,
      diarrhea and rashes, along with kidney and liver problems. Death
      generally occurs as the result of either one or a combination of
      dehydration and/or massive bleeding from leaky blood vessels,
      kidney, and liver failure. The World Health Organization has
      documented 1,850 cases of Ebola (mostly in sub-Saharan Africa)
      since its discovery; only 600 (32 percent) of the victims
      survived. (32 percent) of the victims survived.<br>
      <br>
      [0050]As with all viruses of the order Mononegavirales,
      filoviruses, such as Ebola, contain a single-stranded,
      negative-sense RNA molecule as their genome. The genomes of
      filoviruses are quite large at approximately 19,000 bases in
      length and contain seven sequentially arranged genes. Filovirus
      proteins can be subdivided into two categories, those that form
      the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex and those that are associated
      with the envelope. The proteins associated with the nucleocapsid
      are involved in the transcription and replication of the genome,
      whereas the envelope-associated proteins primarily have a role
      either in assembly of the virion or in receptor binding and virus
      entry.<br>
      <br>
      [0051]There is no known cure for Ebola disease. Existing antiviral
      drugs do not work well against this virus and the best doctors can
      do is attempt to maintain the patient's body fluids and
      electrolytes levels under intensive care; while bleeding problems
      may require transfusions of platelets and/or fresh blood.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Activity of Cohex Against Ebola Virus in Cell Culture</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0052]For EC50 assays, cells were plated onto 96-well plates and
      incubated at 37° C. for 24 hours before adding compound followed
      by cell infection with Zaire Ebola GFP virus, a virus strain that
      contains a GFP gene. The infected cells were allowed to grow for
      an additional 48 hours before reading on a Molecular Devices
      spectrofluorometer (X=485 nm, M=515 nm). Controls were done for
      +virus/-compound and -virus/-compound. The -virus/+compound
      controls were part of the CC50 tests. Dosage of Cohex ranged from
      2.5 µM to 5 mM and were done in triplicates. Error bars for the
      figures are for standard error (SE) of the mean.<br>
      <br>
      [0053]The results for A549 cells and HepG2 cells are shown in the
      left and right panels of FIG. 4, respectively. It is seen that
      there appears to be a general flat response from 2.5 µM until
      around 0.1 mM Cohex, at which point, <b>GFP expression</b> drops
      until there is <b>nearly 100% suppression (-100%) of viral
        expression at concentrations above 1 mM Cohex.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0054]The results for 293T and VeroE6 cells are shown in the left
      and right panels of FIG. 5, respectively. For 293T cells, there is
      a monotonic decrease in GFP expression with increasing Cohex, even
      starting as low as 2.5 µM Cohex. For VeroE6 cells, there is also a
      decrease in GFP expression with increasing Cohex, but the slope of
      the decrease is much less pronounced than for the other cells.
      There is another difference in the cells of FIG. 4 from FIG. 5.
      The values for concentrations below 0.1 mM in FIG. 1 fluctuate
      between 0 and +50 enhancement of GFP with large error bars,
      whereas the values in FIG. 2, for the same region of
      concentration, all show (except for 1 point) negative GFP
      enhancement (i.e., in the suppression of expression region). Thus,
      the behavior of Cohex for the different cell types exhibit
      differential amounts of viral expression decrease, but they all
      show decreasing levels of GFP fluorescence with increasing Cohex
      concentrations, especially above 0.1 mM.<br>
      <br>
      [0055]In order to check whether the decreasing GFP levels were
      simply due to decreasing numbers of viable cells, in vitro
      cytotoxicity studies were performed for the same cell lines. That
      is, the same concentration ranges as used above were used in a
      CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay by Promega. This
      assay is based on quantitation of the ATP present in cells, which
      signals the presence of metabolically active cells, that is, a
      decrease in luminescence correlates with a decrease in the number
      of viable cells. The cells were plated out on 96-well plates, as
      above, and incubated at 37° C. for 24 hours before adding
      compound. The treated cells were then allowed to grow for an
      additional 48 hours before reading on the BMG Lumistar set on the
      ATP protocol.<br>
      <br>
      [0056]In addition to the luminescence assay, a flow cytometry
      assay was performed using propidium iodide as a "dead" stain for
      A549 cells. The flow cytometry assay protocol for A549 cell line
      is similar to protocols known in the art, and is as follows. The
      cells were grown until confluent and reseeded at 100,000
      cells/well in 1 ml in 24-well plates. The monolayers were allowed
      to form overnight at 37° C. under 5% CO2. The Cohex dilution
      series was added to appropriate wells and the plate incubated for
      48 hours at 37° C. under 5% CO2. The cells were then washed,
      pelleted, resuspended in buffer, and transferred to BD falcon
      tubes for flow analysis. A BD FACSort cytometer and BD CellQuest
      software was used to quantify cell viability. Prior to flow
      analysis, 10 µL of propidium iodide (PI) at 0.05 mg/ml was added
      to each tube to stain dead cells. Analysis was performed on 1×104
      events/well.<br>
      <br>
      [0057]FIG. 6 shows the result of the cytotoxicity assay for A549
      and HepG2 cells plotted on semi-log scale. There appears to be no
      toxic effect until about 0.1 mM, after which there is a decreasing
      % of viable cells. To better show the region from 2.5 µM to 0.1
      mM, FIG. 7 provides linear-scale plots to emphasize the
      concentration region that does affect cytotoxicity.<br>
      <br>
      [0058]Both 293T and VerE6 cells lines show much less cytotoxic
      susceptibility to Cohex, leveling off between 70 to 80% viability,
      even at 5 mM Cohex. There is a variety of reactions to Cohex by
      different cell lines, but none of the cells were 100% killed,
      whereas suppression of GFP expression tends to bottom out close to
      -100% (except for VeroE6).<br>
      <br>
      [0059]It is further notable that, in addition to variability
      between cell lines, different markers can also differ in their
      assessment of viability. As an example, the results of a flow
      cytometry measurement using propidium iodide (PI) as a marker for
      dead cells shown in FIG. 9. it can be seen that PI appears to
      measure a cell property (cell permeability) that is much less
      affected by Cohex than the luminescence study (ATP levels).<br>
      <br>
      [0060]The IC50 for Cohex for the different cell lines can be
      estimated from FIGS. 1 and 2. By using a log concentration scale,
      the data can be fitted to the classic sigmoidal shape using a
      non-linear least-squares fitting program, seen in FIG. 10. The
      IC50 for the fit was found to be 0.38 mM Cohex.<br>
      <br>
      [0061]The results with various cell types are shown in Table 2.<br>

      </b><b> Cohex Animal Study Against Ebola</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0062]An efficacy study was conducted in mice to test whether
      Cohex would have a therapeutic affect against Ebola virus
      exposure. Initially, to determine whether the mice would tolerate
      the Cohex, they received <b>intraperitoneal (IP) injections of
        Cohex once a day for 10 days at levels of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8
        mg/kg</b> in this study. The mice tolerated the compound very
      well, with no adverse reactions reported.<br>
      <br>
      [0063]To examine the efficacy of Cohex, mice were treated by IP
      injection with either phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or Cohex in
      PBS one hour before virus exposure, and further treated once a day
      for 9 more days. In comparing the results of the mice treated with
      PBS versus those treated with 8 mg/kg of Cohex, it was found to be
      statistically very likely (p=0.01 in a chi-squared test) that the
      8 mg/kg treatment improved survival rates over the PBS treatment
      in mice infected with Ebola virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0064]The general advantages of a broad-spectrum drug, such as
      Cohex, are its low-cost, stability, and, of course, ability to
      attack multiple microorganisms. When there is no treatment
      available, as in the case of Ebola virus, Cohex could be the only
      source of treatment. For viruses, such as HIV, where drugs with
      very high TI already exist, Cohex can be used in a combination
      drug therapy regime. There are several advantages to doing this:
      (1) as a broad-spectrum compound, Cohex can fight against
      opportunistic infections by other microorganisms; (2) Cohex may
      have a synergistic effect on existing anti-HIV drugs; (3) Cohex
      can significantly decrease the cost of anti-HIV treatment; (4)
      Cohex can slow the development of viral drug-resistance by
      presenting a very different mechanism that must be overcome.<br>

              <br>
              <br>
              October 1, 2014<br>
              Who this is for: Managers of 9-1-1 Public Safety Answering
              Points (PSAPs), EMS Agencies, EMS systems, law enforcement
              agencies and fire service agencies as well as individual
              emergency medical services providers (including emergency
              medical technicians (EMTs), paramedics, and medical first
              responders, such as law enforcement and fire service

              What this is for: Guidance for handling inquiries and
              responding to patients with suspected Ebola symptoms, and
              for keeping workers safe.<br>
              <br>
              How to use: Managers should use this information to
              understand and explain to staff how to respond and stay
              safe. Individual providers can use this information to

              <br>
              Key Points:<br>
              <br>
              The likelihood of contracting Ebola is extremely low
              unless a person has direct unprotected contact with the
              blood or body fluids (like urine, saliva, feces, vomit,
              sweat, and semen) of a person who is sick with Ebola or
              direct handling of bats or nonhuman primates from areas
              with Ebola outbreaks.<br>
              <br>
              When risk of Ebola is elevated in their community, it is
              important for PSAPs to question callers about:<br>
              <br>
              Residence in, or travel to, a country where an Ebola
              outbreak is occurring;<br>
              Signs and symptoms of Ebola (such as fever, vomiting,
              diarrhea); and<br>
              Other risk factors, like having touched someone who is
              sick with Ebola.<br>
              <br>
              PSAPS should tell EMS personnel this information before
              they get to the location so they can put on the correct
              personal protective equipment (PPE) (described below).<br>
              <br>
              EMS staff should check for symptoms and risk factors for
              Ebola. Staff should notify the receiving healthcare
              facility in advance when they are bringing a patient with
              suspected Ebola, so that proper infection control
              precautions can be taken.<br>
              <br>
              The guidance provided in this document is based on current
              knowledge of Ebola. Updates will be posted as needed on
              the CDC Ebola webpage. The information contained in this
              document is intended to complement existing guidance for
              healthcare personnel, Infection Prevention and Control
              Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients with Known or
              Suspected Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever in U.S. Hospitals<br>
              <br>
              Background<br>
              <br>
              The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa has increased
              the possibility of patients with Ebola traveling from the
              affected countries to the United States.<br>
              <br>
              1 The likelihood of contracting Ebola is extremely low
              unless a person has direct unprotected contact with the
              body fluids of a person (like urine, saliva, feces, vomit,
              sweat, and semen) of a person who is sick with Ebola or
              direct handling of bats or nonhuman primates from areas
              with Ebola outbreaks.<br>
              <br>
              2 Initial signs and symptoms of Ebola include sudden
              fever, chills, and muscle aches, with diarrhea, nausea,
              vomiting, and abdominal pain occurring after about 5 days.
              Other symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath,
              headache, or confusion, may also develop. Symptoms may
              become increasingly severe and may include jaundice
              (yellow skin), severe weight loss, mental confusion,
              bleeding inside and outside the body, shock, and
              multi-organ failure.<br>
              <br>
              3 Ebola is an often-fatal disease and care is needed when
              coming in direct contact with a recent traveler from a
              country with an Ebola outbreak who has symptoms of Ebola.
              The initial signs and symptoms of Ebola are similar to
              many other more common diseases found in West Africa (such
              as malaria and typhoid). Ebola should be considered in
              anyone with fever who has traveled to, or lived in, an
              area where Ebola is present. 2 The incubation period for
              Ebola, from exposure to when signs or symptoms appear,
              ranges from 2 to 21 days (most commonly 8-10 days). Any
              Ebola patient with signs or symptoms should be considered
              infectious. Ebola patients without symptoms are not
              contagious. The prevention of Ebola includes actions to
              avoid exposure to blood or body fluids of infected
              patients through contact with skin, mucous membranes of
              the eyes, nose, or mouth, or injuries with contaminated
              needles or other sharp objects.<br>
              <br>
              Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, along with
              other emergency services staff, have a vital role in
              responding to requests for help, triaging patients, and
              providing emergency treatment to patients. Unlike patient
              care in the controlled environment of a hospital or other
              fixed medical facility, EMS patient care before getting to
              a hospital is provided in an uncontrolled environment.
              This setting is often confined to a very small space and
              frequently requires rapid medical decision-making and
              interventions with limited information. EMS personnel are
              frequently unable to determine the patient history before
              having to administer emergency care.<br>
              <br>
              Coordination among 9-1-1 Public Safety Answering Points
              (PSAPs), the EMS system, healthcare facilities, and the
              public health system is important when responding to
              patients with suspected Ebola. Each 9-1-1 and EMS system
              should include an EMS medical director to provide
              appropriate medical supervision.<br>

              Recommendations for 9-1-1 Public Safety Answering Points
              (PSAPs)<br>
              <br>
              State and local EMS authorities may authorize PSAPs and
              other emergency call centers to use modified caller
              queries about Ebola when they consider the risk of Ebola
              to be elevated in their community (e.g., in the event that
              patients with confirmed Ebola are identified in the area).
              This will be decided from information provided by local,
              state, and federal public health authorities, including
              the city or county health department(s), state health
              department(s), and CDC.<br>
              <br>
              For modified caller queries:<br>
              <br>
              It will be important for PSAPs to question callers and
              determine if anyone at the incident possibly has Ebola.
              This should be communicated immediately to EMS personnel
              before arrival and to assign the appropriate EMS
              resources. PSAPs should review existing medical dispatch
              procedures and coordinate any changes with their EMS
              medical director and with their local public health
              department.<br>
              <br>
              PSAP call takers should consider screening callers for
              symptoms and risk factors of Ebola. Callers should be
              asked if they, or someone at the incident, have fever of
              greater than 38.6 degrees Celsius or 101.5 degrees
              Fahrenheit, and if they have additional symptoms such as
              severe headache, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea,
              abdominal pain, or unexplained bleeding.<br>
              <br>
              If PSAP call takers suspect a caller is reporting symptoms
              of Ebola, they should screen callers for risk factors
              within the past 3 weeks before onset of symptoms. Risk
              factors include:<br>
              <br>
              Contact with blood or body fluids of a patient known to
              have or suspected to have Ebola;<br>
              Residence in–or travel to–a country where an Ebola
              outbreak is occurring (a list of impacted countries can be
              accessed at the following link: <a

              <br>
              Direct handling of bats or nonhuman primates from
              disease-endemic areas.<br>
              If PSAP call takers have information alerting them to a
              person with possible Ebola, they should make sure any
              first responders and EMS personnel are made confidentially
              aware of the potential for Ebola before the responders
              arrive on scene.<br>
              <br>
              If responding at an airport or other port of entry to the
              United States, the PSAP should notify the CDC Quarantine
              Station for the port of entry. Contact information for CDC
              Quarantine Stations can be accessed at the following link:

              Recommendations for EMS and Medical First Responders,
              Including Firefighters and Law Enforcement Personnel<br>
              <br>
              For the purposes of this section, “EMS personnel” means
              pre-hospital EMS, law enforcement and fire service first
              responders. These EMS personnel practices should be based
              on the most up-to-date Ebola clinical recommendations and
              information from appropriate public health authorities and
              EMS medical direction.<br>
              <br>
              When state and local EMS authorities consider the threat
              to be elevated (based on information provided by local,
              state, and federal public health authorities, including
              the city or county health department(s), state health
              department(s), and the CDC), they may direct EMS personnel
              to modify their practices as described below.<br>

              appropriate for suspected cases of Ebola (described below)
              before entering the scene.<br>
              <br>
              Keep the patient separated from other persons as much as
              possible.<br>
              <br>
              Use caution when approaching a patient with Ebola. Illness
              can cause delirium, with erratic behavior that can place
              EMS personnel at risk of infection, e.g., flailing or
              staggering.<br>
              <br>
              During patient assessment and management, EMS personnel
              should consider the symptoms and risk factors of Ebola:<br>
              <br>
              All patients should be assessed for symptoms of Ebola
              (fever of greater than 38.6 degrees Celsius or 101.5
              degrees Fahrenheit, and additional symptoms such as severe
              headache, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain,
              or unexplained hemorrhage). If the patient has symptoms of
              Ebola, then ask the patient about risk factors within the
              past 3 weeks before the onset of symptoms, including:<br>
              <br>
              Contact with blood or body fluids of a patient known to
              have or suspected to have Ebola;<br>
              <br>
              Residence in—or travel to— a country where an Ebola
              outbreak is occurring (a list of impacted countries can be
              accessed at the following link: <a
                href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/guinea/index.html%29;"

              or<br>
              <br>
              Direct handling of bats or nonhuman primates from
              disease-endemic areas.<br>
              Based on the presence of symptoms and risk factors, put on
              or continue to wear appropriate PPE and follow the scene
              safety guidelines for suspected case of Ebola.<br>
              <br>
              If there are no risk factors, proceed with normal EMS
              care.<br>
              <br>
              EMS Transfer of Patient Care to a Healthcare Facility<br>
              <br>
              EMS personnel should notify the receiving healthcare
              facility when transporting a suspected Ebola patient, so
              that appropriate infection control precautions may be
              prepared prior to patient arrival. Any U.S. hospital that
              is following CDC's infection control recommendations and
              can isolate a patient in a private room‎ is capable of
              safely managing a patient with Ebola.<br>
              Interfacility Transport<br>
              <br>
              EMS personnel involved in the air or ground interfacility
              transfer of patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola
              should wear recommended PPE (described below).<br>
              Infection Control<br>
              <br>
              EMS personnel can safely manage a patient with suspected
              or confirmed Ebola by following recommended isolation and
              infection control procedures, including standard, contact,
              and droplet precautions. Particular attention should be
              paid to protecting mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and
              mouth from splashes of infectious material, or
              self-inoculation from soiled gloves. Early recognition and
              identification of patients with potential Ebola is
              critical. An EMS agency managing a suspected Ebola patient
              should follow these CDC recommendations:<br>
              <br>
              Limit activities, especially during transport, that can
              increase the risk of exposure to infectious material
              (e.g., airway management, cardiopulmonary resuscitation,
              use of needles).<br>
              <br>
              Limit the use of needles and other sharps as much as
              possible. All needles and sharps should be handled with
              extreme care and disposed in puncture-proof, sealed
              containers.<br>
              <br>
              Phlebotomy, procedures, and laboratory testing should be
              limited to the minimum necessary for essential diagnostic
              evaluation and medical care.<br>
              <br>
              Use of Personal protective equipment (PPE)<br>
              <br>
              Use of standard, contact, and droplet precautions is
              sufficient for most situations when treating a patient
              with a suspected case of Ebola as defined above. EMS
              personnel should wear:<br>
              <br>
              Gloves<br>
              Gown (fluid resistant or impermeable)<br>
              Eye protection (goggles or face shield that fully covers
              the front and sides of the face)<br>
              Facemask<br>
              <br>
              Additional PPE might be required in certain situations
              (e.g., large amounts of blood and body fluids present in
              the environment), including but not limited to double
              gloving, disposable shoe covers, and leg coverings.<br>
              <br>
              Pre-hospital resuscitation procedures such as endotracheal
              intubation, open suctioning of airways, and
              cardiopulmonary resuscitation frequently result in a large
              amount of body fluids, such as saliva and vomit.
              Performing these procedures in a less controlled
              environment (e.g., moving vehicle) increases risk of
              exposure for EMS personnel. If conducted, perform these
              procedures under safer circumstances (e.g., stopped
              vehicle, hospital destination).<br>
              <br>
              During pre-hospital resuscitation procedures (intubation,
              open suctioning of airways, cardiopulmonary
              resuscitation):<br>
              <br>
              In addition to recommended PPE, respiratory protection
              that is at least as protective as a NIOSH-certified
              fit-tested N95 filtering facepiece respirator or higher
              should be worn (instead of a facemask).<br>
              <br>
              Additional PPE must be considered for these situations due
              to the potential increased risk for contact with blood and
              body fluids including, but not limited to, double gloving,
              disposable shoe covers, and leg coverings.<br>
              <br>
              If blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions from a
              patient with suspected Ebola come into direct contact with
              the EMS provider’s skin or mucous membranes, then the EMS
              provider should immediately stop working. They should wash
              the affected skin surfaces with soap and water and report
              exposure to an occupational health provider or supervisor
              for follow-up.<br>
              Recommended PPE should be used by EMS personnel as
              follows:<br>
              <br>
              PPE should be worn upon entry into the scene and continued
              to be worn until personnel are no longer in contact with
              the patient.<br>
              <br>
              PPE should be carefully removed without contaminating
              one’s eyes, mucous membranes, or clothing with potentially
              infectious materials.<br>
              <br>
              PPE should be placed into a medical waste container at the
              hospital or double bagged and held in a secure location.<br>
              <br>
              Re-useable PPE should be cleaned and disinfected according
              to the manufacturer's reprocessing instructions and EMS
              agency policies.<br>
              <br>
              Instructions for putting on and removing PPE have been
              published online at <a

              <br>
              Hand hygiene should be performed immediately after removal
              of PPE.<br>
              <br>
              Environmental infection control<br>
              <br>
              Environmental cleaning and disinfection, and safe handling
              of potentially contaminated materials is essential to
              reduce the risk of contact with blood, saliva, feces, and
              other body fluids that can soil the patient care
              environment. EMS personnel should always practice standard
              environmental infection control procedures, including
              vehicle/equipment decontamination, hand hygiene, cough and
              respiratory hygiene, and proper use of U.S. Food and Drug
              Administration (FDA) cleared or authorized medical PPE.
              For additional information, see CDC’s Interim Guidance for
              Environmental Infection Control in Hospitals for Ebola
              Virus.<br>
              EMS personnel performing environmental cleaning and
              disinfection should:<br>
              <br>
              Wear recommended PPE (described above) and consider use of
              additional barriers (e.g., shoe and leg coverings) if
              needed.<br>
              <br>
              Wear face protection (facemask with goggles or face
              shield) when performing tasks such as liquid waste
              disposal that can generate splashes.<br>
              <br>
              Use an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant with a label
              claim for one of the non-enveloped viruses (e.g.,
              norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, poliovirus) to disinfect
              environmental surfaces. Disinfectant should be available
              in spray bottles or as commercially prepared wipes for use
              during transport.<br>
              <br>
              Spray and wipe clean any surface that becomes potentially
              contaminated during transport. These surfaces should be
              immediately sprayed and wiped clean (if using a
              commercially prepared disinfectant wipe) and the process
              repeated to limit environmental contamination.<br>
              <br>
              Cleaning EMS Transport Vehicles after Transporting a
              Patient with Suspected or Confirmed Ebola<br>
              <br>
              The following are general guidelines for cleaning or
              maintaining EMS transport vehicles and equipment after
              transporting a patient with suspected or confirmed Ebola:<br>
              <br>
              EMS personnel performing cleaning and disinfection should
              wear recommended PPE (described above) and consider use of
              additional barriers (e.g., rubber boots or shoe and leg
              coverings) if needed. Face protection (facemask with
              goggles or face shield) should be worn since tasks such as
              liquid waste disposal can generate splashes.<br>
              <br>
              Patient-care surfaces (including stretchers, railings,
              medical equipment control panels, and adjacent flooring,
              walls and work surfaces) are likely to become contaminated
              and should be cleaned and disinfected after transport.<br>
              <br>
              A blood spill or spill of other body fluid or substance
              (e.g., feces or vomit) should be managed through removal
              of bulk spill matter, cleaning the site, and then
              disinfecting the site. For large spills, a chemical
              disinfectant with sufficient potency is needed to overcome
              the tendency of proteins in blood and other body
              substances to neutralize the disinfectant’s active
              ingredient.<br>
              <br>
              An EPA-registered hospital disinfectant with label claims
              for viruses that share some technical similarities to
              Ebola (such as, norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus,
              poliovirus) and instructions for cleaning and
              decontaminating surfaces or objects soiled with blood or
              body fluids should be used according to those
              instructions. After the bulk waste is wiped up, the
              surface should be disinfected as described in the bullet
              above.<br>
              <br>
              Contaminated reusable patient care equipment should be
              placed in biohazard bags and labeled for cleaning and
              disinfection according to agency policies. Reusable
              equipment should be cleaned and disinfected according to
              manufacturer's instructions by trained personnel wearing
              correct PPE. Avoid contamination of reusable porous
              surfaces that cannot be made single use.<br>
              <br>
              Use only a mattress and pillow with plastic or other
              covering that fluids cannot get through. To reduce
              exposure among staff to potentially contaminated textiles
              (cloth products) while laundering, discard all linens,
              non-fluid-impermeable pillows or mattresses as
              appropriate.<br>
              <br>
              The Ebola virus is a Category A infectious substance
              regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT)
              Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR, 49 C.F.R., Parts
              171-180). Any item transported for disposal that is
              contaminated or suspected of being contaminated with a
              Category A infectious substance must be packaged and
              transported in accordance with the HMR. This includes
              medical equipment, sharps, linens, and used health care
              products (such as soiled absorbent pads or dressings,
              kidney-shaped emesis pans, portable toilets, used Personal
              Protection Equipment [e.g., gowns, masks, gloves, goggles,
              face shields, respirators, booties] or byproducts of
              cleaning) contaminated or suspected of being contaminated
              with a Category A infectious substance. <br>
              <br>
              4. Follow-up and/or reporting measures by EMS personnel
              after caring for a suspected or confirmed Ebola patient<br>
              <br>
              EMS personnel should be aware of the follow-up and/or
              reporting measures they should take after caring for a
              suspected or confirmed Ebola patient.<br>
              <br>
              EMS agencies should develop policies for monitoring and
              management of EMS personnel potentially exposed to Ebola.<br>
              <br>
              EMS agencies should develop sick leave policies for EMS
              personnel that are non-punitive, flexible and consistent
              with public health guidance<br>
              <br>
              Ensure that all EMS personnel, including staff who are not
              directly employed by the healthcare facility but provide
              essential daily services, are aware of the sick leave
              policies.<br>
              EMS personnel with exposure to blood, bodily fluids,
              secretions, or excretions from a patient with suspected or
              confirmed Ebola should immediately:<br>
              <br>
              Stop working and wash the affected skin surfaces with soap
              and water. Mucous membranes (e.g., conjunctiva) should be
              irrigated with a large amount of water or eyewash
              solution;<br>
              <br>
              Contact occupational health/supervisor for assessment and
              access to post-exposure management services; and Receive
              medical evaluation and follow-up care, including fever
              monitoring twice daily for 21 days, after the last known
              exposure. They may continue to work while receiving twice
              daily fever checks, based upon EMS agency policy and
              discussion with local, state, and federal public health
              authorities.<br>
              <br>
              EMS personnel who develop sudden onset of fever, intense
              weakness or muscle pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or any signs
              of hemorrhage after an unprotected exposure (i.e., not
              wearing recommended PPE at the time of patient contact or
              through direct contact to blood or body fluids) to a
              patient with suspected or confirmed Ebola should:<br>
              <br>
              Not report to work or immediately stop working and isolate
              themselves;<br>
              Notify their supervisor, who should notify local and state
              health departments;<br>
              Contact occupational health/supervisor for assessment and
              access to post-exposure management services; and<br>
              Comply with work exclusions until they are deemed no
              longer infectious to others.<br>
