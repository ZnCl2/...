      Inventor: AYRES WALDEMAR A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      My invention relates to equipment for underwater swimming,
      exploration, construction Work, salvage, geologic prospecting,
      marine scientific studies, under water sports, photography, etc.,
      such activities being carried on by the aid of breathing equipment
      being attached to the person (as scuba) or alternatively as
      breathing equipment carried in underwater vessels, or in
      non-propelled work regions or housing spaces such as diving bells,
      underwater domes, etc.; this invention particularly including
      methods and apparatus for rehabilitating exhaled air by extracting
      from it poisonous carbon dioxide and dissolving this in the
      surrounding water, plus extracting dis solved oxygen from the
      surrounding water and adding this oxygen to the exhaled air to
      replenish it, thus making it suitable for rebreathing, thereby
      providing results for people similar to the results prow'ded for
      fishes by their gills. Also, in one form of the invention, results
      will be superior to those fishes can attain, whereby when in
      polluted Water, or Water deficient in dissolved oxygen, operation
      of a mixing valve can provide fresh breathable gases from a
      separate supply, in any desired proportion to the gill-processed
      exhaled air, Where a fish which cannot do this would sufiocate and
      die.<br>
      <br>
      This is one of the oldest dreams of mankind. Throughout human
      history men have enviously watched the fishes swimming serenely at
      various depths in streams, lakes, and in the ocean, breathing by
      the use of their gills, and men have longed for some way to devise
      gills, or their equivalent, for themselves. In the centuries of
      development and use of underwater swimming and diving equipment,
      or in underwater vessels, etc., no one before has attempted and
      succeeded in providing any equivalent to fishes gills, whereby
      dissolved oxygen is extracted from the water, and whereby carbon
      dioxide, one of the poisonous waste products of metabolism, is
      disposed of by passing it into solution in the water.<br>
      <br>
      To the best of our knowledge, all previous diving equipment
      depends upon taking air or oxygen down to the diver, either taking
      it with him when he descends, 0r pumping it down to him.<br>
      <br>
      When the diver has the air pumped down to him the air hoses limit
      his area of free movement, and also the hoses often become
      entangled, leading to accidents which have caused many deaths.
      Furthermore, the diver at all times is completely dependent on the
      men and equipment at the surface for continuously supplying his
      air. If they fail, he dies.<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, equipment for the free diver (scuba), wearing
      tanks of compressed air or oxygen, has become highly developed.
      Elimination of entangling air lines, and the complete freedom of
      movement thus provided has proved of great advantage for many
      types of diving work and sports. However, when the compressed air
      or oxygen in the tank is used up, the diver must return to the
      surface. Also such compressed air is expensive. One published
      statement, even several years ago in this growing field, was that
      some 7 million US. skin divers buy 15 tanks full a year at $1.50 a
      tankfull totaling over $150,000,000 a year.<br>
      <br>
      In all types of diving equipment heretofore, no one else has
      provided means for utilizing the dissolved oxygen in the Water for
      respiration. That is the fundamental aim of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      Extensive study of authoritative technical literature in various
      related fields has been one important part of the development of
      this invention. The following have proved to be useful sources of
      information on various aspects of the physiology, the physics, and
      the chemistry of respiration in men and in various other animals,
      especially including fishes; and various facts cited by them are
      used in this invention:<br>
      <br>
      Cooperative Animal Physiology, by Clifford Ladd I Prosser, and
      others; Anatomy of the Chordates, by Charles R. Weichert; Studies
      of the Structure and Development of Vertebrates, by Edwin S.
      Goodrich; Human Physiology, by Bernardo Housay; A History of
      Fishes, by John R. Norman; A Guide to the Study of Fishes, by
      David Star Jordan; The Study of Fishes, by Albert C. L. Gunther;
      Biological Physics and Chemistry of the Sea Water, by W. B.
      Harvey; Men and the Chemical Elements, by 1. Newton Friend;
      Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology; Hackhs Chemical Dictionary.<br>
      <br>
      A basic principle of respiration for nearly all species, including
      both men and fishes, is the passage of oxygen and carbon dioxide
      through thin membranes. In fish, oxygen dissolved in the Water
      passes from the water, thru the thin membranes of the gills, and
      into the blood stream of the fish. At the same time, the excess CO
      in solution in the fishes blood in the gills, passes thru the same
      thin membrane in the opposite direction and out into the sea
      water, where the CO is dissolved in the Water.<br>
      <br>
      In human lungs, the oxygen of the air passes thru the very thin
      membranes of the lungs and into the blood stream, where it is
      taken up by the hemoglobin of the red corpuscles. At the same
      time, the excess CO carried by the blood passes out thru the thin
      membranes of the lungs into the air of the lungs, where it is then
      exhaled.<br>
      <br>
      In providing, for men, equipment which will extract oxygen from
      the water in a manner comparable to the gills for fish, we will
      first ascertain what principles of physics and chemistry We can
      utilize.<br>
      <br>
      In all the data studied, the passage of oxygen from one liquid
      (such as water) thru a membrance (such as the gills of fishes)
      into another liquid (such as the fishes blood) follows the laws of
      partial pressures of gases in relation to permeable membranes.
      That is, the gas moves from the region where it is at a higher
      partial pressure, thru the membrane, into fluid where it is at a
      lower partial pressure.<br>
      <br>
      The same physical laws apply in the action of human lungs. Oxygen
      in the air in the lungs, called alveolar air, is at a greater
      partial pressure than in the venous blood, so oxygen from the
      alveolar air migrates thru the permeable membranes of the lungs
      into the blood stream.<br>
      <br>
      Carbon dioxide follows these same laws. In men, the partial
      pressure of carbon dioxide is higher in the venous blood stream
      than in the alveolar air, so the CO in the blood migrates thru the
      permeable membranes of the lungs into the alveolar air and is
      exhaled.<br>
      <br>
      Also in fish, the CO in the blood stream returning to the gills
      (venous blood) is at a higher partial pressure than in the water
      in which the fish is swimming, so the CO passes from the blood
      stream, thru the permeable membrane, and into the water where it
      is dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      In the system disclosed in this invention, We provide a series of
      pressure gradients for both oxygen and for CO so that these two
      gases will move independently but simultaneously in the directions
      we Want, by following these same laws of partial pressures of
      gases in relation to permeable membranes. The series of pressure
      gradients for oxygen are as follows:<br>
      <br>
      As stated by W. H. Harvey in Biological Chemistry and Physics of
      Sea Water, The surface layers of the sea are nearly at equilibrium
      with the air in regard to both of these gases (oxygen and
      nitrogen). The weight or volume at N.T.P. (normal temperature and
      pressure) of dissolved oxygen per liter of water varies with the
      temperature of the water, but the pressure is usually in the
      neighborhood of 159 mm. (of mercuryHg), as it is in water
      saturated with air at normal barometric pressure. From this, it is
      established that we start with oxygen dissolved in fresh water or
      sea water at approximately 159 mm. of Hg pressure.<br>
      <br>
      As will be described in detail later, our equipment will include a
      substantial area of man-made permeable membrane material permeable
      to both oxygen and carbon dioxide. One side of this membrane
      material will be immersed in and in direct contact with the fresh
      water or sea water in which the user is submerged. The other side
      of the gas permeable membrane material will form part of the
      breathing circuit of the equipment which leads directly into the
      users lungs. For the next step, we find in Comparative Animal
      Physiology, by C. L. Prosser, the following information: In the
      lungs of men, the blood is exposed to oxygen at a partial pressure
      of approximately 100 mm. of Hg (in alveolar air). When the blood
      leaves the lungs it carries 19 volumes percent of oxygen at 80 mm.
      of Hg and 96% of its hemoglobin is saturated. In the capillaries
      the blood passes thru tissues (elsewhere in the body) where the
      oxygen pressure is low (5 to 30 mm. Hg). Here 25%-30% of the
      oxygen is unloaded, and venous blood returning to the heart
      carries 14 volumes percent of oxygen at about 40 mm. of Hg
      pressure. The information in this quotation is important because
      it establishes the approximate partial pressure of oxygen in the
      venous blood returning to the lungs in man, as being 40 mm. f Hg.
      According to the laws of gaseous diffusion we are utilizing, any
      oxygen pressure higher than 40 mm. of Hg in the lungs will cause
      oxygen to migrate thru the lung membrane and reoxygenate the
      venous blood. The higher the oxygen pressure in the lungs above 40
      mm., the faster this reoxygenation will take place.<br>
      <br>
      In our system, we will provide fresh Water or sea water having
      dissolved oxygen at approximately 159 mm. of Hg pressure. This
      oxygen will pass thru the permeable membrane we provide, probably
      with a slight drop in pressure. We note, from the data quoted,
      that the pressure of oxygen going from alveolar air in the lungs
      thru the lung membrane, and into the blood stream drops
      approximately 20 mm. If the pressure of oxygen dissolved in the
      sea water (159 mm. of Hg) drops by a comparable amount in passing
      thru the man-made permeable membrane we shall provide, the oxygen
      in the breathing circuit would be approximately 139 mm. pressure.
      Since alveolar air normally contains oxygen at only 100 mm. of Hg,
      and since any pressure above 40 mm. of Hg will carry on
      oxygenation of the blood, it is apparent that our system clearly
      will provide the basic conditions necessary for extracting oxygen
      from the sea water and using it for respiration. This pressure
      gradient series for oxygen may be reviewed and summarized as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      We start with fresh water or sea water containing dissolved oxygen
      at aproximately 159 mm. of Hg. This oxygen then passes thru a
      man-made membrane into the breathing circuit of the apparatus at a
      slightly reduced oxygen pressure. Any pressure above 40 mm. will
      cause oxygen carried into the lungs to pass thru the lung
      membranes into the blood stream and the higher the oxygen pressure
      in the lungs the faster the reoxygenation of th blood will take
      place. It is apparent that there is a great deal of latitude for
      oxygen pressure to drop in passing thru the man-made permeable
      membrane, because we have 159 mm, on one side of it, and anything
      above 40 mm. on the other side causes reoxygenation of blood to
      take place.<br>
      <br>
      Also, mm. of oxygen in the alveolar air is all that is necessary
      for ordinary breathing of air directly.<br>
      <br>
      The other basic requirement is that the system dispose of the CO
      of the exhaled air. In Comparative Animal Physiology by C. L.
      Prosser and others, we find this information: The CO in the blood
      of men for arterial blood is at a pressure of from 40-42 mm. of
      Hg, and for venous blood is at a pressure of 45-47 mm. As compared
      with this, the CO pressure in sea water is 0.23 mm. of Hg. We are
      concerned with the venous bloodat 45- 47 mm. of Hg. Its pressure
      relative to the 0.23 mm. of Hg in sea water provides a tremendous
      pressure gradientthe higher pressure is over 18,000% greater than
      the lower pressure. There is no question that CO from the venous
      blood would migrate thru the lung membrane into the breathing
      circuit of the apparatus and then thru the man-made permeable
      membrane into the sea water where it would be dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      The soundness of these principles has been proved by successful
      tests, repeated for witnesses and for photographing, where I
      demonstrated test equipment I designed and built, whereby, for a
      substantial period of time, I exhaled into and inhaled from a
      closed breathing circuit where my exhaled breath and CO extracted
      from it and was dissolved in sea water, and Where dissolved oxygen
      was extracted from the sea water and replenished my exhaled
      breath, and I rebreathed such rehabilitated air over and over
      again.<br>
      <br>
      A principal object of this invention is to extract dissolved
      oxygen from the water and add it to the exhaled breath, and
      extract CO from the breath and dissolve it in the water, and
      return the oxygen enriched and purified breath for rebreathing.<br>
      <br>
      A further object is to provide means whereby the pressure of the
      air breathed by the user is automatically made equal at all times
      to the pressure of the sea water, even though the water pressure
      varies greatly because of the different depths at which the user
      may be submerged.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the invention is to provide means, in one form
      of the apparatus, whereby if the swimmer enters polluted water, or
      water containing insufiicient dissolved oxygen, he will not be
      injured or killed, as often happens to fish in such circumstances,
      but will be able to partly or entirely switch to a reserve supply
      of breathable gas until he returns to water of normal composition.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the invention is to provide a unit which we
      shall call a Gill Respirator, the function of which will be to
      recondition exhaled air thru disposing of excess CO by dissolving
      it in the water in which the user is immersed, and also by
      extracting dissolved oxygen from the water and releasing it in the
      gas stream t be breathed by the user.<br>
      <br>
      Another object, in two forms of the invention, is to provide
      control of the buoyancy of the swimmer and the apparatus he is
      using.<br>
      <br>
      Another object is to provide means whereby water which may have
      leaked into the system may be readily removed from it.<br>
      <br>
      Another object is to prevent foreign objects from entering the
      gill unit and damaging it or interfering with its operation,
      thereby performing the functions comparable to those performed by
      the gill rakers in the gills of fishes.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the invention is to provide methods and means
      for circulating Water across the gas permeable membranes to
      enhance the reoxygenation operation.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the invention is to provide the method of
      rehabilitating the exhaled air of a person in an undersea vessel,
      or other underwater housing, work space, or living space, by
      extracting dissolved oxygen from the water in which he is
      submerged and replenishing said exhaled air with said extracted
      oxygen for rebreathing.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the invention is to provide the method of
      rehabilitating the exhaled air of a person in an underwater
      vessel, or other underwater housing, work space, or living space,
      by extracting carbon dioxide from said exhaled air and dissolving
      it in the water in which the person is submerged.<br>
      <br>
      Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent
      during the course of the following description.<br>

      <b> </b>Referring to the drawings:<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 1, 1 generally is an individual gill respirator element.
      The completed gill respirator unit will contain a large number of
      such individual elements in order to provide a large number of
      square feet of surface of gas permeable membrances thru which
      oxygen from the water surrounding the driver may pass into the air
      breathing circuit and, at the same time, carbon dioxide may pass
      from the air breathing circuit into the sea water Where it will be
      dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      Permeable membranes for the gill respirator elements may be made
      from any one of a variety of materials. The one selected should
      have a preferred combination of qualities such as the ability to
      pass oxygen, ability to pass carbon dioxide, low absorption of
      water, reason able dimensional stability, good mechanical strength
      (particularly tear strength), good characteristics for being
      sealed or cemented to itself or to other materials either by heat
      or adhesive or other appropriate means, and reasonable cost. The
      first requirement is that the material chosen should have good
      ability to pass oxygen and CO In response to our inquiry, written
      to E. I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., their polychemicals
      department sent us a copy of an article titled Permeability of
      Polymeric Films to Gases by V. L. Simril and A, Hershherger,
      published in the July issue of Modern Plastics. This is a
      technical report of studies made of The per-meabilities of 21
      polymeric films to oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen,
      ammonia etc. In this article, all gas permeability data obtained
      in this study are reported here in terms of the permeability
      constant P which is defined as the number of moles of gas passing
      thru one square centimeter of film, one centimeter thick, per
      second per centimeter Hg vapor pressure difference across the
      film. Several of these materials show high permeability factors
      which are expressed as P 10 Table 5 shows Glycerol V as having an
      oxygen permeability of 546, and a C0 permeability of 754. Table 7
      shows Vinyl Butyral as having an oxygen permeability of 464, and a
      C0 permeability of 2280. The same table shows polyethylene
      (ethylene polymer) at relative humidity (this is appropriate
      because the film we use will be immersed in water) as having an
      ggtggen permeability of 839 and a C0 permeability of The same
      table shows ethyl cellulose (48.3 ethoxyl) plasticized with 15% of
      butyl phthalyl butyl glycolate at 0% relative humidity having an
      oxygen permeability factor of 3470 and a C0 permeability factor of
      21,200. At 100% relative humidity the oxygen permeability is not
      given but would probably be higher than 3470 and the CO
      permeability factor is given as 22,500.<br>
      <br>
      The article includes in its summary the further information that,
      In general, it may be said that gas permeation increases with any
      increase in the bonding forces between polymer molecules of the
      film and with any increase in the attractive forces between film
      and gas. Thus, highly polar, strongly bound polymers are less
      permeable to non-polar gases than are the less polar, weakly bound
      polymers. The introduction of side chains onto the main polymer
      chains, the introduction of plasticizers, and the presence of
      water, all tend to increase permeability.<br>
      <br>
      From another source, The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular
      Surgery, November 1960, we learn information on other tests on the
      comparative ability of various sheet materials to pass oxygen,
      carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. In these test results, altho
      the sheets tested were of varying thickness as produced
      commercially, the calculations took this into account compensating
      for these different thicknesses, and thereby provides comparative
      permeability coefiicients of the materials themselves,
      independently of thickness. Also the investigators found that the
      ratio of permeability for carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and
      oxygen is relatively constant for almost all membranes. All three
      are given 'in the following table of permeability coefficients.<br>
      <br>
      From this, it will be seen that various different materials may be
      used as the gas permeable membrane and this invention specifically
      includes any suitable membrane material.<br>
      <br>
      This invention also includes a structure employing no membrane at
      all, as illustrated by the following. There are a number of
      instances in nature where various living creatures utilize the
      migration of dissolved oxygen in water into an air space provided
      by a submerged air bubble, trapped under water, without the use of
      any permeable membrane or anything comparable to it. Also, in
      these same situations, CO given off by the living creature passes
      from the air space into the surrounding water where it is
      dissolved without any permeable membrane being employed.<br>
      <br>
      For example, in an article entitled Insect Breathing by Carroll M.
      Williams, and published by the Scientific American, February 1953,
      the following information is included: The diving bell insects
      take oxygen along with them when they submerge. The bell consists
      of a bubble of air collected at the waters surface and held on one
      or more points of the body. During the dive the insect sucks
      oxygen from the bubble. Students of the phenomenon were long
      puzzled by the fact that the insect can stay under water long
      after it should have exhausted the bubbles oxygen content. The
      puzzle finally was unraveled by the Danish physiologist Richard
      Edge. He found that the bubble can serve as a veritable under
      water lung. As the oxygen pressure in the air-filled bubble falls
      below that of the oxygen dissolved in the surrounding water,
      oxygen from the water diifuses into it. The insect can remain
      submerged until the nitrogen that keeps the bubble inflated
      diifuses into the surrounding water. So, strange as it may seem,
      the most important ingredient in the bubble of air which the
      insect picks up at the surface is nitrogen, not oxygen. The
      nitrogen, which makes it possible to use the bubble as a lung,
      allows the insect to be submerged 13 times as long as an
      equivalent bubble of oxygen would permit.<br>
      <br>
      The last sentence shows migration of oxygen from the Water into
      the air space and of carbon dioxide from the air space into the
      water occurs without any permeable membrane being necessary and
      enables the insect to breathe under water 13 times longer than he
      otherwise could, and the earlier part of the paragraph indicates
      that even this limit is due only to the air space ceasing to exist
      because of the nitrogen also dilfusing away into the water. This
      indicates that if we provide means whereby the air space can be
      maintained, the oxygen can be extracted from the water and carbon
      dioxide disposed of by dissolving it in the water even if we do
      not use a permeable membrane. It is important that we distinguish
      here between a permeable membrane and a porous membrane, sheet, or
      barrier. A permeable membrane, sheet, or barrier will be
      understood to mean a continuous sheet of material (that is,
      homogeneous) as cellophane is continuous, or most plastic sheet
      materials, and as our lung membranes are continuous, and fishes
      gills are continuous, even though all of these may be penetrated
      at various rates by the separate molecules of gases and vapors. We
      are told that such penetration by gases is believed to be thru
      intermolecular spaces of the membrane material similar in size to
      the gas atoms but somewhat larger-- generally the same order of
      magnitude. In contrast to this permeable material, porous
      materials are discontinuous, having openings, pores, interstices
      (as between paper or cloth fibers) or other discontinuities of
      cross section, such pores usually being thousands or millions of
      times larger than the gas atoms we are concerned with. Either
      permeable or porous materials can be used for this invention, but
      different factors are involved.<br>
      <br>
      Certain well known previous experience indicates that one method
      of extracting oxygen without using a permeable membrane would be
      to use a closely woven material, such as cloth, or to use wet
      strength paper, or perhaps very fine wire screening, or perhaps
      sheet metal or plastic perforated with a very large number of very
      small holes. In the old fashioned water wings for swimming, use
      was made of ordinary woven cloth which, when saturated with water,
      prevented the air from going out thru the pores between the
      fibers, even though the water wings were subjected to very
      considerable pressure due to the weight of the person being
      supported in the water. The fundamental force involved in this
      situation is the surface tension of the water, which becomes
      comparatively quite high when the dimensions of the openings
      involved become very small. The surface tension in this case
      caused the water saturating the cloth to bridge the gaps between
      the cloth fibers so tenaciously that even the weight of a large
      person in the water was not sufiicient to disrupt this water film.
      Another example is the experiment which can be performed using a
      sieve made of closely woven wire screen. If the screen is first
      wet with oil, then water, if carefully placed within the sieve,
      can actually be carried in the sieve, whereas normally, of course,
      the water would run right thru. Here again the surface tension of
      the water is the primary operating force. Because of the
      repellance between water and oil, the water cannot wet the sieve,
      and because of the small holes between the wire mesh of the sieve
      the surface tension of the water prevents it from flowing thru.<br>
      <br>
      In a similar manner, this invention includes the use of sheet
      material, whether woven, or perforated, or otherwise of porous
      composition, having a large number of very fine openings which
      will enable water to bridge these openings without flowing thru
      them. In the case of cloth, the sheet material ordinarily would be
      saturated with water. However, an alternative would be to treat
      the cloth with a water repelling material such as an oil or wax,
      in which case the cloth would not be saturated with water.
      Alternatively, sheet material such as plastic or metal, or any
      other appropriate material might be made with a very large number
      of very fine openings where the surface tension of the water would
      bridge these openings but would not flow thru. In these forms of
      the invention the water itself would be exposed to and in direct
      contact with the air in the air breathing circuit of the apparatus
      to be described and the migration of oxygen from the water into
      the air circuit and of CO from the air circuit into the Water
      would follow the same physical laws as those utilized by the
      insects in the article quoted. The construction of the gill
      respirator could be the same, regardless of whether porous
      materials or permeable membranes are used and FIGURES 1-8 and
      FIGURE 16 and the associated specification apply to both types of
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      However, the apparatus described in detail hereafter, for purposes
      of illustration, makes use of permeable membranes and these act in
      the same way and follow the same physical laws as the permeable
      membranes in the lungs of men and the gills of fishes, as
      subsequent dis cussion will explain, but this illustration is not
      limiting, and porous materials may be used, or other means for
      accomplishing the Objects.<br>
      <br>
      In FIGURE 1, the gill respirator element is formed of two sheets
      of permeable membrane material, heat sealed or cemented, or
      otherwise secured together by any appropriate means, all the way
      around its edges as as shown at 2, 2, 2, 2. Subsequently, in this
      description, the term heat sealed will be used, but it is to be
      understood that cementing or any other appropriate means for
      securing plastic to itself or to other materials is included in
      this invention. The respirator element 1 is a basic type of unit
      whereby air contained within it may pass excess CO thru the
      permeable membrane into the surrounding water, and whereby, in the
      opposite direction, oxygen from the outside water may pass into
      the breathing circuit.<br>
      <br>
      It is desirable to provide a maximum amount of surface area
      between air, permeable membrane, and the water, in as small a
      cubic space as possible. With this aim in view, a large number of
      passageways 3, 3, are formed by heat sealing together the two
      surfaces of the gill respirator envelope 1 along the lines shown,
      two of which are designated as 44. Because small passageways
      provided substantial resistance to the flow of air, it is
      desirable to design a unit which consists of such passageways
      utilized in parallel, whereby such resistance is very greatly
      reduced. It is also necessary to supply air exhaled by the user to
      one end of the gill respirator element and collect reoxygenated
      air from the other end of the gill respirator element and to
      conduct this air back to the user to be rebreathed. The two
      elements 5, 5 in FIG. 1 are important in performing these two func
      tions, and are identical in construction.<br>
      <br>
      FIGURE 2 shows a cross section of one of these units taken along
      the line A-A in FIG. 1 and the portions of this unit are shown
      exploded in FIG. 3. In FIG. 3, 6 is the top sheet of permeable
      membrane. 7 is one of two elongated washers stamped out of thin
      sheet material, such as non-corrodable metal, or stifi plastic
      sheet material. 9 is a second elongated washed identical with 7,
      whereas 8 is a corrugated elongated washer having the same over
      all dimensions as 7 and 9 but, due to its corrugations, 8 acts as
      a spacer and separator holding 7 and 9 apart and also provides air
      passageways thru the cross section of the assembled group 7, 8,
      and 9.<br>
      <br>
      in regard to their manufacture, by way of example, 7, 8, and 9 may
      be made of thin sheet brass or stainless steel. 8 may be di-pped
      into a plastic adhesive material which will become thermosetting
      upon the application of appropriate heat. The washers 7 and 9
      could be assembled with the spacer 8 between them in a heated
      press whereby heat would be transferred thru the washers 7 and 9
      to the corrugated separator 8 and the plastic adhesive coating on
      separator 3 would be softened by the heat and then changed into
      its permanent thermosetting adhesive form, whereby the washers 7
      and 9 would become a permanent unitary subassembly. This is a very
      feasible manufacturing procedure and large numbers of such
      subassemblies could be made at comparatively low cost.<br>
      <br>
      The next step in the manufacture of the gill respirator element 1
      would be to utilize an hydraulic press with platens Which could be
      heated and cooled, and in which a suitable pair of dies would be
      mounted for performing the following procedure. With the dies cold
      and separated, one sheet of permeable plastic membrane would be
      laid on the bottom platen. Over this and in proper register would
      be placed the two elongated washers 5, 5 in the form of the
      previously described subassemblies. On top of these two would be
      laid a second sheet of plastic permeable membrane material. The
      platens of the press would then be closed and the platens would be
      heated and then cooled to perform the heat sealing already
      described. This heat sealing would also secure the permeable
      membrane to the surfaces of the elongated washer subassemblies 5,
      5. After the press had cooled, the gill element would be taken out
      of the press and the plastic permeable membranes would be cut out
      where they stretch across the inner openings of subassemblies 5,
      5. This would complete the manufacture of a gill respirator
      element 1.<br>
      <br>
      It will be seen that this will produce a standard sealed unit
      having two large surfaces of permeable membrane material formed
      into a large number of parallel channels used in parallel and
      including two separator elements 5, 5 to which air may be applied
      thru the elongated center openings and then thru the air
      passageways formed by the corrugated separators.<br>
      <br>
      It is a matter of choice and experiment as to what type of
      permeable material is used; as to how thin the sheet should be to
      obtain, on the one hand, maximum gas permeability, which generally
      will increase as the film used is thinner, while at the same time
      maintaining good mechanical strength which, of course, would be
      greater as the film is thicker.<br>
      <br>
      It is even possible, if desired, to make films which are
      exceedingly thin. One method is to release, under water, a plastic
      lacquer, lighter than water, which will immediately rise to the
      surface and spread out in the same manner that oil spreads on
      water. As the solvent of the lacquer evaporates, this film will
      harden and, with care, can be lifted off the surface of the water
      intact. This film can be made so thin that it is comparable to the
      thickness of a film of oil on water or the thickness of the wall
      of a soap bubble. These films have a thickness probably in the
      order of of an inch or less and probably are considerably thinner
      than it would be necessary to use this apparatus, altho they would
      be quite possible to use.<br>
      <br>
      Thin films may be secured to an open mesh or net material, such as
      metal or plastic screen, to provide very much enhanced mechanical
      strength. I have already done this successfully with very thin
      plastic films adhered to plastic window screen.<br>
      <br>
      It is expected that a probably good compromise of design
      characteristics would lie in the choice of films in the order of
      of an inch of thickness. Some recently developed films of such
      thickness made of polystyrene are said to have good oxygen and CO
      permeability, and would have the further advantage that they
      absorb practically no water. Silicone rubber has also been
      recommended because of its high oxygen permeability.<br>
      <br>
      Another factor which is important in the design of the gill
      respirator unit is the amount of time the exhaled air will be
      inside the permeable membrane material and undergoing
      reoxygenation. Clearly, the longer this exposure time can be, the
      greater the amount of reoxygenation that can take place. Also, if
      this exposure time can be made longer it may be preferable to do
      so as a means of decreasing the number of gill elements or of
      decreasing the area of each gill element, or both. In this
      invention, I have devised a principle for increasing the exposure
      time for reoxygenation which is a principle not utilized in the
      gills of fishes nor in the lungs of human beings.<br>
      <br>
      By experiment, I have found that the volume of an average inhaled
      breath is in the neighborhood of 40 cu. inches. In the gill
      respirator and the associated breathing circuit disclosed in this
      invention, two check valves are employed so that air in the
      breathing circuit always progresses in the same direction. Also,
      the volumetric capacity of the parallel passages of the gill
      respirator unit is purposely made several hundred percent greater
      than the average breath exhaled by the diver. The result is that
      for any unit of exhaled air to pass completely thru the gill
      respirator unit, it will take the time of a number of complete
      breathing cycles of the diver. The utilization of these principles
      provides an increase in the reoxygenation efiectiveness of several
      hundred percent. For eX- ample, if we use a gill respirator
      element 18" square its two sides will provide 646 sq. in. of gas
      permeable surface. If it is made of sheeting $6, of an inch thick,
      when deflated its thickness will be 5 of an inch thick; when
      normally inflated to its usual partially inflated capacity, we may
      allow A of thickness. We may also decide to allow 7 water space
      between each of the gill respirator elements. Then, a gill
      respirator assembly containing a 12" stack of 18" by 18" elements
      would have 48 such units and would provide approximately 216 sq.
      ft. of gas permeable membrane exposed to the surrounding water.
      Further, if we assume that the flattened oval cross sections of
      the passages of the gill respirator units occupy approximately /2
      the volume that a continuous separation of the between the sheets
      would provide, then the assembly of 48 gill respirator units would
      provide an approximate volumetric capacity of 480 cu. in. Since an
      average exhaled breath was found to be in the neighborhood of 40
      cu. in., it is seen that the estimated volumetric capacity of the
      gill respirator unit could be in the neighborhood of 1200% greater
      than the volume of an average exhaled breath. This would indicate
      that it would take approximately 12 exhaled breaths to move any
      unit of exhaled air completely thru the gill respirator unit.
      Checking the time of an average breathing rate indicates that it
      maybe in the neighborhood of 16 complete breathing cycles per
      minute. Applying this breathing rate to the 12 cycles resulting
      from previous assumptions, we find a total exposure time of
      approximately 45 seconds for any unit of exhaled air during which
      it is exposed to reoxygenation. This is a very much more favorable
      kind of condition than exists for human breathing. In the lungs of
      man, the oxygenation of the inhaled air must take place in
      approximately /2 the complete breathing cycle, or, according to
      the preceding average figures given, in less than 2 seconds. Thus
      we may obtain an improvement, as compared with human lungs, of
      more than 2250%, in regard to the exposure time available for
      reoxygenation in the gill respirator unit.<br>
      <br>
      It will be informative to make a comparison between the factors
      contributing to the extraction of oxygen by the gill respirator
      unit as compared with the extraction of oxygen from the alveolar
      air in the lungs of man. Generally speaking, we can utilize the
      assumption that the oxygenation function will be the permeable
      member area times the time system provides for reoxygenation,
      other things being equal. In the book Human Physiology by Prof.
      Bernardo Housay, we find the information that The total surface of
      the alveoli (lung tissues) has been calculated to be between 80
      and 100 square meters in man. The walls are sufliciently thin and
      permeable to allow for rapid interchange of gases. (However, Dr.
      Genero of the University of Florida Medical School, whom I
      interviewed checking out the medical aspects of this invention,
      showed me a more recent medical reference where the lung area has
      been recalculated with the finding of 8 to square meters-one tenth
      the former calculation. However, even using Housays figures to be
      ultra conserva tive, we find the following favorable
      circumstances.)<br>
      <br>
      Since a square meter is approximately a square yard, we may figure
      (using Housays 80-100 sq. meters) that the area of the lungs in
      man has been calculated as being from 720 to 900 sq. ft. We will
      average these two figures using 810 sq. ft. If we multiply this by
      the approximate two seconds during which the breath is inhaled in
      an average breathing rate, we get 1,620 square-footseconds of lung
      exposure for reoxygenation. It is useful to employ this new
      measure of square-foot-seconds for the purpose of making
      comparative calculations of reoxygenation devices in this new
      field of designing gill respirators for extracting oxygen from
      water for breathing purposes.<br>
      <br>
      If we assume the design dimensions of the gill respirator unit
      discussed previously having the major dimensions 18" by 18" by
      12", this unit will provide an approximate permeable membrane area
      of 216 square feet. If we multiply this by the 45 seconds of time
      for any unit of air to pass thru the gill respirator unit, we find
      that we have an approximate 9720 square-foot-seconds of gill
      respirator exposure for reoxygenation. This indicates that we have
      an extremely promising set of possibilities since the number of
      square-foot-seconds for a gill respirator unit of quite moderate
      size, 18 by 18" by 12", appears to provide 600% more
      square-foot-seconds for reoxygenation than the average human
      lungs.<br>
      <br>
      It is also a matter of design choice as to how large the gill
      respirator element 1 shall be made and, further, it is a matter of
      preference as to how many such elements may be used in an
      assembled gill respirator unit. Furthermore, some persons
      utilizing this invention may wish to employ more than one
      assembled gill respirator unit, depending upon their own
      preferences as to the most convenient size and shape of the
      equipment.<br>
      <br>
      It should be understood that the purposes of this invention will
      be fulfilled by the extraction of dissolved oxygen from the water
      to any extent, for breathing purposes. In other words, design
      characteristics may be chosen whereby the resulting amount of
      oxygen extracted from the water acts merely to enable the
      prolonging of the time a diver may stay under water (as compared
      with holding his breath) whether he is relying solely on the gill
      respirator unit, as shown in the form of the invention in FIGURE
      10, or whether he is using the form of the invention including an
      auxiliary compressed air supply as shown in FIGS. 12 and 14. Also,
      the purposes and principles of the invention will be fulfilled if
      design characteristics are utilized enabling the extraction of a
      greater amount of oxygen from the sea water so that the user is
      able to continuously breathe air which has been reoxygenated by
      the gill respirator unit for extended periods, without being
      replenished by mixture with new oxygen from a compressed air or
      compressed oxygen supply.<br>
      <br>
      One important principle of this apparatus enabling such thin films
      to be used without fear of their being ruptured is that the
      equipment is so designed that the air pressure inside the gill
      respirator unit is always at precisely the same pressure as the
      outside water, or very, very nearly so, despite great variations
      in the pressure of the water in which a diver may be swimming,
      depending upon the depth at which he is swimming. Very closely
      connected to this important principle is the further fact that the
      gill respirator elements disclosed in this invention are capable
      of containing a volume of air which varies with each inhalation
      and exhalation of the user.<br>
      <br>
      I have found by experiment that it is impossible for a human being
      to breathe air from the surface thru a simple tube when he is
      submerged, if he is more than two or three feet below the surface
      of the water. Analysis shows that this occurs because the air
      inside a persons lungs is then at atmospheric pressure, whereas
      water on the outside of his lungs is at a pressure considerably
      greater than atmospheric pressure. The human body simply does not
      have the muscular strength to expand the rib cage for inhalation
      against a pressure difference of more than two or three feet of
      water, balanced against atmospheric pressure. It may be taken as a
      basic principle for equipment of this class, that the air supplied
      for inhalation by the lungs must be at a pressure equal to, or
      very nearly equal to, the pressure of the outside water in which
      the swimmer is submerged. This alone, however, is not the complete
      answer. I have found by further experiment that if :air is
      supplied in any reasonably small closed rigid container even at
      the same pressure as the outside water and is connected by a
      mouthpiece to the lungs that a user would find it impossible to
      inhale from such a container and exhale back into it, and such a
      container may be taken as representative of a closed system
      intended for circulating and breathing air. It becomes evident
      that a flexible bag, or other flexible container, subjected to the
      pressure of the sea water on the outside and carrying the air in
      the breathing circuit on the inside needs to be one essential part
      of the system. With this element included and with the water
      pressure pressing equally upon both the flexible container and on
      the rib cage of the diver, the divers chest muscles are again
      effective in expanding the lungs for inhalation, whereupon the
      flexible container of air is correspondingly compressed. Upon
      exhalation, the reverse occurs. The muscles of the chest contract
      the rib cage applying a slightly greater pressure to the air
      contained in it and the exhaled air passes to the flexible
      container which expands by a corresponding amount. Since the
      outside water presses equally on the flexible air container and
      upon the rib cage of the diver, his muscles can become fully
      effective in the ordinary breathing movements. Also, because his
      air container has a flex ible structure, the air contained in the
      breathing circuit at all times is at precisely the same pressure
      as the -outside water for the simple reason that the outside water
      compresses a flexible container of air until the pressure of the
      air inside is at equilibrium with the pressure of the water. It
      will be noted that in all three forms of the invention disclosed
      in this patent application, these essential principles are
      embodied.<br>
      <br>
      in regard to the gill respirator elements in particular, the air
      passageways formed by the parallel lines of heat sealing are
      normally quite flat ovals in cross section. As the diver exhales
      and additional air flows into the breathing circuit thereby, the
      slight added air pressure will cause these passage ways to become
      more rounded ovals in shape, thereby increasing their volumetric
      capacity. Conversely, when the diver inhales and air is withdrawn
      from the breathing circuit, the water pressure on the outside of
      the permeable membranes of the gill respirator elements will cause
      these parallel passage ways to assume a more flattened oval shape,
      thereby decreasing their volumetric capacity. In this simple way,
      the gill respirator elements, in addition to their functions of
      providing oxygen and CO exchange with the water, also provide for
      the breathing circuit a flexible element having variable
      volumetric capacity. In addition, as the diver descends into
      deeper water and the pressure of the water increases the
      flexibility of the permeable membranes will result in
      automatically increasing the pressure of the air in the breathing
      circuit by an exactly corresponding amount. Similarly when the
      diver swims toward the surface, and as he ascends, the water
      pressure decreases, the air contained in the parallel passage ways
      of the gill respirator unit will expand by an amount exactly
      suflicient to maintain the air in the breathing circuit at a
      pressure equal to the outside water at all times. Of course, a
      separate conventional flexible breather bag can be added to the
      breathing circuit, if desired.<br>
      <br>
      In the forms of the invention shown in FIGS. 12 and 14, if use has
      been made of the compressed air supply while the diver was
      submerged, when the diver returns toward the surface, an
      adjustable air exit valve is provided which will automatically
      open and allow excess air to escape, if necessary as an aid in
      maintaining the pressure in the breathing circuit exactly equal to
      or very nearly equal to the pressure of the outside water.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 shows a cross section of three gill respirator element 1
      taken along the line BB in FIG. 1. Here the flattened oval cross
      sections of the individual parallel passage ways of the permeable
      membrane material is clearly shown, as at 19. Note also the outer
      edges are sealed together as shown at 11 and as shown at 2, 2, 2,
      2 in H6. 1. In FIG. 4, three of the gill respirator elements are
      shown to illustrate clearly how they may be spaced and how the sea
      water may be made to flow between them, at 12, 12, 12. Means will
      be shown and discussed later whereby the sea water is kept moving
      in the same direction. At the outer edges of the gill respirator
      elements bent strips of metal are shown, as 13, 13. These are
      optional stiffener elements and their purpose will be discussed
      later.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 shows a fragmentary side elevation, partly in cross
      section, of the assembled gill respirator unit. A<br>
      <br>
      plurality of gill respirator elements 14 are stacked together
      between an upper end plate 15 and a lower end plate 16. These gill
      elements are held in register and the whole unit is held together
      by the tie bolts 17 and 13 which pass up thru the bottom of end
      plate 18, thru the opposite ends of the elongated openings of the
      subassernblies 5, shown in FIG. 1, up thru the upper end plate 15,
      thru the water tight gasket 19, and thru the respirator unit air
      conduit 20. The tie bolts 17 and 18 are held securely in place by
      the nuts 21, 21, as shown.<br>
      <br>
      Refer to FIG. 10 which is a plan view of the assembled gill
      respirator unit. Here it will be seen that two of the respirator
      unit air conduits 20 are used in the parallel fashion shown. It
      should be understood that when a series of gill respirator units
      1, of FIG. 1, are piled in a stack in register, and to this stack
      are added the end plates 15 and 16 and two respirator air conduits
      20 are also employed as shown in FIG. 10, then air passage ways
      are provided as follows. Air may be supplied by a flexible hose
      connection as 22 in FIG. 5, and will pass through the respirator
      unit air conduit 20 which leads to the elongated opening provided
      by the stack of separators 5 of the gill respirator elements 1 of
      FIG. 1; air can move down thru the central opening of the stacked
      elements 5 and also can move in a parallel fashion thru the
      passage ways provided by the corrugated separator 8 of each of the
      subassemblies and thence thru the parallel channels formed in the
      permeable membranes. The air then flows out thru the corrugated
      elements 8 of the subassemblies 5 at the other end of the gill
      respirator elements 1 and flows upwardly thru the elongated
      openings of the stack of elements 5 and back out thru the second
      respirator unit air conduit 20 and thence thru a second flexible
      air hose.<br>
      <br>
      It is desirable to cause new water to flow frequently across the
      permeable membranes. If the Water stays motionless then the oxygen
      dissolved in it will soon be used up and there will only be a very
      small amount left for later respiration purposes. Because of this
      same requirement, most species of fishes have means for passing
      new water across the permeable membranes of their gill. Often this
      is accomplished by opening and closing the mouth and some species
      even have structures which act as valves which pump new water
      across the gill surfaces each time the fish closes its mouth.
      Particularly is this noticeable in the moray eel, which opens and
      closes its mouth very noticeably even when completely at rest, as
      a means of forcing new water across its gill surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      To perform this same function, means are provided in the gill
      respirator unit both for pumping water across the permeable
      membrane surface and also, as the most eflicient method, means are
      provided which cause such water to flow always in the same
      direction, so that there will be a maximum exchange of new water
      replacing tie-oxygenated Water.<br>
      <br>
      In connection with this flow of water across the gill surfaces,
      many species of fish also are equipped with gill rakers which
      serve as a screen to keep out foreign objects which might
      interfere with the functioning of the gills or which might damage
      the delicate gill membranes.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 5, coarse screen members 23, 23 are soldered to the inside
      faces of angle members 24, 24, 24, 24 which, in turn, are secured
      to the end plates 15 and 16 by the mounting screws 25, 25, 25, 25.
      The screen members 23 act like the gill rakers of fish, to keep
      out foreign bodies which might interfere with the action of the
      unit or damage it.<br>
      <br>
      Circulation of water across the gill units is provided for in two
      ways. I have made extensive studies, in this connection, of the
      water circulation across the gill surfaces of big fish, comparable
      to the size of a man, particularly of big sharks at Marineland,
      south of St. Augustine, Florida, and at the Seaquarium in Miami.
      The curator at Marineland told me that the amounts of water
      flowing thru the gills of big fish have never been measured.<br>
      <br>
      However, I have developed a way of making a useful approximation
      for our purposes. At the outdoor shark run at the Seaquarium it is
      readily possible to get within a few feet of the sharks. I studied
      nurse sharks there which (I was told) weighed approximately 400
      pounds, as a basis for making a conservative comparison with a 175
      pound man. They swam, much of the time, at approximately 1 ft. per
      second. It could easily be seen that they were not working their
      jaws in breathing, but as is common with sharks, with mouth
      slightly open were depending entirely upon their forward movement
      to pass water thru their gills. Also the gill slits did not
      periodically distend in a breathing rhythm, but instead maintained
      constant apertures.<br>
      <br>
      All the water going over the gill membranes necessarily comes out
      of the gill slits, so all we need to do is estimate the flow at
      that point. This flow will be the total cross sectional area of
      the gill openings times the rate of flow, this flow being
      approximately equal to the speed of the fish thru the water. The
      gill slits averaged approximately 3 inches long, with an average
      opening of approximately 7 width, and these nurse sharks had 4
      gill slits per side, making a total of eight. The total gill slit
      cross sectional area therefore was approximately 3" (height) times
      (width) times 4 (gill slits per side) times 2 (sides), equalling a
      total of 4 /2 sq. in. cross section of water flow.<br>
      <br>
      At the swimming speed of 1 ft. per second, and 4 /2 sq. in. of
      water flow, this equals 54 cubic inches of water per second, which
      equals approximately 14 gallons per minute.<br>
      <br>
      This 14 gallons a minute is for a 400 pound shark. It might be a
      fraction of this for a 175 pound man.<br>
      <br>
      Now compare this 14 gallons a minute for the 400 lb. shark with
      what we could readily provide for the man, swimming (with swim
      fins) at the same very slow rate of 1 ft. per second.<br>
      <br>
      We have previously described a gill unit having a frontal area 18"
      wide by 12" high. The 48 gill units were planned at thick each
      with spaces between. The total cross sectional area of water fiow
      will therefore be 47 spaces times 18" wide times A high, which
      totals slightly over 158 sq. in. of water flow. (Note the shark
      had only 4.5 sq. in. of water flow). With the gill unit having
      approximately 158 sq. in. of water flow, at a speed of 1 ft. per
      second we would have approximately 492 gallons flowing across the
      gill surfaces per minute. This obviously is far more than
      necessary. Then, from another point of view, calculating what
      reduced speed would provide the same flow as for the 400 lb.
      shark, we find that approximately /3 of an inch per second would
      do it.<br>
      <br>
      This is such an extremely low speed that most bodies of water
      probably have at least this much water movement as their natural
      state, without a person having to swim at all, most of the time.
      However, a great many fish swim all their lives to circulate water
      over the gill surfaces. The nurse shark swims most of the time,
      but can also stop, and then pumping action thru the gills is
      observable.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, both methods for passing water over the gill units are
      provided in this invention. Swimming action will continuously hold
      open the valves (to be described below), while this will be
      supplemented by pumping action when not swimming.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 5, water which has come thru the screen member
      23 next passes thru a valve unit which is comprised of a
      perforated plate 26, shown in FIGS. 5, 6, and 7, and a series of
      flexible rubber-like valve strips 27, 27, which are cemented along
      their upper edges to the perforated plate 26 and are mounted in an
      overlapping fashion resembling shingles. These valve strips are
      normally closed, but in FIG. 5 they are shown in a partially open
      position with water passing thru the spaces between them. At the
      right hand side of FIG. 5, after water passes thru the screen 23
      into the perforated metal sheet 26 and the valve flaps 27a, it
      then passes along between the gill respirator elements and flows
      out thru the valve unit at the left and then out thru the screen
      at the left. Water pressure, when swimming, holds both sets of
      valves open continuously with water flowing right thru. When not
      swimming, the force which provides the pumping action is as
      follows. When the diver inhales and Withdraws air from the
      breathing circuit, the volumetric capacity of the parallel
      channels in the gill respirator units is correspondingly reduced
      below the pressure of the outside water. The greater pressure of
      the water on the outside forces the valve flaps 27b to close and
      the valve flaps 27a to open, as shown at the right side of FIG. 5,
      so that with these open the water flows into the spaces between
      the gill respirator elements by an amount suflicient to make up
      for the volume of these elements which are reduced when the diver
      inhaled. Conversely, when the diver exhales, the volumetric
      capacity of the parallel passages of the respirator gill element
      increases, thereby increasing the pressure of the water between
      these elements to a point Where this pressure is greater than the
      pressure of the water outside the respirator unit. The increase of
      pressure from the water on the inside causes the valve flaps 27a
      to close and the valve flaps 27b shown at the left side of FIG. 5,
      to open, thereby allowing water to flow outwardly and thru the
      screen until the pressure of the water remaining within the gill
      respirator unit equals the pressure of the air contained in the
      parallel passages of the permeable membrane units. In this way,
      with each inhalation by the diver, there is a flow of water into
      the front of the gill respirator unit, and with each exhalation by
      the diver there is a flow of water out thru the back of the gill
      respirator unit.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be understood however, that any suitable means for moving
      water thru the gas exchange unit may be employed, as preferred.
      For example, an electric pump could be used, with a rechargeable
      storage battery for power; or the power might come from copper and
      zinc plates with sea water as the electrolyte forming a primary
      battery.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 5, 28 is a sheet of sponge rubber or other resilient
      material, cemented to the bottom plate and intended to make the
      respirator unit more comfortable when worn by the diver.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 8, 9A, 9B, and 9C show various details of an optional
      element which may be used or not as found preferable. If it is
      found that water flowing into the front of the respirator unit (at
      the right as shown in FIG. 5) tends to bend over the sealed edges
      of the thin flexible plastic of the gill respirator elements, and
      if such action tends to close off these channels unduly, then
      stiffener elements, described below, may be utilized to hold the
      edges of the respirator elements in a preferred spaced and
      separated relation.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9A is a plan view of part of one of the stiffener elements
      29. This may be made of a thin strip of noncorrodable material,
      such as thin sheet brass, or stainless steel. It is shown in end
      elevation in FIG. 9B. This strip carries small rounded raised
      portions 30 which will serve as spacers. In the manufacturing
      process, each strip 29 will be bent as shown in FIG. 9C and will
      be laid along one of the heat sealed edges 2 of the gill
      respirator elements 1 of FIG. 1. Then the metal strip 29 will be
      bent closed so that it grips both sides of the heat sealed edge as
      shown at 13 in FIG. 4. When these strips have been added to the
      gill respirator elements 1 of FIG. 1 and these elements have been
      assembled in a stack, their edges will appear as shown in FIG. 8.
      Here it is clear that the raised portions 30 will act as spacer
      elements reliably separated, thereby providing adequate spaces for
      the passage of water therebetween.<br>
      <br>
      . FIG. 10 is a plan view of a complete underwater breathing system
      utilizing the previously described gill respirator 1 7 unit. Part
      of this diagram is fragmentary, showing in cross section some of
      the construction of the breathing circuit. The gill respirator
      unit, generally designated as 31, is connected by a conventional
      flexible air hose 32 to the right hand end of the central valve
      group, generally designated as 33. This group consists of a
      shutofl valve 34 of conventional design, which may be manually
      operated by the diver; a check valve 35 shown in cross section; a
      second check valve 36 also shown in cross section; a second
      shutoff valve 41; and a mouthpiece 37. Although a mouthpiece alone
      is shown in these diagrams, it is to be understood that the
      invention specifically includes the use of a face mask, as an
      equivalent, or a combined mouthpiece and face mask, or any
      equivalent of these for introducing air into the divers lungs. 38
      is a snorkle for breathing at the surface and 39 is a screw-type
      valve cap for the snorkle, of well known design. 40 is a check
      valve in the snorkle allowing air to be drawn into it but
      preventing air from moving in the opposite direction. 42<br>
      <br>
      is a flexible air hose of the same type as 32. Both of these air
      hoses, 32 and 42, connect to the gill respirator air conduits, as
      shown. 43 is an adjustable air exit valve, the construction of
      which is shown in detail in FIG. 11. The purpose of this valve is
      to allow air to escape from the breathing circuit out into the
      surrounding water whenever the air pressure in the air breathing
      circuit becomes enough greater than the pressure of the
      surrounding water to compress the adjustable spring in this valve
      and unseat the valve diaphragm. The spring is made adjustable so
      that the amount of pressure obtainable in the air breathing
      circuit above that of the outside Water pressure (at which point
      the valve will open) is an adjustable factor.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 11, 44 designates the body portion of the valve. 45 is the
      valve diaphragm which normally holds this valve closed. 46 is a
      gasket of rubber or other appropriate material, cemented to the
      under side of the flange 45 as shown. 47 is a bridge member made
      of appropriate metal secured to the body of the valve 44 by
      attachment screws 48, 48, across the top of the valve as shown in
      FIGS. 10 and 11. At the center of this bridge rnember 47, a
      threaded stud 49 is riveted. The threads of this stud carry the
      threaded adjustment knob 50 which includes a pointer 51. The
      underside of the adjustment knob 50 is groove-d to receive the
      upper end of coil spring 52. The lower end of spring 52 is
      contained within the cup portion of the valve diaphragm 45, as
      shown. It is intended that quite a light spring will be used as
      the spring 52 and that when the ad ustment knob is set for least
      pressure, the resultant spring pressure bearing upon the diaphragm
      45 will be only a very small fraction of an ounce. Adjustment of
      the knob clockwise in FIG. 10 will increase the spring pressure on
      the valve diaphragm and it will then require a greater pressure
      difference between the air inside the breathing circuit and the
      water outside to unseat the valve diaphragm 45 and allow air to
      escape.<br>
      <br>
      This valve has two principal purposes. One of them is in
      connection with charging the system with air at the surface, as
      will be described later. The second purpose of the valve 43
      becomes important in the forms of the invention shown in FIG. 12
      and FIG. 14. In these systems, it is intended that at certain
      times and for certain purposes compressed air will be introduced
      into the breathing circuit from the auxiliary tanks shown. This
      might result in a considerably higher pressure of air being in the
      breathing circuit than is present in the outside water,
      particularly when a diver is returning toward the surface and the
      pressure of the outside water is rapidly diminishing. It is an
      important safety factor that automatic valve means be included in
      the equipment to release the excess air even if a diver should
      forget to balance these forces manually. It is not only important
      in protecting the permeable membranes of the equipment, it is also
      extremely important that the air in the divers lungs has its
      pressure reduced at the same rate as the pressure of the water
      outside. If not, and if he should arrive at the surface with a
      considerable pressure of air in his lungs, and then should breathe
      air at atmospheric pressure, the delicate tissues of the lungs may
      burst causing the condition known by the medical term of embolism,
      and this condition is quite capable of killing the diver. The
      automatic exit valve 43, therefore, is an important safety feature
      of the invention. 53 is a handle attached to the air exit valve
      diaphragm 45 and may be used to lift the diaphragm manually to
      permit the escape of air.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of the equipment shown in FIG. 10, is as follows.
      Assuming that the diver is wearing the equipment and is in the
      water at the surface, submerged except for his head and shoulders,
      he will first unscrew the snorkle valve cap 39 and breathe in the
      ordinary manner. Each inhalation will suck air in thru the cap 39,
      down thru the snorkle tube 38, thru the check valve 40, thru the
      mouthpiece 37, and into his lungs. In order to charge the gill
      respirator unit with air he will turn off the shutoff valve 34.
      Continued breathing on the part of the diver will result in each
      exhaled breath passing thru check valve 36, thru shutoff valve 41
      which is open, up thru air hose 42, down thru the left side of the
      gill respirator unit 31, across toward the right side of the stack
      of gill respirator elements, up thru the right side of the gill
      respirator 31, and down thru the air hose 32. Because shutoff
      valve 34 is closed, the exhaled air in the breather circuit is not
      free to circulate and will build up pressure with each exhalation
      until the air pressure unseats the air exit valve 43. The diver
      will know when he has reached this condition because he will see
      and hear the air escaping and bubbling. This is notice to him that
      the operation of charging the equipment with air has been
      completed. Then the diver, while holding his breath, will close
      the snorkle valve cap 39 and open the shutoff valve 34.
      Thereafter, he will continue breathing in the normal manner and is
      ready to submerge. The check valves 35 and 36 will cause each
      exhaled breath to pass upward thru air hose 42 and each inhaled
      breath to pass downward thru air hose 32, and thru the air
      breathing circuit already described. The exhaled air, as it passes
      thru the gill respirator elements, will extract oxygen from the
      surrounding water and at the same time will dispose of the excess
      CO in the exhaled breath by passing this outward and dissolving it
      in the surrounding water.<br>
      <br>
      As previously pointed out, the flexibility of the per-v meable
      membranes and the type of structure provided in this design will
      enable the volumetric capacity of the air passages to be reduced
      as the pressure of the surrounding water increases as the diver
      submerges to increasing depths in the water. Because this factor
      is provided for in this design the air pressure in the breathing
      circuit will always adjust itself to the same pressure as the
      surrounding water.<br>
      <br>
      The system shown in FIG. 12 is the same as that shown in FIG. 10
      with the exception that a small compressed air tank 54 has been
      added along with an air pump 55, and their associated valves. The
      tank 54 has a hand operated valve 56 controlling the air flowing
      out of the tank and into the flexible hose 57 and thru the three
      way shutoff valve 58.<br>
      <br>
      FIGURE 13 shows a cross section of such a three Way valve. The
      inner section may be rotated to control the flow of air between
      the three parts in a manner well known to the art.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 12, the hand pump 55 is connected internally thru a
      conventional check valve at its Output side to the compressed air
      tank 54. The hand pump takes in air thru the hand operated valve
      59, thru the flexible connecting air line 60 and thru the three
      way shutoff valve 61. The compressed air tank 54 is also equipped
      with a pressure gauge 62 showing the pressure of the compressed
      air within the tank. Compressed air tank 54 and hand pump 55 are
      equipped with lugs 63, 63, 63, 63, for attaching a harness to be
      worn by the diver.<br>
      <br>
      The operation is as follows. While charging the equipment with air
      at the surface, as previously described 1n connection with the
      operation of the system shown in FIG. 10, the pump valve 59 may be
      opened and the hand pump 55 may be operated to take air from the
      breathing circuit and compress it in the small compressed air tank
      54. When the gill respirator unit and the breathing circuit has
      been fully charged with air at the surface, as previously
      described, and when the diver closes the snorkle valve 59 and
      submerges, if he goes down to an appreciable depth the air in the
      breathing circuit will become more compressed as the pressure of
      the water into which the diver descends increases. For example, if
      the diver descends to 33 ft. of depth, the pressure of the water
      doubles and the air in the breathing circuit also has its pressure
      doubled and, therefore, will have-only half its former volume.
      This will reduce the buoyancy of the diver and his apparatus. It
      is usual practice today for divers to wear weight belts and to
      carry a number of weights on the belt in accordance with personal
      choice as to the buoyancy desired. It a diver using this equipment
      had chosen to wear enough weights on his weight belt to have
      neutral buoyancy at the surface, then as he descended and the
      additional water pressure compressed the air in the breathing
      circuit, he would have considerable negative buoyancy. If he
      wished to restore his neutral buoyancy with this equipment, he
      could do so while submerged by open ing the hand operated valve 56
      and carefully allowing enough compressed air from tank 54 to enter
      the breathing circuit to expand the gill respirator elements to
      their former size, thereby displacing the same amount of water as
      when at the surface If he should allow too much compressed air
      into the breathing circuit for neutral buoyancy, so that his
      buoyancy became positive, he could correct this by opening the
      pump valve 59 and operating the hand pump 55 while under water,
      thereby pumping some of the air in the breathing circuit back into
      the compressed air tank 54. Similarly, as he might choose to swim
      at various depths during his under water swimming, he can
      repeatedly obtain his desired buoyancy for the varying pressure
      conditions by opening valve 56 to increase buoyancy or by opening
      valve 59 and operating hand pump 55 to decrease buoyancy. An
      additional use for this system is in a situation where a diver may
      wish to carry a heavy object to the surface. In this case, while
      he may take hold of the object at the bottom when his buoyancy is
      neutral, he may wish to increase his buoyancy as an aid in
      carrying it to the surface and thereby reduce the effort of
      swimming up. Similarly, a diver may wish to operate at negative
      buoyancy at the surface as a means of getting to the bottom
      rapidly.<br>
      <br>
      The compressed air in the tank 54 can also be used as an auxiliary
      air supply without affecting buoyancy by opening valve 56 to pass
      new air into the breathing circuit and then by manually operating
      the air exit valve diaphragm handle 53 to allow a corresponding
      amount of the old air to escape into the water, or by pumping an
      equivalent amount of old air from the breathing circuit back into
      the compressed air tank 54.<br>
      <br>
      Pump 55 can also be employed as a drainage pump for pumping out
      water which may have leaked into the breathing system. Such leaked
      water will first accumulate in the valve housing43, because this
      is made the low point in the breathing circuit. A manually
      operated valve (well known to the art-not shown) may be connected
      to the bottom of the housing 43. This valve, in turn, may be
      connected by a flexible hose to valve 59. Also, a manually
      operated petcock and a check valve (both also well knownnot shown)
      may be attached to the lowest point of the tank 54. Then if leaked
      water accumulates in housing 43, the valve there may be opened and
      also valve 59, and the manual pump 55 may be operated, which will
      pump the leaked water from housing 43 into tank 54. Then the
      manually operated drainage petcock in tank 54 may be opened, and
      the air pressure in tank 54 will blow the water out. The check
      valve will keep any water from coming in under any circumstancesa
      safety precaution.<br>
      <br>
      The system shown in FIG. 14 is identical with that shown in FIG.
      10 except that the shutoff valves 34 and 41 of FIG, 10 are
      replaced by proportioning valves 65 and 64 in FIG. 14.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 15 shows such a proportioning valve in cross section. It will
      be seen that the rotatable central part can be rotated clockwise
      or counterclockwise to completely close either branch of the valve
      or can be positioned to vary the proportioning of the air flowing
      in the two left branches of the valve, or can be rotated to shut
      ofi? the fiow of air altogether. The valves 64 and 65 are
      identical in operation. The air hoses 66 and 67 connect the
      proportioning valves 64 and 65 with a demand regulator 68 which is
      of well known type widely used in self contained under water
      breathing apparatus. This regulator 68 also has a central push
      button, also well known in the art, for manually depressing the
      diaphragm of the demand regulator in order to pass air from the
      compressed air supply into the breathing circuit. is a
      conventional tank of compressed air and is equipped with the lugs
      '71 which are provided for attaching a harness to be worn by the
      diver.<br>
      <br>
      The primary purpose of the system shown in FIG. 14 is to provide
      the gill respirator unit for breathing under water most of the
      time, but to also provide an auxiliary compressed air supply which
      the diver may use if he gets into polluted water. Fish very
      frequently die when they enter polluted water because the toxic
      gases in such Water go thru the gill membranes and enter the blood
      stream of the fish and there is no way the fish can prevent it. In
      contrast, in this system, we supply an improvement over anything
      the fish can make use of. The diver, as soon as he smells the
      toxic gases of polluted water, can turn the handle of the
      proportioning valve 64 clockwise so that his breathing circuit is
      connected only with the air hose 66 and can also turn the control
      handle of proportioning valve 65 counter clockwise so that his
      beathing system is connected only with hose 67. Under these
      circumstances, the gill respirator unit breathing circuit is
      completely shut off from the diver and will remain inoperative.
      The diver will continue to breathe in a normal manner and will
      obtain his air exclusively from the compressed air tank 70 in the
      well known manner characteristic of self contained under water
      breathing apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      If the diver, instead of entering polluted water, should find
      himself in Water which has less than the normal amount of
      dissolved oxygen in it, he may adjust the equipment to breathe a
      mixture of air, reoxygenated by the gill respirator unit and new
      air obtained from the auxiliary compressed air supply in tank 70.
      For example, if he should like to have a mixture which is
      approximately half and half, he would set the control handles of
      the valves 64 and 65 as shown in FIGS. 14 and 15. Small changes of
      the positions of these control handles would vary the proportion
      accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      Another use for the equipment is to pass air from tank 70 into the
      breathing circuit of the gill respirator unit, which can be done
      by turning valve 65 so that it connects only with the air hose 42.
      If it is desired to increase the buoyancy of the equipment with
      the valve setting just described, the manual button 69 may also be
      operated which will release additional air into the total
      breathing circuit and will expand the gill respirator elements,
      thereby increasing the buoyancy of the equipment.<br>
      <br>
      At any time after the diver has left either polluted Water or
      water having less than normal oxygen content, he can reset the
      valves 64 and 65 so that he is breathing thru the gill respirator
      unit only.<br>
      <br>
      While the systems discussed have talked in terms of use of air and
      comrpessed air, it is to be specifically understood that the scope
      of this invention includes also the use of oxygen and compressed
      oxygen or any other breathable gas or gas mixture. For most
      purposes, compressed oxygen is considered less useful because of
      the danger of oxygen poisoning at depths greater than 25 feet,
      unless used by persons well aware of the danger and extremely
      skilled in the use of oxygen under such conditions. In contrast,
      the compressed air equipment is regularly used at depths of 100,
      200, and even 300 feet.<br>
      <br>
      In connection with leaked water, in all three systems as shown in
      FIGS. 10, 12, and 14, the air exit valve 43 is purposely located
      directly below the air passage Ways leading to the mouthpiece of
      face mask, so that leaked water will naturally flow down into the
      internal space provided by this valve and there will be far less
      likelihood that an inhaltion will suck water into the divers
      lungs. Also, this is the best location for leaked water in
      connection with expelling it. In the system shown in FIG, 10, the
      diver may expel leaked water by first inhaling a deep breath, and
      then turning off valve 41, and then expelling his breath sharply.
      The exhaled breath can only escape by unseating the diaphragm of
      air exit valve 43 and the air flowing out will carry the leaked
      water with it. The process may be repeated if necessary to expel
      all the leaked water.<br>
      <br>
      In the system shown in FIG. 12, the same thing can be accomplished
      by closing valve 58 and exhaling sharply, or leaked water can be
      blown out by compressed air by opening valve 56 and passing enough
      air into the breathing circuit so that the pressure provided for
      by the setting of control knob is exceeded and the valve 43 will
      open automatically, the air expelled thereby carrying out the
      leaked water also.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 14, leaked water may be blown out by the exhaled breath of
      the diver by closing valve and exhaling sharply, or by also
      turning valve 64 so that it connects only with hose 66, and then
      operating button 69 which will release compressed air from tank 70
      and blow out the leaked water.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 16 is a fragmentary enlarged cross sectional View, comparable
      to FIG. 4, but shows an alternative form of construction for a
      gill element. In this design, a central core member 73, having a
      multiplicity of channels 7474 formed in its opposite faces
      supports the permeable or porous membrane material 75-7 5.
      Optional stiffener and spacing members 7676 may be used, like
      those shown in FIGS. 9A, 9B, and 9C. Even though the channels
      74-74 may be made quite small in size, the fact that they operate
      in parallel for each gill element, and that the gill elements also
      operate in parallel, readily suplies ample cross sectional area
      for easy breathing. This core element 73 extends right up to the
      elongated washer and spacer subassemblies 5-5 of FIG. 1, air
      passing freely from one to the other.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 17 is a process diagram showing the principles of this
      invention applied to rehabilitating the exhaled breath of one or
      more persons in under water vessels, other under water housings,
      work spaces, living spaces, etc. For example, successful
      experiments have recently been made with an under water house
      containing beds, cooking facilities, electric lights, and even
      television, where two men lived for a week 33 feet below the
      surface of the sea. This undoubtedly will be a growing field of
      development, for one reason because it eliminates a great deal of
      decompression time now required where extended under water work
      needs to be done. Instead of taking air down in tanks or piping it
      down, it would be very advantageous to use my invention of
      extracting dissolved oxygen from the unlimited sea Water and
      disposing of CO or to use this as an alternative system-safety
      being much enhanced by having two kinds of systems for protection
      of the lives of the persons there.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 17, 76 represents the surrounding body of Water, a portion
      of which is pumped in thru the hull of an under water vessel or
      wall of a housing 77 by the pump 78 thru the conduit 79 and valve
      80; into the gas exchange unit 81 and out by pump 82, thru conduit
      83, thru valve 84 and back to the surrounding body of water 76.
      This completes the water circuit.<br>
      <br>
      The exhaled breath of the person or persons submerged is pumped by
      pump 35 thru the conduit 86 into the gas exchange unit 81 and then
      out thru conduit 87 back to be rebreathed. The gas exchange unit
      81 can consist of any of the previously discussed gas permeable or
      porous sheet materials used to form passage ways thru which the
      exhaled air is pumped, such units being bathed by the flowing
      water 76 whereby dissolved oxygen is extracted from the water and
      carbon dioxide is extracted from the exhaled breath, such
      extracted oxygen being added to the exhaled breath and carbon
      dioxide being passed off into the water, and the rehabilitated air
      being returned to the person or persons for rebreathing.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 18 shows an alternative form of gas exchange unit where the
      transference of carbon dioxide from air to water and of oxygen
      from the Water to the air takes place directly across the
      air-to-water interfaces without any barrier material being used.
      The wall 88 of the gas exchange unit 81 is partially filled with
      the Water 76. Pipes or other gas conducting means 89 with spaced
      apertures cause the exhaled air to bubble up thru the water. These
      bubbles would preferably be very small and in enormous numbers so
      that the air is provided with a very large surface area (relative
      to its volume) in direct contact with the Water for enhancing the
      gas exchange. FIG. 18 is not necessarily to scale, and its
      vertical height may be increased as much as desired to provide
      full gas exchange of the bubbles as they rise vertically thru the
      water.<br>
      <br>
      There may be considerably greater pressure in the water 76 than in
      the inside of the vessel or housing 77, with possible danger of
      flooding if the pumps should fail. As a safety feature, the pumps
      78 and 82 and valves 80 and 84 (these valves preferably being of a
      type which can be actuated either manually or electrically) are
      interconnected so that at any time that the pumps 78 or 82 fall
      below their proper speed, or stop, the valves 80 and 84 will
      automatically close, thus assuring against flooding, and the
      alarms 90 or 91 will ring. This system will have an independent
      power supply from that driving the pumps 78 and 82. The units on
      the pumps sensing their speed can be Well known centrifugal
      governors, but connected to actuate the valves and alarms instead
      of being connected to control the speed of the pumps.<br>

      Kenichi Nagase&nbsp; Fukashi Kohori&nbsp; Kiyotaka Sakai&nbsp;
      Hiroyuki Nishide <br>
      <br>
      Using the derived mass transfer correlations for hollow fibers,
      hollow fiber arrangements were optimized for an artificial gill
      that uses an oxygen carrier solution. FC-40, a perfluorocarbon
      (PFC), was used as the oxygen carrier solution. In the oxygen
      uptake module, a hollow fiber arrangement with parallel coiled
      hollow fibers is preferred. The optimum outside diameter of the
      hollow fibers and the transverse pitch between them are 300 and
      500µm, respectively. In the oxygen release module, a hollow fiber
      arrangement of straight parallel hollow fibers is preferred. The
      optimum outside diameter of the hollow fibers and transverse pitch
      between them are 300 and 500µm, respectively. In the case of
      humans, the scaling up was estimated from the oxygen transfer
      rates using these optimum hollow fiber arrangements. The required
      total membrane surface area is 50.8m 2 , the total delivered
      pumping energy is 124W, and the oxygen partial pressure in
      inspiration is 17.8kPa. Importantly, the total membrane surface
      area required was significantly reduced using the modules with an
      optimum hollow fiber arrangement in comparison with that using
      connected membrane oxygenators as a gas exchanger. The
      optimization of hollow fiber arrangements in an artificial gill
      significantly enhances oxygen transfer from water to air.<br>

      Inventors:&nbsp; Arnold J. Lande (St. Paul, MN, US)<br>
      <br>
      The invention provides a system whereby oxygen can be derived from
      seawater or from thin air at higher altitudes while simultaneously
      eliminating carbon dioxide from the blood. This allows prolonged
      underwater liquid breathing at greater depths without suffering
      from the bends or, alternatively, the ability of workers to
      breathe underwater or at high altitudes without having to rely
      upon air tanks or the like. The artificial gill comprises a
      plurality of concatenated modules each containing a semi-permeable
      membrane operative to transfer oxygen in a first direction and
      carbon dioxide in a second direction across the membrane. By
      providing multiple concatenated interconnected modules, oxygen
      becomes concentrated to allow breathing thereof. Because the
      system is connected in series with a person's blood supply, CO2
      produced in the body is extracted and disposed of via the
      artificial gill. The semipermeable membrane preferably comprises a
      plurality of tubular fibers, each with a relatively large lumen
      when compared to present day blood oxygenators arranged as a
      bundle in a housing such that seawater or rarefied air passes over
      the exterior surfaces of the fibers while blood or Hgb flows
      through the lumens. The larger diameter fibers reduce hemolysis
      and clotting.<br>

      A self-contained open-circuit breathing apparatus for use within a
      body of water naturally containing dissolved air. The apparatus is
      adapted to provide breathable air to a diver. The apparatus
      comprises an inlet means for extracting a quantity of water from
      the body of water. It further comprises a separator for separating
      the dissolved air from the quantity of water, thereby obtaining
      the breathable air. The apparatus further comprises a first outlet
      means for expelling the separated water back into the body of
      water, and a second outlet means for removing the breathable air
      and supplying it for breathing. The air is supplied so as to
      enable all of it to be expelled back into the body of water after
      it has been breathed.<br>
