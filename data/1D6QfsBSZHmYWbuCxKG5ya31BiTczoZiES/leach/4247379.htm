      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>An apparatus for accomplishing
        photochemical reactions includes a series of reaction chambers
        and a heat exchanger. When the apparatus is employed for the
        production of hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide from water or water
        vapor, cold water is initially passed through the heat exchanger
        to cool the output gases; and then the water is further heated
        and turned to steam, prior to supplying it to the reaction
        chambers. The elongated photochemical reaction chambers are
        connected in series, with the water vapor being coupled to pass
        successively up one elongated reaction chamber, down the next
        and so forth. Each reaction chamber is provided with a central
        gas discharge device for producing characteristic output
        radiation at various lower frequencies. Enclosing the elongated
        gas discharged tube is a reaction zone or reaction chamber; and
        between the gas discharge tube and the reaction zone are
        arrangements including a metallic film, such as aluminum, which
        is highly transmissive to short wavelengths but which reflects
        the lower frequencies initially radiated by the gas discharge
        tube. Various arrangements including resonant cavities, a
        slotted shield, or coherent radiating material may also be
        provided to facilitate shifting of the lower frequencies from
        the gas discharge device to higher frequencies which will pass
        through the metallic coating, to irradiate the reactant with
        ultraviolet radiations. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to photochemical reaction techniques and
        apparatus. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>As disclosed in my prior U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,701, granted Apr.
        10. 1979, and in my subsequent U.S. patent application cited
        hereinabove, and in the references cited therein, it has
        previously been proposed to dissociate gases by irradiating them
        with coherent radiation from laser apparatus; and mercury vapor
        gas discharge tubes have previously been proposed for use in the
        implementation of photochemical reactions. </p>
      <p>In many cases, however, the reactant has high absorption to
        frequencies in the ultraviolet frequency band when high levels
        of radiation are present. Up to the present time it has not been
        practical to obtain very high intensity ultraviolet radiation on
        a commercial scale and at a reasonable cost. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, a principal object of the present invention is to
        provide a relatively simple apparatus for the production of high
        intensity, high frequency ultraviolet irradiation for use in
        ionizing gases, in photochemical processes, and particularly for
        the dissociation of water vapor to form hydrogen and hydrogen
        peroxide. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, it has
        been determined that the output radiation from gas discharge
        tubes such as mercury vapor, sodium vapor, and other similar
        tubes, which have a large portion of the output energy at
        relatively low frequencies, can be raised to the higher energy
        ultraviolet range by the use of films such as thin metallic
        films of copper or silver, to permit the transmission only of
        the higher frequency ultraviolet wavelengths. </p>
      <p>In cooperation with these selective transmission films, the
        apparatus includes other arrangements such as high frequency
        cavities bounded by reflective material, or laser-type material
        capable of harmonic generation, for facilitating the frequency
        shift. </p>
      <p>Other features include arrangements for preheating the input
        water in a heat exchanger which cools the output gases, such as
        hydrogen or hydrogen peroxide; feedback arrangement for
        supplying limiting amounts of hydrogen or hydrogen peroxide back
        to each of the reaction chambers to increase the kinetic energy
        of the ongoing photochemical reaction; gas discharge pulsing
        arrangements for successively initiating chain reactions in the
        various reaction chambers included in a single system; and "flow
        through" arrangements for supplying the reactant from one end of
        the first of several parallel elongated reaction chambers, back
        through in the opposite direction in the adjacent reaction
        chamber and so forth throughout the entire series. </p>
      <p>In one structural arrangement, a slotted reflecting cylinder
        encompasses the gas discharge tube, a series of reflectively
        coated laser rods are spaced around the slotted reflector, and
        the outer coating on each of the laser rods is cut away where it
        is adjacent an associated slot, to receive pumping energy from
        the gas discharge tube. With the outer coating on the laser rods
        being of aluminum or other frequency selective transmission
        material, only the harmonic radiation from the laser rods is
        radiated into the enclosing reaction chamber. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment, a series of elongated resonant chambers
        are spaced around the gas discharge device, and have reflecting
        walls except for one slot for receiving radiation from the gas
        discharge device and additional openings for radiating higher
        frequency energy through a selective transmission film, into an
        outer reaction chamber. As more and more energy is pumped into
        the resonant chamber, the energy content increases, as it cannot
        escape, and finally the energy reaches such a high level that
        the frequency is shifted upward and the contained energy is
        "dumped" at the higher frequency levels through the selective
        transmission films. Incidently, this frequency shift phenomenon
        is similar to that which occurs in a kiln, as more and more
        energy is supplied to it and the temperature within the kiln
        increases from the infrared to a bright red and finally to white
        heat, radiating progressively higher frequencies as the energy
        within the kiln or reservoir increases. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the
        entire space within and surrounding the gas discharge device may
        be formed into a resonant cavity with selected areas of the
        special transmittance film to radiate into the reaction chamber
        in accordance with the cavity dumping phenomenon mentioned
        hereinabove. </p>
      <p>From a somewhat different aspect, the invention involves the
        intense irradiation of relatively concentrated gas molecules by
        photons having a higher energy content than that required to
        fully ionize the molecules; so that the resultant energetic
        particles, and subsequent energetic and powerful photons
        generated upon recombination of atoms and electrons, will
        provide further ionization of the gas molecules. Under
        conditions of relatively high gas molecular concentrations,
        wherein the ionization reaction is "caged" or "imprisoned" by
        other gas molecules, and under other conditions for precluding
        significant dissipation of energy, successive stages of
        ionization and finally of dissociation may be obtained from a
        single high energy ionization of a molecule by high energy
        photons. Further, when the reaction chamber is flooded with such
        high frequency photons, the direct, the indirect, and
        chain-produced ionization, all supplemented by multiphoton
        absorption, will produce high yields of the desired output
        gases. </p>
      <p>Other object, features and advantages of the invention will
        become apparent from a consideration of the following detailed
        description and from the accompanying drawings. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>Referring more particularly to the drawings, FIG. 1 is a
        sideview of a photochemical apparatus illustrating the
        principles of the present invention. More specifically, the
        system of FIG. 1 includes as its major components, the heat
        exchanger 14 and a series of six reaction chambers 21 thru 26. A
        central gas discharge lamp, which may for example be a mercury
        vapor lamp, extends for most of the length of each of the
        reaction chambers 21 thru 26, and is centrally located in each
        of them, as will be disclosed in greater detail below. The
        electrical cables 28 and 30 extend from the electrical switching
        timing and power supply unit 32 to the individual terminals at
        the top and bottom of the gas discharge devices. </p>
      <p>When the apparatus of FIG. 1 is employed to dissociate water,
        and to form hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide, water is initially
        supplied to the input metal tubing 34, is circulated through the
        coil 36 within the heat exchanger 14, and the warmed water is
        drawn off through another conduit 38. From conduit 38, the water
        is supplied to a conventional steam generator 40 and is returned
        to the apparatus as water vapor, through the metal tubing 42. It
        is supplied to the lower end of the reaction chamber 21, and is
        coupled by the tube 44 to the upper end of the next successive
        reaction chamber 22. After traversing the length of the chamber
        22 to its bottom, it is coupled by the metal tubing 46 to the
        bottom of the next adjacent reaction chamber 23. Similarly, the
        water vapor and resultant product gases are interconnected from
        reaction chamber to reaction chamber by the metal tubing
        sections 48, 50 and 52, and the hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide
        product gases from reaction chamber 26 are coupled to the
        left-hand end of the manifold 54 and then connected by the
        larger metallic conduit 56 to the lower end of the heat
        exchanger 14. The cooled gases are shown off from the upper end
        of the heat exchanger 14 through the conduit 58, and are
        supplied to storage tank 57 through check valve 59. </p>
      <p>Extending from the hydrogen manifold 54 are a series of metal
        tubes 60 which connect to the individual reaction chambers
        through separate check valves 62 which only permit
        unidirectional flow from manifold 54 to each of the reaction
        chambers to allow feedback flow of hydrogen or hydrogen peroxide
        gas carrying kinetic energy into the reaction chambers. Also the
        feedback paths facilitate the smooth flow of gases by passign
        pressure surges in the manifold back to the reaction chambers. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows a partially broken away rendition of one of the
        reaction chamber assemblies 21. In FIG. 2 the outer wall 64 may
        be formed of stainless steel or aluminum, and centrally mounted
        within the reaction chamber is a gas discharge tube 66. This gas
        discharge tube may for example be a mercury vapor tube, but
        other gas discharge devices including sodium vapor or other
        known elements could be employed. When the gas discharge devices
        are in the order of three feet in length, the envelope would be
        approximately one-half inch in diameter; and when longer units
        such as four or five foot units are employed, a larger diameter
        such as one inch might be employed for the discharge device 66.
        Surrounding the gas discharge device 66 is a slotted stainless
        steel cylinder 68. Around the outside of the stainless steel
        member 68, are a plurality of longitudinally extending
        cylindrical structures 70 which are useful in converting the
        relatively lower frequency radiation from the gas discharge tube
        66, to flood the interior of the reaction chamber, between the
        wall 64 and the elements 70, with high intensity ultraviolet
        radiation. The cylindrical elements 70 may be in one of several
        forms, as discussed hereinbelow. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view taken along lines III--III of
        FIG. 2, and FIG. 4 is an enlarged cross-sectional view showing
        one of the elements 70 and its association with the slotted
        cylinder 68 in greater detail. As shown in FIG. 3, the central
        gas discharge tube 66 is spaced from the enclosing slotted
        stainless steel cylinder 68, and the longitudinally extending
        members 70 are mounted adjacent the successive slots 72 in the
        element 68. As shown in greater detail in FIG. 4, the rods 70
        may be of laser material such as suitably doped aluminum oxide,
        used in the ruby laser, or other known laser materials. To
        enhance laser action, and the generation of harmonic
        frequencies, the outer surface of the cylindrical laser member
        74 may be coated with a film 76 of aluminum or other suitable
        material having high reflection at visible wavelengths but low
        reflectance and high transmissivity for frequencies in the
        ultraviolet spectrum. For completeness, FIG. 9 shows these
        properties for an evaporated film of silver and of aluminum. The
        plots of FIG. 9 are from an article in the Physical Review,
        Volume 55, page 1064, 1939, authored by J. B. Sabine. The film
        76 is removed from that portion of the cylinder 74 which is
        mounted immediately adjacent the slot 72, so that pumping
        radiation may readily be received by the laser material 74 from
        the gas discharge pumping source. </p>
      <p>Concerning the mode of operation of the laser elements 70, the
        diameter of the rods 74 is preferably an even multiple of half
        wavelengths at the lasing output frequency of the material which
        is employed. In this connection, the fundamental radiation
        wavelength of a ruby laser is just under 7000 angstrom units. As
        shown in FIG. 9, the aluminum layer would reflect substantially
        all of this fundamental frequency. However, at frequencies above
        the fourth harmonic (wavelength equal to approximately 1,750
        angstrom units), the reflectance of the aluminum layer decreases
        rapidly, so that the radiation of the higher harmonics of the
        fundamental lasing output will be greatly enhanced. </p>
      <p>In place of the laser rods 70, the frequency of the radiation
        transmitted into the reaction chamber portion of the system may
        be raised through the use of resonators 82 as shown in FIG. 5.
        The cylindrical resonators 82 are spaced around the slotted
        cylinder 68 and are located to receive radiation from the gas
        discharge tube through the slots 72. The structure of the
        resonator 82 includes three stainless steel elements 84, 86 and
        88 which together make up the greater portion of a cylinder
        which effectively has a first slot 90 facing the slot 72 to
        permit the entry of radiation into the resonator 82, and
        additional output slots 92 and 94. Enclosing the greater portion
        of the stainless steel sections 84, 86 and 88, is the partial
        cylinder 96, which may be made of a suitable material having
        high transmission qualities for ultraviolet radiation, and good
        high temperature strength. One such material is aluminum oxide
        sold under the trademark "MACOR" by Corning Glass Company. The
        portion of the cylinder 96 near the slots 72 and 90, is cut away
        to permit direct juxtaposition of the slot 90 with the slot 72.
        On the inner surface of the plastic cylinder 96 is a very thin
        metal coating 98 of material which is reflective to visible
        light, but which transmits ultraviolet radiation, so that the
        reaction chamber may be irradiated by ultraviolet radiation
        through the slots 92 and 94. Although the metal coating 98 need
        only be at the location where the slots 92 and 94 are present,
        for convenience, the major portion of the internal surface of
        the plastic cylinder 96 may be so coated. </p>
      <p>Instead of using the cylinder 96 of insulating material, sheet
        silver may be rolled down to a few Angstroms in thickness,
        secured across the slots 92, and the aluminum layer may be vapor
        deposited on to the roller silver substrate. </p>
      <p>The mechanism by which the relatively lower frequencies
        entering the resonator 82 with its highly reflecting sidewalls
        becomes converted to high frequency ultraviolet radiation which
        passes through the slots 92 and 94 is relatively complex. It
        involves the absorption of more and more energy into the
        resonator 82 until finally, when very high levels of energy
        storage obtain within chamber 82, frequency conversion takes
        place, and the resultant higher frequencies are gated or
        "dumped" through the selective transmission windows 98. More
        precise mathematical analysis becomes somewhat complicated, but
        may be accomplished by treating the resonator as an "infinite
        square well potential" phenomenon. In a more simplistic manner,
        and as mentioned above, the resonator may be analogized to a
        kiln or other heat sink, which, as more and more energy is
        supplied to it, gradually increases in its output radiation
        frequencies. Thus, when heat is initially supplied to a furnace,
        the furnace gets hot, reaches the infrared range, and a dull red
        heat, then increases to white heat, and finally at very high
        temperatures after much additional heat has been supplied to it,
        reaches the higher blue heat temperature range. Similarly, as
        more and more energy is supplied to the resonator 82, it
        eventually reaches a very high energy level at which the
        generated ultraviolet radiation is "dumped" out through the
        slots 92 and the ultraviolet frequency transmissive windows 98.
      </p>
      <p>FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate one arrangement for mounting the
        resonators 82 about the gas discharge tube 66 and the slotted
        stainless steel cylinder 68, for use with the system of FIG. 1.
        In the arrangement of FIG. 6, only 10 cylinders are employed to
        enclose the slotted sleeve 68, whereas in the arrangement of
        FIG. 2, 12 cylinders were employed. Of course, either the laser
        rods, or the passive resonators may be employed in either the
        arrangement of FIG. 6 or the arrangement of FIG. 2. </p>
      <p>The arrangements for supporting the three stainless steel
        elements 84, 86 and 88 which form a principal part of the
        resonator 82, are shown in FIGS. 6 and 7. With reference to FIG.
        7, it may be noted that plugs 102 having an outer diameter equal
        to the inner diameter of the resonator are employed at each end
        of each of the resonator assemblies. The plugs 102 are provided
        with an orientation extension 104 which fits into corresponding
        recesses 106 in the resonator mounting block 108. In practice,
        the plugs 102 may be provided with protrusions or pins 110
        aligned with the orientation extensions 104, to properly align
        the elements 84, 86 and 88, with the slot 90 as shown in FIG. 5
        adjacent the slot 72 in the stainless steel cylinder 68.
        Following assembly of the three elements 84, 86 and 88 to the
        plugs 102, the cylinder 96 with its inner layer 98 may be slid
        over the assembly, with the slot 90 between elements 84 and 88
        left exposed, and the entire assembly may be mounted as shown in
        FIG. 6. </p>
      <p>Incidentally, the hollow insulating elements which are employed
        in the mounting of the gas discharge tubes at each end thereof,
        (see elements 112 and 114), for example, should be made of high
        quality insulating material of good mechanical strength, such as
        Macor ceramic, available from Corning Glass Company. The gas
        discharge tubes are preferably mercury arc discharge tubes of
        the type available from the "Volt Arc" Company. </p>
      <p>FIG. 8 shows another alternative arrangement to implement a
        passive resonator structure between the outer wall 65 of the
        reaction chamber and the gas discharge tube 66 at its center.
        More specifically, in FIG. 8, a plastic cylinder 116 is provided
        with a heavy coating of reflecting material 118 on its inner
        surface, whereby a passive resonator is formed immediately
        around the gas discharge tube 66. At spaced intervals around the
        inner surface of the cylinder 116 there are provided zones 120
        where the only reflecting coating is a very thin layer of
        aluminum or other selective transmission coating of the type
        discussed hereinabove with reference to other figures of the
        drawings and in connection with the plot of FIG. 9. By way of
        example, the inner reflecting layer 118 may be made up of an
        initial coating on the inner surface of the cylinder 116 of
        aluminum; and then after masking the areas 120, a heavy coating
        of chromium or other uniform high reflectivity coating may be
        superposed on the inner surface. Then, the resonator would have
        the advantage of very high reflectivity throughout the visible
        spectrum and on into the ultraviolet except at the areas 120,
        and then generated higher frequency radiation is transmitted
        through the slots or regions 120 in the far ultraviolet
        frequency range, as indicated by the characteristic of aluminum
        in FIG. 9. Of course, other suitable materials and coatings may
        be employed to implement the configuration shown in FIG. 8. </p>
      <p>FIG. 9 shows plots of the percent reflectance of evaporated
        films of silver and aluminum, plotted against the wavelength in
        angstrom units. As indicated by the heavy vertical line and the
        arrow and legend, the visible band of frequencies extends from
        approximately 4,000 angstrom units, up to about 7000 angstrom
        units, with the color blue being at the shorter end of the
        wavelength spectrum, and red being at the longer end. As
        indicated by the plots for silver and aluminum in FIG. 9, the
        reflectivity of silver is very high in the visible spectrum, but
        drops off rapidly in the near ultraviolet band. On the other
        hand, aluminum has moderately high reflectance down to about
        2000 angstrom units, and then, in this frequency band in the far
        ultraviolet, its reflectance drops off rapidly until it
        transmits virtually all of the incident radiation at wavelengths
        shorter than about 1000 angstrom units. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 10, 11, and 12 are drawn from my prior U.S. patent
        application Ser. No. 879,226, cited hereinabove. In FIG. 10, the
        envelope of the gas discharge tube 66 is designated by this
        reference numeral, and a series of spheres 126 are mounted on
        its outer surface. The spheres 126 are provided with an outer
        reflecting coating 128 of selective transmitting material, such
        as an evaporated film of aluminum as discussed hereinabove, see
        FIG. 11. The spheres 126 are secured to the glass discharge
        envelope by frit 130, which is made of suitable material so that
        the pumping radiation 132 from the gas discharge device is not
        impeded in its path into the laser material 126. This phenomenon
        is shown more diagrammatically in FIG. 10 in which the ionized
        gas of molecules or atoms 134 of mercury or other suitable
        material are shown directing the radiations 132 through the
        envelope 66 and into the spheres 126. In FIG. 10 the reactant is
        shown on the other side of the envelope 66 and includes large
        molecules of water 136, smaller molecules representing atoms of
        oxygen 138, and the smaller circles 140 which represent hydrogen
        atoms or molecules. With the construction as shown in FIGS. 10
        and 11, the pumping radiation from the gas discharge tube 66,
        which may be in the visible range, pumps the ruby laser
        material, aluminum oxide suitably doped, to the excited state,
        and laser operation is initiated. With substantially total
        reflection from the outer coating 128 in the visible spectrum
        where a ruby laser normally operates, higher harmonics will be
        generated and harmonics such as the fifth or higher will be
        readily transmitted through the aluminum coating 128 and radiate
        into the reaction chamber surrounding the discharge tube 66.
        This dissociates water vapor molecules such as those indicated
        at 136 in FIG. 10 to form hydrogen gas and oxygen, which
        recombine to form hydrogen peroxide in many cases. FIG. 12 is a
        greatly enlarged showing of a filament of 142 of laser material
        provided with an outer coating 144 of suitable reflecting
        qualities such as aluminum, as shown in FIG. 9. </p>
      <p>As in the case of other embodiments employing laser material,
        the distance 146 between reflecting surfaces should be an
        integral number of half wave lengths at the lazing frequency of
        the laser material This would of course also be true of the
        diameter of the spheres 126 of FIGS. 10 and 11. Also, the output
        radiation from the filament 142 of FIG. 12 would primarily be in
        the far ultraviolet frequency region. </p>
      <p>Now that the basic structure of the present apparatus has been
        described, certain background and associated information will be
        set forth. In this connection and by way of background,
        attention is directed to the May 1979 Scientific American, in
        which the article entitled, "Laser Chemistry" starting on page
        114 and extending through page 128 is noted. </p>
      <p>FIG. 13 is a showing similar to that of FIG. 12, but with the
        packets of incident waves shown in more diagrammatic manner.
        Specifically, the radiation from the discharge tube within the
        envelope 66 is represented by the line 152 and the superposed
        relatively low frequency sine wave 154 associated therewith. The
        laser sphere 126 is provided with an outer coating of copper 128
        which substantially fully reflects relatively low frequencies
        such as the incoming wave 152. However, after repeated
        reflection from the surface 128, harmonic energy is generated
        and this higher frequency energy is radiated out through the
        coating 128 as indicated by the arrow 156 and the associated
        higher frequency sine wave 158. </p>
      <p>FIG. 14 shows an alternative arrangement of passive resonator
        for use with the gas discharge tube 66 and the reaction chamber
        64, as shown in FIG. 2. More specifically, FIG. 14 shows a thin
        coating 160 directly on the outer surface of the quartz envelope
        for the gas discharge tube 66. This coating 160 is of the high
        frequency transmissive type such as the aluminum layer, the
        characteristic of which is shown in FIG. 9 of the drawings. In
        addition, a thicker coating 162 of a fully reflecting metal is
        laid down on top of the coating 160, but with slots permitting
        radiation to pass through at a number of points around the
        periphery of the tube 66. On the other hand, even when radiation
        passes through the layer 160, if it is in the vicinity of the
        thicker fully reflecting layer elements 162, it cannot pass
        through, but is reflected back into the space within the
        discharge tubes 66. Finally, after numerous reflections within
        the gas discharge envelope 66, as indicated by the
        characteristics 164, certain higher frequency radiations which
        have been generated pass through one of the slots in the layer
        162 and enter the space 166 between the coated envelope 66 and
        the peripherally extending slotted conductor 168 interposed
        radially between the central discharge tube and the main
        reaction chamber region 170. The purpose of the slotted
        reflector 168 is to cause further reflections back and forth
        within the region 166, finally permitting even higher
        frequencies, having correspondingly more energetic photons, as
        indicated by the wave packet 172, to pass out into the reaction
        zone 170. </p>
      <p>FIG. 15 shows a somewhat different structure following similar
        principles as the arrangements of FIG. 14 and certain earlier
        embodiments of the invention. In FIG. 15, between the centrally
        located gaseous discharge tubes 66 and the outer walls 64 of the
        reaction chamber, are included the quartz or aluminum oxide tube
        176 which is coated with a thin aluminum layer 178, and the
        reflecting heavy metal cylinder 180 which is provided with
        angled slots 182. The higher frequencies which pass through the
        aluminum coating 178 are reflected back and forth between the
        reflecting surface of the cylinder 180 and the layer 178, until
        the higher frequency radiations finally impinge on one of the
        slots and are transmitted through, as indicated by arrows 184,
        into the reaction chamber 186. </p>
      <p>Now that the principal elements of structure which are included
        in the system have been described it is appropriate to mention
        some of the background factors which lead to the structures
        which have been described. Initially, in the following tables,
        the energy required for molecular dissociation is set forth in
        Table No. I, and the energy required for ionization at the
        lowest levels, both for atoms and molecules is set forth in
        Table II, as follows: </p>
      <p>______________________________________ ENERGY REQUIRED FOR
        MOLECULAR DISSOCIATION Molecule Electron Volts (eV)

        ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>From Table II it is evident that, for the ionization of a
        molecule of water vapor by a single photon, it is necessary that
        it have a wavelength less than 984.1 angstroms, or a higher
        frequency. At lesser energy levels involving longer wavelengths
        and lower frequencies, multi-photon absorption is required for
        the ionization of water vapor. Further, if a single molecule
        vapor is hit with a large number of high energy photons in a
        short period of time, even where each of the photons could have
        ionized the molecule by itself, the energy may still be absorbed
        by the molecule with the result that highly energetic output
        products are produced. </p>
      <p>In the present system as shown in FIG. 1, each of the mercury
        vapor arc lamps is capable of emitting approximately 10,000
        joules of radiated energy, and the set of six therefore produces
        the order of 60,000 joules. For mercury vapor, this energy is
        emitted in the form of 13 principal spectral lines. While other
        fainter or weaker output frequencies are present, these 13
        principal lines are more important ones and were accepted for
        design calculations. None of these radiations are acceptably
        effective at the wavelength as emitted, as they do not couple
        strongly with the absorption bands of water vapor and are
        accordingly relatively ineffective. In the present examples, the
        wavelengths are compressed, on the average, to about 25% of the
        normal emissions. Of course, the corresponding increase of the
        frequencies is approximately 400%. </p>
      <p>The wave compression is accomplished within the passive
        resonators by restraining and containing all input radiation
        within the resonator cavities until the compression level
        reaches the design point at which all the radiation energy
        contained in the resonator cavities is "dumped" automatically in
        an action called "cavity-dumping". </p>
      <p>The energy emitted by the resonators, except for some heat
        losses, is nominally the same amount of energy which entered the
        resonators. Of course, the characteristics are entirely
        different, and the differences may be studied by comparing
        Tables III and IV set forth below: </p>

      <p>In considering the foregoing tables, it may be noted that the
        sum of the power of the 13 frequencies from the mercury vapor
        lamps is 60,000 joules, and the sum of the power in the four
        representative frequencies indicating the nature of the higher
        frequency radiation, is also equal to 60,000 joules.
        Incidentally, Table IV is derived in part from FIG. 9 and is
        based on the use of an aluminum film as the filter at the ouput
        of the resonator. </p>
      <p>The wave compression action reduces the number of photons to
        about 24% or 25% of the original number of photons comprising
        the "pumping energy". However, ignoring the nominal heat losses
        from convection, the amount of energy carried by these fewer
        numbers of photons is still approximately equal to the 60,000
        joules which were initially present. Each individual (averaged)
        photon leaving the resonators is carrying about 415% more
        (redistributed) energy than the individual photon entering the
        resonators. The resonators restrain the wavelengths to those
        wavelengths between about 600 angstroms to about 1500 angstroms.
        With resonators employing films having different cutoff
        frequencies or wavelengths, the frequency could be shifted
        higher, with correspondingly shorter wavelengths to reduce the
        wavelengths to below 200 angstroms. </p>
      <p>A crude analogy to this optical wave compression may be found
        in a simple high temperature ceramic kiln as mentioned
        hereinabove. The heating elements are continually pumping the
        kiln with long-wave infrared radiation. The insulation contains
        the energy, and the temperatures climb upward. As the radiated
        infrared energy continues to irradiate the kiln interior from
        the heating elements, the color of the kiln interior changes
        from dull red, to bright cherry red, to orange-red, to orange,
        to yellow, to white, and finally to blue-white. These color
        changes reflect the "wave compression" of the radiated energy
        contained within the kiln cavity. </p>
      <p>More rigorous mathematical analysis reaching the same
        conclusions may be accomplished using square well potential
        theory and Schroedinger's equation, following the approach set
        forth in the text entitled, "Quantum Physics of Atoms,
        Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, and Particles", by Robert Eisberg and
        Robert Resnick, copyright 1974 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.,
        pages 226 through 239, and Appendix G, pages G1 through G6. </p>
      <p>Incidentally, the beating together of two or more radiations,
        such as those of 1500 and of 1100 Angstrom units wavelength, in
        the presence of media discontinuities, such as the feedstock, in
        the reaction chamber, will produce additional higher frequency
        radiation, as a result of the sum and difference frequencies
        (particularly the sum frequencies) which are generated. </p>
      <p>Now, returning to the drawings, FIG. 16 indicates
        diagrammatically some of the phenomena which occur within the
        reaction chamber. In connection with FIG. 16, attention is
        particularly directed to Table I which shows the energy required
        for molecular dissociation, Table II indicating the energy
        required for the ionization of various atoms and molecules, and
        Table IV which indicates the energy levels present in the high
        frequency radiations from the resonant chambers. It is also
        noted that, with the geometry employed in connection with the
        present structures, the water vapor supplied to the reaction
        chambers is flooded with very high frequency and high intensity
        radiation having energy content adequate for dissociation and
        ionization. Under these conditions, the phenomenon of
        "multiphoton absorption" in which a single atom or molecule
        absorbs a large number of photons within a short interval of
        time, also frequently takes place. It is also noted that the
        ionization reaction in each atom and molecule is surrounded, or
        "caged" by large numbers of un-ionized water vapor molecules so
        that the energy generated, both in terms of the kinetic energy
        of electrons and positive ions, as well as the generated
        photons, will impinge on these other water vapor molecules and
        ionize or dissociate them, in turn. </p>
      <p>In the showing of FIG. 16, the reaction starts with the
        impingement of a large number of high energy photons 192 on the
        water vapor molecule 194 in a multiphoton absorption process
        involving the arrival of the photons 192 within a very short
        interval such that they are all absorbed by the water vapor
        molecule 194. Now, referring back to Table IV, we will assume,
        for simplicity, that all of the incident photons 192 have energy
        equal to 20 electron volts, making a total of 160 electron
        volts, which is substantially instantaneously absorbed by the
        water molecule 194. With only about 2.51 electron volts being
        required for the molecular dissociation of water vapor, and with
        only 12.6 electron volts being required for the ionization of
        the atoms and molecules of water vapor, the applied 160 electron
        volts will "blast" the molecular structure apart. In addition to
        fully dissociating and ionizing the hydrogen and oxygen atoms
        included in the water vapor molecule, very large amounts of
        kinetic energy are supplied to the resultant charged particles,
        including the electrons and atomic nuclei. The dashed lines 196
        and 198 extending from the water vapor molecule 194 indicate the
        high velocity particles emanating from the original location, in
        this simplistic showing of FIG. 16. </p>
      <p>The ejected electrons are instantly subject to "recapture" by
        any proton nucleus. In the electron-ion recombination "capture"
        process, the electron must go from a free (positive energy)
        state, to a bound (negative energy) state, and the electronic
        energy of the system must be reduced. Also, in a positive
        ion-negative ion recombination, a similar reduction in
        electronic energy must be achieved in order for the electron to
        transfer from the negative ion to the positive ion, thereby
        neutralizing the system. Then, in both cases, the electronic
        energy which is released in the course of a recombination event,
        must be transmitted from this location; this energy may appear
        in the form of electromagnetic radiation, internal modes of
        vibration, or rotation if molecules are involved, or
        translational kinetic energy of any particles participating in
        the capture process. </p>
      <p>In the qualitative diagram of FIG. 16, a pair of recapture
        events is shown at 200 with the resultant high energy
        ultraviolet photon being indicated at 202, impinging on an
        additional pair of water vapor molecules 204, and ionizing each
        of them in the next step of the chain event. It may also be
        noted that, during the successive stages of recombination,
        photons of radiated energy are emitted comprised of the specific
        frequencies that are characteristic of the atomic structures.
        Such radiations are indicated by the reference numerals 206.
        These radiations may vary widely in their frequency and their
        energy content, and may include, for example, both radio
        frequency and infrared radiations. Through the phenomenon of
        multiphoton absorption, many of these radiations will impinge on
        other molecules or atoms substantially simultaneously with other
        incident radiations on the same molecule or atom, and cause
        dissociation or ionization through this multiphoton absorption
        process. </p>
      <p>Successive additional steps of ionization of further water
        vapor molecules is indicated, going from the bottom to the top
        of FIG. 16, by the row of four water vapor molecules 208 in the
        third level, and in the row of eight water vapor molecules 210
        in the fourth stage. </p>
      <p>Quantum Physics indicates that the captured electrons in each
        case can have only discrete energies corresponding to atomic
        energy levels detailed in the technical literature. As the newly
        bound electrons seek the lowest energy level, the successive
        downward transitions release precise quantized packets of
        radiations as photons, with clearly defined spectral lines that
        are superposed at precise frequencies on the spectrum of
        continuous radiation. The downward cascade of the captured
        electron, within the quantized ladder of bound energy levels,
        leads first to the emission of extremely long wavelengths from
        levels high within the atom. Then, infrared radiation is
        emitted. This is followed by visible and an abundance of
        ultraviolet radiation of very short wavelengths. </p>
      <p>Returning to FIG. 16, by the time that the photons strike the
        eight water vapor molecules 210, the energy level is
        insufficient for ionization, so the phenomenon merely involves
        dissociation at the two upper levels, where the sixteen water
        vapor molecules are designated by the reference numeral 212, and
        the final thirty-two reaction products by the reference numeral
        214. </p>
      <p>In the diagram of FIG. 16, thirty-three water vapor molecules
        have been dissociated. Further, this all originated with a
        single molecule 194 which was powerfully and energetically
        ionized by the original incident packets of high frequency
        energy. </p>
      <p>Some of the points to be noted from the diagram of FIG. 16 are
        first, that merely because a number of photons are absorbed by a
        single water vapor molecule, this does not mean that the excess
        energy is lost. Instead, this excess energy is re-radiated and
        utilized in further dissociation and ionization reactions.
        Secondly, the very high intensity levels of radiation which are
        present in the reaction chambers of the invention contributes to
        the multiphoton ionization and dissociation which in some cases
        over-excites molecules; and in other cases, when the individual
        photons could not dissociate or ionize alone, the convergence of
        several photons on the single molecule or atom will cause such
        action. In addition, the moderately high concentration of water
        vapor molecules will "cage" the radiation which occurs
        immediately adjacent the sources of radiant energy, so that the
        excess energies are appropriately utilized. </p>
      <p>Turning to another phase of the invention, it is important to
        note that the chain reaction mechanism is initiated by radiation
        supplied from the central discharge tubes, outside of the
        reaction chamber per se. This input of primary radiation can be
        supplied either continuously or in a pulsed sequence according
        to design. Either continuous or pulsed radiation of appropriate
        wavelength as input to the reaction chamber will initiate large
        numbers of working chains. As indicated in FIG. 16, product
        atoms and molecules carry away both internal and kinetic energy.
        These "excited atoms", both hydrogen and oxygen, can be
        manipulated, quenched, controlled, or combined into desirable
        product molecules. </p>
      <p>Incidentally, returning to FIG. 1, the system is designed to
        minimize the size of the electrical component associated with
        the unit by energizing the mercury vapor tubes associated with
        the successive reaction chambers sequentially, for discrete
        intervals. At present, a duty cycle for each tube of one second
        is contemplated with the successive tubes being fired in order,
        and the initial tube being energized for another one second
        interval, every six seconds. </p>
      <p>Returning now to the Figures of the drawings, FIGS. 17 through
        21 of the drawings show a further alternative arrangement. More
        specifically, with reference to FIG. 17, this diagram is a
        simplistic showing of the use of a series of three apertured
        conductive members 232, 234 and 236, with the screens 232 and
        234 defining a first resonator therebetween, and the screens 234
        and 236 defining a second resonator. In addition, associated
        with each of the screens 234 and 236 would be a high frequency
        short length wave filter element for permitting the transmission
        of very high frequencies in the ultra violet band but not
        frequencies in the visible or near ultraviolet frequency bands.
      </p>
      <p>In the schematic showing of FIG. 17, radiation from the
        discharge lamp is indicated as arriving at arrow 238, and this
        would be longer wavelength and lower frequency energy. Following
        processing in the two resonators and passing through the high
        frequency transmission filters associated with the reflecting
        surfaces 234 and 236, high frequency and high intensity
        ultraviolet radiation is transmitted into the reaction chamber
        as indicated by the arrow 240. FIG. 18 is a more accurate view
        of the perforated screen which would make up each of the
        reflectors 232, 234 and 236. It could, for example, be made of a
        relatively thick self supporting layer of aluminum, stainless
        steel, or other high reflectivity materials. </p>
      <p>FIG. 19 is a greatly enlarged cross-sectional view of the
        screen 234 showing the solid portion 242 and one of the many
        holes or apertures 244. The filter for permitting the
        transmission of far ultraviolet radiations and for reflecting
        visible light and near ultraviolet radiations may take the form
        of a two-layer film including a substrate 246 of rolled silver
        and a vapor deposited coating of aluminum 248, which is applied
        to the thin rolled layer 246 of siler after it is secured in
        place on the screen 234 by epoxy glue or the like. The silver
        layer is rolled very thin in a manner similar to gold leaf, and
        may be only a few angstrom units thick. With reference to FIG. 9
        of the drawings, it may be noted that the silver layer will
        transmit most ultraviolet radiations shorter than about 3100
        Angstroms; however, the aluminum layer does not transmit
        significant amounts of radiation until the wavelength is
        significantly shorter than 2000 Angstroms, and then transmits
        freely below 1000 Angstroms. Accordingly, the use of the very
        thin rolled silver layer for support of the vapor deposited
        aluminum layer 248 is a convenient technique for obtaining the
        desired transmission qualities. In addition, the diagram of FIG.
        19 may represent other earlier embodiments of the invention
        described hereinabove in which 244 would be a slot in one of the
        cylindrical members 242, and the laminated film 246, 248 would
        cover these slots. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 20 and 21 indicate diagrammatically the incorporation of
        the three reflecting surfaces 232, 234 and 238 into a structure
        enclosing a gas discharge device 252 and providing high
        frequency radiation as indicated by the arrow 240 into the outer
        reaction chambers shown in the earlier embodiments of the
        invention. </p>
      <p><b>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</b> </p>
      <p>Any oscillator can be turned into an amplifier by providing a
        suitable type of feedback. In the present oscillator/resonator,
        "feedback" is provided by means of highly reflective mirrored
        surfaces at both ends of an optical path traversing the
        oscillator cavity. The energy that starts the oscillation enters
        the cavity through the optical windows facing the gas discharge
        device in the arrangements of FIGS. 14 and 15 for example. FIGS.
        17 through 21 show alternative similar structures using
        apertures instead of slots. </p>
      <p>The end mirrored surfaces of a resonator "define" a resonator,
        and, existing in all resonators are normal modes or resonances .
        . . field configurations that represent "energy storage within
        the resonator", and are self-sustaining with the resonator for
        relatively long periods of time. The modes of an optical
        resonator are similar to those of a microwave resonator in that
        they represent configurations of the electromagnetic field that
        are determined by boundary conditions. </p>
      <p>It is common to speak of the configuration in the X, Y,
        directions as the spatial or transverse mode configuration, and
        quite independently to speak of the Z direction as the
        longitudinal or temporal mode configuration. In the arrangements
        disclosed herein, the "Z" direction is radial, perpendicular to
        the windows and the reflecting walls. </p>
      <p>For simplicity we will drop the use of the word "configuration"
        when speaking further of the resonator modes. </p>
      <p>The frequencies at which temporal modes can occur are set by
        the boundary conditions at the reflective surfaces, which
        determine that oscillation can occur only when there are an
        integral number of half-wavelength between the reflective
        surfaces. A basic characteristic of the modes of any resonator
        is, that they represent energy storage within the resonator as
        noted earlier. </p>
      <p>The resonators disclosed herein are (by design) short in the Z
        direction, unlike normal commercial resonators, also, as
        compared to the X and Y directions. Short oscillators offer an
        advantage in that the normal mode separation is quite large, in
        fact larger than the mean width of the Doppler profile. In this
        case, stable oscillation in a single mode can be achieved even
        though the cavity gain is considerably above threshold.
        Additionally, on an absolute basis, a short resonator/oscillator
        will experience less distortions per given thermal or mechanical
        disturbance than a long one. The only known major disadvantage
        of the short resonator is that its gain per pass is less. </p>
      <p>In the design of short lasers for single-frequency operation,
        the length of the resonator/oscillator must be dictated by the
        Doppler width, as well as gain available and other less
        important considerations. </p>
      <p>The short "Z" as used in the present arrangements does not
        result in (or create) modified energy distribution by
        diffraction effects as is the case (normally) with long "Z".
        Near-field and far-field distribution remain the same with short
        "Z" distance. </p>
      <p>In a mode denoted by the notation TEM.sub.mnq, the number "q"
        denoted the nodes in the electric field between the end
        reflective surfaces. The number of half-wavelengths in the
        resonator is then either q or q plus 1, depending in detail on
        the spatial mode for normal resonators. </p>
      <p>If q' is an integer that denotes either q or q plus 1, as
        appropriate, then the wavelength of the oscillation is given by
      </p>
      <p>and the frequency is therefore given by </p>
      <p>The frequency separation between Modes corresponding to q' and
        q'+1 is therefore given by </p>
      <p>where C is the mean speed of light in the medium and L is the
        length of the optical path between the reflective surfaces. </p>
      <p>When the optical path between the reflective surfaces traverses
        solids as in solid lasers, L becomes an "effective length" by
        taking into account possible wavelength changes because of
        refractive index effects. The quantity C/2L, is therefore
        fundamental to many details of oscillator operation. Incidently,
        it is also the inverse of the time required for a radiated
        signal to travel a complete round trip through the oscillator
        (or resonator), starting through the entry opening and bouncing
        between the two reflective surfaces. </p>
      <p>When a resonator/oscillator is functioning in many spatial
        modes as well as in several temporal modes, then the frequency
        allocations of the various modes become much more complex, and
        will not be treated here. </p>
      <p>The accumulated energy is coupled out of the resonator cavity
        at the desired wavelength/frequency by providing output
        reflective (mirrors) with transmission T, that is reflective at
        the optical pump input frequencies and transmitting at the
        desired output frequencies, as discussed to some extent
        hereinabove in connection with FIG. 9. This fundamental
        characteristic can be "predetermined by design", can be
        structured by means of "narrow band-pass reflectors", which can
        be produced by the layered combination of suitable materials in
        discrete multi-element (or multi-compound) assemblies with
        appropriate thicknesses and stack positions. </p>
      <p>The "CAVITY DUMPING SYSTEM" of the present invention can best
        be described by comparing it to a well-known laser system called
        "PULSE-TRANSMISSION MODE Q-SWITCHING", which is a means for
        generating extremely short (time) Q-switched laser pulses by
        Q-switching a laser with 100 percent reflective mirrors on both
        ends of the oscillator cavity, and then at the peak of the
        stored accumulation of energy, rapidly switching the output
        mirror from 100 percent to a very low percent reflection, or
        high transmission. This allows a very rapid dumping of the
        accumulated optical energy from within the cavity. </p>
      <p>The present apparatus (like most lasers), uses electrical
        energy as a source for power. The electrical energy is converted
        into radiation by means of conventional noble gas, metal vapor
        discharge lamps or special filament lamps. The selection and use
        of a particular lamp (pump) is controlled by the type of
        emissions desired and whether the lamp or pump driver will be
        operated in a continuous or pulsed mode. The discharge lamps
        employed in the implementation of the present invention operate
        at modest current densities and represent a compromise between a
        monochromatic source and a black body source such as filaments.
      </p>
      <p>The apparatus of the present invention is so structured that
        all the diverse input wavelengths are combined into a relatively
        monochromatic narrow band of ultraviolet frequencies. The lamps
        or optical pumps must be structured of suitable materials so
        that the lamp envelope is transparent to the desired wavelengths
        of radiated energy. Available envelope materials (and expense)
        places very limited parameters on the transmission
        characteristics of the lamps. </p>
      <p>Different materials must be used to make lamp envelopes for
        different desired wavelength emissions, because the transparency
        of the available materials to the radiated energy varies from
        wavelength to wavelength. Glass transmits radiation (light) in
        the visible region; however, quartz (SiO.sub.2) must be used on
        the ultraviolet side of the visible spectrum. For practical
        purposes, quartz is opaque to wavelength much shorter than 2,000
        Angstroms, and must be replaced by very expensive SUPRASIL brand
        quality quartz, which is a very superior grade quartz that does
        transmit extremely well at 1 mm thickness at 1700 angstroms (85
        percent). </p>
      <p>Calcium Fluorite (CaF2) may be used (at considerable expense),
        which transmits well at 1600 Angstroms. Many attempts have been
        made to find other materials (such as sapphire tubing) to extend
        the transmission much further down into the vacuum ultraviolet
        range, which are practical for lamp manufacturing in large
        quantities and sizes as well as being practical from an economic
        point of view. No acceptable materials have emerged. </p>
      <p>For the purposes of the present invention, we are interested
        (principally) in the wavelengths from 1,000 down to about 500
        Angstroms, with nothing longer than 1500 Angstroms. </p>
      <p>Since the commercial lamps that operate as optical pumps
        actually emit lower frequency broad-band radiation by comparison
        to both lasers and the desired output frequencies for the
        present invention, we must "accept" these multiple spectral
        lines into our resonator, combine the multiple spectral lines
        into a narrow band of substantially monochromatic radiation and
        then by means of our cavity-dumping system, build up the
        energy-frequency relationship which shortens the wavelength
        before we dump the energy from the cavity. </p>
      <p>This frequency conversion is a continuous and progressive
        operation which requires a nominal part of a second for
        conversion of a photon. It occurs inside a sealed reaction
        chamber and floods the reaction chamber (photochemical) with
        large amounts of powerful radiation at selected, predetermined
        spectral bands. </p>
      <p><b>FREQUENCY/WAVELENGTH/ENERGY RELATIONSHIPS</b> </p>
      <p>All electromagnetic radiation can be characterized by its
        particular wavelength, lambda, .lambda. (measured in meters,
        centimeters, or Angstrom units), or by its wavenumber, nu, .nu.
        (the reciprocal of the wavelength, .nu.=1/.lambda., commonly
        expressed in reciprocal centimeters, 1/cm, or cm.sup.-1). </p>
      <p>Each unit of radiation (a photon) corresponds to a QUANTUM of
        radiant energy, E, which is directly proportional to the
        wavenumber, .nu.. Since chemical calculations are founded on a
        MOLE basis, when considering the relationship between radiant
        energy and chemical processes it is convenient to express
        radiant energy in Kcal/mole of photons, or Kcal/einstein. </p>
      <p>We can do this according to a simple relationship: the radiant
        energy in 1 mole of photons, with .nu.=350 cm.sup.-1, is equal
        to 1 Kcal. </p>
      <p>The derivation of the above simple relationship proceeds as
        follows: </p>
      <p>The energy of a photon with a given wavenumber, .nu., is given
        by the expression: </p>
      <p>In this expression, h is Planck's constant
        h=6.62.times.10.sup.-27 erg.times.sec) and c is the velocity of
        light (c=3.00.times.10.sup.10 cm/sec), and .nu. is expressed in
        cm.sup.-1. Therefore, the quantum of energy corresponding to a
        photon of a given wavenumber is: ##EQU1## We can express this
        quantum of energy in the Kcal units by using the conversion
        factor 1 erg=2.39.times.10.sup.-11 kcal, as follows: ##EQU2##
        and the energy in 1 mole of photons (6.023.times.10.sup.23
        photons) is: ##EQU3## </p>
      <p>The conversion factor between cm.sup.-1 and kcal/mole is: </p>
      <p>As an example, the energy of photons with .nu.=20,000 cm.sup.-1
        is: ##EQU4## And the energy of a single photon of .nu.=20,000
        cm.sup.-1 : ##EQU5## Further, physicists normally think in terms
        of "electron-volts," eV, which is defined as the amount of
        energy equal to the change in energy of one electronic charge
        when it moves through a potential difference of one volt. Since
        the electron-volt is an energy unit, it is in the same category
        as the foot-pound, the British thermal unit, and the
        kilowatt-hour. </p>
      <p>Energies in joules can be converted to electron-volts when
        divided by e.sub.c =1.60.times.10.sup.-19. In this case (only),
        the e.sub.c is not a charge but is a conversion factor having
        the units of joules per electron-volt. </p>
      <p>It is quite convenient to express photon energies in
        electron-volts. As an example, we will calculate the energy of
        1200 A radiation expressed in electron-volts. ##EQU6## Then,
        converting from joules to electron-volts: ##EQU7## </p>
      <p>In the illustrative embodiments of the invention, radiated
        energy is accepted from the optical pump in all of the different
        wavelengths which the pump emits. As an example, the pump
        H15K/77A (mercury vapor) emits 13 different wavelengths that
        vary from 2420 A to about 10,150 A., and these were set forth in
        Table III. </p>
      <p>As mentioned above, the "wave-compression" is accomplished in
        the resonators where electromagnetic fields can exist whose
        distributions of amplitudes and phases reproduce themselves upon
        repeated reflections between mirrored surfaces. These particular
        electromagnetic field configurations comprise the transverse
        modes of a passive resonator. The "wave-compression" was
        calculated by means of Schroedinger equations involving the
        Infinite Square-well Potential. </p>
      <p>The "INFINITE SQUARE WELL POTENTIAL" analysis approach is often
        used in quantum mechanics to represent a condition in which a
        particle-wave duality moves in a restricted region of space
        under the influence of forces which hold it in that region.
        Although this simplistic potential loses some details of the
        motion, it retains the essential feature, which is binding a
        wave-particle to a region of a certain size, by means of forces
        of certain characteristics. The resonators employed in the
        present systems, with their output filter are clearly analogous
        to the physical systems which have previously been analyzed
        using the square well potential approach. </p>
      <p>The resonator cavities are designed to restrain and retain the
        input radiation by means of repeated reflections and
        replications, through a period of wavelength compression. This
        compression of the wavelength occurs during the "energy
        (radiated) input period". An accurate analogy is well-known and
        proven, termed MULTIPHOTON ABSORPTION. This method and means, of
        raising the energy level of a molecule or atom, within the very
        limited time parameter of less than 10.sup.-8 second, also
        raises the frequency in direct relationship with the increase in
        energy. In other words, the higher the energy, the more numerous
        are the oscillations and the higher is the wavenumber. </p>
      <p>The quantum mechanical probability density oscillates more and
        more as "n" increases. In the limit that "n" approaches
        infinity, that is for eigenvalues of very high energy, the
        oscillations are so compressed that no experiment could possibly
        have the resolution to observe anything other than the average
        behavior of the probability density predicted by quantum
        mechanics. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the fractional separation of the eigenvalues
        approach zero as "n" approaches inifinity, so that this becomes
        a limiting factor in that their discreteness cannot be resolved.
        We have observed that quantum mechanical predictions actually
        approach the predictions of classical mechanics in the large
        quantum number, or high density limit. This is to be expected
        from the correspondence principle of the old quantum theory. </p>
      <p>Reference is also made to my prior granted patents, U.S. Pat.
        Nos. 4,113,589 and 4,148,701, which are directed to related
        inventions. More specifically, the efficiency of the apparatus
        disclosed in the present specification is enhanced, as in the
        case of the earlier inventions in part as a result of the low
        energy content gaseous products which are released in the course
        of the process. These low energy gasous products may include HO
        and HO.sub.2, which are less well known gaseous products. When
        these gaseous products are released into the atmosphere, it is
        believed that they absorb high frequency radiations, and
        eventually change state, become hydrogen gas, oxygen gas, water
        vapor, atomic hydrogen and atomic oxygen, with the inputs to the
        present system including water and oxygen in air. In one sense,
        therefore, the present system may be considered to utilize solar
        energy. </p>
      <p>It is also noted that the prior copending U.S. patent
        application Ser. No. 879,226 discloses a number of chain
        reactions in addition to those of the type shown in FIG. 16.
        These other types of chain reactions, including gases other than
        water vapor, could be implemented by the present invention. Some
        of these reactions included the reaction of hydrogen gas with
        chlorine to form HCl gas; the reaction of methane with chlorine
        to form methyl chloride; hydrogenation and olefin formation; the
        dehydration of alcohols; additional reactions of olefins; and to
        reactions involving poly-substituted saturated hydrocarbons,
        benzene, unsaturated hydrocarbons, including the alkyne series,
        alcohols, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and ketones. </p>
      <p>For completeness, reference is made to certain text material
        relating to ionization. These include a 1958 text entitled,
        "Gaseous Conductors" by James Dillon Cobine, Dover Publications,
        Inc., 180 Varick Street, New York, N.Y., 10014, in which note
        particularly pages 86 through 91; and "Atom and Ion Sources", by
        L. Valyi, John Wiley &amp; Sons, London, 1977, in which pages 24
        through 45 are of interest. </p>
      <p>Also, concerning another aspect of the present invention, in
        connection with FIG. 9 of the drawings, the matter of coatings
        which reflect longer wavelength, and which freely transmit
        wavelengths in the far ultraviolet region, were noted, and the
        advantages of thin aluminum films was brought out. Other films
        which could be employed include a film of magnesium on chromium,
        which has a cutoff frequency in the range between 2000 and 1200
        angstroms. Films of iron are also useful for certain
        applications. It is further noted that successive layers of
        certain dielectric coatings, either alone or in combination with
        other layers, have been developed which can be designed to cut
        off at desired frequencies. </p>
      <p>Returning now to FIG. 1, it is noted that the electrical
        switching and power supply circuit 32 provides sequential
        energization of the mercury vapor discharge devices within the
        reaction chambers 21 through 26, with switching circuitry being
        of conventional configuration, and avoiding the need for a
        higher capacity power supply. Concerning the feedback tubes 60
        from the manifold 54 to the individual reaction chambers 21
        through 26, these feedback arrangements may be connected to any
        desired point along the reaction chambers, and could be
        connected centrally if desired or to the input point in each of
        these reaction chambers 21 through 26. It is further noted that,
        along with the water vapor supplied from the steam generator 40
        through the tubing 42, additional oxygen or air may be supplied
        to each of the reaction chambers through the inlet conduit 42.
        This would permit the formation of larger quantities of hydrogen
        peroxide, H.sub.2 O.sub.2, when larger quantities of this output
        gas are desired. </p>
      <p>Incidentally, concerning operating parameters of the system,
        the six gas discharge tubes may be one inch in diameter and
        approximately 51 inches long; they may have quartz, pyrex, or
        lime glass envelopes, and may operate with a voltage of 10,000
        volts at about seven amperes, for each tube. Concerning
        pressures, to avoid condensation of the water vapor the
        temperature in the reaction chamber should be maintained above
        100 degrees Centigrade, and could be as high as several hundred
        degrees. With regard to pressure, it is contemplated that the
        reaction chambers may operate at from one to several atmospheres
        pressure. Although the system would be operative at high
        temperatures and pressures, less problems are encountered at the
        indicated ranges. </p>
      <p>In closing, it is emphasized that the present invention is not
        limited to the precise structure as illustrated in the drawings
        and described in the foregoing detailed description. More
        specifically, other resonator configurations could be employed,
        both of the passive and active types; the reaction chambers
        could be operated in parallel rather than in series, either in
        whole or in part; and the reaction chambers could be if desired,
        of a more circuitous design, for example, with quartz tubes or
        helical metal baffles providing longer paths for each of the
        individual water vapor molecules; and other changes in
        mechanical, optical, or electrical configuration may be made
        within the scope of the invention as taught. Accordingly, the
        invention is not limited to the precise illustrated
        configurations. </p>
