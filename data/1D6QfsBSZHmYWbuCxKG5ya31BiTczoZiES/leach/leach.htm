        <p><b>H2O &gt;&gt;TC3 = Hydrogen Fuel</b> </p>
        <p><b>Jim McFarland</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Ever since man began valuing some substances more than others,
        there has been continuous effort --- scientific and
        sot-so-scientific --- expended toward the transmutation of the
        stuff nobody want into the stuff everybody wants. In the Middle
        Ages it was lead into gold. With the dawn of the era of the
        automobile, it was water into gasoline. More recently it has
        been VW Beetles into Bugattis, Grand Prix Mercedes, and
        Bentleys. However, at least one of these dreams seems on the
        verge of becoming reality --- the conversion of water into
        hydrogen fuel. It’s not gasoline, but it is a viable source of
        highway power and it can be generated from an onboard system.
        Jim McFarland,. Former publisher and editor of <i>Hot Rod
          Magazine</i>, now with Edelbrock Equpment Company, has been
        following this project almost since its inception. --- Ed. </p>
      <p>It has been proposed that hydrogen is the building block of all
        chemistry, whereby hydrogen could be produced from water by
        practical means, society’s reliance on petrochemical fuels would
        be substantially reduced --- perhaps, in fact, eliminated. But
        there have been problems in the development of such processes.
        The processes most commonly discussed, coal gasification and
        electrolysis of water, have required more energy to produce the
        hydrogen than the energy available from the hydrogen produced, a
        case of more input than output resulting in a lack of cost
        effectiveness in hydrogen production. If it were possible to
        devise a machine whose output energy was greater than its input
        energy, a so-called exothermic process would result. The problem
        here was in the basic laws of thermodynamics. But that was
        before the development of the SLX process. </p>
      <p>For years, this process has been under development by Omnia
        Research Corporation, a California-based organization. Through
        the intense efforts of this group, it appears a breakthrough of
        major proportions has been accomplished. So with a view toward
        how this process could impact everyday modes of transportation,
        let’s examine how ordinary water could be used as feedstock for
        the production of hydrogen fuel for internal combustion engines.
      </p>
      <p>Water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen --- there are two
        hydrogen atoms for every oxygen atom in each molecule, resulting
        in the common symbol H2O. The bonding of the atoms is based on a
        form of magnetic attraction. Given conditions that might alter
        this magnetic attraction, it is possible to separate the two.
        Keep in mind that there is nothing of radioactive interaction
        here. If an oxygen atom (while it is attracted to a hydrogen
        atom) is placed in an environment more favorable to attraction
        of another element or substance, the hydrogen atom is left free
        to find another home. Simply stated, it’s like magnets that are
        made to repel, not attract, each other, and seek other sources
        of attraction. </p>
      <p>It has been suggested that hydrogen and oxygen atoms could be
        disassociated by the right process. If water were to be
        conditioned in terms of temperature and pressure, and subjected
        to a particular chemical substance (a reactant), contained
        oxygen atoms and released hydrogen atoms might result. In fact,
        this is the basis of the new SLX process. </p>
      <p>In an enclosed vessel, water is heated to a temperature of
        about 300 F it is next introduced into a reaction chamber
        containing material that will interact with water. Under
        specific conditions of temperature and pressure, the reactant
        captures oxygen atoms and holds them while releasing atoms of
        hydrogen. The process could be called an exothermic oxidizing
        reaction: It causes reaction heat to be generated, since heat is
        the prime ingredient. Once free from the oxygen atoms, the
        hydrogen atoms are reunited by a photochemical process that
        releases reaction heat and results in hydrogen molecules. What
        we have are two reactions taking place simultaneously and
        interdependently within the same reaction chamber. These
        reactions both liberate and recombine hydrogen atoms to form H2.
        The potential enormity of such a discovery is staggering. </p>
      <p>But let’s focus now on the use of hydrogen as fuel for our
        daily transportation (although it is really only one minor
        aspect of its importance). In an internal combustion engine like
        the 1.7-liter engine installed in Omnia research’s Plymouth
        Horizon TC3 laboratory mule, hydrogen burns much more quickly
        and at higher temperatures than gasoline. An engine intended to
        run on hydrogen requires changes to combustion chamber design,
        ignition, timing, combustion surface texture, method of fuel
        delivery, spark plugs, and combustion-exposed materials
        (pistons, rings, and valve heads, for example). Spark plug
        characteristics relative to cold-start versus warm-engine
        drivability also must be changed. Sudden burning of fuel and
        resulting cylinder pressure rises can lead to damaged pistons,
        rings, walls, gaskets, and bearings. Uncontrolled, these
        conditions could be compared to the detonation of gasoline in
        ordinary engines. </p>
      <p>But despite the differences in the rate of combustion between
        gasoline and hydrogen, there are specific benefits to be
        derived. Perhaps the most significant is that combustion of
        hydrogen largely produces water. Consequently, concerns for
        environmental pollution caused by petrochemicals are completely
        eliminated. Oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and unburned
        hydrocarbons are not major byproducts of hydrogen combustion.
        Open exhaust pipe tests performed in enclosed laboratories with
        the TC3 produce no traceable odors and show only water
        condensation at the tailpipe. In addition, there is substantial
        reduction in the amount of combustion residue formed in the
        combustion chambers of a hydrogen engine. The so-called
        heavy-ends of petrochemicals tend to produce residue in the
        exhaust systems of conventional engines. In fact, hydrogen acts
        as a scrubber and can reduce the amount of pollution in
        industrial smokestack. While this is more applicable to
        industrial use of hydrogen along with petrochemical fuels, we
        mention it here to show yet another benefit it could provide to
        conventional gasoline-fueled engines. </p>
      <p>As a retrofit system, there are possibilities under study.
        However, from a practical standpoint, other engine modification
        such as those previously mentioned would increase the amount of
        investment in a present-day production vehicle. Fuel savings
        would be substantial, and the payback period would be
        considerably shortened as compared to conventional fuel-saving
        retrofit devices. </p>
      <p>Detroit, on the other hand, would be in a better position to
        react to such a change in basic vehicle fuel. Internal
        metallurgical changes could be made to an engine’s interior
        without sweeping design alterations. The use of contemporary
        onboard fuel management systems could allow much greater
        precision in ignition timing and fuel-flow control. Costs of
        exhaust emission control equipment (catalytic converters, oxygen
        sensors, feedback carburetors, and similar devices) would be
        eliminated, thereby lowering overall vehicle cost. </p>
      <p>Omnia Research Corporation has already had authenticating
        energy balance tests performed by outside independent
        engineering consultants. These tests not only proved the
        validity of the SLX process as an exothermic (heat-producing)
        machine, but also verified that the present lab model could be
        up- or down-sized for a variety of uses (including that of
        onboard fuel production for highway vehicles). This you will
        note I the accompanying photographs of the Omnia hydrogen-fueled
        Horizon TC3. But even aside from OEM or aftermarket
        considerations, there are still other possibilities under study
        for applications of the process. </p>
      <p>For example, suppose we have a turbine-type device that’s
        capable of being fired by hydrogen. This could amount to a
        conventional turbo supercharger (turbine side) that would burn
        hydrogen for the purpose of turning a shaft connected to a set
        of planetary gears driving an alternator (compressor side). What
        we would have at this point is a hydrogen combustion process
        that generates shaft rpm delivered to a means of producing
        electrical power. Directed to a system of storage batteries,
        such a mechanism could provide continuing electrical recharge,
        in effect creating an infinite-range electric car that uses
        water as the source of fuel. Omnia’s Horizon is already in
        operation utilizing hydrogen as a fuel. The fact that it will
        start and run on hydrogen (acting against a road-load chassis
        dynamometer) is clear indication that a hydrogen-powered
        internal; combustion engine vehicle is possible. The basis for
        its fuel supply is a device incorporating the SLX process. </p>
      <p>Economical analysis of hydrogen versus gasoline in an internal
        combustion engine has already proven the cost-effective
        potential of H2 over gasoline. But, as readers of Motor Trend
        know, there are some aspects to be considered in the overall
        scheme of alternative fuels. Perhaps the most critical is
        hydrogen availability, which brings us back to the fundamentals
        of the SLX process. Incredibly, it offers the availability of an
        exothermic process where hydrogen is produced from deionized
        water. Since there is heat produced during the combined
        thermochemical and photochemical processes, liberation of heat
        in excess of that required to start and continue hydrogen
        production allows system efficiency in excess of 100%. Data
        gathered by a Chicago-based consulting firm showed a range of
        system efficiency from a low of 143% to a high of more than
        200%. It is this feature of the SLX process which has caused
        considerable stir within the scientific and academic
        Communities. </p>
      <p>The significance of this feature as applied to a vehicle is
        mind-boggling. For with this capability, it is possible to use a
        portion of the produced hydrogen to raise incoming water
        temperature to the level required prior to reaction chamber
        entry. Such excess would require the amount of hydrogen required
        for primary fuel consumption by the vehicle, and would further
        extend its driving range. </p>
      <p>The possibilities of hydrogen as fuel have long been known, and
        if the demonstrated capability of the SLX process becomes of
        widespread use to the automotive industry, automotive fuel
        availability and concerns for environmental impact by combustion
        engines may soon change radically. Further, when you consider
        that the ability to separate hydrogen and oxygen atoms allows
        for the synthesis of other fuels such as ethanol and methanol,
        we may be dealing with a process for which we do not have a
        current definition. For by the rearrangement by photochemical
        means of surplus hydrogen and oxygen atoms left over from the
        initial disassociation process many other&nbsp; O-H molecules
        (such as hydrogen peroxide) can be constructed. While continuing
        experiments are dealing with such secondary recovery techniques,
        the initial impact of the SLX process is yet to be felt. But it
        will be soon, for it offers the opportunity for science to work
        with a brand-new chemical erector set to build what is needed to
        keep society moving. </p>

      <p>"It's the greatest thing since sex," proclaims Patrick
        McDonald, vice president of MJM Hydrotech of Los Angeles. "There
        will be no reason to strip-mine for coal, no reason to run
        supertankers full of oil or build nuclear-power plants." The
        object of McDonald's enthusiasm is a mysterious stainless-steel
        case, about the size of a steamer trunk, equipped on the outside
        with six dials and a gas jet. It was developed by an equally
        mysterious 61-year-old Los Angeles inventor named Sam Leach, who
        claims it will do nothing less than produce combustible hydrogen
        from tap water - without any continous source of outside energy.
        If Leach is telling the truth, his hydrogen generator would
        satisfy a dream that scientists have had for decades; an
        unlimited supply of clean energy for homes, autos and industry
        at practically no cost. If he's not telling the truth, it could
        be the biggest business scam since hundreds were bilked by the
        promoter of the nonexistent Dale automobile. Leach says his
        device is really quite simple. Inside the case is an
        UNIDENTIFIED REACTANT METAL. Tap water is fed into the case and
        an electric charge is applied, turning the water to steam. The
        reactant metal SOAKS UP THE OXYGEN in the steam and the hydrogen
        THUS RELEASED is sucked out of the chamber by a vacuum device.
        Leach says the device needs a small charge of outside power to
        begin Page 1 the conversion process, but that after that it
        powers itself by using the heat produced by the chemical
        reaction. Unlikely as all this sounds, Leach has some believers.
        Morris J. Mirkin, the founder and former head of Budget
        Rent-A-Car and now chairman of MJM, and Randall Presley,
        president of Presley Cos., a California group of home
        construction firms, have each paid Leach $500,000 for
        "automotive" and "residential application rights," respectively,
        to the generator. When rumors of the device began to circulate,
        the stock in the Presley Cos. shot from $4.24 a share last
        December 23rd to $20.25 on March 25th. At that point, the
        Securities and Exchange Commission stopped trading in Presley
        stock and launched an investigation into the possibility of
        stock manipulation and other violations of securities laws.
        Leach commissioned two reputable laboratories to test the
        generator. In press releases prepared by MJM, both were quoted
        as saying the machine worked. But the testing laboratories
        themselves refuse to talk to reporters, saying they promised
        Leach they would not. Skeptics : Leach also is not available to
        reporters, and he has little support among scientists. Most
        experts say his description of the process violates two laws of
        thermodynamics. "It's ridiculous," snapped a hydrogen expert
        from UCLA. "It sounds like a perpetual-motion machine." And so
        far, the U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration
        also is unimpressed. "It's possible to produce hydrogen that
        way," one top ERDA scientist said, "but we don't know what's in
        his box and he won't tell anybody. If I had to make a guess, I'd
        say it is a gimmick." Whether is is indeed a gimmick or for real
        will presumably be known when the SEC completes its
        investigation - or when one of the 86 patents Leach HAS BEEN
        ISSUED in countries around the world is made public. That may
        happen early next month. In the meantime, the Southern
        California Gas Co. of Los Angeles, one of the firms approached
        to use the Leach device to generate gas, is keeping an open
        mind. "It seems a little unusual, but [physical] laws have been
        broken in the past," says Southern vice president Ray Todd. But
        then, Todd is willing to consider some unconventional
        propositions. Not long ago, he was approached by an inventor
        with an idea for extracting methane gas - the chief ingredient
        in natural gas - from chicken droppings. </p>

      <p>Last March 28 in Los Angeles representatives of several
        laboratories and some reporters watched what seemed to be
        ordinary water piped into a device somewhat LARGER THAN A BIG
        TRUNK. Knobs were turned and a JET OF FLAME burst forth from a
        tube and BURNED FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES, until the machine was
        turned off. Samuel Leach, the 61-year old inventor, claims the
        flame results from BURNING GAS GENERATED BY SPLITTING WATER into
        hydrogen and oxygen. Except for the brief electrical input
        necessary to start the process, says Leach, it is
        self-sustaining and derives (heat) from the water itself. An
        inexpensive process to separate hydrogen and oxygen would solve
        the world's energy problems. For at least 60 years it has been
        known that the REACTIONS OF METAL AND WATER WILL PRODUCE
        HYDROGEN. One early process mixed POWDERED IRON WITH STEAM. The
        Chicago Institute of Gas Technology has developed a HYDROGEN
        GENERATOR BASED ON CADMIUM. But Derek P. Gregory of the
        Institute, who has led the push for a "hydrogen economy," states
        that NO KNOWN SYSTEM will approach the claims made by Leach. "If
        it works the way they say it does, it is perpetual motion.
        That's impossible," SCIENCE NEWS quotes Gregory as saying. The
        apparatus inside Leach's CLOSED STEEL TRUNK is supposed to
        include TWO STEEL TANKS, each holding GRANULES of an
        UNIDENTIFIED METAL that theoretically REACTS WITH STEAM, BINDING
        THE OXYGEN and RELEASING HYDROGEN. After the oxygen has been
        bound to the metal, Leach claims the metal can BE HEATED TO
        REMOVE THE OXYGEN AND THE CYCLE REPEATED (using the same metal).
        If it is to be self-sustaining, the heat given off by the
        hydrogen must be MORE THAN SUFFICIENT to remove the oxygen from
        the metal. The laws of thermodynamics say this is impossible.
        It's easy enough to produce hydrogen but some heat always would
        be lost in the process and outside energy would have to be
        added. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Tunnel Vision?</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Science regards the laws of thermodynamics as almost sacred. A
        Mr. Leach insists that "thermodynamicists follow certain things
        BLINDLY, like TUNNEL VISION." Meanwhile investments made in a
        Leach invention by several large companies are at stake. The
        stock of Presley, one of the companies associated with the
        invention, has jumped from about $2.00 to $20.00 and 3/8 on the
        American Stock Exchange, and the Securities and Exchange
        Commission has ordered an investigation. One thing seems sure.
        Although two laboratories, Smith-Emery Company of Los Angeles
        and the Approved Engineering Test Laboratories of Encino,
        California, disassembled and reassembled the apparatus and say
        they COULD FIND NO HIDDEN SOURCE OF ENERGY, definitive operating
        tests by dispassionate scientists have not been made. Repealing
        the laws of thermodynamics seems considerably more difficult
        than amending the Constitution of the United States. But
        wouldn't it be wonderful if Sam Leach has done it. - Curtis

      <p>Vangard notes... A picture of the device shows the front panel
        to have two large meter type indicators, 3 small pressure
        indicators, 1 large pressure indicator, 3 protruding stops which
        could be needle valve adjusters, and 5 knobs. A cutaway shows at
        least eleven drip bottles with a common input for each row of

        needle valve adjustment per row. There must be three rows of
        these drip bottles, each row of which can be fed singly or in
        any combination and at any rate of water. Apparently, this water
        then drips into the tank where it is electrified to generate
        steam. The steam is then broken down by the metal in its process
        of absorbing the oxygen. The device sounds simple enough and has
        many possible arrangements to enhance the effect. At this time,
        we do not have copies of the patents which were said to have
        been issued in OTHER COUNTRIES. Those in a position to
        experiment with various metals might do well to check into this
        phenomena. A very simple test would be to use a metal sample
        under a glass jar. As steam was passed over the metal, the
        hydrogen, being a very light gas would accumulate in the top of
        an upside down jar. Page 4 A flame could then be introduced
        using a spark triggered from a safe distance to check for
        ignition. If the reactant is a metal and NOT AN ALLOY, it should
        be fairly easy to locate it by trial and error using different
        metals. Again, if this inspires you to carry out an experiment
        in this area, we would really appreciate you sharing it with us
        and the people interested in such projects. </p>

      <p>Back on the original topic (Sam Leach's over unity plasma steam
        device) have you found any info on this? Something ominous is
        brewing here in Canada. The company that bought this thing from
        Leach is speaking of an imminent news release or conference at
        the end of this month where they will demonstrate the production
        prototype that they paid 130k$ for. I spoke with the company
        pres. and she seems to be excited on the border of fear for what
        this thing is going to do. She claims there will be no question
        about the validity of the device after their release. This Leach
        guy seems to have a pretty good record according to her. He held
        a patent on the original 3d process for movies and did quite
        well when he sold it to Eastman. He's no spring chicken
        apparently and just wants to see this invention in the hands of
        someone who will run with it. Apparently, they are real
        concerned about Mr. Leach's safety. He's under 24 hour guard.
        This is starting to sound like a B-movie! I'll try to keep you
        posted as this thing develops. regards Gary </p>

        Subject: Re: Electric Arc Plasma Steam Generation &gt; <br>
        Date: Mon, 4 Jul 94 22:19:14 -0500 &gt; </p>
      <p>The inventor is an American by the name of Leach. Basically,
        the way it works is that a gas plasma is formed by ionizing a
        water spray containing an electrolyte. He injects a stream of
        water into an electric arc, thereby reducing the arc
        temperature, vapourizing the water and ionizing the hydrogen and
        oxygen atoms. &gt;&gt;Now please don't laugh or flame too
        much... I know all about the laws of thermodynamics...but it
        appears that this device might be exhibiting some excess energy
        production. &gt;&gt;Ha ha! (sorry) Flame! Flame! (sorry) That's
        ok...at least your flame is polite :-) &gt; &gt;Exactly what
        part of this description implies the presence of excess energy
        production? No part of the patent information infers any sort of
        excess energy or unusual phenomenon at all. However, the
        Canadian rights were recently acquired by a group in Vancouver,
        and they are listed on the TSE. There was a brief blurb in the
        Globe and Mail recently, and they mentioned things like "closed
        loop operation ...no fossil fuel required...only uses small
        amounts of water" The only phrase they didn't use was "perpetual
        motion" They also said that investors are not responding, which
        really comes as no surprise considering the rather incredible
        claim. &gt; A tremendous amount of energy is poured into the
        plasma by the electric arc. This dissociates the molecules and
        ionizes the atoms. When the atoms restablize and the molecules
        recombine, that energy is returned as heat and light. The
        presence of water vapor or liquid in this formulation changes
        nothing as far as I can see. I'm not sure what determines the
        "temperature" of the arc, but as long as an arc persists, the
        process that I described goes on. &gt; The presence of an
        "electrolyte" in the water is completely irrelevant, as an
        electrolyte is of interest only in the context of electrical
        conduction in a water solution, and I realize that, and I'm sure
        that's why he adds the electrolye. The arc he talks about is
        over 7 inches [long] and the voltages are only in the 2kV range,
        so he would need something to encourage conduction. &gt; has no
        effect in a plasma, where any liquid water is quickly vaporized
        (and dissociated and ionized). &gt; So again, my question is:
        why do you think something unusual is happening here?&gt;
        &gt;Dave&gt; The only reason why I would even consider the
        possibility of something unusual here stems from something I
        recall Harold Puthoff (see the thread on amazing lightness in
        this conference) once suggested tapping energy from the vacuum
        (30 seconds allowed for laughter to subside). He suggested that
        devices employing cold plasma streams might exhibit vacuum
        energy effects, via the "Casimir pinch" effect. I don't believe
        this inventor is making any ZPE claims, but I couldn't help but
        notice the coincidence. So now I am just fishing for any info on
        this inventor, to see if any similar claims/suggestions have
        surfaced down south. regards Gary </p>
      <p>From: gsteckly@clark.dgim.doc.ca (Gary Steckly) .... </p>
      <p>The developing story on the Leach device here in Canada is
        interesting, since this is a company with public stock
        offerings, and some respectable papers have covered it, although
        interestingly (and undertandably) the market is not responding.
        These are still penny stocks...likely the biggest bargain of the
        century if they can deliver. I spoke with the company CEO and
        they seem entirely serious and confident in the technology,
        although they can't understand Leach's explanations. I asked
        them if Leach ever mentioned ZPE or vacuum energy, but they have
        never even heard the term. I picked up a copy of his patent. He
        was careful not to say anything relating to OU energy production
        in the claims. Interestingly, it is a plasma device, utilizing
        water injection which breaks down in the electric arc, so the
        plasma is a soup of hydrogen, oxygen and free electrons. I will
        be following the development of the Leach device very closely
        and keep you posted. regards Gary </p>

      <p>Los Angeles, April 20 --- Sam Leslie Leach, the inventor of a
        controversial process that he contends can economically separate
        the hydrogen and oxygen in water, says he has refined his design
        and begun building a system that will be capable of running an
        automobile on hydrogen derived from water. Mr. Leach's invention
        has been the subject of both mystery and controversy since he
        said in 1976 that he had devised an economically efficient means
        of splitting water, a contention that promised a cheap source of
        hydrogen as a replacement for fossil fuel. Mr. Leach, a
        multimillionaire professional inventor who has several basic
        patents in the field of optics, has been trying to interest the
        Federal Government and industry in his concept for more than
        three years, but has been largely ignored. For the most part,
        scientists have ridiculed the concept, arguing that it violated
        basic laws of physics. Any system of splitting water, they
        contend, has to consume more energy than it produces. Positive
        Evaluation Mr. Leach has refused to discuss the details of his
        system or how it purportedly works. but last spring an
        innovation research center at the University of Oregon financed
        by the National Science Foundation evaluated part of the
        technology over a period of two weeks and concluded that, that
        based on its analysis, it did not violate the laws of physics or
        thermodynamics. The center said that the process appeared to be
        technically sound and have commercial potential, but its report
        did not dampen skepticism in the scientific community. Page 1
        Two critics of the system, Howard Riese and Donald Bunker, both
        professors at the University of California, argued, for example,
        that it was impossible for such a system to work as Mr. Leach
        contends because, in effect, it would be a "perpetual motion
        machine." The inventor denies such a characterization. In an
        interview, Mr. Leach said that he had declined to make public
        any details until he had protected his rights to the process.
        Last fall, he received a patent on some elements of the process.
        Last week a second was issued by the United States Patent
        Office. After its issuance he agreed to give some details of how
        the system purportedly works. How System Operates In its
        simplest terms, he said, the process utilizes a lazer-like
        device to generate ultraviolet radiation that photochemically
        splits steam into oxygen and hydrogen. It then utilizes the
        electrostatic forces that normally bind electrons and protons in
        water vapor (and which are released in the water- splitting
        action) to maintain the reaction. In 1922, Niels Bohr, the
        Danish theoretical physicist, first defined the electrostatic
        forces that bind electrons and protons as "extranuclear" energy.
        Mr. Leach's contention that he has found a way to use the energy
        in the way he describes is likely to evoke additional skepticism
        from other scientists. But he asserts that the process he
        utilizes to maintain the water-splitting action is identical
        with one observed by astronomers in energy interactions that
        occur in gaseous nebulae, the great masses of interstellar gas
        that absorb ultraviolet radiation from stars and re-emit it as
        visible light. The following is a more detailed account of how
        Mr. Leach says the system works: The reaction is started with an
        input of electrical energy from outside the system, from a
        battery or electric line. This energy is converted, by using an
        "optical pump" and other components, into large amounts of
        ultraviolet radiation of a specific wavelength that is precisely
        tailored to ionize hydrogen and oxygen molecules in the steam
        that has been fed into a tubular reaction chamber. The chamber
        is flooded with the radiation. During the ionization, electrons
        are momentarily liberated from their atoms and molecules.
        Ionization and Radiation Microseconds later they are recaptured
        and recombined with the proton or nucleus of the atom. At this
        point, the energy that was required to ionize it reappears and
        radiates away. This radiation then ionizes another molecule.
        Very soon a chain reaction begins that involves millions of
        molecules and atoms. The process's concept, Mr. Leach said,
        manipulates the Page 2 recombination of electrons and protons as
        hydrogen and oxygen instead of water vapor. Some of the
        hydrogen, he said, can be used to generate electricity to
        continue the initial input to the process and, in effect, be
        SELF-SUSTAINING AS LONG AS WATER IS PUMPED INTO THE SYSTEM. In
        1975, before he publicized his work, the Presley companies, a
        southern California home builder, acquired an option on the
        process from Mr. Leach for use in home heating. The Securities
        and Exchange Commission investigated the company and alleged
        that it had issued false statements regarding its capabilities.
        Subsequently, Mr. Leach reacquired the option for the same price
        Presley paid for it. Mr. Leach asserted that he had demonstrated
        the validity of his theory in 11 experimental machines that
        split water into hydrogen and oxygen. He said that the machine
        now being built for use in an automobile was of a more
        sophisticated design and was intended to drive a 245-horsepower
        automobile. A spokesman for a company that is assembling the
        device under a contract with Mr. Leach said it was hoped the
        machine would be ready for testing in early summer. Scientists
        have tried for more than a century to separate water into its
        two components, oxygen and hydrogen. Electrolysis, nuclear
        reactors and other means have been employed to do so, but every
        method has consumed far more energy that the hydrogen that was
        produced. The availability of a cheap source of hydrogen would
        have immense implications for the world economy. Not only could
        hydrogen be used as a substitute for gasoline, but it would also
        be used as a replacement for home heating fuels and other energy
        sources. </p>

        hydrogen extraction process during the mid seventies. The unit
        easily extracted free hydrogen from water and was small enough
        to fit under the hood of automobiles. In 1976 two independent
        labs in LA tested this generator with perfect results. Mr. M.J.

      <p>According to the a <i>New York Times Special</i> of 20 April
        1979, (can't find the original on line, but here is a more
        recent reference to the matter) Sam Leslie Leach, a professional
        inventor with several basic patents in the field of optics, has
        obtained two patents for an invention that he says accomplishes
        the economic separation of hydrogen and oxygen gases from water.
      </p>
      <p>The process, as described in the article, subjects water vapor
        injected into a reaction chamber to ultraviolet radiation of a
        specific wavelength, which ionises the hydrogen and oxygen
        atoms. Apparently, the radiation is re-emitted by the atomic
        gases and so upholds the separation process in a self-sustaining
        way, as long as more water vapor is supplied. </p>
      <p>Information in the article is scant of technical detail. No
        contact address is given. Maybe someone out there would be able
        to follow this up and give us more information, especially as to
        further developments (if any) after 1979. It appears that Leach
        ran into a lot of scepticism from scientists contending that his
        process ‘could not possibly work’. </p>

      <p>Californian Sam Leach knew that hydrogen was a winner. Near the
        time of the first Middle East Oil crisis in the early 1970s,
        Leach convinced gullible American investors to give him
        US$1-million on the strength of his claim that he had built a
        car that used ordinary water as a fuel. His "invention" used
        electrolysis assisted by his secret catalyst [ Manganese oxide
        ]. He claimed to be able to decompose water into oxygen and
        hydrogen, and then use the hydrogen as a fuel to run the engine
        and generate more electricity than he started with. The claims
        turned out to be false, but by then Leach and the money had

      <p>Genesis Project: a really good scam can be used over and over.
      </p>
      <p>Back in the early '70s, an inventor named Sam Leach claimed to
        have built a car that used ordinary water as a fuel. The idea
        was simple: You use electrolysis to decompose the water into
        oxygen and hydrogen and then use the hydrogen as a fuel to run
        the engine and generate electricity for the separation. So there
        you have it: You start with water and end up with water plus
        work. Scientists scoffed: it would take more energy to decompose
        the water than you could get from the combustion of hydrogen.
        Ordinarily yes, Leach agreed, but he had a secret catalyst [
        Manganese oxide ]that reduced the energy of decomposition. The
        great thing about the First Law of Thermodynamics, however, is
        that it doesn't care what's in your secret box, it gives you the
        limit of any process. Leach raised millions from investors and
        then retired to a seaside villa in California. Who needs a car
        that runs on water when you have a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce?
        The rumor spread that he had been bought off by the oil
        companies. Now something called Genesis World Energy is running
        the same scam over again. </p>

        of substantially different molecular weights, such as oxygen and
        carbon monoxide, includes a series of concentrically nested
        coils, with the output of each coil being connected to the input
        of the next coil. Gas is directed through the coils at high
        velocity to cause laminar flow in the tubes of the coils, with
        the heavier gas flowing through the tubing adjacent the outer
        periphery of each coil of tubing, as a result of centrifugal
        force, and the lighter gas being forced to flow near the inner
        surface of the tubing of each coil. Starting one or two turns
        from the input to each coil, after laminar flow is established,
        small openings are provided at the outer periphery, or
        preferably at the inner surfaces of the tubing making up the
        coils, whereby one of the gases selectively flows out of the
        coils of tubing into an enclosing housing. A gas storage
        container may be provided to receive the gas which flows into
        the enclosing housing; and a water tank, and pumps to direct
        water flow between the gas storage container and the water tank
        may be employed to provide reduced pressure in the gas storage
        container. Conventional vacuum or gas pumps may also be provided
        to reduce the pressure in the storage tank and the enclosing

        Through one heat exchange structure, water is formed into steam.
        Then, in one or more additional heat exchangers, the steam is
        converted into hydrogen gas and/or hydrogen peroxide. The active
        material in the additional heat exchanger arrangements may
        include both (1) a metal oxide, such as manganese oxide, which
        successively sequesters oxygen from water vapor, and then as the
        pressure is reduced in later portion of the cycle, releases the
        captured oxygen; and may also or alternatively include (2) host
        and sensitizer material for shifting the output radiation into
        one of the absorption bands for water vapor. Additionally,
        through the very high intensity infrared radiation which is
        applied in a concentrated manner to the steam, further
        dissociation of the water vapor by the phenomenon of multiphoton
        absorption, is obtained; and suitable resonant cavity and high
        pass filtering film arrangements may be employed to shift the
        frequency of radiation applied to dissociate the water vapor
        into the ultraviolet frequency range. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>An apparatus for accomplishing
        photochemical reactions includes a series of reaction chambers
        and a heat exchanger. When the apparatus is employed for the
        production of hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide from water or water
        vapor, cold water is initially passed through the heat exchanger
        to cool the output gases; and then the water is further heated
        and turned to steam, prior to supplying it to the reaction
        chambers. The elongated photochemical reaction chambers are
        connected in series, with the water vapor being coupled to pass
        successively up one elongated reaction chamber, down the next
        and so forth. Each reaction chamber is provided with a central
        gas discharge device for producing characteristic output
        radiation at various lower frequencies. Enclosing the elongated
        gas discharged tube is a reaction zone or reaction chamber; and
        between the gas discharge tube and the reaction zone are
        arrangements including a metallic film, such as aluminum, which
        is highly transmissive to short wavelengths but which reflects
        the lower frequencies initially radiated by the gas discharge
        tube. Various arrangements including resonant cavities, a
        slotted shield, or coherent radiating material may also be
        provided to facilitate shifting of the lower frequencies from
        the gas discharge device to higher frequencies which will pass
        through the metallic coating, to irradiate the reactant with
        ultraviolet radiations. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>In addition to the apparatus disclosed in
        the prior patent applications of which this application is a
        continuation-in-part, a reaction chamber is provided with
        mercury vapor quartz discharge lamps. In close proximity to the
        lamps are spheres, or thin continuous wires, or filaments or
        other physical configurations of laser-type material which
        produce relatively coherentradiation in a manner similar to
        lasers. The spheres or filaments include concentric partially
        reflective surfaces, and include an active material which is
        pumped by the efficient spectral radiation of the mercury vapor,
        and radiates at a frequency or frequencies matched to the
        absorption characteristics of the feedstock being fed through
        the reaction chamber. The laser-type material may be operated to
        produce output radiation at a harmonic, such as the second,
        third, fourth or higher harmonic of the basic laser radiation,
        and these harmonic output radiations may be enhanced by using
        semi-reflective coatings which reflect in the order of 70% to
        90% of the radiation, particularly in the case of spheres. High
        energy content ultraviolet radiation may also be generated by
        the "beating" of radiant energy from the mercury vapor tubes and
        the laser-type material. Efficiency is enhanced by chain
        reactions which occur with the feedstock materials being fed to
        the reaction chamber, and these chain reactions involve the
        generation and regeneration of excited atoms of oxygen or other
        substances. <br>

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> An apparatus is disclosed for
        exothermically obtaining hydrogen or hydrogen peroxide from
        water vapor in a reaction chamber. The separation of the
        hydrogen and oxygen may be accelerated through the use of a
        combination host and sensitizer material which is present near
        spaces or voids within the reaction chamber. The water vapor has
        certain particular absorption bands in its absorption versus
        frequency characteristic. Each of the sensitizers which are
        located adjacent the voids in the reactant, in one embodiment
        forming part of the walls of small cylindrical tubes, has an
        energy output in the excited state which is precisely in one of
        the energy absorption bands in the water vapor characteristic.
        The host material absorbs heat energy and excites the sensitizer
        material. In addition to the formation of free hydrogen, some
        hydrogen peroxide is also formed. Other feedstocks may have
        energy selectively applied to them. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> An electric arc plasma steam generator
        includes a pair of electrodes (12,14) for generating the arc
        plasma, and a housing for enclosing the arc plasma. Jets of
        water are directed into the arc plasma to convert the water into
        steam and to ionize the hydrogen and oxygen components of the
        steam. Arrangements including coils (56) and water jackets
        (48,50) are provided for circulating water in proximity to the
        arc plasma and for super-heating the water contained in the
        water jacket and/or the coils, which are preferably mounted
        within the housing. An expansion chamber (44) is connected to
        receive both the super-heated water, and also the superheated
        steam from the arc plasma, as the hydrogen and oxygen recombine
        to form steam once again. The arc plasma in one embodiment may
        be formed by electrical conduction through a spray of water
        containing an electrolyte; and in another embodiment electrodes
        may initially form the arc plasma in air or other gas, and as
        the electrodes are consumed, they may be advanced by a suitable
        mechanical arrangements including threads on the electrodes,
        keyway slots on the electrodes, and stepping motors which serves
        to advance the electrodes as needed. </p>
