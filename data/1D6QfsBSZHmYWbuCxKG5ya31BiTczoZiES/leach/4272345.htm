      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Waste heat which would otherwise be lost up a stack or chimney
        may be employed to generate hydrogen or hydrogen peroxide
        through the use of special equipment including a heat exchange
        structure associated with the stack or chimney. Through one heat
        exchange structure, water is formed into steam. Then, in one or
        more additional heat exchangers, the steam is converted into
        hydrogen gas and/or hydrogen peroxide. The active material in
        the additional heat exchanger arrangements may include both (1)
        a metal oxide, such as manganese oxide, which successively
        sequesters oxygen from water vapor, and then as the pressure is
        reduced in later portion of the cycle, releases the captured
        oxygen; and may also or alternatively include (2) host and
        sensitizer material for shifting the output radiation into one
        of the absorption bands for water vapor. Additionally, through
        the very high intensity infrared radiation which is applied in a
        concentrated manner to the steam, further dissociation of the
        water vapor by the phenomenon of multiphoton absorption, is
        obtained; and suitable resonant cavity and high pass filtering
        film arrangements may be employed to shift the frequency of
        radiation applied to dissociate the water vapor into the
        ultraviolet frequency range. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to arrangements for generating hydrogen
        and/or hydrogen peroxide from waste heat, such as that passing
        up an industrial stack or chimney. </p>
      <p>A recent book which has generated much interest in Washington,
        D.C. and throughout the country is entitled, "Energy Future",
        and was edited by Robert Stobaugh and Daniel Yergin. This
        authoritative book includes the following quotations: </p>
      <p>"There is a source of energy that produces no radioactive
        waste, nothing in the way of petrodollars, and very little
        pollution. Moreover, the source can provide the energy that
        conventional sources may not be able to furnish. To be
        semantically accurate, the source should be called conservation
        energy to remind us of the reality--that conservation is no less
        an energy alternative than oil, gas, coal or nuclear. Indeed, in
        the near term, conservation could do more than any of the
        conventional sources to help the country deal with the energy
        problem it has." </p>
      <p>"As two prominent analysts, Lee Schipper and Joel Dormstadter,
        have expressed it: `The most impelling factor in encouraging
        conservation action is the cost of not conserving`." </p>
      <p>"It is well known that vast amounts of energy are radiated up
        industrial stacks into the air--or into lakes, rivers or oceans.
        This is called waste heat/energy." </p>
      <p>"At a typical electric utility generating plant, up to two
        thirds of the fuel's potential energy is lost as discharged
        waste heat. Meanwhile, industrial waste heat has been estimated
        at 20 percent of total national energy consumption." </p>
      <p>In the same book it is stated that the energy consumption in
        the United States in 1977 when converted into equivalent barrels
        of oil per day, is equal to approximately 36.7 millions of
        barrels per day, with each one million barrels of oil per day
        being equivalent to approximately 2.12.times.10.sup.15 BTUs per
        year. Using the figure of industrial waste heat being in the
        order of 20 percent of the total national energy consumption,
        this means that we are wasting in this one area along,
        approximately 7 or 8 million barrels of oil per day equivalent,
        and this corresponds to about 15.times.10.sup.15 BTUs per year.
        Assuming a conservative cost of about $2.00 per million BTUs,
        the annual loss is more than $3.times.10.sup.10 or over 30
        billion dollars for the year 1977. </p>
      <p>Although various proposals have been made for utilizing the
        waste heat lost going up the stacks of chimneys, up to the
        present time commercial efforts to recover this waste heat and
        to convert it efficiently and economically into useful forms of
        energy have not justified the investment. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, a principal object of the present invention is to
        provide an economical manner of directly recovering the wasted
        heat and providing the recovered energy in a useful form which
        may be readily and conveniently employed. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, apparatus operating
        on the general principles outlined in my U.S. Pat. Nos.
        4,113,589 and 4,148,701 may be employed to utilize waste heat
        from industrial processes and to directly generate hydrogen gas
        and/or hydrogen peroxide. </p>
      <p>More specifically, in accordance with the present invention,
        heat exchanging arrangements are coupled to a stack or chimney
        in a streamlined manner to avoid introducing undue back pressure
        into the stack or chimney; steam is generated from the waste
        heat; and then the steam is dissociated to form hydrogen gas and
        hydrogen peroxide. </p>
      <p>The dissociation step is accomplished by an oxygen sequestering
        step, and/or by the application of high intensity radiation
        within the absorption band or bands of water through the use of
        special host and sensitizer materials which absorb radiation
        from the walls of the heat exchanger directly or indirectly and
        re-radiate the desired frequencies at exceedingly high
        intensities. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the heat
        exchangers may take the form of pipes which extend through the
        walls of the chimney or stack, in an open configuration to
        absorb some portion of the waste heat without creating any
        significant back pressure retarding the flow of gases. A small
        portion of the available heat absorbed by the heat exchange
        structure may be used to convert water into steam or water
        vapor, and the greater portion of the space within the heat
        exchanger may contain material, such as a suitable metal oxide,
        and/or host and sensitizer material, for the sequestering and
        radiation steps mentioned hereinabove. </p>
      <p>Additional aspects and features of the invention include the
        following: </p>
      <p>(1) A metal oxide is selected which will absorb oxygen from
        water vapor at the ambient temperatures provided by the stack; </p>
      <p>(2) Host and sensitizer materials are selected which will
        absorb energy at the ambient temperature and which will radiate
        energy within the absorption band or bands of water vapor or
        other gases to be dissociated. </p>
      <p>(3) A series of units may be provided in a single stack
        operative at progressively lower temperatures so that a larger
        proportion of the waste heat may be recovered; </p>
      <p>(4) Any desired portion of the generated hydrogen and/or
        hydrogen peroxide may be routed back to the main process or to
        directly raise the temperature of the heat exchanger containing
        the metal oxide, so that the hydrogen or hydrogen peroxide may
        be continuously employed to reduce the total amount of energy
        input; </p>
      <p>(5) The system external to the stack may include a heat
        exchanger in which the hot hydrogen and/or hydrogen peroxide as
        it is formed warms the input water which is subsequently
        converted to steam; </p>
      <p>(6) A negative pressure tank is provided to withdraw oxygen
        either alone or as carbon dioxide, as it is disproportionated
        from the metal oxide reactant; </p>
      <p>(7) Arrangements may be provided for passing carbon monoxide
        from the waste gases in the stack over the metal oxide to
        facilitate the disproportionation of the oxygen; </p>
      <p>(8) The heat exchange structures within the stack or chimney
        may be a series of spaced pipes extending generally vertically
        or in the direction of gas flow to minimize back pressure; </p>
      <p>(9) Each unit may include a series of heat exchanging reaction
        chambers operated sequentially, to continuously generate
        hydrogen or hydrogen peroxide; </p>
      <p>(10) The heat exchange tubes may be coated internally with host
        and sensitizer material to directly irradiate the steam in a
        continuous process; and </p>
      <p>(11) Suitable resonant cavities and a high pass filtering film
        may be provided to shift the radiation applied to the water
        vapor into the ultraviolet spectrum. </p>
      <p>An important advantage of the present invention is its
        applicability to existing facilities, as a "technical fix" to
        significantly increase the efficiency of the many industrial
        plants which now radiate and waste vast quantities of heat
        energy. </p>
      <p>Other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent
        from a consideration of the following detailed description and
        from the accompanying drawings. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>Referring more particularly to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows an
        industrial building 12 which is provided with a stack or chimney
        14. In the normal course of operation of the industrial
        facility, substantial heat is lost through the chimney 14 in the
        form of hot gases which pass up the chimney 14. In accordance
        with the present invention, a series of waste heat energy
        recovery units 21 through 24 are provided to convert the waste
        heat to burnable fuel, such as hydrogen gas or hydrogen
        peroxide. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 is a detailed showing of one illustrative implementation
        of one of the units 21 of FIG. 1. The units such as 21 include
        two principal sets of equipment, one of which is located within
        the chimney or stack structure 14, and the other being
        immediately adjacent and external thereto. Within the chimney 14
        is an open heat exchanging conduit configuration 28 and a
        cup-shaped member 30 for absorbing heat or heated gases passing
        up the stack 14. Steam to be dissociated to form hydrogen gas is
        supplied to the reaction chamber within tubing 28, through the
        conduit 32. Gases are withdrawn from the tubing 28 through the
        conduits 34 and 36. Heat or heated gases picked up by the
        cup-shaped element 30 are brought out from the stack 14 through
        conduit 36. </p>
      <p>The major components external to the stack 14 include a source
        of input water 42, a heat exchanging tank 44 within which the
        input water is stored, and through which the output hydrogen
        and/or hydrogen peroxide passes within the coiled conduit 46,
        thereby cooling the hydrogen gas and providing initial heating
        for the water within tank 44. From the tank 44, the water is
        routed to the steam generation unit 48. Incidentally, the steam
        generation unit 48 may be implemented by a few turns of metal
        tubing within the stack 14, rather than by an external unit as
        shown in FIG. 2. Also shown in FIG. 2 is the vacuum pump 50 and
        the reduced pressure tank 52. Hydrogen and/or hydrogen peroxide,
        formed in the reaction conduits 28, are stored in the tank 54.
        The burner 56 indicates schematically the utilization of the
        hydrogen gas which has been stored in tank 54. In practice, the
        gas may be directed back to a furnace or other utilization
        equipment 60 in FIG. 1, to reduce the input fuel requirements
        for the industrial facility 12. The process may be carried out
        cyclically through the use of the valves 62 as shown in FIG. 2.
        These valves may be either cam actuated, or they may be
        implemented by electromagnetic valve actuators. </p>
      <p>In connection with the implementation and operation of the
        apparatus of FIG. 2, reference is again made to my prior U.S.
        Pat. Nos. 4,113,589 and 4,148,701, and the contents of these two
        prior patents are hereby incorporated by reference into the
        present specification. In this connection, reference is made to
        FIG. 5 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,113,589 in which cam actuated
        arrangements for a similar apparatus are disclosed; and to FIG.
        7 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,701, in which the staggered cyclical
        operation of a related unit is graphically analyzed. It is noted
        in passing that the apparatus of U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,113,589 and
        4,148,701 were not associated with, and did not involve, the
        formation of hydrogen from waste industrial heat. The present
        invention does so relate, and involves the recognition that the
        heat which would otherwise be lost up an industrial stack or
        chimney can be reclaimed through the generation of fuel, such as
        hydrogen or hydrogen peroxide in a simple, convenient and
        efficient manner. In addition, the present invention involves
        significantly different structural arrangements and
        configurations from those shown in the prior patents, and have
        been designed to implement the waste heat recovery system. </p>
      <p>Turning for the moment to FIG. 5, this is a cross-sectional
        view through a pipe 72 of high temperature resistant material
        which may be employed to implement the conduit 28 as shown in
        FIG. 2, or similar structures shown in other embodiments of the
        drawings. Within the conduit 72 is a mass of finely divided
        material such as manganese oxide 74 and additional material,
        such as the spherical metal balls 76 and the stainless steel
        metal turnings 78, which increase the void volume within the
        conduit 72 and permit freer flow of gas through the conduit 72.
        The size of the manganese oxide particles may be in the order of
        one hundredth of an inch in their largest dimension, or about
        0.010 inch. </p>
      <p>Now, when steam is supplied to the conduit 72 and passed over
        the manganese oxide, with the oxide at an elevated temperature,
        the manganese oxide is further oxidized to a higher oxidation
        state, and the oxygen in the water vapor is thereby sequestered.
        The reaction is substantially as follows, in one of a number of
        alternative modes: </p>
      <p>The foregoing reaction occurs at a temperature above
        atmospheric pressure and this can range from a few pounds per
        square inch above atmospheric pressure to many atmospheres,
        depending on the desired output pressure of the hydrogen. </p>
      <p>Subsequently, the pressure within the heat exchanger is
        reduced, to atmospheric pressure or less, preferably in the
        order of about 1/10th atmospheric pressure, and the oxygen is
        disproportionated from the manganese oxide and it returns to its
        lower oxidation state as follows: </p>
      <p>Incidentally, for the above reactions to go forward in the
        indicated manner, the temperature of the reactant should be
        substantially above 535 degrees C., which is the temperature at
        which MnO.sub.2 will dissociate to Mn.sub.2 O.sub.3.
        Accordingly, it is desirable to operate at temperatures well
        above 535 degrees C., and satisfactory sequestering and
        disproportionating operation has been achieved at temperatures
        from 600 degrees C. to 950 degrees C., by way of example. </p>
      <p>In some cases, it is convenient to facilitate the
        disproportionation of oxygen from the metal oxide by the
        reaction set forth in equation (3) set forth below. </p>
      <p>This may be accomplished when the waste gases passing through
        the stack of 14 have a high carbon monoxide content. Referring
        back to FIG. 2 the cup 30 is employed to pick up some of the
        waste gases containing carbon monoxide from stack 14 for
        utilization in the reaction set forth at (3) above. </p>
      <p>As indicated by Equation (1) and Equations (2) or (3), the
        process as described hereinabove is implemented in two
        successive stages, with the first stage involving the
        dissociation of steam and the second stage involving the
        disproportionation of oxygen from the metal oxide, such as
        Mn.sub.2 O.sub.3. This cycling may be accomplished through the
        use of the valves 62 as shown in FIG. 2. For convenience in
        following brief description, the valves 62 are referred to by
        their reference letters A through F. Initially, it will be
        assumed that the manganese is in its lower oxidation state as
        Mn.sub.2 O.sub.3, and that steam is to be admitted to the
        reaction coils 28 containing the manganese oxide. Under these
        conditions, the valve 62F is open supplying pressure to move the
        water through the steam generator 48. Output steam from unit 48
        passes through the open valve 62D through the T-junction 82 and
        into the reactant filled coils 28. With valve 62B open and valve
        62C closed, the generated hydrogen passes through the T-junction
        84, the cooling coil 46, and through valve 62B to the hydrogen
        storage tank 54. </p>
      <p>Subsequently, during the disproportionation of the oxygen from
        the manganese oxide in accordance with Equation (2) or Equation
        (3), the valve 62C is open, and 62B is closed, so that the
        manganese oxide in the higher oxidation state in the heat
        exchanger 28 is subjected to reduced pressure whereby the oxygen
        is drawn off. In addition, if desired, with the valve D being
        closed, waste gas may be drawn through the check valve 88, from
        cup 30 so that both equation (2) and equation (3) are
        implemented concurrently. </p>
      <p>Incidentally, concerning valve 62A, when it is desired to draw
        off some hydrogen from the storage tank 52 and burn it at the
        burner 56, or utilize it elsewhere, the valve 62A is opened. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 3 and 4 show an alternative arrangement for implementing
        the heat exchanger portions, such as the conduit 28 in FIG. 2,
        and the similar structures in units 21 through 24 of FIG. 1.
        More specifically, in FIGS. 3 and 4, the chimney or stack 14
        includes four two-turn heat exchange conduits 91 through 94 and
        a fourth two-turn conduit 96 which is of smaller diameter and
        which serves to generate steam. As in the case of the
        arrangements shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the system of FIGS. 3 and 4
        includes the stack 14, and also includes a pickup funnel or duct
        98 to receive exhaust gases for the implementation of equation
        (2) and equation (3), as discussed hereinabove. </p>
      <p>The system shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 was designed to produce
        approximately 15 cubic feet of hydrogen gas per minute, or
        approximately 900 cubic feet per hour, corresponding to 292,500
        BTUs per hour. The amount of loosely filled reactant in the four
        tubes 91 through 94 is approximately 693 cubic inches.
        Incidentally, as a matter of interest, the weight of reactant is
        approximately 49 grams per cubic inch. Using a 11/2 inch
        diameter tube, between 32 and 33 feet of conduit are required.
        This means that each of the four tubes is in the order of 8 to
        81/2 feet in length. A two-turn coil, with the outer diameter in
        the order of 20 or 21 inches, and the inner turn in the order of
        14 or 15 inches in diameter, gives the approximate length which
        is required. To avoid undue back pressure within the stack, the
        coils 91 through 94 may be laterally spaced apart from one
        another by approximately 2 inches or more. </p>
      <p>It may be noted that the axis of the turns is horizontal, and
        this is preferred rather than having the reactant lying in a
        conduit which extends generally horizontally. If such latter
        construction were employed, it would be possible that the
        reactant would settle to some extent so that the steam or water
        vapor would by-pass the reactant, thereby possibly avoiding
        dissociation. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 6 and 7 show an alternative arrangement in which a
        somewhat different configuration of conduits containing reactant
        is employed. Specifically, in FIGS. 6 and 7 a series of
        vertically extending pipes are assembled to extend around the
        inner periphery of a predetermined section of the vertically
        extending stack 14. As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, a short section
        of several pipes or conduits 102 are employed to generate steam,
        and the major section of the vertically extending assembly of
        pipes 104 is used in the main reaction. The heat exchange
        structure 104 may be subdivided into four sections to correspond
        to the arrangement of FIG. 4, or may be a single longer conduit
        more similar to that shown in FIG. 2 of the drawings. The heat
        exchange structure may be secured in position by any suitable
        means, such as by fasteners 106. </p>
      <p>In addition to the formation of hydrogen by the sequestering of
        oxygen from water vapor, the present invention also contemplates
        the dissociation of water vapor by irradiation of the water
        vapor within the absorption bands of water vapor, and also
        through the phenomenon of multiphoton absorption by the water
        vapor. </p>
      <p>With regard to this phase of the invention, attention is
        directed to my prior U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,701, in which the
        portion of the specification starting in Column 13 is
        particularly pertinent. A brief summary of the concepts which
        are involved will be repeated here. </p>
      <p>Initially, it is noted that the theory of MASERS and LASERS
        form a background for this portion of the specification. The
        word LASER is an acronym which stands for Light Amplification by
        the Stimulated Emission of Radiation. The maser/laser type of
        acronym may also be applied to another system termed "HASER", an
        acronym for "Heat Amplification by Stimulating Emission of
        Radiation". As will be developed below, the term "amplification"
        is not used in the sense of increasing signal strength, but in
        the sense of amplifying the effectiveness of heat energy. </p>
      <p>The Haser application depends not as much on coherence or
        monochromaticity per se, but rather on the unprecedented energy
        per unit area. This radiated energy is a by-product of the
        coherence of the radiation, and can be many orders of magnitude
        greater in energy than normal incoherent thermal radiation. To
        understand why this is possible, it is necessary to review
        briefly a few of the basic differences between the incoherent
        radiation produced by an ordinary bright source and the coherent
        light (radiation) produced by a laser or maser. </p>
      <p>In a conventional source the atoms of a solid (or a gas) are
        agitated either thermally or electrically to higher energy
        states. When these atoms return spontaneously to their lower
        levels, they radiate some of their excess energy as light. Since
        each atom behaves independly at this state, its emission is at a
        random time and in a random direction with a random
        polarization. </p>
      <p>It follows that the light radiated in a single direction is the
        complex sum of all the light from the individual atoms. The
        phases of any two atoms will tend to cancel their radiation in
        some directions and enhance it in others. The total energy of
        the source will be on the average be radiated uniformly in all
        accessible directions, and the amount of energy observed in a
        given direction will be proportional to the solid angle
        subtended by the observing device. In the Haser interior the
        observing device is either a water-vapor molecule (or other
        feedstock) or another particulate of reactant. </p>
      <p>The maximum total energy that can be radiated by a given source
        depends on two factors: the surface area of the source and the
        maximum temperature to which the source has been heated.
        Therefore, in practice, the only way to increase the power
        output from an ordinary source beyond the limitations imposed by
        the source material is to increase the surface area of the
        source. </p>
      <p>Power output, however, is only half the solution. Concentrated
        power is much more important than power itself. A 40-watt
        fluorescent lamp, for example, produces more light than a
        40-watt incandescent lamp, but the fluorescent lamp is not
        nearly as effective as the incandescent light source for a
        spotlight. </p>
      <p>Now, in a laser or maser, the energy is also emitted when atoms
        drop from a higher energy level to a lower one; however, in this
        case the atoms are triggered and emit radiation (to a large
        percentage) in unison. In the case of the Haser, the atoms are
        triggered to emit radiation in unison by phonon/photon waves
        within the unit cavity or cell interor. Enough of the energy
        previously generated is retained within the mass of particulates
        to maintain emission in a compatible phase, polarization and
        direction. This phonon wave interacts with the excited atoms and
        causes them (to a large degree) to emit their excess energy in
        phase with the stimulating wave before they have a chance to do
        it randomly. </p>
      <p>As a result, the Haser generates a good percentage of its
        radiated energy so that it travels in synchronism with the
        standing phonon waves, therefore concentrating the energy
        emitted as photons. </p>
      <p>In effect, the radiated photons from the Haser particulates are
        all relatively concentrated, monochromatic, and therefore,
        relatively coherent energy sources. This results in an excellent
        energy density even though the photons are traveling in
        practically an infinite number of directions, due to the fact
        that the particulate sources number in hundreds of millions. The
        photons moving from particulate to particulate impact and are
        absorbed by other particulates. Then this STORAGE, BUILDUP, AND
        RELEASE of the "phase and amplitude of radiated energy",
        combined with the fine particulate geometry of the Haser power
        (energy) source, which provides surface area to emit a
        concentrated array of photons, allows a "maximum efficiency
        utilization" of the radiated energy within the Haser cavity. </p>
      <p>The act of controlling the spectral emissions to most
        effectively dissociate (for example) water vapor, by sensitizing
        the host compound properly is another very important point. The
        monochromatic waves may become distorted in passing through
        substances, so that harmonic waves are generated at two or more
        times their original frequency. </p>
      <p>Infrared wavelengths may be converted into visible light into
        ultraviolet waves. </p>
      <p>This new system utilizes fine (small) particulates of solid
        comprised of oxides which are predetermined by design and within
        which some host atoms are replaced by other frequency sensitive
        atoms also predetermined by design, which provides stimulated
        absorption and emission at predetermined wavelengths. </p>
      <p>The waste heat passing up the stack heats the conduits to
        thereby provide the original energy to liberate a massive volume
        of photons at the frequency range which will activate the
        sensitive atoms included in the host compound; the fine
        multi-faceted particulates absorb the photons which normally
        proceed as phonons through the particulate to generate and
        provide large numbers of cavity resonances which stimulates
        emission with each internal excursion; therefore, again, the
        gain by this regenerative amplifier when driven by the thermal
        noise fluctuations from the cavity walls, can be significant. </p>
      <p>In the case of the HASER, the principle emissions of radiation
        designed and produced to dissociate the chemical product may be
        emitted from coatings on the material and walls around the open
        spaces or cavities in the conduits in FIGS. 5, 8, and 9 for
        example. </p>
      <p>As the reactive mass reaches temperature levels which excite
        the molecules and atoms to a radiating level of energy, phonons
        and photons evolve which distribute the thermal energy within
        the mass. Incidentally, relative to the use of the terms
        "photon" and "phonon", when a phonon traveling through space
        impinges on a solid, the resultant wave in the solid is termed a
        "phonon". </p>
      <p>The ability of `atoms` to store energy has to do with the
        electrons within the individual atoms. The electrons exist as a
        cloud of negative charge around the positively charged nucleus.
        Each election occupies a state of energy and angular momentum
        that cannot be occupied by any other election. </p>
      <p>Therefore, the electrons tend to fill stable shells surrounding
        the nucleus. </p>
      <p>The electrons of the outermost shell are the ones most easily
        affected by outside forces because of their accessibility. These
        outer electrons can be moved to higher energy states, but they
        always tends to return to their lowest energy state. Electrons
        at certain levels decay (fall to a lower state) more easily than
        electrons at other levels. </p>
      <p>Each excited electronic state of the atom has a characteristic
        lifetime that indicates the average time it takes an electron to
        fall to a lower level and therefore radiate a photon. Most
        excited states have lifetimes of about 10.sup.-8 second. </p>
      <p>There are some excited states or levels in all atoms in which
        the electron cannot decay easily by giving up a photon. Such
        atoms must therefore wait for other means of giving up their
        energy, such as colliding with other atoms or with the walls of
        the system. Electrons in this state of energy tend to stay there
        for relatively long periods of time (0.001 second or more), and
        are referred to as being in metastable states. This is an
        important part of the storing of energy, which can then be
        retrieved in the excitation process by stimulation. </p>
      <p>The normal radiative decay from a higher electronic state to a
        lower one is termed spontaneous emission. As discussed earlier,
        processes exist that can force an atomic electron to a higher
        state or stimulate it to jump to a lower state. An example of
        forcing, as discussed earlier, is provided when a photon
        collides with an atom and excites the outer electron to a higher
        level, which can happen when the energy or wavelength of the
        photon corresponds exactly to the difference in energy between
        the state the electron is in and some higher possible state.
        This process is known as absorption because the photon (energy)
        is actually absorbed by the atom and all the photon's energy
        goes into raising the electron to a higher state. </p>
      <p>Similarly, as discussed earlier, the stimulated electron can
        move to a lower level, provided that such a level exists and
        that the difference between the two levels corresponds to the
        energy of the incoming photon exactly. The energy given up by
        the electron in jumping to a lower state goes into creating an
        additional photon with the same characteristics as the colliding
        photon. </p>
      <p>A large number of atoms can provide an increase in the radiated
        energy at the desired frequency or energy level, if the
        population of electrons in the excited states of the atoms is
        suitably arranged. Consider two excited levels of a system of
        identical atoms with the electrons divided between the upper and
        lower levels. If a radiated photon having a wavelength
        corresponding to the difference in energy between the two levels
        is allowed to pass through the system medium, it will be
        amplified if there are more atoms with electrons in the upper
        state and absorbed if there are more atoms with electrons in the
        lower state. The condition of having more atoms in the upper
        state is called a "population inversion" (because it goes
        against the normal processes of nature, which tend to keep more
        electrons at lower energies than at higher energies). </p>
      <p>The search for new Haser "systems" is therefore not easy,
        because one is working against the natural tendencies of the
        electrons. </p>
      <p>Another important consideration is the actual `lifetimes` of
        the ion energy levels of the impurity atoms involved in the
        population inversion. The upper level of a two-level system with
        a population inversion radiates energy corresponding exactly to
        the difference between the two levels. </p>
      <p>The electrons that have thus yielded energy by radiation, end
        up at the lower level. If they remained there, the situation
        would result wherein there would be more atoms at the lower
        level than at the upper level, and as discussed earlier, there
        would be absorption instead of gain. For continuous operation,
        one must find impurity atoms with combinations of levels such
        that the lower level has a short lifetime and the upper level is
        preferentially populated. This necessity rules out the ion
        ground state as a possible Haser level, since all ion ground
        states are metastable. The pair (or more) of ion energy levels
        which will provide amplification must be energetically above the
        ground state but still below the metastable states. </p>
      <p>Although the original gas laser utilized electrical excitation
        of electronic transitions, later versions used vibrational
        transitions in molecules such as carbon dioxide, and the
        excitation mechanism may involve electrical or chemical
        excitation, or the burning of fuel. In the chemical laser,
        atomic species such as hydrogen and fluorine can be reacted to
        produce molecules in an excited vibrational state which in turn
        yields amplification or oscillation. </p>
      <p>An entirely new excitation process was announced by Garry in
        1970. In this, the gas dynamic laser, an appropriate fuel is
        burned to produce carbon dioxide and nitrogen at high
        temperature and pressure. When released through a nozzle into
        the optical resonator region, the gas cools rapidly in terms of
        its kinetic or translational energy, but the population of the
        vibrational energy levels of the carbon dioxide molecules
        becomes inverted since the lower level of the laser transition
        relaxes more rapidly. In addition, the vibrationally excited
        nitrogen molecules are in near resonance with the upper laser
        state of the carbon dioxide and transfer energy with high
        efficiency to maintain the inversion. This type of `laser` has
        produced continuous powers as high as 60 Kw. </p>
      <p>The HASER phenomenon as utilized in the present invention,
        actually uses a thermochemical excitation mechanism. The energy
        from waste heat prepares the reactant material within the
        reaction chamber by bringing the material to photon emitting
        temperatures. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 5, suitable host and sensitizer material
        to be identified below, may be coated on the inner wall of
        conduit 72 and on the inert spacer elements 76 and 78, to
        thereby radiate into the adjacent spaces or cavities. Similarly,
        in the fragmentary views of FIGS. 8 and 9, the hollow metal
        screen cells 112 (FIG. 8) and the hollow ceramic tubes 114 (FIG.
        9) in the conduits 72, are surrounded by metal oxide 116, and
        the entire mass is heated to elevated temperatures through the
        walls 72. Included in the structure of the cells 112 (or coated
        on them), and included in the ceramic tubes 114 is the host and
        sensitizer material, tailored to absorb input heat energy and to
        radiate energy at the desired output frequency within the
        absorption bands of the water vapor. </p>
      <p>When water vapor is introduced into the arrangements of FIGS. 1
        and 8, for example, the excited billions of photons emitted and
        traveling between particulates, strike the sensitized "Cavities"
        with a barrage of photons designed to provide frequency,
        amplitude, and steric factor impact adequate to dissociate the
        H.sub.2 O molecules. On dissociation, the 2H.sub.2, and O.sub.2
        molecules are vibrating at very high temperatures and pressures
        which are compatible with recombining these molecules through
        the "activated complex" mechanism into their (high temperature)
        preferential H.sub.2 O.sub.2 +H.sub.2 molecules, which
        incidentally evolves more than 33 KCal/mole heat energy. As the
        steam enters and traverses the cavity, an amount of the steam
        (depending upon the design of the contents of the reaction
        chamber and the relative amount of reactant, manganese oxide or
        other similar metal oxide, and the host/sensitizer material),
        combines with the reactant, which raises the oxidation level
        through the process of oxidation; and this of course, evolves
        heat energy (because this is an exothemic reaction), which,
        broadcasts more photons of energy throughout the cavity
        interior, to react with the sensitizers and activators; and this
        in turn creates massive amounts of new photons of energy to
        dissociate the water vapor and to help maintain the reaction
        temperatures within the host materials. </p>
      <p>Referring again to FIG. 8, the cavities 112 can be fabricated
        of very fine mesh woven wire, which is cut into small sections,
        stamped, folded, and the outer edges of the wire mesh are
        secured together to form a hollow cell. The wire, of a diameter
        approximately equal to 0.002 inch, is made up of the elements,
        compounds, and a metal carrier (inert to the process), and is
        intially woven and formed into the cells as described above. It
        is then transformed into the desired host and sensitizer
        materials through oxidation in an atmospherically controlled
        furnance or kiln. </p>
      <p>Instead of the wire mesh cells 112 as shown in FIG. 8, the
        preferred form of Haser cavity is shown in FIG. 9 in which a
        large number of ceramic tubes 114 are present. These tubes are
        preferably extruded from mullite, which is a common clay having
        the approximate chemical structure of 2Al.sub.2
        O.sub.3.SiO.sub.2 with a range to 3Al.sub.2 O.sub.3.2SiO.sub.2.
        Suitable quantities of host and sensitizer materials, as
        described below, are added to, and thoroughly mixed with the
        mullite prior to extrusion. Subsequent to extrusion the tubes
        are fired in a suitable kiln or furnance. The tubes may suitably
        have a diameter of about 1/4 inch or 1/2 and be from 1/2 inch to
        4 inches in length. The sidewalls may be suitable from 1/32 to
        1/16 of an inch in thickness, but none of the foregoing
        dimensions are critical. After firing, the tubes 114 may be
        provided with filters in both ends. The filters may be of any
        suitable structure, for example, several layers of metal gauze,
        to prevent the intrusion of the reactant 116 which may, for
        example, be manganese oxide. In practice the ceramic tubes 114
        may be initially placed in one of the heat exchanges conduits;
        and then powdered metallic manganese or manganese oxide may be
        poured in and the entire unit vibrated and rotated until the
        manganese oxide 116 as shown in FIG. 9 fills all the space
        around the ceramic tubes 352. With this arrangement, of course,
        the water vapor is present within all of the ceramic tubes 114
        and radiation from the host/sensitizer combination forming part
        of the ceramic walls 352 radiates intense coherent energy in one
        or more of the absorption bands of water vapor; and this intense
        radiation serves to dissociate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms
        making up the water vapor molecule. </p>
      <p>In the tabulation which is set forth below, suitable host
        materials and sensitizers for applying radiation to water vapor
        will be set forth. In this tabulation the chemical symbols for
        the elements will be employed, and the host materials will be
        listed first followed by the sensitizer material. In each case
        the absorption band for the host material will initially be
        given and then the emission wavelength of the sensitizer will be
        set forth. </p>

      <p>In the foregoing tabulation it may be noted that there are only
        three separate combinations of host and sensitizer materials
        which are being employed. More specifically, the combination of
        calcium tungstate and neodymium produce output radiations both
        at 1.065 microns and also at 1.3372 microns as set forth in
        examples (a) and (b). It may be noted that the absorption
        wavelengths for the two output emissions differ correspondingly.
        The combination tabulated in examples (c) and (d) set forth
        above include yttrium aluminum oxide as the host material and
        erbium as the sensitizer. In this case, the emitted radiation
        for both (c) and (d) is at 1.6602 microns; however, the
        absorption for the two examples is at different frequencies. The
        final example (e) using calcium floride as the host material and
        uranium-3 as the sensitizer was mentioned above absorbs at 1.2
        to 1.3 microns, and radiates at 2.5111 and at 2.613 microns. </p>
      <p>With regard to the matching of the emitted radiation from the
        sensitizers with the absorption bands for water vapor as a
        feedstock, reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,701 in which
        a full discussion is presented. </p>
      <p>Three additional host-sensitizer combinations which are
        applicable to water vapor are yttrium aluminum oxide with
        holmium; calcium tungstate with erbium; and calcium fluoride
        with dysprosium. These are tabulated below with their absorption
        and emission wavelengths in microns. </p>

        ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>Incidentally, the visible spectrum ranges from about: 0.400
        microns to about 0.700 microns (4,000 Angstrom units to 7,000
        Angstrom units) so the 0.46 to 0.47 micron absorption region is
        in the blue band of the visible spectrum, and most of the
        emission wavelengths are in the infrared band. </p>
      <p>With regard to the relative quantities of the host and
        sensitizer material in the mullite, the quantity of host
        material should be approximately 25 to 1,000 times greater than
        the amount of associated sensitizer material. A ratio of
        approximately 0.5% of sensitizer of the amount of host material
        is the general order of magnitude which should be employed. In
        addition, the quantity of each particular category of host and
        sensitizer material such as those set forth in the tabulation of
        combinations (a) through (h) set forth above, should be
        proportioned to the absorption bands of the feedback which is
        being irradiated. Thus, in the particular example under
        consideration, where the host/sensitizer combination (e) using
        calcium floride and uranium-3, is matched to a broad absorption
        band of water vapor, a larger quantity of this host/sensitizer
        combination should be employed as compared with combination
        (a),(b) and combination (c), (d). Thus, in the making of the
        ceramic tubes, the material which is being prepared might
        include approximately 88% by weight of mullite, 8% by weight of
        the host/sensitizer combination (e), and 2% by weight of each
        host/sensitizer combinations (a), (b) and (c), (d). Similarly,
        in the event that the wire mesh is employed, the host
        sensitizer/sensitizer combinations may be added in the same
        proportions to stainless steel wire and the combination material
        drawn into wires and formed into mesh. Alternatively, after the
        preparation of the stainless steel wire cells, mullite together
        with the host sensitizer combinations could be applied in
        several bands in the plastic state around the stainless steel
        wire mesh cells, and then fired, to produce the desired result.
        This result, as mentioned above, involves the provision of
        spaces throughout a body of material constituting a heat
        reservoir, and locating host/sensitizer combinations around the
        boundaries of these spaces or voids in the material. </p>
      <p>The chemical formula for mullite was given above, and it is
        again noted that mullite includes aluminum oxide AL.sub.2
        O.sub.3 and silicon dioxide SiO.sub.2 in certain proportions
        noted above. In order to enhance the "HASER" action and increase
        the energization of the host/sensitizer combinations (a) through
        (e) set forth above, a material such as chromium, which acts as
        a sensitizer in cooperation with the aluminum oxide in mullite
        which acts as the host material, may be added. The
        chromium-aluminum oxide, sensitizer-host combination produces
        strong output radiation at a number of wavelengths, including
        output radiation centered ar 0.6934 microns, when the AL.sub.2
        O.sub.3 is absorbing energy at 0.5 microns. The radiation
        centered at 0.6934 is broadened at the high temperature
        operating conditions so that the radiation extends from 0.6 or
        0.65 to 0.75 or 0.8 microns, thus providing supplemental input
        energy to example (a) set forth hereinabove, which involves
        absorption at about 0.74 to 0.76 microns. The AL.sub.2 O.sub.3
        /Cr combination may also directly apply energy to the feedback
        when the output radiation is of the proper frequency and may
        also pump other host/sensitizer combinations. When chromium is
        used it will be present in quantities in the order of five
        percent by weight or less of the mullite employed as the basic
        material of the tubes 114 shown in FIG. 9. </p>
      <p>The primary requirements for potential solid-state Maser/Haser
        materials are, first, that the composition should fluoresce with
        a suitably high intensity at elevated temperatures by means of
        thermal energy alone and, second, that the matrix should be
        transparent or has no absorption transition at the operation
        frequency; it should also be chemically stable and have no
        caustic characteristic. </p>
      <p>Preferably, the terminal level of the Haser transition of the
        active ion should be far enough above the ground state so that
        three or four-level operation is possible and at elevated
        temperatures. </p>
      <p>The lifetime of the metastable level from which the Haser
        transition orginates should be, insofar as possible, equal to
        the lifetime for spontaneous emission with no constraints
        imposed by competitive dissipation to the matrix. In four-level
        operation the lifetime of the terminal of the transition must be
        smaller than that of the metastable level; otherwise, a suitable
        excess populetion in the upper level cannot be maintained. </p>
      <p>This condition is generally obtained when the terminal level
        lies in the phonon absorption region, preferably between 6,000
        and 19,000 cm.sup.-1. In addition, it is helpful for the excited
        active ion to be unable to absorb photons corresponding in
        energy to the Haser transition. Where such absorption into a
        higher level or band is possible, the photon/phonon flux in the
        particulate cavity is reduced and the metastable level depleted.
      </p>
      <p>For best coherence the active ions should occupy equivalent
        positions in the host structure, so that there will not be a
        multiplicity of spectra. When these ions are in completely
        unique sites, the emissions spectrum has the minimum detail and
        line width consistent with the site symmetry, the crystal field,
        and the active-ion concentration. In general, the higher the
        site symmetry the more degenerate the electronic state of the
        active ion. Therefore, fewer distinct transitions should be
        observed in fluorescence and, on the average, each emission
        transition should fluoresce a greater portion of the absorbed
        energy. However, there are also fewer distinct absorption
        transitions, and certain emission transitions may be favored in
        a low-symmetry environment. As long as the emission transitions
        are few in number, the low symmetry environment may prove to be
        advantageous by virtue of a broader absorption coverage. </p>
      <p>Different classes of active ions seldom find optimum
        environments in the same host structure. Different activator
        ions are best accommodated in oxides or fluorides, where the
        cations of the matrix are approximately equal in size to the
        activator. AL.sub.2 O.sub.3, MgO, MgFL.sub.2, and ZnF.sub.2 are
        typical matrices for transitional ions, CaF.sub.2 is
        particularly useful for divalent rare-earth ions, and
        CaWO.sub.4, LaF.sub.3, and Y.sub.2 O.sub.3 are best suited for
        trivalent rare-earth ions for lasers. Y.sub.3 AL.sub.5 O.sub.12
        can readily accommodate both trivalent rare-earth ions and
        trivalent 3d transitional-metal ions. Certain crystals have
        conveniently disposed matrix absorption bands and these can be
        used to absorb pumped radiation over a broad spectrum. </p>
      <p>Other factors to be considered in selecting suitable host and
        sensitizer materials are set forth in my prior U.S. Pat. No.
        4,148,701, mentioned above. </p>
      <p>An electromatic radiation, (such as radiowave, light, and
        X-ray) can be characterized by its particular wavelength,
        LAMBDA, (measured in cm or A), or by its wave number, NU, (the
        reciprocal of the wavelength), .nu.=a/.lambda., commonly
        expressed in reciprocal centimeters, cm.sup.-. </p>
      <p>Each unit of radiation (a photon) corresponds to a quantum of
        radiant energy, E, which is directly proportional to a wave
        number, .nu.. Since chemical calculations are founded on a mole
        basis, in discussing the relationship between radiant energy and
        chemical processes (responsive activators and hosts) it is
        convenient to express radiant energy in kcal/mole of photons. We
        can do with this accepted relationship; the radiant energy in 1
        mole of photons, with=350 cm.sup.-1, is equal to 1 kcal. </p>
      <p>Therefore, we can obtain the energy (expressed in kcal/mole)
        for photons of a given number simply by multiplying the value of
        .nu. expressed in cm.sup.31 1 by the conversion factor: ##EQU1##
      </p>
      <p>For example, the energy of light photons with .nu.=20,000
        cm.sup.-1 is: ##EQU2## and the energy of a single photon of
        .nu.=20,000 cm.sup.-1 is: ##EQU3## </p>
      <p>The wave number, .nu. and the energy, of electromagnetic
        radiations varies within an extremely wide range .nu.=10.sup.14
        cm for the .gamma.-rays emitted in nuclear reactions to
        .nu.=10.sup.-6 cm for radiowaves. In between these two extremes,
        there is a continuum of radiations of intermediate wave
        numbers--the "visible region", which extends approximately from
        27,000 cm.sup.-1 to 13,500 cm.sup.-1. </p>
      <p>In general, when white light strikes a substance, part of the
        light is absorbed and part is transmitted (if the substance is
        transparent) or part is reflected (if the substance is opaque).
        A substance may absorb preferentially the light photons of one
        (or more) regions of the spectrum, so that the transmitted light
        or the reflected light is relatively richer in the radiation of
        the remaining regions. </p>
      <p>The combined effect of these remaining radiations is observed
        as a particular color (when it is in the visible spectrum). </p>
      <p>For example, a substance that, when exposed to white light,
        absorbs almost all photons in the entire yellow--to violet
        region (say from 17,000 to 27,000 cm.sup.-1) will "appear red",
        because only the radiations in the red region of the spectrum
        (13,500 to about 17,000 cm.sup.-1), which are not absorbed,
        remain to be observed. </p>
      <p>Similarly, a substance that "appears yellow" absorbs photons of
        both the green-to-violet region (from 19,000 cm.sup.-1 to 27,000
        cm.sup.1) and the red region (from 13,500 to 16,000 cm.sup.-1)
        of the visible spectrum. </p>
      <p>Since light (radiation) is energy, the absorption of radiation
        is absorption of energy; it is well known, that, if a substance
        absorbs light, the corresponding absorbed energy may be used to
        promote certain atoms, ions, or molecules of a substance from
        "ground-state" to an "excited state". For example, an atom, ion,
        or molecule which absorbs a photon of a given wave length takes
        on a `quantun` of energy that may serve to promote one electron
        from a lower energy orbital to a higher (available) energy
        orbital. In general, different electronic transitions involve
        the absorption of different quanta of energy. </p>
      <p><b>SPECIFIC EXAMPLES</b> </p>
      <p>Some underlying principles involved in the selection of Haser
        systems have been set out hereinabove and a preferred embodiment
        has been described which involves water vapor as a feedstock and
        the generation of hydrogen and/or hydrogen peroxide. It is to be
        understood that the Haser concept is not limited to the specific
        embodiment described herein but has more general applicability
        in the conversion of broad spectrum heat energy or radiation to
        particular frequencies which lie within the absorption band or
        bands of any selected feedstock. Further, the feedstock may be
        gaseous or liquid or even a slurry. </p>
      <p>In the following examples, a number of reactions are set forth
        and these are followed by an identification of a host and
        sensitizer material which will concentrate the broader spectrum
        heat energy to one of the absorption bands of the feedstock.
        Incidentally, in the following examples, in addition to the
        standard symbols for the elements, the following abbreviations
        are used: Et for ethyl, C.sub.2 H.sub.5 ; Ph for phenyl, C.sub.6
        H.sub.5 ; Pr for propyl, C.sub.3 H.sub.7 ; and Bu for butyl,
        C.sub.4 H.sub.9. In addition to the host and sensitizers shown
        in each of the following examples, Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 in mullite
        and Cr.sup.+3 may advantageously be used (absorption at 0.5
        microns; emission centered at 0.6934 microns). As noted above,
        the mullite may conveniently be employed to physically support
        the host and sensitizer materials. In the actual examples set
        forth below, the host and sensitizer materials implement the
        HASER concept by shifting the radiation, and concentrating it
        within the absorption bands of the materials being acted upon.
        However, in most cases no steam is involved and no sequestering
        of oxygen occurs. Accordingly, with regard to the implementing
        apparatus, that disclosed below in connection with FIG. 10, for
        example, is employed within the heat exchanger apparatus. </p>

      <p>FIG. 10 shows an alternative arrangement for the heat absorbing
        conduit and reaction zone. More specifically, referring to FIG.
        10, it shows in cross section the outer stainless steel tube or
        conduit 122 and an inner layer 124 of host and sensitizer
        material of any of the types described hereinabove, and matched
        in its output spectral characteristic to the absorption bands of
        the material which is to be passed through the opening 126 at
        the center of the conduit 122. In the case of the dissociation
        of water vapor, any of the host and sensitizer combinations
        designated A through H hereinabove may be employed for the layer
        124. It may also be noted that the hollow interior of the
        conduit 122 will facilitate the transmission of liquids and
        slurries through the conduit in addition to gases such as water
        vapor mentioned hereinabove. It may also be noted that, in the
        arrangement of FIG. 10, no metal oxide is employed; accordingly,
        the generation of hydrogen may be continuous without the need
        for successive oxide regeneration or oxygen disproportionation
        periods of time during which the generation of hydrogen is
        halted. </p>
      <p>Incidentally, in FIG. 10 the arrows directed inwardly toward
        the outer surface of the conduit 122 indicates schematically the
        waste heat which is continually applied to the conduit, from the
        gases passing up the stack or chimney. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 11, 12 and 13 represent yet another embodiment for the
        possible use of waste heat in forming hydrogen and in other
        chemical reactions, with the embodiment of FIGS. 11 through 13
        being at present in the experimental developmental stages. More
        specifically, the structure of FIG. 11 shows an outer stainless
        steel conduit 132 having an inner layer of host/sensltizer
        material 135 and two inner concentric perforated metal cylinders
        136 and 138. The cylinder 136 in apertured in a manner indicated
        generally in FIG. 12 of the drawings. FIG. 13 shows the
        composite structure of the cylindrical wall 138, which has
        apertures 140 spaced less frequently than the apertures in the
        cylindrical wall 136, and covered with a very thin composite
        film of silver and aluminum. In the schematic showing of FIG.
        13, the substrate 142 is a very thin layer of rolled silver, and
        it is provided with a vapor deposited coating of aluminum 144
        which is applied to the layer of silver 142 after it has been
        secured in place on the screen 138 by epoxy glue or the like. A
        silver layer is rolled very thin in a manner similar to gold
        leaf, and may be only a few Angstrom units thick. It is known
        that a very thin layer of silver will transmit most ultraviolet
        radiations shorter than about 3100 Angstroms; however, it is
        known that deposited aluminum layers do not transmit significant
        amounts of radiation until the wavelength is significantly
        shorter than 2,000 Angstroms and then transmits freely below
        1000 Angstrom units. The use of a very thin rolled silver layer
        for support of the vapor deposited aluminum layer 248 is a
        convenient technique for obtaining the desired transmission
        qualities, emphasizing the transmission through the cylinder 138
        of ultraviolet radiations of high intensity, which are well
        within the ultraviolet absorption band of water vapor at which
        it readily dissociates. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 11, radiation such as that indicated by the
        line 148, which originates from the host/sensitizer layer 134,
        will pass through some of the apertures in the cylinder 136, and
        will be subject to multiple reflections between the two
        stainless steel cylinders 136 and 138 until the radiation
        finally passes through one of the openings in cylinder 138, as
        indicated by the arrowhead 150. The two stainless steel
        cylinders 136 and 138 form a resonant cavity into which
        progressively more energy is fed by the radiation from the
        host/sensitizer layer 134 passing through the openings in
        cylinder 136. As more and more energy is pumped into the
        resonant cavity, its energy content increases, as the energy
        cannot escape, and finally the energy reaches such a high level
        that the frequency is shifted upward and the contained energy is
        "dumped" at the higher frequency levels through the selective
        transmission fill. Incidentally, this frequency shift phenomenon
        is similar to that which occurs in a kiln, as more and more
        energy is supplied to it and the temperature within the kiln
        increases from the infrared to a bright red and finally to white
        heat, radiating progressively higher frequencies as the energy
        within the kiln or reservoir increases. </p>
      <p>The "wave-compression" or frequency increase is accomplished in
        resonators where electromagnetic fields can exist whose
        distributions of amplitudes and phase reproduce themselves upon
        repeated reflections between mirrored surfaces. These particular
        electromagnetic field configurations comprise the transverse
        modes of a passive resonator. The "wave-compression" may be
        calculated by means of Schroedinger equations involving the
        Infinite Square-Well Potential. </p>
      <p>The "Infinite Square-Well Potential" analysis approach is often
        used in quantam mechanics to represent a condition in which a
        particle/wave duality moves in a restricted region of space
        under the influence of forces which hold it in that region.
        Although this simplistic potential loses some details of the
        motion, it retains the essential feature, which is binding a
        wave particle to a region of a certain size, by means of forces
        of certain characteristics. The resonator as shown in FIG. 11,
        with the output filter of FIG. 13, is clearly analogous to the
        physical systems which have been previously been analyzed using
        the square-well potential approach. More rigorous mathematical
        analysis reaching the same conclusions may be accomplished using
        square-well potential theory and Schroedinger's equation,
        following the approach set forth in the text entitled, "Quantum
        Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, and Particles", by
        Robert Eisberg and Robert Resnick, Copyright 1974 John Wiley
        &amp; Sons, Inc., pages 226 through 239, and Appendix G, pages
        G1 through G6. </p>
      <p>The action of the high pass filter, including the aluminum and
        silver layers 142 and 144 associated with the perforated cylnder
        138, is similar to the cavity dumping principles employed in
        lasers. More specifically, it may well be compared to the
        well-known laser system known as "pulse-transmission mode
        Q-switching" which is a means for generating extremely short
        (time) Q-switched laser pulses by Q-switching a laser with 100%
        reflective mirrors on both ends of the oscillator cavity, and
        then at the peak of accumulated stored energy, rapidly switching
        the output mirror from 100% to a very low percent reflection, or
        high transmission. This allows a very rapid dumping of the
        accumulated optical energy from within the cavity. As noted
        above, the effect of the composite screen 142, 144 is very
        similar in that, as the frequency of the radiation builds up to
        the ultraviolet levels, it is immediately permitted to radiate
        through the composite screen and into the central reaction zone
        within the cylinder 138 to dissociate water vapor therein. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 14 and 15 of the drawings, the disclosed
        apparatus is similar in many respects to those shown in FIGS. 1
        through 5 of the drawings. More particularly, the apparatus as
        shown in block diagram form in FIG. 14 includes four reservoirs,
        162, 164, 166 and 168 for water, steam, hydrogen and hydrogen
        peroxide, and finally, the low pressure or vacuum tank 168. In
        FIG. 14, the block 170 shown in dashed lines represents the
        space within the stack or chimney from which the waste heat is
        being derived. Within the stack 170 are located the heat
        exchanger 172 which is employed to turn water from tank 162 into
        steam and supply it back to the reservoir 164; and the four
        combined reaction chamber and heat exchange units 174, 176, 178
        and 180. Associated with each of the units 174, 176, 178 and 180
        are three valves designated S, H and V. The four reaction
        chamber units are operated sequentially so that hydrogen or
        hydrogen peroxide is generated continuously. Regarding the cycle
        for each one of the individual units, initially the input valve
        designated "S" is opened to admit steam; and the output valve
        designated "H" is opened to the hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide
        storage tank 166. After a predetermined period of time, when
        most of the reactant in the reaction chamber, such as 174, has
        been oxidized to a higher oxidation state, the hydrogen valve
        designated "H" is closed, and the valve "V" leading to the low
        pressure or vacuum chamber 168 is opened to disproportionate the
        metal oxide at a lower pressure. The sequential mode of
        operation is disclosed in greater detail in my prior patents
        cited hereinabove. </p>
      <p>Also shown in FIG. 14 is the vacuum pump 184 and the torch or
        burner 186 which is shown to indicate a useful load. Suitable
        check valves 188 may be provided as indicated, and elsewhere in
        the system, such as in association with the "H" valves leading
        from each reaction chamber to the hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide
        reservoir 166. The valve designated "E" indicates the exhaust
        from the vacuum pump 184. </p>
      <p>FIG. 15 shows a pilot plant implementation of the system
        diagrammatically shown in FIG. 14. In FIG. 15, the stock 170 is
        shown at the upper left, and encloses the small diameter piping
        172 wherein the steam is formed, in addition to the reaction
        chamber--heat exchanger assemblies 174, 176, 178 and 180. The
        conduits generally indicated by reference numeral 192
        interconnect the heat exchanger components with the remainder of
        the apparatus located outside of the stack, and including the
        four reservoirs 162, 164, 166 and 168. The cyclic operation of
        the four heat exchanger--reaction chamber units is controlled by
        the cams 194 which operate the valves S, H, and V associated
        with each of the four reaction chambers. The cam shaft is driven
        by a small electric motor 196. The remaining components shown in
        FIG. 15 generally carry the same reference numerals as the
        corresponding parts shown in the diagram of FIG. 14. </p>
      <p>It may be noted in passing that each of the heat
        exchanger--reaction chamber units 174, 176, 178 and 180 includes
        a series of vertically oriented conduits of relatively large
        diameter, interconnected by smaller diameter conduits at the top
        or the bottom, so that flow through the larger diameter upright
        conduits is maintained from one end of the first large diameter
        conduit to the end of the last one. In practice, the small
        diameter horizontal tubes interconnecting the larger diameter
        conduits, are empty; but the larger diameter vertically
        extending conduits contain metallic oxide, such as manganese
        oxide, having a cross sectional configuration somewhat like that
        shown in FIG. 5. When the oxide containing reaction chambers are
        vertically oriented, there is little opportunity for the water
        vapor to by-pass the oxide material, unlike a horizontal
        configuration, for example, wherein the oxide might fall away
        from the upper wall and permit unhindered flow of the steam
        through the system without dissociation. Concerning the mode of
        forming spaces within the metal oxide, such as manganese oxide,
        one possible arrangement has been discussed hereinabove in
        connection with FIG. 5. In another alternative embodiment, the
        metal oxide may be initially mixed up in a batch interspersed
        with a material which will be driven off at higher temperatures
        but below the operating temperature of the unit. In one case, a
        substantial quantity of very thin spaghetti was employed, and
        the result after driving off the spaghetti through heating to
        elevated temperature, was porous and channeled so that good flow
        of steam via a circuitous path through the metal oxide was
        achieved. </p>
      <p>Incidentally, the preferred metallic oxide, manganese oxide has
        several oxidation state. At atmospheric pressure MNO.sub.2
        disproportionates to MN.sub.2 O.sub.3 at 535 degrees centigrade,
        which corresponds to approximately 995 degrees Fahrenheit and
        about 808 degrees Kelvin. Also, MN.sub.2 O.sub.3
        disproportionates to MN.sub.3 O.sub.4 at approximately 1,080
        degrees Centigrade, corresponding to approximately 1,976 degrees
        Fahrenheit or 1,353 degrees Kelvin. With an assumed stack
        temperature in the order of 1,200 degrees Kelvin, or about
        927.degree. C., or 1,701 degrees Fahrenheit, the disclosed
        system will absorb oxygen and disproportionate between MNO.sub.2
        and MN.sub.2 O.sub.3, under normal conditions. However, when
        temperatures above 1,080 degrees C. are present in the stack,
        additional oxidation and sequestering of the oxygen may take
        place to include the MN.sub.3 O.sub.4 oxidation state of
        manganese. </p>
      <p>Now, turning to a consideration of temperatures and radiation
        frequencies, operation at a temperature in the order of 1000
        degrees Kelvin will be briefly considered. Initially, it is
        noted that 1000 Kelvin is in the order of 727 degrees
        Centigrade, and this in turn is in the order of 1340 degrees F.
        As noted hereinabove, the temperature for the dissociation of
        MnO.sub.2 to Mn.sub.2 O.sub.3 at atmospheric pressure is
        approximately 535 degrees C. Accordingly, at the higher
        temperature of 1000 degrees Kelvin or 727 degrees C., such
        dissociation at a reduced pressure of perhaps 1/10th atmosphere
        will go forward rapidly. At lower temperatures, even below 535
        degrees C., the process may still be operated, but with oxides
        other than manganese oxide. Other metals and oxides thereof
        which may be used, are mentioned in column 37 of my prior U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,113,589, and these include antimony, cesium, barium,
        iron, manganese, chromium, iridium, nickel, and thallium, and
        eutectics or alloys of these metals and their oxides. Specific
        oxides which may be used and their minimum temperatures include
        lead oxide having a critical disproportionation temperature of
        370 degrees C., nickel oxide having a critical temperature of
        about 600 degrees C., potassium peroxochromate having a critical
        temperature of only 100 degrees C., Strontium oxide, having
        critical temperature of 215 degrees C., and telurium oxide
        having a critical temperature of about 400 degrees C. If
        desired, the units 21, 22, 23 and 24 may include different
        oxides, with the cooler gases toward the upper portion of the
        stack being uitilized to work with some of the oxides which
        disassociate at atmospheric pressure at temperatures below
        manganese oxide, for example. Alternatively, if the stack gases
        remain at a reasonably high temperature as they pass the heat
        exchange units 21 through 24, or in the event that arrangements
        such as those shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 are employed, a single
        oxide such as manganese oxide may be employed. </p>
      <p>It may also be noted with regard to the radiation inward from
        the walls of the pipes which are exposed to the exhaust gases,
        that a temperature of 1000 degrees Kelvin will produce radiation
        in a "black body" which will peak at a wavelength of
        approximately 2 microns, as shown in FIG. 15 of U.S. Pat. No.
        4,113,589 cited hereinabove, and the radiation will extend to a
        significant degree into the lower frequency end of the visible
        spectrum. In this connection it may be useful to note that the
        visible spectrum extends from about 0.4 to 0.7 microns,
        corresponding to 400 to 700 millimicrons, and the equivalent
        band expressed in Angstrom units is 4,000 to 7,000 Angstrom
        units. With an ambient temperature in the order of 1000 degrees
        Kelvin, ample excitation for the host/sensitizer combinations as
        set forth hereinabove is available. In the event of somewhat
        lower exhaust gas temperatures, supplemental heating from the
        generated hydrogen may be employed locally at the individual
        heat exchange units, or may be supplied to the main process to
        further increase its temperature, and both of these
        possibilities are indicated by the feedback conduit 152 as shown
        in FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>In closing, it is to be understood that the foregoing
        description and the drawings merely refer to one illustrative
        embodiment of the invention. Thus, by way of example and not of
        limitation, the heat exchange arrangements may have any suitable
        configuration which enhances heat transfer and minimizes back
        pressure, and these may be other than those shown in the
        drawings; the dissociation of the water vapor may be
        accomplished by (a) the sequestering of oxygen from water vapor
        by metallic oxides, (b) the generation of suitable frequencies
        within the absorption bands of water vapor by suitable host and
        sensitizer combinations, (c) by appropriate multiphoton
        absorption processes, and (d) any combination of the foregoing
        including the further dissociation of water vapor by high
        excitation photons or particles; and other filtering materials
        may be employed which are different from those disclosed in
        connection with FIG. 13 of the drawings. Accordingly, it is to
        be understood that the present invention is not limited to the
        embodiments precisely as described hereinabove and as shown in
        the accompanying drawings. </p>
