      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>A gas separator system for separating gases of substantially
        different molecular weights, such as oxygen and carbon monoxide,
        includes a series of concentrically nested coils, with the
        output of each coil being connected to the input of the next
        coil. Gas is directed through the coils at high velocity to
        cause laminar flow in the tubes of the coils, with the heavier
        gas flowing through the tubing adjacent the outer periphery of
        each coil of tubing, as a result of centrifugal force, and the
        lighter gas being forced to flow near the inner surface of the
        tubing of each coil. Starting one or two turns from the input to
        each coil, after laminar flow is established, small openings are
        provided at the outer periphery, or preferably at the inner
        surfaces of the tubing making up the coils, whereby one of the
        gases selectively flows out of the coils of tubing into an
        enclosing housing. A gas storage container may be provided to
        receive the gas which flows into the enclosing housing; and a
        water tank, and pumps to direct water flow between the gas
        storage container and the water tank may be employed to provide
        reduced pressure in the gas storage container. Conventional
        vacuum or gas pumps may also be provided to reduce the pressure
        in the storage tank and the enclosing chamber or to direct the
        separated gas as desired. <br>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Various methods and apparatus have been proposed heretofore to
        separate gases. For example, carbon monoxide has been separated
        from oxygen by bubbling the gas mixture through water, with the
        carbon monoxide being selectively absorbed into the water.
        Apparatus have also been proposed to separate gases through
        their differing magnetic properties. However, these systems have
        not been entirely satisfactory, with incomplete separation in
        some cases, and with at least one of the gases not being readily
        available, as in the case of the absorption of carbon monoxide
        into water. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, an important object of the invention is to provide
        a system for accomplishing relatively complete separation of
        gases, with the output gases being directly available in gaseous
        form. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention a mixture of gases of
        significantly different molecular weights is applied at high
        velocity to a coil of tubing having a series of turns, so that
        laminar flow is produced in the tubing, with the heavier gas
        toward the outer periphery of the coils of tubing, and the
        lighter gas flowing adjacent the inner side of each turn of
        tubing. Small openings are provided at either the outer or
        preferably the inner surfaces of each turn of tubing other than
        the input turn or two, to permit selective flow of one of the
        gases into an enclosing housing. </p>
      <p>In accordance with a more specific aspect of this invention,
        carbon monoxide and oxygen may be supplied to the coils of
        tubing at a high velocity and at a relatively high temperature,
        so that the oxygen gas is in its monatomic state, and the lower
        molecular weight oxygen is drawn off through small openings at
        the inner surfaces of the coils, into the enclosing housing
        which is maintained at a reduced pressure. </p>
      <p>In accordance with an additional aspect of the invention, an
        additional gas collection or storage chamber is coupled to this
        enclosing housing to collect and store one of the separated
        gases prior to utilization. A water tank may also be provided,
        along with arrangements for pumping water between the water tank
        and the gas collection and storage chamber, to maintain the
        storage chamber at the desired reduced pressure. Gas pumps may
        be provided for (1) reducing the pressure in the enclosing
        housing or the storage tank, (2) transmitting the collected gas
        to a desired external location and/or (3) for compressing the
        collected gas for long term storage. </p>
      <p>Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will
        become apparent from a consideration of the following detailed
        description and from the accompanying drawings. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>Referring more particularly to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows a
        complete system in accordance with the present invention whereby
        mixed gases from a source such as that shown at 12 in the
        drawings, are separated so that the component gases, separated
        from one another, appear at the output conduits 14 and 16. In
        the particular example with which the inventor was concerned,
        the two gases which were applied to the input conduit 18 were
        carbon monoxide and oxygen, at a temperature of approximately
        1100 degrees Fahrenheit, wherein the oxygen was in the monatomic
        form as a single atom of oxygen, rather than in its diatomic
        form, usually shown as O.sub.2, which is the form taken by
        oxygen at room temperatures, and as it is present in the earth's
        atmosphere. </p>
      <p>The mass of one gram-mole of oxygen atoms is precisely 15.9994
        grams, and consequently the mass for one oxygen atom is
        2.656383862.times.10.sup.-23 grams. Similarly, the mass of one
        gram-mole of carbon monoxide molecules is 28.01055 grams, and
        consequently the mass for one carbon monoxide molecule is
        4.650597709.times.10.sup.-23 grams. </p>
      <p>In the system of the present invention, the difference in the
        mass between the carbon monoxide and the oxygen molecules is
        employed to separate the two gases as a result of the
        centrifugal and centripetal forces acting on the molecules of
        the gases as they are applied to the coils 20, 22, 24, 26 and 28
        at relatively high pressures and resultant velocities. For
        convenience, and because these terms will be used in the
        following description, it is noted that the word "centrifugal"
        means "proceeding or acting in a direction away from a center or
        axis"; and the word "centripetal" means "proceeding or acting in
        a direction toward a center or axis". </p>
      <p>In the present case, the greater mass of the carbon monoxide
        molecules will apply a centrifugal force to carbon monoxide,
        which is substantially greater than the centrifugal force
        applied to the oxygen, and accordingly, the carbon monoxide will
        displace the oxygen adjacent the outer periphery of the tubing
        in the coils through which the mixed gases pass. Small slots 32
        are provided on the inner surface of the coils such as coil 20,
        as shown in FIG. 3, after the first few turns of the coil 20,
        following the establishment of laminar flow within the tubes.
        With the enclosing chamber 34 maintained at a somewhat reduced
        pressure, an inward, or centripetal force arising from the gas
        pressure within the tubes, will cause oxygen flow through these
        slots 32 into the enclosing chamber 34. </p>
      <p>Now, returning to FIG. 1 of the drawings, the conduit 18 is
        coupled at point 36 to the innermost coil 20, having the
        smallest radius. At the bottom of the assembly, the lowermost
        turn of coil 20 is coupled to the lowermost turn of the coil of
        tubing 22, so that the gas follows a circular path back up to
        the top of the chamber 34, with the successive coils from the
        coil 20 to coil 28 being coupled to one another, with the
        lowermost turn of the outer coil 28 being connected to the exit
        conduit 14 for the carbon monoxide. </p>
      <p>It is again noted that each of the coils of tubing 20, 22, 24,
        26 and 28 has a series of slots 32 as shown in FIG. 3 on the
        inner surface of each turn of the coil, with the exception of
        the first couple of turns, which are excluded in view of the
        probability that laminar flow will not have been established
        until the gases have been directed through a couple of turns of
        each coil. </p>
      <p>In addition to the enclosure 34, the system of FIG. 1 includes
        a gas storage chamber 42 which is normally maintained at a
        reduced pressure or partial vacuum, and the water tank 44. The
        pumps 46 are provided to pump water back and forth between the
        water tank 44 and the gas storage chamber 42. By initially
        filling the gas storage chamber 42 substantially full of water,
        and then gradually lowering the level of the water, any desired
        partial vacuum may be accurately provided within the chamber 42.
        Of course, with the valve 48 open, this will provide a
        corresponding reduced pressure within the chamber 34. </p>
      <p>Incidentally, floats 52 and 54 may be provided within the water
        tank 44 and the gas storage chamber 42, respectively, to avoid
        or to reduce exposure between the gas in the chamber 42 and the
        water. The gas or vacuum pumps 56 are provided to withdraw gas
        from the chamber 42 and direct the gas to the output conduit 16.
        The conduits 58 extend to a point near the top of the gas
        storage chamber 42 so that the upper ends of the conduits 58 are
        always above the levels of the water which may be present in the
        gas storage chamber 42. It is to be understood that, if desired,
        the water tank 44 could be dispensed with, and the pressure
        within the gas storage chamber 42 controlled entirely by the
        pumps 56. However, through the use of the supplemental water
        tank, and the controlled level of water within the gas storage
        chamber 42, the pressure within the gas storage chamber 42 and
        the enclosure 34 may be accurately controlled; and if desired,
        the pumps 56 need only be actuated intermittently to exhaust the
        gas stored within the chamber 42. If desired, during the period
        when the oxygen is being drawn off from the chamber 42, the
        valve 48 interconnecting chambers 42 and 34 may be closed, and
        the water level within the gas storage chamber 42 raised, to
        assist in forcing out the gas stored within the chamber 42. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 is an exploded view showing the two inner coils 20 and
        22 separated from one another. It may be observed from FIG. 2
        that the input mixed gases are initially applied to the
        innermost coil 20. Of course, this coil has the smallest radius,
        and accordingly the greatest centrifugal force. With the gas
        concentration being highest, in this innermost coil 20, it is
        advantageous to have the maximum separating force present in
        this coil rather than initially applying the gases to one of the
        outer coils having a larger radius. As mentioned above, the
        openings or ports such as those shown in FIG. 3 are not provided
        until laminar flow is established within the coils of tubing.
        Accordingly, for example, the top two or three turns 62 of the
        coil 20 would not have any ports 32 (see FIG. 3). Similarly, the
        first few turns 64 of coil 22, at the bottom thereof, where the
        lowermost turn of the coil 20 is coupled to the lowermost turn
        of the coil of tubing 22, would also be free of gas retrieval
        ports. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 4 and 5 are diagrammatic showings of the mode of
        separation of the mixed gases. More specifically, in both FIGS.
        4 and 5, the carbon monoxide molecules are diagrammatically
        shown as darkened dots, while the monatomic oxygen molecules are
        shown as circles with open centers. In FIG. 4, it may be seen
        that the carbon monoxide and the oxygen are fairly uniformly
        distributed throughout the entire cross-section of the input
        tube 18. In FIG. 5, the cross-section shown is that of coils 22
        and 24, with one tube of each being shown, along with the oxygen
        retrieval or escape ports 32' and 32" being associated with
        coils 22 and 24, respectively. The center of the chamber 34 is
        located to the left, as shown in FIG. 5, and accordingly, the
        ports 32' and 32" are toward the center of each of the coils of
        tubing, 22 and 24. It may be noted from FIG. 5, that laminar gas
        flow is occurring in both of the coils of tubing 22 and 24, with
        the heavier carbon monoxide being to the right or to the outside
        of the tubes, and the lighter monatomic oxygen being to the
        left, and passing through the ports 32' and 32", into the
        enclosure 34, as shown in FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, it is to be understood that the foregoing
        detailed description and the accompanying drawings relate to a
        preferred embodiment of the invention. However, various changes
        and alternative constructions may be employed to implement the
        invention. Thus, by way of example and not of limitation,
        instead of using retrieval ports for the lighter gas on the
        inner surfaces of the circular tubing, retrieval ports may be
        provided on the outer surface of the circular tubing to collect
        the heavier gas or gases. In addition, instead of employing a
        series of concentric coils 20 through 28 as shown in FIG. 1 of
        the drawings, a series of flat spiral coils of tubing could be
        employed; further, instead of applying the input gas to the
        coils in series, the gas could be applied to all of the coils of
        tubing in parallel, with suitable manifolding and changes in
        cross-sectional diameter at the input and the output to the sets
        of coils. Also, instead of using water in the chambers 42 and
        44, other liquids could be employed. Accordingly, it is to be
        understood that the present invention is not limited to that
        precisely as shown in the drawings or as described in the
        foregoing detailed description. </p>
      <p>In the following appendix, certain fundamental mathematical and
        related background information and analysis will be set forth,
        which is useful in understanding the present invention. </p>
      <p><b>APPENDIX</b> </p>
      <p><b>SEPARATING CO AND O, FOR SEPARATE DELIVERY AS CO AND O,
          MOLECULES, ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS</b> </p>
      <p>The two gases CO, and O, are gases with differential masses,
        which means that CO gas can be selectively separated from O gas
        at temperatures that make it impractical by known methods that
        are used commercially to separate these and other gases. </p>
      <p>Separation can be achieved by inducing stratified, or laminar
        flow in a moving stream constrained in curved tubes, because of
        their .DELTA.M, or differential masses. </p>
      <p>The mass of a gram-mole of oxygen atoms is precisely 15.9994
        (g), consequently the mass for one oxygen atom is
        2.656383862.times.10.sup.-23 (g). </p>
      <p>The mass of a gram-mole of CO molecules is 28.01055 (g),
        consequently the mass for one CO molecule is
        4.650597709.times.10.sup.-23 (g). </p>
      <p>A. Assume we are moving 1.0 cubic foot of CO+O gas through a
        two inch (outside diameter) tube, that has been coiled in a
        continuous circular form with on inch free-space separating the
        coils from each other-on a 24 inch (outer radius), with a helix
        spiral configuration. </p>
      <p>B. A second independent tube fits inside the above helix coil,
        an exact duplicate with an outer diameter of 42 inches. </p>
      <p>C. A third independent tube fits inside the second helical
        coil, an exact duplicate of the second but with an
        outer-diameter of 36 inches. </p>
      <p>D. A fourth independent tube fits inside the third helical
        coil, an exact duplicate of the third but with an outer diameter
        of 30 inches. </p>
      <p>E. A fifth independent tube fits inside the fourth helical
        coil, an exact duplicate of the fourth but with an outer
        diameter of 24 inches. </p>
      <p>F. The tubes are connected on a horiziontal plane so that
        entering gas mixtures are directed first into the No. 1 (inside)
        tube at the top level. The gases travel around the helical
        pattern (at a pre-determined velocity due to an applied force in
        the form of pressure), to reach the bottom of the tube No. 1.
        The gases travel (at the bottom of tube No. 1), through a
        connecting tube to the bottom of tube No. 2, to enter that tube
        and spiral helically around tube No. 2 till they reach the top.
        At this point a connecting tube transfers the moving gas-stream
        to the top of tube No. 3 where it spirals around and down to the
        bottom of tube 3, to enter the bottom of tube 4, where it
        spirals upward to reach the top of tube 4, transfers to the top
        of tube 5, flows spirally downward to the bottom of tube 5 . . .
        then out through the exit tube. </p>

      <p>The total length of the tube is 15,833.62 inches (1,319.47
        ft.), or 402.17 meters. </p>
      <p>Assume the SS walls have a thickess of 0.200, then the inner
        diameter (ID) equals 1.6 inches, and the radius equals
        1.6/2=0.80 (in.), 0.80.sup.2 =0.64 </p>
      <p>Then, the area of a circle equals </p>
      <p>Assuming the tube is filled with the mixed gases CO+O. The mass
        of CO equals 33.48 grams per cubic foot, and the mass of O
        equals 19.13 grams per cubic ft., therefore the combination
        equals 52.61 grams per cubic foot. </p>
      <p>at one atmosphere pressure (14.7 Psi) </p>
      <p>Assume we are operating at 5.0 atmos. (or 73.5 psig), then we
        would have a mass of 5.0.times.969.2474 grams of the mixed gases
        within the tube, for a total mass of 4,846.24 (grams), or 10.684
        pounds. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE</b> </p>
      <p>Recall that in the c.g.s. system of units the unit of force is
        called a dyne. A dyne (as stated earlier), is that force which
        will produce an acceleration of 1 cm. per second per second when
        acting on a mass of 1 g. A poundal is defined as that force that
        will produce an acceleration of 1 ft. per second per second in a
        mass of 1 pound. </p>
      <p>A quick calculation evidences tht the oxygen atom O, is only
        57.1192 percent of the mass of the CO molecule. </p>
      <p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>
      <p><b>FORCES AND MOTIONS</b> </p>
      <p>A force is an action exerted by one body on another, tending to
        change the state of motion of the body acted upon. </p>
      <p>The primary effects of a force are two: A force may cause a
        change in the size, or shape, or density, of a body; or if the
        body is free to move, a force can cause a change in velocity.
        This change in velocity may be a change in the direction of the
        motion, or a change in the magnitude of the velocity, or both. </p>
      <p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>
      <p><b>NEWTON'S FIRST LAW OF MOTION</b> </p>
      <p>This law states that every body continues in a state of rest or
        uniform motion in a straight line, unless it is compelled to
        change that state by the application of some external force. </p>
      <p>For motions of rotation, the law states that every body
        continues in a state of uniform motion of rotation about a fixed
        axis unless acted upon by some impressed force applied at some
        point not on the axis of rotation. </p>
      <p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>
      <p><b>INERTIA</b> </p>
      <p>In Newton's first law of motion an important property of matter
        appears. It is known an inertia and is defined as that property
        of matter by virtue of which it tends to remain at rest or in
        uniform motion unless external forces are acting on it. ROTARY
        INERTIA depends on the distribution of the mass about the axis
        of rotation. </p>
      <p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>
      <p><b>UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION</b> </p>
      <p>If a body or mass moves in a circular path in such a way that
        it always passes over equal distance in equal intervals of time,
        it is said to have uniform circular motion. The magnitude of its
        velocity is constant, however, its direction of motion is
        constantly changing. Such a body has an acceleration, however,
        this acceleration consists in a change in the direction. </p>
      <p>In uniform circular motion the acceleration toward the
        center=.nu..sup.2 /R. </p>
      <p>Of course, a force is necessary to produce a change in the
        direction of the motion of the body, just as a force is
        necessary to produce a change in the rate of motion. </p>
      <p>Since, in a circular motion this force produces no change in
        the magnitude of the velocity but only a change in the direction
        of motion, the force must act at right angles to the direction
        of motion. Since the force is at right angles to the direction
        of motion and the motion is in a circular path, the force is
        along the radius of the circle and directed toward the center of
        the circle. </p>
      <p>A normal circle with a fixed radius determines the rate at
        which the direction of motion is changing, is constant, and the
        force that produces it must therefore be constant. </p>
      <p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>
      <p><b>ACCELERATION IN UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION</b> </p>
      <p>In uniform circular motion with a fixed radius, there is at
        every instant an acceleration, there is at every instant an
        acceleration towards the center. To calculate this acceleration,
        assume that a particle passes over the arc AB, with a constant
        speed .nu. in the time t. The space passed over in this time is
        AB=.nu.t. </p>
      <p>The direction of motion of the body has changed but it
        continues to move tangent to the circle. The angle .theta.
        between the radii OA and OB is equal to the angle between the
        velocity of the body at A and its velocity at B. </p>
      <p>To find the rate of change of the velocity, draw two vectors
        .nu..sub.o and .nu..sub.t, each of the same magnitude .nu.. </p>
      <p>These vectors differ only in direction. The velocity of the
        body at A is represented by the vector .nu..sub.o and the
        velocity at B by the vector .nu..sub.t. The angle .theta. is the
        change in the direction of motion. </p>
      <p>In order to change the velocity from .nu..sub.o to .nu..sub.t,
        an additional velocity must be added to the body. If a is the
        rate of change of the velocity, that is, the acceleration, and
        t, the time for the body to move from A to B, the change in
        velocity is at. This is the velocity which must be added to
        cause the velocity of the body to change from .nu..sub.o to
        .nu..sub.t. To find this change of velocity, draw .nu..sub.o and
        .nu..sub.t from a common point S, making an angle .theta. with
        each other. </p>
      <p>Close the triangle thus formed by drawing a third vector which
        is equal to the change of velocity in the time t. When the angle
        .theta. is small, the chord AB, is nearly equal to the Arc AB,
        and the two triangles AOB and MSN are similar. ##EQU2## This
        acceleration is directed toward the center of the circle. </p>
      <p>If .omega. is the angular velocity of the radius, ##EQU3## </p>
      <p>This expression may be written in another form. If N denotes
        the number of revolutions per second, ##EQU4## </p>
      <p>From this last expression it becomes evident that the
        acceleration increases when the radius of the path is increased,
        and it also increases when the number of revolutions is
        increased. </p>
      <p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>
      <p><b>CENTRIPETAL FORCE</b> </p>
      <p>Newton's second law of motion states that whenever an
        acceleration is produced, a force must be applied. </p>
      <p>It has been seen that a body moving in a circular path with
        uniform velocity has an acceleration toward the center of the
        circle. To produce this acceleration and to keep the body from
        flying off tangent to the circle, a force must be applied at
        right angles to the direction of motion. </p>
      <p>This force which is directed toward the center of the circle is
        called the CENTRIPETAL force. </p>
      <p>To find its magnitude, recall the Newtons second law of motion
        is </p>
      <p>Now the acceleration in the case of uniform circular motion is
        ##EQU5## This force is necessary to keep the body moving in a
        circular path. </p>
      <p>The reaction this moving body produces due to the constraint is
        called the CENTRIPETAL FORCE. </p>
      <p>The centrifugal force is equal in magnitude but opposite in
        direction to the centripetal force. </p>
      <p>A centripetal force is induced by directing a body of mixed
        gases of .DELTA., differential masses, into and through a series
        of circular tubes of design diameter, volume, and radius. The
        tubes constrain the moving body of gas induce the heavier
        molecules into a laminar or stratified flow just within the
        outer radius of the tubes (on the inside of the tubes). </p>
      <p>This outer wall of the tube provides the centripetal force by
        constantly directing the gas flow inwardly around the circle as
        the heavier molecules of CO gas accumulate in a dense strata and
        displace the light oxygen atoms inwardly away from the CO
        strata, assisted by an induced negative pressure controlled
        precisely to remove the lighter oxygen atoms continuously from
        the circular orbiting, with the oxygen atoms exiting through
        escape holes in the inner wall of the tubes--for that purpose
        only, and designed in size and shape to function as stated. </p>
      <p>In this unit, under the forces and constraints as described,
        the difference in the masses (.DELTA.M) of the moving gases
        under pressure at a good velocity (and their tendencies to move
        at high speed in a straight line within the tube), makes it
        possible to separate the gases as they travel quickly about an
        axis. </p>
      <p>The heavier gas (CO.sub.(g)) at 28.01055 grams per gram-mole,
        is literally thrown outward to the furthest distance possible
        within the tube itself--and the lighter gas (O.sub.(g)) atoms
        are moved away and out of the negative pressure exhaust
        port--then delivered separately as a second product O.sub.2, as
        they recombine into oxygen molecules as they cool down to a
        lower temperature. </p>
      <p>Induced (real) laminar flows occur due to stratification of
        .DELTA.M, differential masses of `many` gases--allowing a good
        separation of those gases even at very high working
        temperatures. </p>
      <p>The carefully controlled negative pressure removes the lighter
        gas or gases from the circular tube system as the gases move at
        good velocities through the circular tubes and stratify. </p>
      <p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>
      <p><b>ABSOLUTE UNITS OF FORCE</b> </p>
      <p>Newton's second law of motion gives a satisfactory way of
        defining an absolute unit of force. </p>
      <p>By suitably choosing the unit of mass, the unit of force, and
        the unit of acceleration, the factor of proportionality becomes
        equal to unity and Newton's second law of motion takes the form
      </p>
      <p>This equation implicitly defines the absolute unit force as the
        force which will produce unit acceleration when acting on unit
        mass. In the c.g.s. system of units, this unit of force is
        termed a dyne. A dyne is `defined` as that force which will
        produce an acceleration of 1 cm. per second per second when
        acting on a mass of 1 gram. A poundal is defined to be that
        force that will produce an acceleration of 1 ft. per second per
        second in a mass of one pound. </p>
      <p><b>FORCE (DEFINITION)</b> </p>
      <p>That which changes the state of rest or motion in matter,
        measured by the rate of change of momentum. </p>
      <p>ABSOLUTE UNIT, the dyne, is that force which will produce an
        acceleration of one centimeter per second per second in a gram
        mass. The gram weight, or weight of a gram mass, is the cgs
        gravitational unit. </p>
      <p>The force F required to produce an acceleration a in a mass m
        is given by </p>
      <p>when m is substituted in grams and a in cm per sec.sup.2, F
        will be given in dynes. </p>
      <p><b>NOTE</b> </p>
      <p>To convert dynes into joules/cm, multiply by the constant
        10.sup.-7 </p>
      <p>(A)CONSIDER TUBE NO. 1, LENGTH 5362.3 cm, RADIUS 30.48 (cm.),
        CONVEYING CO (g) </p>
      <p>Assume a mass of 33.48 grams of CO gas (1.0 cf), has an
        acceleration of 17,556.48 cm. per second, from an orifice of
        0.6350 cm. dia. directly into tube No. 1, whose I.D.=1.6 in.

      <p>(1) When a mass moves in a uniform circular motion with linear
        speed 300 cm/sec (.nu.), it is accelerated toward the center of
        the circle with an acceleration, a, given by ##EQU7## </p>
      <p>(2) Knowing the magnitude and the direction of the acceleration
        of a mass in uniform circular motion, it is convenient to
        compute the force which acts on the mass. If the mass is m, we
        find with application of Newtons second law ##EQU8## where the
        mass is 33.48 (g) velocity=3252.7559 (cm/sec).sup.2 </p>

        circular motion for the length of the tube--likewise, this
        represents the centrifugal force which is equal but opposite in
        direction. </p>

      <p>Assume a mass of 19.13 grams of oxygen atoms has an
        acceleration of 17,556.48 cm. per second, from the same orifice
        of 0.6350 cm. diameter. ##EQU12## then: </p>

      <p>(3) The total force required to keep this mass of 0 atoms
        moving in a uniform circular motion at 3252.7559 cm/sec within

      <p>(b) Tube No. 1 is 5362.32 (cm.) long ##EQU17## </p>
      <p>(C) COMPARING .DELTA. FORCE REQUIRED FOR .DELTA.M </p>
      <p>Notice that moving the CO (gas) mass of 33.48 (g) (1 cu ft),
        required 6,542 joules, and moving the 0 (gas) atoms mass of
        19.13 (g) (1 cu ft), required 3,740.96 joules. </p>
      <p>(1) The oxygen atoms actually required about 43 percent as much
        energy as the CO molecules, "to maintain the same uniform
        circular motion for the same distance traveled." </p>
      <p>(2) Since the exact amount of force (energy) was delivered to
        both examples, the oxygen, O, atoms would have traveled
        considerably faster through the tube than the CO molecules.
        Actually the O atoms would have separated from the CO molecules
        and have responded to an induced laminar flow stream traveling
        43 percent (approximately) faster than the heavier CO flowing
        laminar stream of its own. </p>
      <p>(3) The .DELTA.M affects the molecules and atoms in another
        very important way. All movement of mass "preferentially" goes
        in a straight line with uniform speed, while the tube within
        which the mass is moving turns in a continuous uniform circle.
        The trajectories of the moving gas and the curbing tube wall
        intersect continuously, therefore the heavier CO gas, .DELTA.M,
        is continuously impacting and moving along the tube wall in an
        ever increasing density of CO molecules as that laminar (layer)
        moves through the length of the tube. </p>
      <p>The lighter oxygen, O, atoms are not affected to the same
        degree by the continuously curving and constraining wall of the
        tube, because the O atoms are lighter, they rise above the CO
        flow and at this point the removal of oxygen atoms begins. </p>
      <p>(4) Since the circular tubes are all horizontal and the
        continuous curving coils bring the CO molecules to the inside of
        the outer wall where their packed density slides along as a (for
        practical purposes) separate flow-stream. </p>
      <p>The lighter (47 percent) oxygen atoms ride in their separate
        flow stream on the inner side of the tube. </p>
