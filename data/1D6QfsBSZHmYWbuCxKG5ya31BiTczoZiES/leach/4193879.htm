      <p>In addition to the apparatus disclosed in the prior patent
        applications of which this application is a
        continuation-in-part, a reaction chamber is provided with
        mercury vapor quartz discharge lamps. In close proximity to the
        lamps are spheres, or thin continuous wires, or filaments or
        other physical configurations of laser-type material which
        produce relatively coherentradiation in a manner similar to
        lasers. The spheres or filaments include concentric partially
        reflective surfaces, and include an active material which is
        pumped by the efficient spectral radiation of the mercury vapor,
        and radiates at a frequency or frequencies matched to the
        absorption characteristics of the feedstock being fed through
        the reaction chamber. The laser-type material may be operated to
        produce output radiation at a harmonic, such as the second,
        third, fourth or higher harmonic of the basic laser radiation,
        and these harmonic output radiations may be enhanced by using
        semi-reflective coatings which reflect in the order of 70% to
        90% of the radiation, particularly in the case of spheres. High
        energy content ultraviolet radiation may also be generated by
        the "beating" of radiant energy from the mercury vapor tubes and
        the laser-type material. Efficiency is enhanced by chain
        reactions which occur with the feedstock materials being fed to
        the reaction chamber, and these chain reactions involve the
        generation and regeneration of excited atoms of oxygen or other
        substances. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention related to highly efficient photochemical
        techniques. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It has been proposed heretofore to apply coherent radiation
        from conventional lasers to gases to dissociate them. However,
        such application of laser energy is highly inefficient, and is
        not economically practical for commercial processes. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, a principal object of the present invention is to
        practically and economically apply intense relatively coherent
        radiation to chemical substances to dissociate them, and
        initiate additional reactions. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a reaction
        chamber is provided with a number of gas discharge tubes, and
        closely associated material capable of being pumped to excited
        states and emitting relatively coherent radiation of high
        intensity. Feedstock is supplied to the reaction chamber and is
        exposed to the radiation, which floods the reaction chamber.
        Further, the feedstock has absorption bands at certain
        frequencies, and the gas discharge and the associated laser-type
        material are chosen to provide intense output radiation at one
        or more of the absorption bands of the feedstock. </p>
      <p>Additional gases may be supplied to the reaction chamber to
        react with the products formed when the basic feedstock is
        dissociated. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one particular aspect of the invention the
        laser-type material may be in the form of filaments, wires or
        spheres, and may also be provided with one or more
        semi-transparent concentric reflecting surfaces accurately
        spaced to reinforce the coherent output radiation. </p>
      <p>One particularly advantageous form of the invention involves
        the use of a large number of spheres of laser-type material
        secured to the outer surface of the gas discharge tubes. The
        spheres are provided with a semi-reflecting outer metallic
        coating, but this is not present on that portion of the spheres
        adjacent the gas discharge tubes to permit easy entry of the
        pumping radiation from the gas discharge tube. When it is
        desired to provide increased high frequency output radiation, by
        the generation of harmonics of the basic output radiation
        frequency of the laser type material, the reflective coating
        should be in the order of 70% to 90% reflecting. </p>
      <p>In accordance with a subordinate feature of the invention,
        instead of normal reflecting materials such as chromium or
        nickel, for example, metallic coatings may be employed which are
        reflective to visible and infrared frequencies but are
        relatively transparent to shorter wavelength ultraviolet
        radiation. </p>
      <p>The use of mercury vapor gas in discharge tubes having quartz
        envelopes is preferred, in view of the many spectral lines of
        mercury vapor which are useful for pumping the laser-type
        material. Ruby laser material, aluminum oxide doped with
        chromium, may suitably be employed as the laser-type material;
        but other laser-type materials having different output radiation
        frequencies should be used as required to match the absorption
        bands of the feedstocks supplied to the reaction chamber. </p>
      <p>Another feature of the invention involves the beating together
        of radiation at different frequencies in the presence of media
        discontinuities in the form of the feedstock to be irradiated,
        and the resultant generation of sum and difference frequencies
        appropriate to couple strongly with absorption bands of the
        feedstock material. This technique is particularly advantageous
        when the feedstock has absorption bands in the ultraviolet
        frequency spectrum. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another specific aspect of the invention,
        the feedstock may be water vapor and air may also be supplied to
        the reaction chamber. When high intensity radiation within the
        ultraviolet or other absorption band of water vapor is radiated
        throughout the reaction chamber, the water vapor is split into
        hydrogen and activated oxygen atoms. These activated oxygen
        atoms combine with additional water vapor to form hydrogen
        and/or hydrogen peroxide, in additional reactions forming part
        of a chain reaction initiated by the basic irradiation. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another important feature of the invention,
        at least two feedstocks are supplied to a reaction chamber, and
        the reaction chamber is flooded with radiation within at least
        one of the absorption bands of one of said feedstocks at an
        intensity level sufficient to dissociate the feedstock and the
        dissociation products are maintained in said reaction chamber at
        concentrations sufficient to create a chain reaction with the
        incoming feedstocks. </p>
      <p>Another feature of the invention involves applying radiation of
        different frequencies to the input section as compared with the
        output section of the reaction chamber, to facilitate relatively
        complete irradiation and dissociation of the incoming feedstock
        and avoiding dissociation of the desired product gases. For
        example, in the case of water vapor as one of the feedstocks and
        hydrogen peroxide as one of the product gases, both water vapor
        and hydrogen peroxide have high absorption bands in the
        ultraviolet frequency spectrum; and water vapor, but not
        hydrogen peroxide, has absorption bands in the infrared
        frequency range. Accordingly, the more powerful U-V radiations
        may be employed in the input section of the reaction chamber, to
        dissociate water vapor; but in the output section where a
        substantial proportion of hydrogen peroxide will be present,
        infrared radiation may be employed to selectively dissociate the
        water vapor without dissociating the hydrogen peroxide. Similar
        considerations are of course applicable to other feedstock and
        product gases, taking into consideration their absorption
        characteristics, and relative responsiveness to radiation of
        different frequencies. </p>
      <p>A feature of the invention involves the introduction of
        additional air into the reaction chambers to combine with the
        hydrogen which is dissociated from water vapor to produce
        hydrogen peroxide, with the collateral advantage of supplying
        heat to the reaction chamber from this exothermic reaction. </p>
      <p>Other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will
        become apparent from a consideration of the following detailed
        description, and from the accompanying drawings. </p>

      <p>Initially, before considering the drawings in detail, it may be
        noted that FIG. 1 through 23 were included in the prior
        co-pending patent applications, Ser. Nos. 790,320, and 834,682,
        of which this specification is a Continuation-in-Part. FIGS. 24
        through 32 are newly added in the present specification and
        represent the preferred embodiments of the invention. The
        following description of FIGS. 1 through 23 will closely
        parallel that set forth in the prior patent application, Ser.
        No. 834,682 cited hereinabove. </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>Turning now to FIG. 1, the system of the present invention is
        generally designated by the numeral 10 and it comprises reaction
        chambers 12, 14, 16 and 18, heating means generally designated
        20, and a hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide reservoir or
        accumulator 22. Water enters the system at conduit 24, passes
        through flow control valve 26 and conduit 28 to manifold 30.
        Water may then be supplied to heat exchange coil 32 through
        valve 34 and conduit 36, to heat exchange coil 38 through valve
        40 and conduit 42, to heat exchange coil 44 through valve 46 and
        conduit 48, and to heat exchange coil 50 through valve 52 and
        conduit 54. It will be seen that conduit 36 is the inlet end of
        heat exchange coil 32, the outlet of heat exchange coil 32 being
        conduit 56 which is connected to one end of reaction chamber 12.
        Similarly, the outlet end of heat exchange coil 38 is conduit 58
        connected to one end of reaction chamber 14, the outlet end of
        heat exchange coil 44 is connected to one end of reaction
        chamber 16 through conduit 60, and the outlet end of heat
        exchange coil 50 is connected to one end of reaction chamber 18
        through conduit 62. </p>
      <p>Vacuum is applied to the system, for purposes which will become
        apparent as the description proceeds, through conduit 64, flow
        control valve 66, and conduit 68 which is connected to one end
        of a conventional gas burner 70. It will be appreciated that
        heating means 20 comprises burner 70 and heat exchange coils 32,
        38, 44, and 50, and their respective conduits and valves. </p>
      <p>As will also become apparent as the description proceeds,
        hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide generated in the reaction
        chambers 12, 14, 16, and 18 passes through conduits 72, 74, 76
        and 78, respectively and valves 80, 82, 84 and 86, respectively,
        to manifold 88. The hydrogen and/or hydrogen peroxide then
        passes through conduit 90 with check valve 92 to hydrogen
        accumulator 22 where it is then drawn off for use through
        conduit 94, flow control valve 96, and conduit 98. Conduit 100,
        flow control valve 102 and conduit 104 are provided to allow
        atmospheric air to enter the system when and if needed, as will
        be described more fully hereinbelow. </p>
      <p>Before proceeding further with a description of the system, it
        should be distinctly understood that while the example given
        herein for purely illustrative purposes includes four reaction
        chambers, there is, in fact, no limit other than practical
        considerations of size and weight as to the number of reaction
        chambers used. In fact, the invention could be practiced with as
        few as one reaction chamber and as many reaction chambers as
        desired, there being no reason why a bank of dozens or even a
        hundred reaction chambers could not be used. For this reason,
        applicant is not limiting himself to the use of four reaction
        chambers except for illustrative purposes. Obviously, one
        skilled in the art would easily be able to include the necessary
        valve elements and other hardware if he were adding more
        reaction chambers. </p>
      <p>With the foregoing understood, the description of the instant
        inventive system will proceed. The system runs at about
        900.degree. K. or 1000.degree. K. and may be pre-heated by any
        well-known electrical heating means such as that described in
        the parent application. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, pre-heating can be accomplished by burning
        hydrogen in burner 70, the hydrogen being the "tailings" left in
        one or more of the reaction chambers from a previous run of the
        system. For this pre-heating cycle, flow control valve 26 is
        opened to allow water to enter the system filling manifold 30.
        Valves 34, 40, 46 and 52 remain closed during this cycle. Valves
        106, 108, 110 and 112 are opened. Vacuum is applied at conduit
        64 with valve 66 opened. Thus, it will be seen that vacuum is
        applied via conduit 68 to burner 70. Since the other end of
        burner 70 is connected to conduit 114 which, in turn, is
        connected to manifold 116, manifold 116 is under vacuum. Then,
        since valves 106, 108, 110, and 112 are open, the vacuum is
        applied to reaction chambers 12, 14, 16 and 18, respectively,
        through conduits 118, 120, 122 and 124, respectively. Thus, any
        residual hydrogen tailings remaining in any of the reaction
        chambers is drawn into the inlet end of burner 70 to be burned
        along with any residual oxygen tailings or with atmospheric air
        drawn in through conduit 100 and valve 102 by the vacuum which
        also affects this air line. It should also be noted that in
        event of a "cold" start where there are no hydrogen tailings to
        be burned, a combustible gas, such as hydrogen, could be drawn
        in through conduit 100 and valve 102 to provide the initial
        start-up heat. The burning of hydrogen in burner 70 provides
        considerable heat which, by radiation and conduction is passed
        to the reaction chambers which are filled with reactant 126.
        When the system is pre-heated to a sufficiently high
        temperature, we are ready to proceed with the generation of
        hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide. </p>
      <p>Valve 34 is opened to allow a predetermined amount of water to
        enter heat exchange coil 32 which is, in essence, a steam
        generator. The water is "flashed" to steam and delivered through
        conduit 56 to the inlet end of reaction chamber 12. The steam
        enters reaction chamber 12 containing reactant 126 to fill the
        total void volume and is constrained in this volume because all
        outlet valves are closed. The residence time, or reaction time,
        may be controlled from a few seconds (typically about 2 to about
        3 seconds) to a rather long time (typically about 60 seconds),
        depending on the reactant used, the particulate size, the
        temperature, and the pressure. Valves 108, 110, and 112 are
        fully opened to allow the vacuum evacuation of all residual
        gases in the other reaction chambers and their respective heat
        exchangers and piping. It should be noted that since a
        predetermined amount of water was to be passed to heat exchange
        coil 32, valve 34 was opened for just a brief period and then
        closed. </p>
      <p>Steam having entered and permeated reactant 126 in reaction
        chamber 12, valve 40 is then opened briefly to allow a metered
        amount of water into heat exchange coil 38, with the steam
        generated therein then passing through conduit 58 to reaction
        chamber 14. Valve 40 is then closed. The steam which passes into
        reaction chamber 14, as with the steam wich had passed into
        reaction chamber 12, is converted into hydrogen and/or hydrogen
        peroxide and then held restrained in the reaction chamber for
        the predetermined control time. In the meantime, valve 80 is
        opened so that the pressure built up in reaction chamber 12 will
        force the hydrogen to exit through conduit 72 and valve 80 into
        manifold 88 and then through check valve 92 into the hydrogen
        accumulator 22. Valve 80 is then closed and valve 106 is opened
        to allow the vacuum to empty the residual hydrogen and oxygen
        tailings from reaction chamber 12 and pass it to burner 70 where
        the mixture is burned using disproportionated oxygen from
        reaction chambers 12, 16, and 18 along with additional
        atmospheric oxygen supplied through conduit 100, if necessary.
        It should be noted that when valve 80 was opened to pass the
        hydrogen and/or hydrogen peroxide out of chamber 12, and then
        vacuum was applied by opening valve 106, the oxidized reactant
        in chamber 12 disproportionated to release the bound oxygen
        since the temperature in the reaction chamber remained high and
        the presure was lowered. </p>
      <p>With valve 106 still open, valve 82 is also opened to allow the
        hydrogen and/or hydrogen peroxide generated in reaction chamber
        14 to flow into the manifold 88 from which it is directed into
        the hydrogen reservoir 22. In the meantime, valve 46 had briefly
        opened to allow a metered amount of water into heat exchange
        coil 44 and then the steam formed in heat exchange coil 44
        passes to the inlet end of reaction chamber 16. At this point,
        valve 84 is still closed. Valves 106 and 112 are still open to
        allow vacuum to exhaust chambers 12 and 18. </p>
      <p>Valve 82 then closes and valve 108 opens along with valves 106
        and 112 which are also open. Thus, hydrogen and/or hydrogen
        peroxide and oxygen tailings are being conveyed through valve
        108 to burner 70 for combustion with the combustion gases being
        exhausted through conduit 68. </p>
      <p>Then, valve 84 is opened to pass the hydrogen and/or hydrogen
        peroxide from reaction chamber 16 to manifold 88. Valves 106 and
        108 are opened to allow vacuum to exhaust the respective
        chambers 12 and 14 while valve 52 has been allowed to briefly
        open to pass a metered amount of water to heat exchange coil 50
        with the steam being formed then passing to reaction chamber 18.
        The steam in reaction chamber 18 reacts with reactant 126 to
        form hydrogen and/or hydrogen peroxide which is restrained since
        valve 86 is still closed. Valves 106, 108 and 110 are all open
        so that the other reaction chambers are being exhausted. </p>
      <p>Valve 88 is then opened to relieve the pressure on reaction
        chamber 18 and allow the hydrogen and/or hydrogen peroxide to
        pass to manifold 88. At this point, the whole cycle starts again
        and valve 14 is briefly opened to allow a metered amount of
        water to pass to heat exchange coil 32, valve 86 is closed, and
        valve 112 is opened. The whole cycle then repeats. </p>
      <p>While the system of the invention is shown schematically, it
        wll be readily understood by one skilled in the art that it can
        be easily constructed. The valves are all of a mechanical type
        which are cam operated so that a precise timed sequence of
        events can be carried out in a predetermined manner, the timing
        of the opening and closing of the valves being controlled by the
        size, shape, configuration and speed at which the cams are
        moving. </p>
      <p>The following "steps" are identifiable in the total reaction
        cycle involving gases and solids: </p>
      <p>(1) Supply of the water vapor (steam) in the direction of flow.
      </p>
      <p>(2) Diffusion of this steam into contact with the particulates
        of manganese oxides or to the reacting interface which may be on
        the surface, or inside the particulate, depending on the
        oxidation level of that particular particulate in the gradient
        (overall). </p>
      <p>(3) Interface reaction (intrinsic rate), including sequestering
        of oxygen and the release of the gaseous product H.sub.2. </p>
      <p>(4) Diffusion of product from the interface. </p>
      <p>(5) Removal of product, H.sub.2, in the direction of flow. </p>
      <p>(6) Concurrently with Steps 2-5, the water vapor is also being
        directly dissociated by photon action, producing both H.sub.2
        and H.sub.2 O.sub.2, as described in detail below. </p>
      <p>(7) Diffusion of combined oxygen from the interior of the
        reactant to the interface, and then away from the reactant in
        the direction of flow of the H.sub.2 and O.sub.2 residual
        tailings. </p>
      <p>(8) Combustion of the H.sub.2 and O.sub.2 tailings in the
        centrally located burner. </p>
      <p>(9) Removal of products of combustion from the burner in its
        separate direction of flow. </p>
      <p>The instant process is a process in which a relatively small
        amount of heat-energy input, (in the form of pre-heat for the
        reactant) provides conditions for the reactant to effect changes
        of state, during which a gaseous chemical molecule is completely
        dissociated into its separate gaseous atoms by two distinct
        phenomena. In the course of one of these phenomena, the solid
        reactant concurrently effects a "change of state" by means of an
        exothermic transformation from one oxidation product level to
        another oxidation product level; and in the course of the second
        phenomena, to be described in detail below, the H.sub.2 O
        molecules are directly dissociated by photon energy, forming
        H.sub.2 and also H.sub.2 O.sub.2, hydrogen peroxide. </p>
      <p>It should also be noted that pressure changes play an important
        part in the system. Specifically, the reactant is heated to a
        temperature well above the dissociation temperature for oxygen
        from the metallic oxide of higher oxidation number at room
        temperature. This temperature for MnO.sub.2 is given in
        handbooks as 535.degree. C., and at atmospheric pressure this
        MnO.sub.2 will dissociate to Mn.sub.2 O.sub.3 at temperatures
        above 535.degree. C. Accordingly, it is desired to operate at
        temperatures well above 535.degree. C. such as 600.degree. C. to
        950.degree. C. In addition, during the hydrogen formation
        portion of the cycle, the pressure must be well above
        atmospheric so that the oxygen will be absorbed by the Mn.sub.2
        O.sub.3 (the oxide of lower oxidation number), with a pressure
        of about at least 75 psi or 100 being preferred, and preferably
        between 100 psi and 150 psi to as high as 200 psi or more. In
        addition, during the oxygen disproportionation phase, the free
        oxygen and other gases are removed from the vicinity of the
        reactant, preferably by a reduction in pressure to less than
        atmospheric, with about one-tenth atmosphere being successfully
        employed. As can be appreciated, by using temperatures and
        pressures well above and below critical levels during the two
        phases of the cycle, increased speeds of operation may be
        obtained. </p>
      <p>Reference is now made to FIGS. 2 and 3 wherein the heating
        means 20 is shown in more detail. Heating means 20, as already
        discussed, comprises burner 70 and heat exchange coils 32, 38,
        44, and 50. Burner 70 comprises casing 128 made of any suitable
        metallic material lined with a porous fire brick insulation 130
        which is carved or otherwise formed to fit casing 128 and has an
        axial hollow core running longitudinally through most of its
        length. The hollow core is, in turn, filled with a suitable
        surface catalyst 132 for "burning" hydrogen and oxygen to form
        steam. Through the center of heating means 30 is a conventional
        electrical resistance heating element 140 which is used, when
        necessary, for pre-heating the system for a cold start. At the
        lower end of heating means 20 as in the drawings, are
        atmospheric air inlet 104 and residual tailings inlet 114. At
        the upper end is exhaust line 68. </p>
      <p>The next sub-system under consideration is the reaction
        chambers 12, 14, 16 and 18. For an understanding of the
        construction of the reaction chambers, attention is directed to
        FIG. 4 where a single reaction chamber designated generally as
        142 is shown. Reaction chamber 142 comprises an outer casing 144
        made of any suitable material such as 3/8" thick stainless steel
        or as discussed in the aforementioned co-pending application. It
        is filled with reactant 126 as discussed above and as shown and
        described below in connection with FIGS. 8, 11 and 12. Passing
        axially through the reactant is a conventional electrical
        resistance heating element 146, this heater being essentially
        the same as heater 140 in FIG. 22. This may be used for pre-heat
        in a cold start. As already discussed, however, the exact means
        used for pre-heating the system is not critical to the invention
        and any means well-known in the art for accomplishing this end
        may be used. The reactant 126, including sensitizer and host
        materials, is placed in casing 144 leaving a space at each end,
        these spaces being designated in FIG. 23 as 148 and 150. Spaces
        148 and 150 essentially serve the function of surge tanks,
        manifolds, or the like. Steam inlet 152 and vacuum inlet 154 are
        provided at one end of reaction chamber 142 and hydrogen outlet
        156 is provided at the other end. Steam inlet 152 corresponds to
        conduit 56, for instance, vacuum outlet 154 corresponds to
        conduit 118, for instance, and hydrogen outlet 156 corresponds
        to conduit 72, for instance, in FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>Turning now to FIG. 5, the preferred configuration of the
        apparatus is shown along with the sub-system which includes the
        valves and driving mechanism for the same as well as the
        "plumbing". It will be seen that the valves which are described
        above are arrayed in a single line. The valves are of a
        conventional type which are operated by pushing or releasing a
        plunger designated, for convenience of illustration, as 158 in
        conjunction with valve 34. It will be appreciated that while the
        description of the valves refers to valve 34 and plunger 158 for
        exemplary purposes, each of the valves operates in the same
        manner. A variable speed motor 160 turns a drive shaft 162 which
        is journaled in mounting plates 164 and 166. Fixedly mounted on
        drive shaft 162 are cams 168, with one cam corresponding to each
        of the valves and mounted on drive shaft 162 in such a way as to
        cooperate with plunger 158 of each valve. Thus, as motor 160
        turns drive shaft 162 and, in turn, cams 168, the valves are
        opened and closed in a manner which is predetermined by the
        positioning of cams 168. This, of course, will be readily
        understood by one skilled in the art. </p>
      <p>Referring further to FIG. 5, it will be seen that the reaction
        chambers are set vertically in an enclosure that is square in
        cross-section and are shown in the drawing with reaction chamber
        12 in the front left-hand corner, reaction chamber 14 in the
        rear left-hand corner, reaction chamber 16 in the front
        right-hand corner, and reaction chamber 18 in the rear
        right-hand corner. Heating means 20 is disposed in the center.
        The enclosure or, more specifically, inner enclosure 170 is
        preferably made of magnesium oxide packed in a stainless steel
        container. This material was chosen because it distributes heat
        evenly throughout the volume of the enclosure 170. Surrounding
        inner enclosure 170 is outer enclosure 172 which is made of any
        suitable material such as stainless steel and filled with a high
        quality insulation such as alumina fibers. It will be
        appreciated by one skilled in the art that any high quality,
        high temperature, insulating material may be used. </p>
      <p>Returning to a consideration of the drawings, FIG. 6 is a block
        schematic drawing showing in a central position the reaction
        chamber or chambers 202 and an immediately associated steam
        generator 204. A reservoir of water 206 supplies water to the
        steam generator 204, which may be of any of the types described
        in connection with earlier figures of the drawings. In this
        connection, it may be noted that all of the arrangements shown
        in FIG. 6 are applicable to the hydrogen generation apparatus
        shown hereinabove in the present specification. </p>
      <p>Steam or water vapor is supplied to the reaction chamber or
        chambers 202 through line 208 which may of course be internally
        connected between the immediately adjacent and thermally
        connected units 202 and 204. Hydrogen from reaction chamber or
        chambers 202 may be routed through output line 210 to the
        venturi tube combining unit 212 which is also in intimate
        heat-conducting relationship with reaction chamber 202 and the
        stream generator 204. As mentioned above, in connection with
        manganese oxide the temprature of the entire assembly, including
        the venturi unit 212, may be in the order of 600.degree. to
        950.degree. C. </p>
      <p>Hydrogen peroxide may be formed in either of two ways, and the
        proportion of hydrogen peroxide to hydrogen gas may be
        controlled by valves 213 and 215. Initially, considering the
        formation of H.sub.2 O.sub.2 within the reactor chambers, by
        photon action, valving 215 would be opened while steam is
        present in the reaction chambers and while the H.sub.2 gas is
        being drawn off, and oxygen at high pressure, corresponding to
        the pressure of the reaction chamber is admitted to chambers 202
        via conduit 217 from pump 219. </p>
      <p>Now considering the subsequent formation of H.sub.2 O.sub.2,
        valve 215 would be permanently closed, and valve 213 would be
        open. When hydrogen starts to flow rapidly through the Venturi
        unit 212 the check valve 214 will open and oxygen will be
        combined with hydrogen to form hydrogen peroxide. The Venturi
        unit 212 is in intimate heat conducting relationship with
        reaction chamber 202 and during the preheat period, absorbs heat
        from the reaction chamber. Later, during operation, the
        combination of hydrogen with oxygen is an exothermic reaction as
        set forth quantitatively in equation form hereinbelow, and
        supplies heat to the system. The hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide
        is stored in reservoir 216, which is maintained at a relatively
        high pressure level by the check valve 218 which prevents loss
        of hydrogen back toward the reaction chamber 202 between the
        intermitent withdrawing of hydrogen from the reaction chamber
        202. Hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide may be withdrawn as needed
        from the reservoir 216 through an output line 220. By closing
        both valve 213 and valving 215, the amount of hydrogen peroxide
        which is generated is severely limited, and the bulk of the
        output will be hydrogen, rather than H.sub.2 O.sub.2. </p>
      <p>Vacuum pump 221 may be employed to speed up separation of
        oxygen, hydrogen tailings, and other residual gases from the
        reactant during dissociation or disproportionation. </p>
      <p>With regard to the block diagram of FIG. 6, it is to be
        understood that the components shown in this figure may be
        employed in connection with any system described hereinabove in
        the present specification. Specifically, the various input and
        output control valves have been, for the most part, omitted from
        FIG. 6 for purposes of simplicity. Similarly, the precise
        physical arrangement, with the units 202, 204 and 212, for
        example, being in intimate heat-conducting relationship with
        each other, and insulated from the atmosphere, is not shown in
        FIG. 6, but may be in accordance with disclosures of other units
        disclosed in the present specification. </p>
      <p>FIG. 7 shows a typical pressure versus time cycle for a system
        in accordance with the present invention using manganese oxide
        as the reactant, and four reaction chambers. This is, for
        example, of the type described hereinabove in connection with
        FIGS. 1 through 5 of the drawings. </p>
      <p>The pressure is "gauge" pressure in pounds per square inch
        (psi). With this pressure scale, atmospheric pressure is of
        course indicated by zero. </p>
      <p>Considering the cycles shown in FIG. 7 from an overall
        standpoint, the complete cycle for each reaction chamber
        including both breaking up the water vapor and dissociating the
        oxygen from the reactant may be 40 seconds. However, the cycles
        of the reaction chambers are evenly staggered in operation, by
        10 seconds in the example so that hydrogen is generated on a
        substantially continuous basis. In FIG. 7 the pressure cycle for
        reaction chamber No. 1 is shown in the lower characteristic, and
        the pressure cycle for reaction chamber No. 2 is shown in the
        upper characteristic. The pressure versus time characteristics
        for reaction chambers Nos. 3 and 4 are substantially the same as
        those of chambers No. 1 and 2, but are displaced by additional
        10 second intervals. </p>
      <p>Now, referring specifically to the lower characteristic 230 in
        FIG. 7, the cycle starts with the opening of the water inlet
        valve for a couple of seconds at the beginning of the cycle.
        Steam is promptly generated and fills the first reaction
        chamber. At about 6 seconds, the hydrogen outlet output valve is
        opened as indicated by arrow 232. Hydrogen and/or H.sub.2
        O.sub.2 continues to flow until about 16 or 17 seconds of the
        cycle, when the hydrogen pressure drops to the hydrogen
        reservoir pressure, indicated as equal to 80 pounds by the dash
        dot line 234 in FIG. 7. The closure of the hydrogen reservoir
        check valve 218, as shown in FIG. 6, is indicated by the arrow
        236 in FIG. 7. Soon after the closure of check valve 236 the
        pressure release and vacuum pump valve is opened, as indicated
        by arrow 238 and the pressure drops along characteristic 240 to
        the negative pressure of about one-tenth of an atmosphere
        indicated by line 242. During the interval from about 20 seconds
        to 40 seconds the disproportionation phase takes place. Then at
        approximately 40 seconds the water inlet valve is opened again,
        and the cycle repeats. </p>
      <p>The upper characteristic in FIG. 7 shows the same cycle for
        reaction chamber No. 2 as described above for reaction chamber
        No. 1. In the upper characteristic the same reference numerals
        are employed, but primes are employed in place of the unprimed
        numbers used in connection with the lower plot of FIG. 7. </p>
      <p>FIG. 8 is a fragmentary view of a portion of a reaction chamber
        such as that shown in FIGS. 1 and 4 described hereinabove. In
        FIG. 8 the outer cylindrical wall 252 may for example be made of
        one-quarter or three-eights inch stainless steel. </p>
      <p>Referring more specifically to FIG. 8, in order to expose the
        manganese oxide powder fully to the space within reaction
        chamber 258, this chamber is filled with a large number of
        hollow stainless steel screen elements which may be formed by
        taking small strips of stainless steel and folding them over
        upon themselves and welding or otherwise securing them together
        to form a hollow enclosed space. The chamber 258 is initially
        filled with these stainless steel, hollow mesh cells 260. Then a
        large quantity of manganese oxide is poured into the reaction
        chambers and is shaken down in among the stainless steel mesh
        cells to completely fill the entire chamber 258. In FIG. 8 a
        number of these stainless steel mesh cells designated 560 are
        shown, and the manganese oxide powder 262 between the cells is
        also indicated. It is to be understood, of course, that other
        techniques may be employed for exposing the reactant to the
        space within the reaction chamber, but the foregoing system has
        proved eminently satisfactory in at least one 4-reaction chamber
        apparatus which has been successfully operated. </p>
      <p>In addition, the host and sensitizer material may be included
        in the fabrication of the wire mesh cells 260. With waver vapor
        within these wire mesh cells, this feedstock is fully exposed to
        the intense radiation from the sensitizer. </p>
      <p>FIG. 9 shows an improved structural arrangement of the reaction
        chambers in which the four reaction chambers 302, 304, 306 and
        308 are donut-shaped and are stacked up on top of one another in
        intimate heat conducting and transferring relationship. Each of
        the four reaction chambers is provided with two manifolds 310
        and 312 to supply gases to the reaction chambers and to remove
        gases therefrom. These input and output manifolds serve the same
        functions as the spaces 148 and 150 at the top and bottom of the
        cylindrical reaction chambers as shown in FIG. 4, for example. </p>
      <p>Each of the reaction chambers 302, 304, 306, and 308 contain
        reactant, such as manganese oxide, and voids created by wire
        mesh cells as described above, or other structure which will be
        described below, with which the sensitizer and host materials
        are associated. </p>
      <p>A burner 314 extends through the central opening of all of the
        four donut-shaped reaction chambers. The burner 314 has the
        general configuration shown in FIG. 3, but is provided with
        upper and lower apertured plates 316 and 318 for ease in
        applying the hydrogen and oxygen to the burner and for ease of
        withdrawning the burned gaseous products from the unit. Although
        the details of the burner 314 are not shown, it includes the
        refractory lining and the granular refractory material such as
        is shown at 130 and 132, respectively, in FIG. 3. </p>
      <p>The unit of FIG. 9 is also provided with heavy upper and lower
        plates 320 and 322, which are bolted together with a series of
        bolts 324 spaced around the periphery of the plates 320 and 322.
        With this arrangement the reaction chambers 302, 304, 306, and
        308 are rigidly together in intimate heat conducting
        relationship, and can withstand very high pressures even at very
        high temperatures without deformation of the reaction chambers.
      </p>
      <p>The reaction chamber assembly is mounted on any suitable
        insulating support as indicated by the blocks 326. A lower metal
        base 328 and lighter gauge stainless steel metal sidewalls 330
        are also provided. High temperature heat insulating ceramic wool
        encloses the reaction chamber assembly and reduces heat
        radiation to very low levels. The ceramic wool is indicated by
        reference numeral 332 in FIG. 9. In passing, it may be noted
        that the use of flat donut-shaped reaction chambers provides a
        geometry which is superior to the set of five cylinders shown in
        FIG. 5, in that the reaction chambers are in more intimate heat
        conducting association with one another and with the central
        burner, than in the arrangement of FIG. 5. </p>
      <p>Apart from the physical arrangement of the four reaction
        chambers and the central burner, the "plumbing" and mode of
        operation of the system as described in connection with FIGS. 1
        through 8, remains unchanged. </p>
      <p>A more detailed consideraion of the absorption characteristic
        of water vapor and other possible feedstocks, and the matching
        of the host and sensitizer materials to the feedstock absorption
        characteristic will now be undertaken. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 10 the relative transmittance and absorption of water
        vapor at different wavelengths is shown. By way of example, note
        that at wavelengths of about 2.5 to 2.6 microns, the curve which
        represents transmittance has a dip designated 342 in FIG. 10.
        This is in contrast to the peaks 344 and 346 which are centered
        just above 2 microns, and in the vicinity of 4 microns,
        respectively. A combined host material and sensitizer which will
        provide intense coherent radiation in the vicinity of 2.5 and
        2.6 microns, and which absorbs energy in the vicinity of 1.2 to
        1.3 microns, will be employed as one set of materials for
        concentrating energy and applying it to water vapor. The
        particular host material and sensitizer which provides this
        wavelength of absorbing heat energy and radiating energy is
        calcium fluoride CaF.sub.2 as the host material, and uranium-3
        as the sensitizer. </p>
      <p>Before considering FIGS. 11 and 12 some background relative to
        the phenomena which are taking place will now be included. </p>
      <p>Initially, it may be noted that the theory of Masers and Lasers
        of course forms a background for the present invention. The word
        "LASER" is an acronym which stands for the Light Amplification
        by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Although related to
        some extent to Maser and Laser theory, the present invention
        does not involve the intense collimated beams of energy
        characteristic of Masers and Lasers; and of course, Masers and
        Lasers do not derive their energy from a heat reservoir made up
        of a body of material at elevated temperatures. </p>
      <p><b>Types of Radiation</b> </p>
      <p>There are two separate processes by which a material can become
        a generator (or producer) or radiation energy after absorbing
        suitable quantities of primary energy. In the first process the
        absorbed energy is converted (degraded) into a
        low-quantum-energy heat that diffuses through the material which
        then emits radiation called thermal radiation. </p>
      <p>In the second process an appreciable part of the absorbed
        energy is temporarily localized as relatively
        high-quantum-energy excitation of atoms or small groups of atoms
        which then emit radiation called luminescense radiation. </p>
      <p>Specifically, "luminescence" is a process whereby matter
        generates nonthermal radiation which is characteristic of the
        materials involved and not the temperatures. Sometimes, however,
        the radiation as generated is also called "luminescence". It is
        in fact luminescence only when the radiated energy is in excess
        of the thermal radiation produced by heat. </p>
      <p>Thermal radiation from solids is generally a broad continuous
        spectrum of radiation, especially infrared, which is emitted in
        increasing amount as the temperature of the solid is increased.
      </p>
      <p>The quality and quantity of thermal radiation depend almost
        exclusively on the temperature rather than the nature of the
        emitting solid material. Broadly and objectively speaking,
        luminescence describes emission of radiaton (of subatomic
        origin) in excess of thermal radiation; that is, luminescence
        yields photon emission in excess of the photon emission produced
        entirely by thermal agitation. </p>
      <p>Luminescence is generally excited by primary photons or charged
        material particles having individual energies ranging from about
        2 ev to over 10.sup.6 ev and affords emitted photons with
        energies in excess of 1 ev. When luminescence is excited by
        energy liberated during chemical reactions, the liberated energy
        per emitting atom or molecule usually exceeds 1 ev. These
        excitation energies are hundreds to millions of times greater
        than the energies of individual phonons in solids. A single
        phonon can increase the energy of an electron or atom in a solid
        by at most a few hundredths of an electron volt, whereas the
        individual primary particles normally used to excite
        luminescence can provide energy increases up to the total amount
        of energy carried by the primary particle (except for rest-mass
        energy), that is, tens to millions of electron volts. </p>
      <p>In order to obtain barely visible emissions of thermal
        radiation from a solid, the temperature of the solid must be
        raised above 900.degree. K. to obtain an appreciable probability
        of getting 1.7 ev (or greater) electronic excitations by the
        cumulative action of phonons. </p>
      <p>The thermal radiations from real solids cannot exceed the
        emission which would be obtained from a perfect black body at
        the given temperature and frequency. Most solids emit somewhat
        less thermal radiation than the maximum which is expressed by: </p>
      <p>The peak wavelength .lambda.pk of the broad emission band of
        black body radiation is inversely proportional to T, according
        to WIEN'S displacement equation. </p>
      <p>The TOTAL THERMAL EMISSIVE POWER P.sub.T of a perfect black
        body increases as T.sup.4, according to the STEFAN-BOLTZMANN
        LAW: </p>
      <p>P.sub.T =2 .sup.5 k.sup.4 T.sup.4 /15C.sup.2 h.sup.3
        =5.7.times.10.sup.-5 T.sup.4 erg cm.sup.-2 sec.sup.-1 (52) </p>
      <p>At room temperature (about 200.degree. K.), .lambda.pk is in
        the far infrared at 97,000 A, and P.sub.T is only
        4.6.times.10.sup.5 erg cm.sup.-2 sec.sup.-1, so that there is
        not an appreciable amount of radiation in the VISIBLE region
        between 4000 and 7000 A. </p>
      <p>At the temperature of an incandescent lamp filament (about
        2800.degree. K.), .lambda.pk is about 10,000 A, and P.sub.T is
        3.5.times.10.sup.9 erg cm.sup.-2 sec.sup.-1, so that there is an
        appreciable emission in the visible part of the spectrum. In the
        temperature range between about 700.degree. and 1000.degree. K.
        there is an overlapping of feeble luminescence and feeble
        incandescence. </p>
      <p>The present invention involves temperatures from a lower limit
        of about 900.degree. to 1000.degree. Kelvin or about 600.degree.
        to 700.degree. Centigrade and ranges upward from these
        temperatures with the upper limit controlled only by the
        strengths of the materials utilized (1) as the reactant or
        host/sensitizer, (2) for the reaction chamber, and (3) for the
        tanks, tubing, etc. </p>
      <p><b>THE HASER CONCEPT</b> </p>
      <p>The Maser/Laser type of acronym may also be applied to another
        system termed "Haser", an acronym for "Heat Amplification by
        Stimulted Emission of Radiation." As will be developed below,
        however, the term "Amplification" is not used in the sense of
        increasing signal strength, but in the sense of amplifying the
        effectiveness of heat energy. </p>
      <p>The Haser application depends not as much on coherence or
        monochromaticity per se, but rather on the unprecedented energy
        per unit area. This radiated energy is a by-product of the
        coherence of the radiation, and can be many orders of magnitude
        greater in energy than normal incoherent thermal radiation. To
        understand why this is possible, it is necessary to review
        briefly a few of the basic differences between the incoherent
        radiation produced by an ordinary bright source and the coherent
        light (radiation) produced by a laser or maser. </p>
      <p>In a conventional source the atoms of a solid (or a gas) are
        agitated either thermally or electrically to higher energy
        states. When these atoms return spontaneously to their lower
        levels, they radiate some of their excess energy as light. Since
        each atom behaves independently at this state, its emission is
        at a random time and in a random direction with a random
        polarization. </p>
      <p>It follows that the light radiated in a single direction in the
        complex sum of all the light from the individual atoms. The
        phases of any two atoms will tend to cancel their radiation in
        some directions and enhance it in others. The total energy of
        the source will on the average be radiated uniformly in all
        accessible directions, and the amount of energy observed in a
        given direction will be proportional to the solid angle
        substituted by the observing device. In the Haser interior the
        observing device is either a water-vapor molecule (or other
        feedstock) or another particulate of reactant. </p>
      <p>The maximum total energy that can be radiated by a given source
        depends on two factors: the surface area of the source and the
        maximum temperature to which the source has been heated.
        Therefore, in practice, the only way to increase the power
        output from an ordinary source beyond the limitations imposed by
        the source material is to increase the surface area of the
        source. </p>
      <p>Power output, however, is only half the solution. Concentrated
        power is much more important than power itself. A 40-watt
        fluorescent lamp, for example, produces more light than a
        40-watt incandescent lamp, but the fluorescent lamp is not
        nearly as effective as the incandescent light source for a
        spotlight. </p>
      <p>Now, in a laser or maser, the energy is also emitted when atoms
        drop from a higher energy level to a lower one; however, in this
        case the atoms are triggered and emit radiation (to a large
        percentage) in unison. In the case of the Haser, the atoms are
        triggered to emit radiation in unison by phonon/photon waves
        within the unit cavity or cell interior. Enough of the energy
        previously generated is retained within the mass of particulates
        to maintain emission in a compatible phase, polarization and
        direction. This phonon wave interacts with the excited atoms and
        causes them (to a large degree) to emit their excess energy in
        phase with the stimulating wave before they have a chance to do
        it randomly. </p>
      <p>As a result, the Haser generates a good percentage of its
        radiated energy so that it travels in synchronism with the
        standing phonon waves, therefore concentrating the energy
        emitted as photons. </p>
      <p>In effect, the radiated photons from the Haser particulates are
        all relatively concentrated, monochromatic, and therefore,
        relatively coherent energy sources. This results in an excellent
        energy density even though the photons are traveling in
        practically an infinite number of directions, due to the fact
        that the particulate sources number in hundreds of millions. The
        photons moving from particulate to particulate impact and are
        absorbed by other particulates. Then, this STORAGE, BUILD-UP,
        AND RELEASE of the "phase and amplitude of radiated energy,"
        combined with the fine particulate geometry of the Haser power
        (energy) source, which provides surface area to emit photons in
        extremes, allows a "maximum efficiency utilization" of the
        radiated energy within the Haser cavity. </p>
      <p>The act of controlling the spectral emissions to most
        effectively dissociate (for example) water vapor, by sensitizing
        the host compound properly is another very important point. The
        monochromatic waves may become distorted in passing through
        substances, so that harmonic waves are generated at two or more
        times their original frequency. </p>
      <p>Infrared wavelengths may be converted into visible light, and
        visible light into ultraviolet waves. </p>
      <p>This new system utilizes fine (small) particulates of solids
        comprised of oxides which are predetermined by design within
        which some of the host atoms are replaced by other frequency
        sensitive atoms also predetermined by design, which, provide
        stimulated absorption and emission at predetermined wavelengths.
      </p>
      <p>An ohmic (or other) pre-heat provides to the heat reservoir
        mass the original energy to liberate a massive volume of photons
        at the frequency range which will activate the sensitive atoms
        included in the host compound; the fine multi-faceted
        particulates absorb the photons which normally proceed as
        phonons through the particulate to generate and provide large
        numbers of cavity resonances which stimulates emission with each
        internal excursion; therefore, again, the gain by this
        regenerative amplifier when driven by the thermal noise
        fluctuations from the cavity walls, can be significant. </p>
      <p>In the case of the HASER, the principle emissions of radiation
        designed and produced to dissociate the chemical product may be
        emitted from the woven wire mesh cavity balls or cells 260 (FIG.
        8) that fill the entire Haser cavity. </p>
      <p>The "preheat" energy can be electrical and inserted (through
        resistance heaters) into the internal cavity or the heaters may
        also be external to the cavity and heat the mass by conduction
        and radiation through solids. </p>
      <p>Also, the "preheat" energy may be inserted by combusting
        suitable fuels such as hydrogen, hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, and
        other hydrocarbons, directly in the internal cavity of the unit
        or within a "center-core" burning unit as is designed into the
        unit of FIG. 9, for example. </p>
      <p>As the reactive mass reaches temperature levels which excite
        the molecules and atoms to a radiating level of energy, phonons
        and photons evolve which distribute the thermal energy within
        the mass. Incidentally, relative to the use of the terms
        "photon" and "phonon", when a photon traveling through space
        impinges on a solid, the resultant wave in the solid is termed a
        "phonon". </p>
      <p>The ability of `atoms` to store energy has to do with the
        electrons within the individual atoms. The electrons exist as a
        cloud of negative charge around the positively charged nucleus.
        Each election occupies a state of energy and angular momentum
        that cannot be occupied by any other election. </p>
      <p>Therefore, the electrons tend to fill stable shells surrounding
        the nucleus. </p>
      <p>The electrons of the outermost shell are the ones most easily
        affected by outside forces because of their accessibility. These
        outer electrons can be moved to higher energy states, but they
        always tend to return to their lowest energy state: the ground
        state. Electrons at certain levels decay (fall to a lower state)
        more easily than electrons at other levels. </p>
      <p>Each excited electronic state of the atom has a characteristic
        lifetime that indicates the average time it takes an electron to
        fall to a lower level and therefore radiate a photon. Most
        excited states have lifetimes of about 10.sup.-8 second. </p>
      <p>There are some excited states or levels in all atoms in which
        the electron cannot decay easily by giving up a photon. Such
        atoms must therefore wait for other means of giving up their
        energy, such as colliding with other atoms or with the walls of
        the system. Electrons in this state of energy tend to stay there
        for relatively long periods of time (0.001 second or more), and
        are referred to as being in metastable states. This is an
        important part of the storing of energy, which can then be
        retrieved in the excitation process by stimulation. </p>
      <p>the normal radiative decay from a higher electronic state to a
        lower one is termed spontaneous emission. As discussed earlier,
        processes exist that can force an atomic electron to a higher
        state or stimulate it to jump to a lower state. An example of
        forcing, as discussed earlier, is provided when a photon
        collides with an atom and excites the outer electron to a higher
        level, which can happen when the energy or wavelength of the
        photon corresponds exactly to the difference in energy between
        the state the electron is in and some higher possible state.
        This process is known as absorption because the photon (energy)
        is actually absorbed by the atom and all the photon's energy
        goes into raising the electron to a higher state. </p>
      <p>Similarly, as discussed earlier, the stimulated electron can
        move to a lower level, provided that such a level exists and
        that the difference between the two levels corresponds to the
        energy of the incoming photon exactly. The energy given up by
        the electron in jumping to a lower state goes into creating an
        additional photon with the same characteristics as the colliding
        photon. </p>
      <p>A large number of atoms can provide an increase in the radiated
        energy at the desired frequency or energy level, if the
        population of electrons in the excited states of the atoms is
        suitably arranged. Consider two excited levels of a system of
        identical atoms with the electrons divided between the upper and
        lower levels. If a radiated photon having a wavelength
        corresponding to the difference in energy between the two levels
        is allowed to pass through the system medium, it will be
        amplified if there are more atoms with electrons in the upper
        state and absorbed if there are more atoms with electrons in the
        lower state. The condition of having more atoms in the upper
        state is called a "population inversion"](because it goes
        against the normal processes of nature, which tend to keep more
        electrons at lower energies than at higher energies). </p>
      <p>The search for new Haser "systems" is therefore not easy,
        because one is working against the natural tendencies of the
        electrons. </p>
      <p>Another important consideration is the actual `lifetimes` of
        the ion energy levels of the impurity atoms involved in the
        population inversion. The upper level of a two-level system with
        a population inversion radiates energy corresponding exactly to
        the difference between the two levels. </p>
      <p>The electrons that have thus yielded energy by radiation, end
        up at the lower level. If they remained there, the situation
        would result wherein there would be more atoms at the lower
        level than at the upper level, and as discussed earlier, there
        would be absorption instead of gain. For continuous operation,
        one must find impurity atoms with combinations of levels such
        that the lower level has a short lifetime and the upper level is
        preferentially populated. This necessity rules out the ion
        ground state as a possible Haser level, since all ion ground
        states are metastable. the pair (or more) of ion energy levels
        which will provide amplficiation must be energetically above the
        ground state but still below the metastable states. </p>
      <p>Although the original gas laser utilized electrical excitation
        of electronic transitions, later versions use vibrational
        transistions in molecules such as carbon dioxide, and the
        excitation mechanism may involve electrical or chemical
        excitation, or the burning of fuel. In the chemical laser,
        atomic species such as hydrogen and fluorine can be reacted to
        produce molecules in an excited vibrational state which in turn
        yields amplification or oscillation. </p>
      <p>An entirely new excitation process was announced by Garry in
        1970. In this, the gas dynamic laser, an appropriate fuel is
        burned to produce carbon dioxide and nitrogen at high
        temperature and pressure. When released through a nozzle into
        the optical resonator region, the gas cools rapidly in terms of
        its kinetic or translational energy, but the population of the
        vibrational energy levels of the carbon dioxide molecules
        becomes inverted since the lower level of the laser transition
        relaxes more rapidly. In addition, the vibrationally excited
        nitrogen molecules are in near resonance with the upper laser
        state of the carbon dioxide and transfer energy with high
        efficiency to maintain the inversion. This type of `laser` has
        produced continuous powers as high as 60 kw. </p>
      <p>The HASER phenomenon as utilized in the present invention,
        actually uses a thermochemical excitation mechanism. The
        original preheat energy prepares the reactant material within
        the reaction chamber by bringing the material to photon emitting
        temperatures. </p>
      <p>When water vapor is introduced into the chamber of FIGS. 1 and
        8, for example, the excited billions of photons emitted and
        traveling between particulates, strikes the sensitized "Cvities"
        with a barrage of photons designed to provide frequency,
        amplitude, and steric factor impact adequate to dissociate the
        H.sub.2 O molecules. On dissociation, the 2H.sub.2, and O.sub.2
        molecules are vibrating at very high temperatures and pressures
        which are compatible with recombining these molecules through
        the "activated complex" mechanism into their (high temperature)
        preferential H.sub.2 O.sub. + H.sub.2 molecules, w hich
        incidentally evolves more than 33 KCal/mole heat energy. As the
        steam enters and traverses the cavity, an amount of the steam
        (depending upon the design of the contents of the reactor
        chamber and the relative amount of reactant, manganese oxide or
        other similar metal oxide, and the host/sensitizer material),
        combines with the reactant, which raises the oxidation level
        through the process of oxidation; and this of course, evolves
        heat energy (because this is an exothemic reaction), which,
        broadcasts more photons of energy throughout the cavity
        interior, to react with the sensitizers and activators; and this
        in turn creates massive amounts of new photons of energy to
        dissociate the H.sub.2 O vapor and maintain the reaction
        temperatures within the host materials. </p>
      <p><b>HASER CAVITIES</b> </p>
      <p>Referring again to FIG. 8, the cavities 260 can be fabricated
        of very fine mesh woven wire, which is cut into small sections,
        stamped, folded, and the outer edges of the wire mesh are
        secured together to form a hollow cell. The wire, of a diameter
        approximately equal to 0.002 inch, is made up of the elements,
        compounds, and a metal carrier (inert to the process), and is
        initially woven and formed into the cells as described above. It
        is then transformed into the desired host and sensitizer
        materials through oxidation in an atmospherically controlled
        furnace or kiln. </p>
      <p><b>CERAMIC HASER TUBES</b> </p>
      <p>Instead of the wire mesh cells 260 as shown in FIG. 8, the
        preferred form of Haser cavity is shown in FIG. 11 in which a
        large number of ceramic tubes 352 are present. These tubes are
        preferably extruded from mullite, which is a common clay having
        the approximate chemical structure of 2Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 .
        SiO.sub.2 with a range to 3Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 . 2SiO.sub.2.
        Suitable quantities of host and sensitizer materials, as
        described below, are added to, and thoroughly mixed with the
        mullite prior to extrusion. Subsequent to extrusion the tubes
        are fired in a suitable kiln or furnace. The tubes may suitably
        have a diameter of about 1/4 inch or 1/2 inch and be from 1 to
        12 inches in length. The sidewalls may suitably be from 1/32 to
        1/16 of an inch in thickness, but none of the foregoing
        dimensions are critical. After firing, the tubes 352 are
        provided with filters 354 in both ends. The filters may be of
        any suitable structure, for example, several layers of metal
        gauze, to prevent the intrusion of the reactant 356 which may,
        for example, be manganese oxide. In practice the ceramic tubes
        352 with their associated filters 354 may be initially placed in
        one of the reaction chambers such as reaction chamber 302, 304,
        306, and 308 of FIG. 9, or the chambers 126 of FIG. 1; and then
        powdered metallic manganese or manganese oxide may be poured in
        and the entire unit vibrated until the manganese oxide 356 as
        shown in FIG. 11 fills all the space around the ceramic tubes
        352. With this arrangement, of course, the water vapor is
        present within all of the ceramic tubes 352; heat is provided by
        the manganese oxide 356; and radiation from the host/sensitizer
        combination forming part of the ceramic walls 352 radiates
        intense coherent energy in one or more of the absorption bands
        of water vapor; and this intense radiation serves to dissociate
        the hydrogen and oxygen atoms making up the water vapor
        molecule. </p>
      <p>The foregoing action is shown diagrammatically in FIG. 12 in
        which the tube 352 is shown centrally located and the
        surrounding particles of manganese oxide 356 are shown radiating
        broad spectrum thermal radiation 358 in all directions including
        into the ceramic tube 352. The water vapor particles 360 shown
        as small circles within the tube 352 may be directly impacted by
        the coherent radiation 362 which is emitted by the
        host/sensitizer combination included in the walls of ceramic
        tubes 352. It may be noted, that for convenience in
        illustration, the magnanese oxide particles are shown spaced
        apart in FIG. 12; however, in practice they would be filling all
        of the space within the reaction chambers which is not filled
        with the ceramic tubes 352. </p>
      <p><b>HOST/SENSITIZERS FOR WATER VAPOR FEEDSTOCK</b> </p>
      <p>In the tabulation which will be set forth below, suitable host
        materials and sensitizers for applying radiation to water vapor
        will be set forth. In this tabulation the chemical symbols for
        the elements will be employed, and the host material will be
        listed first followed by the sensitizer material. In each case
        the absorption band for the host material will initially be
        given and then the emission wavelength of the sensitizer will be
        sent forth. Following the tabulation, the absorption
        characteristic of water vapor as shown in FIG. 10 wll be
        reviewed and the relationship of the emisson lines of the
        sensitizers to the absorption bands of the water vapor will be
        discussed. </p>

        Ca,(Calcium) Emission = 2.5111 microns-2.613 F(Fluorine) microns
        U(Uranium) ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>In the foregoing tabulation it may be noted that there are only
        three separate combinations of host and sensitizer materials
        which are being employed. More specifically, the combination of
        calcium tungstate and neodymium produce output radiations both
        at 1.065 microns and also at 1.3372 microns as set forth in
        examples (a) and (b). It may be noted that the absorption
        wavelengths for the two output emissions differ correspondingly.
        The combination tabulated in examples (c) and 8d) set forth
        above include yttrium aluminum oxide as the host material and
        erbium as the sensitizer. In this case, the emitted radiation
        for both (c) and (d) is at 1.6602 microns; however, the
        absorption for the two examples is at different frequencies. The
        final example (e) using calcium fluoride as the host material
        and uranium-3 as the sensitizer was mentioned above </p>
      <p>With regard to the matching of the emitted radiation from the
        sensitizers with the absorption bands shown in FIG. 10 for water
        vapor as a feedstock, the high absorption band for water vapor
        extending from about 2.4 microns to about 3.1 microns is well
        located to receive emitted energy in the 2.5 microns to 2.6
        micron wavelength region from example (e) tabulated above. With
        regard to examples (a) through (d), a cursory review of the
        emission wavelengths and the corresponding moderately sharp
        absorption bands between 1 and 2 microns would indicate that
        there is not necessarily an exact correspondence. However, it
        has been determined that there is a certain amount of broadening
        of the radiation and of the absorption characteristics which
        occurs at high temperatures; accordingly, with the basic
        location of the emission lines and the absorption points as
        indicated in the above table and in FIG. 10, the practical
        result is good coupling from the emitted radiation to the water
        vapor molecules at the 1,000 .degree.Kelvin temperature at which
        the system is operative. </p>
      <p>With regard to the relative quantities of the host and
        sensitizer material in the mullite, the quantity of host
        material should be approximately 25 to 1,000 times greater than
        the amount of associated sensitizer material. A ratio is
        approximately 0.5% of sensitizer of the amount of host material
        is the general order of magnitude which should be employed. In
        addition, the quantity of each particular category of host and
        sensitizer material such as those set forth in the tabulation of
        combinations (a) through (e) set forth above, should be
        proportioned to the absorption bands of the feedstock which is
        being irradiated. Thus, in the particular example under
        consideration, where the host/sensitizer combination (e) using
        calcium fluoride and uranium-3, is matched to a broad absorption
        band of water vapor, a larger quantity of this host/sensitizer
        combination should be employed as compared with combination (a),
        (b) and combination (c), (d). Thus, in the making of the ceramic
        tubes, the material which is being prepared might include
        approximately 88% by weight of mullite, 8% by weight of the
        host/sensitizer combination (e), and 2% by weight of each of
        host/sensitizer combinations (a), (b) and (c), (d). Similarly,
        in the event that the wire mesh is employed, the host
        sensitizer/sensitizer combinations may be added in the same
        proportions to stainless steel wire and the combination material
        drawn into wires and formed into mesh. Alternatively, after the
        preparation of the stainless steel wire cells, mullite together
        with the host sensitizer combinations could be applied in
        several bands in the plastic state around the stainless steel
        wire mesh cells, and then fired, to produce the desired result.
        This result, as mentioned above, involves the provision of
        spaces throughout a body of material constituting a heat
        reservoir, and locating host/sensitizer combinations around the
        boundaries of these spaces or voids in the material. </p>
      <p>The chemical formula for mullite was given above, and it is
        again noted that mullite includes aluminum oxide Al.sub.2
        O.sub.3 and silicon dioxide SiO.sub.2 in certain proportions
        noted above. In order to enhance the "HASER" action and increase
        the energization of the host/sensitizer combinations (a) through
        (e) set forth above, a material such as chromium, which acts as
        a sensitizer in cooperation with the aluminum oxide in mullite
        which acts as the host material. The chromium-aluminum oxide,
        sensitizer-host combination produces strong output radiation at
        a number of wavelengths, including output radiation centered at
        0.6934 microns, when the Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 is absorbing energy at
        0.5 microns. The radiation centered at 0.6934 is broadened at
        the high operating conditions so that the radiation extends from
        0.6 or 0.65 to 0.75 or 0.8 microns, thus providing supplemental
        input energy to example (a) set forth hereinabove, which
        involves absorption at about 0.74 to 0.76 microns. The Al.sub.2
        O.sub.3 /Cr combination may also directly apply energy to the
        feedstock when the output radiation is of the proper frequency
        and may also pump other host/sensitizer combinations. When
        chromium is used it will be present in quantities in the order
        of five per cent by weight or less of the mullite employed as
        the basic material of the tubes 352 as shown in FIGS. 11 and 12.
      </p>
      <p><b>MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>The primary requirements for potential solid-state Maser/Haser
        materials are, first, that the composition should fluoresce with
        a suitably high intensity at elevated temperatures by means of
        thermal energy alone and, second, that the matrix should be
        transparent or has no absorption transition at the operation
        frequency; it should also be chemically stable and have no
        caustic characteristic. </p>
      <p>Preferably, the terminal level of the Haser transition of the
        active ion should be far enough above the ground state so that
        three or four-level operation is possible and at elevated
        temperatures. </p>
      <p>The lifetime of the metastable level from which the Haser
        transition originates should be, insofar as possible, equal to
        the lifetime for spontaneous emission with no constraints
        imposed by competitive dissipation to the matrix. In four-level
        operation of the lifetime of the terminal level of the
        transition must be smaller than that of the metastable level;
        otherwise, a suitable excess population in the upper level
        cannot be maintained. </p>
      <p>This condition is generally obtained when the terminal level
        lies in the phonon absorption region, preferably between 6000
        and 19,000 cm.sup.-1. In addition, it is helpful for the excited
        active ion to be unable to absorb photons corresponding in
        energy to the Haser transition. Where such absorption into a
        higher level or band is possible, the photon/phonon flux in the
        particulate cavity is reduced and the metastable level depleted.
      </p>
      <p>For best coherence the active ions should occupy equivalent
        positions in the host structure, so that there will not be a
        multiplicity of spectra. When these ions are in completely
        unique sites, the emission spectrum has the minimum detail and
        line width consistent with the site symmetry, the crystal field,
        and the active-ion concentration. In general, the higher the
        site symmetry the more degenerate the electronic states of the
        active ion. Therefore, fewer distinct transitions should be
        observed in fluorescence and, on the average, each emission
        transition should flouresce a greater portion of the absorbed
        energy. However, there are also fewer distinct absorption
        transitions, and certain emission transitions may be favored in
        a low-symmetry environment. As long as the emission transitions
        are few in number, the low symmetry environment may prove to be
        advantageous by virtue of a broader absorption coverage. </p>
      <p>Different classes of active ions seldom find optimum
        environments in the same host structure. Different activator
        ions are best accommodated in oxides or fluorides, where the
        cations of the matrix are approximately equal in size to the
        activator. Al.sub.2 O.sub.3, MgO, MgFl.sub.2, and ZnF.sub.2 are
        typical matrices for transition-metal ions, CaF.sub.2 is
        particularly useful for divalent rare-earth ions, and
        CaWO.sub.4, LaF.sub.3, and Y.sub.2 O.sub.3 are best suited for
        trivalent rare-earth ions for lasers. Y.sub.3 Al.sub.5 O.sub.12
        can readily accommodate both trivalent rare-earth ions and
        trivalent 3d transition-metal ions. Certain crystals have
        conveniently disposed matrix absorption bands and these can be
        used to absorb pumped radiation over a broad spectrum. </p>
      <p>The excitation may be subsequently transferred to trivalent
        rare-earth ions contained in the matrix and therefore, greatly
        enhance the overall efficiency of fluorescence. It probable is
        essential to move into the visible region, to obtain continuous
        operation for molybdates or niobates. </p>
      <p>In comparison, materials which have their matrix absorption
        edges well above the excitation range but absorb strongly as a
        result of the active ions having strong absorption bands of
        their own, together with narrow emission lines, can afford very
        favorable pumping conditions. </p>
      <p>Ions such as, Cr.sup.3+, Chromium, and. Dy.sup.2+, Dysprosium
        offer this advantage. </p>
      <p>The past decade has provided rapid extension of spectral
        measurements and theoretical analysis, such that the properties
        of most of the divalent and trivalent activator species are well
        understood. The interest in solid-state masers and lasers, has
        motivated the preparation of various crystals containing
        divalent rare-earth ion species and the extensive study of their
        infrared characteristics. Parallel studies of the infrared
        properties of the transition-metal ions and trivalent rare-earth
        ions have been equally productive. </p>
      <p>The selection of materials for Hasers which will operate in the
        infrared region depends on the disposition of the vibrational
        bands in the matrices. Because vibrational levels may drain an
        electronic state, they should not be too close below the
        metastable level, or the latter should lie below the vibrational
        levels in energy. </p>
      <p>Suitable coupled pairs which provide a mutual cross relacation
        can also be used advantageously to minimize loss of efficiency
        due to fluorescence from levels lying higher than the metastable
        level of interest and loss to the phonon spectrum. It is also
        desirable to increase the efficiencies of masers that terminate
        on phonon levels. This mechanism of operation offers the
        possibility of a maser that can be tuned over a broad range of
        frequencies. </p>
      <p><b>PREFERRED LATTICES</b> </p>
      <p>Oxygen-dominated compounds are those in which oxygen is a major
        chemical constituent of the host lattice. They may be classified
        according to their chemical composition into four groups. </p>
      <p>The first group, comprising the simplest compounds, has the
        generic formula M.sub.x O.sub.y, representative numbers being
        the alkaline earth oxides and Al.sub.2 O.sub.3, Y.sub.2 O.sub.3,
        and ThO.sub.2, with Cr.sup.3+, Mn.sup.2+, and the rare earths as
        common activators. Other compounds included in the generic
        formula are CuO, and ZnS and the other II-VI wide-band-gap
        compounds. </p>
      <p>The second and largest group are the binary oxides, M.sub.x
        A.sub.y O.sub.z, where M is any element of Group II, A or B, and
        Period 2 to 6, and A is Ti, Zr, V, Nb, Mo, B, Al, Si, Ge, P, As,
        Sb, or S. </p>
      <p>In many cases x=4y, the oxygens nearly tetrahedrally arranged
        arond the multivalent atom, A. </p>
      <p>The common activators are Mn.sup.2+, Mn.sup.4+, Ag.sup.+,
        Sn.sup.2+, Tl.sup.+, Pb.sup.2+, and the rare earths. Included in
        this group also are the wwell-known self-activated compounds
        comprised of tungstates and molybdates, which are commonly
        called scheelites (although some do not have the scheelite
        structure). These require no activating impurity, because the
        energy transitions take place within the anion, although
        impurity-activated luminescence is also observed. </p>
      <p>Of the impurity-activated members of the binary oxides, the
        borates, phosphates and silicates are the most numerous. </p>
      <p>Ternary systems, M.sub.x A.sub.y B.sub.y O.sub.z, constitute
        the third category. M and A and B are the elements listed in the
        binary systems plus the alkali metals. </p>
      <p>The most common activators, other than the rare earths, are
        those listed with the binary oxides. There are a few ternary
        compounds not containing tungsten or molybdenum which are
        believed to be self-activated. </p>
      <p>There are many other oxygen-containing inorganic luminescent
        solids, including a large number of rare-earth salts and
        impurity-activated nitrites, carbonates, etc. The work on the
        latter is largely incomplete. The work on the rare-earth salts
        constitutes a well-studied separate discipline (Diecke et al,
        1961). </p>
      <p>Considering the small number of possible combinations of simple
        oxides and activators, it is surprising that new prospects in
        this group continue to be found. New compounds, however,
        consisting of oxides of antimony, germanium, thorium, calcium,
        strontium, yttrium, and gadolinium with various activators have
        been developed over the last few years. </p>
      <p>The valence of manganese in phosphors or compounds is
        interesting because of its use as an activator in many lattices.
        Kroger (1948) showed that the broad structureless red or green
        emission spectra of manganese-activated compounds is generally
        due to Mn.sup.2+, whereas the red narrow-banded emission is due
        to Mn.sup.4+ </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY</b> </p>
      <p>In the same way that the spectroscopy of atoms provided basic
        information on atomic structure, careful study of controlled
        luminescence of solids provide information on band structures
        and energy levels of impurities and imperfections. In some
        cases, the spectra of impurities yield, through the application
        of crystal field theory, information on the symmetry and
        strength of the crystal field at the impurity site. The
        absorption or excitation spectra involve electronic states of
        the system with equilibrium nuclear coordinates characteristic
        of the ground state; luminescent emission spectra involves
        electronic states with the equilibrium nuclear coordinates of
        the emitting state. </p>
      <p>Additionally, detailed theoretical knowledge of band structure
        and of impurities and imperfections obtained from semiconductor
        and photoconductor research provides understanding of the
        luminescence of these materials. </p>
      <p>Luminescence is generally investigated as a steady-state
        phenomenon, wherein the compound interacts with the excitation
        source and emits radiated energy continuously. The thermodynamic
        parameters of the compound remain time independent at every
        point in the system, despite the occurrence of excitation,
        emission, and dissipative processes. </p>
      <p>Irreversible thermodynamics is concerned with just such open
        systems, which interact with their environment in a stationary
        way. </p>
      <p>It is a principle of irreversible thermodynamics that the
        entropy production is positive in every macroscopic region of
        the system undergoing irreversible processes. </p>
      <p>Macroscopic regions refer to regions large enough for
        microscopic fluctuations to exist but small enough for
        approximate equilibrium to exit within each region. We are
        especially interested in the more complex excitation mechanisms
        involving energy transfer between different macroscopic regions
        not in equilibrium with each other. </p>
      <p><b>LIGHT ABSORPTION AND COLOR</b> </p>
      <p>An electromatic radiation, (such as radiowave, light, and
        X-ray) can be characterized by its particular wavelength,
        LAMBDA, .lambda. (measured in cm or A), or by its wave number,
        .sup.NU, .nu. (the reciprocal of the
        wavelength),.nu.=1/.lambda., commonly expressed in reciprocal
        centimeters, cm.sup.-1. </p>
      <p>Each unit of radiation (a photon) corresponds to a quantum of
        radiant energy, E, which is directly proportional to the wave
        number, .nu.. Since chemical calculations are founded on a mole
        basis, in discussing the relationship between radiant energy and
        chemical processes (responsive activators and hosts) it is
        convenient to express radiant energy in kcal/mole of photons. We
        can do so with this accepted relationship: the radiant energy in
        1 mole of photons, with .nu.=350 cm.sup.-1, is equal to 1 kcal.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, we can obtain the energy (expressed in kcal/mole)
        for photons of a given wave number simply by multiplying the
        value of .nu. expressed in cm.sup.-1 by the conversion factor
        ##EQU1## </p>
      <p>For example, the energy of light photons with .nu.=20,000
        cm.sup.-1 is: ##EQU2## and the energy of a single photon of
        .nu.=20,000 cm.sup.-1 is: ##EQU3## </p>
      <p>The wave number, and the energy, of electromagnetic radiations
        varies within an extremely wide range --.nu.=10.sup.14 cm.sup.-1
        for the .gamma.-rays emitted in nuclear reactions to
        .nu.=10.sup.-6 cm.sup.-1 for radiowaves. In between these two
        extremes, there is a continuum of radiations of intermediate
        wave numbers--the "visible region", which extends approximately
        from 27,000 cm.sup.-1 to 13,500 cm.sup.-1. </p>
      <p>In general, when white light strikes a substance, part of the
        light is absorbed and part is transmitted (if the substance is
        transparent) or part is reflected (if the substance is opaque).
        A substance may absorb preferentially the light photons of one
        (or more) region(s) of the spectrum, so that the transmitted
        light or the reflected light is relatively richer in the
        radiations of the remaining regions. </p>
      <p>The combined effect of these remaining radiations is observed
        as a particular color (when it is in the visible spectrum) </p>
      <p>For example, a substance that, when exposed to white light,
        absorbs almost all photons in the entire yellow-to-violet region
        (say from 17,000 to 27,000 cm.sup.-1) will "appear red", because
        only the radiations in the red region of the spectrum (13,500 to
        about 17,000 cm.sup.-1), which are not absorbed, remain to be
        observed. </p>
      <p>Similarly, a substance that "appears yellow" absorbs photons of
        both the green-to-violet region (from 19,000 cm.sup.-1 to 27,000
        cm.sup.-1) and the red region (from 13,500 to 16,000 cm.sup.-1)
        of the visible spectrum. </p>
      <p>Since light (radiation) is energy, the absorption of radiation
        is absorption of energy; it is well known, that, if a substance
        absorbs light, the corresponding absorbed energy may be used to
        promote certain atoms, ions, or molecules of a substance from
        "ground-state" to an "excited state". For example, an atom, ion,
        or molecule which absorbs a photon of a given wave number takes
        on a `quantum` of energy that may serve to promote one electron
        from a lower energy orbital to a higher (available) energy
        orbital. In general, different electronic transitions involve
        the absorption of different quanta of energy. </p>

      <p><b>SPECIFIC EXAMPLES</b> </p>
      <p>Some underlying principles involved in the selection of Haser
        systems have been set out hereinabove and a preferred embodiment
        has been described which involves water vapor as a feedstock and
        the generation of hydrogen and/or hydrogen peroxide. It is to be
        understood that the Haser concept is not limited to the specific
        embodiment described herein but has more general applicability
        in the conversion of broad spectrum heat energy or radiation to
        particular frequencies which lie within the absorption band or
        bands of any selected feedstock. </p>
      <p>The feedstock may be gaseous or liquid or even a slurry, and
        may be brought into proximity with the heat reservoir and
        associated host and sensitizer material in any desired and
        practical manner. The heat in the heat reservoir may be
        generated in any suitable manner including the use of the
        exothermic reactor for generating hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide
        and/or the combustion of the hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide. </p>
      <p>The feedstock may for example be directed through the heat
        reservoir by a pipe suitable coiled to provide for adequate
        exposure to the radiation. The pipe may be transparent to the
        radiation being applied to the feedstock; or alternatively, the
        pipe may be made of material containing the specially selected
        host and sensitizer material. </p>
      <p>In the following examples, a number of reactions are set forth
        and these are followed by an identification of a host and
        sensitizer material which will concentrate the broader spectrum
        heat energy to one of the absorption bands of the feedstock.
        Incidentally, in the following examples, in addition to the
        standard symbols for the elements, the following abbreviations
        are used: Et for ethyl, C.sub.2 H.sub.5 ; Ph for phenyl, C.sub.6
        H.sub.5 ; Pr for propyl, C.sub.3 H.sub.7 ; and Bu for butyl,
        C.sub.4 H.sub.9. In addition to the host and sensitizers shown
        in each of the following examples, Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 in mullite
        and Cr +3 may advantageously be used (absorption at 0.5 microns;
        emission centered at 0.6934 microns). As noted above, the
        mullite may conveniently be employed to physically support the
        host and sensitizer materials. The actual examples follow: </p>

      <p>FIG. 13 is a schematic showing of an apparatus for a
        continuously processing feed stock such as the materials
        disclosed in the foregoing examples, or steam, of course. In
        FIG. 13 the reaction chamber 402 is provided with upper and
        lower manifold chambers 404 and 406 which are separated from the
        main portion of the reaction chamber 402 by apertured plates 408
        and 410. Within the reaction chamber 402 are a large number of
        the ceramic tubes 412 such as those shown in FIG. 11. All of the
        space within chamber 402 apart from that occupied by the tubes
        354 is filled with a reactant such as manganese oxide or other
        reactants disclosed elsewhere in the present case and in my
        prior co-pending specification cited above. </p>
      <p>A heat or radiation exchanger including upper and lower
        manifold structures 414 and 416 as well as the interconnecting
        tubes or pipes 418 exposes the feed stock, which is applied
        through input tube 420 and brought out through tube 422, to the
        high temperatures and radiation present within the main reaction
        chamber 402. </p>
      <p>At the center of the apparatus shown in FIG. 13 is a burner 424
        to whch a lower inlet pipe 426 and an upper outlet pipe 428 are
        connected. This central burner unit may be of the type shown in
        FIG. 9 of the drawings and as described hereinabove. The entire
        reaction chamber 402 shown in FIG. 13 is fully insulated and
        mounted as shown in FIG. 9, and equipped with suitable automatic
        valving of the type described above in connection with other
        embodiments of the invention. </p>
      <p>In operation, steam is initially supplied to the reaction
        chamber 402 through inlet line 430 when valve 432 is opened. Of
        course prior to this initial step, the reaction chamber 402 has
        been preheated to a temperature in the order of 1000.degree.
        Kelvin, and the steam is supplied under high pressure. Hydrogen
        is then displaced by the action of the reactant, and the
        host/sensitizer materials included in tubes 412, as described
        above. Hydrogen H.sub.2 and hydrogen peroxide H.sub.2 O.sub.2
        are drawn off through the upper manifold 404 and the connecting
        line 434 through valve 436. During the hydrogen displacement
        phase of the cycle, additional oxygen may be supplied through
        line 438 via valve 440. The additional oxygen promotes the
        formation of hydrogen peroxide, which is, with the hydrogen,
        drawn off through line 434. </p>
      <p>The overall cycle of reaction chamber 402 may be substantially
        as indicated by one of the two plots shown in FIG. 7.
        Accordingly with the steam valve 432 and the valve 436 to the
        hydrogen storage tank both closed, the vacuum may be applied to
        the reaction chamber 402 so that disproportionation of the
        oxygen from the reactant takes place. </p>
      <p>While the hydrogen displacement at high pressure and the oxygen
        disproportionation phase of the cycle at low pressure is
        occurring in the main reaction chamber 402, the feed stock may
        be continuously passed throgh the heat and radiation exchanger
        414, 416, 418, at a suitable rate to maintain the desired high
        temperature and high level of radiation of the feedstock.
        Incidentally the tubes 418 interconnecting the upper chamber 414
        and the lower chamber 416 may be made of mullite including the
        host/sensitizer materials mentioned in the various examples
        given above. Similarly the manifolds 414 and 416 may be made of
        such materials. Alternatively the elements 414, 416, and 418,
        may be made of metal, such as stainless steel, to which suitable
        quantities of host/sensitizer materials have been added in order
        to give the desired intimate irradiation action with regard to
        the feed stock. </p>
      <p>Instead of using a single reaction chamber as shown in FIG. 13,
        a heat and irradiation exchange unit could be employed with a
        multiple reaction chamber apparatus such as that shown in FIG.
        9. When used with a multiple reaction chamber arrangement such
        as that shown in FIG. 9, of course the heat exchange elements
        must make sealing engagement with the walls of the individual
        reaction chambers which will be at different pressures during
        different portions of the individual staggered cycles in the
        different reaction chambers. </p>
      <p>It may be noted that, in accordance with disclosures in my
        prior co-pending patent application cited above, and teachings
        found elsewhere in the present specification, the hydrogen and
        H.sub.2 O.sub.2 "tailings", obtained as a vacuum is being drawn
        on line 438, and such output hydrogen and/or hydrogen peroxide
        from line 434 as may be desired, may be applied through line 426
        to the central burner 424. This may serve the purpose of
        supplying additional heat to the entire unit to permit more
        rapid flow of feed stock through lines 420 and 422 without loss
        of temperature in reaction chamber 402. </p>
      <p><b>ENERGY BALANCE</b> </p>
      <p>In my prior co-pending patent application an "Energy Balance"
        section was included. In the present specification, a portion of
        the prior analysis will be set forth, and a more thorough energy
        analysis involving the new material in this application will be
        included. </p>
      <p>In view of the fact that the apparatus of the present type and
        as disclosed in my prior application are exothermic on a net
        basis and also produces hydrogen or hydrogen peroxide which can
        be burned, there have been some suggestions that certain
        so-called Laws of Thermodynamics are being violated. This is of
        course not the case, as will be developed by the Energy Balance
        analysis set forth below. </p>
      <p>From an overall standpoint, the present system may be viewed as
        providing an energy balance and not violating any "Laws of
        Thermodynamics" as a result of the low energy content gaseous
        products which are released in the course of the process. These
        low energy gaseous products may include HO and HO.sub.2, which
        are less well known gaseous products. When these gaseous
        products are released into the atmosphere, it is believed that
        they absorb high frequency radiations, and eventually change
        state to become hydrogen gas, oxygen gas, water vapor, atomic
        hydrogen and atomic oxygen. In one sense, therefore, the present
        systems may be considered to utilize solar energy. </p>
      <p>The stoichiometric reactions set forth below represent one of
        several modes of operation which may obtain in implementations
        of the present invention. </p>
      <p>The foregoing equations may be analyzed from two different
        standpoints. Incidentally, it may be noted that the "2HO"
        designated (4) in the upper equation is actually evolved in the
        disproportionation phase. In addition, a portion of the hydrogen
        gas H.sub.2 from (6) in the upper equation is an input in the
        lower equation which combines with the disproportionated oxygen
        to form HO. Also, of course, the incident photons are applied in
        the atmosphere, and not in the apparatus per se. It should also
        be noted that the O.sub.2 input designated (2) is essentially
        optional and may involve the venturi unit 212 or inlet 217, of
        FIG. 6, whereby additional O.sub.2 is supplied to generate
        H.sub.2 O.sub.2, as noted above. ##STR1## </p>

        energy standpoint: </p>

      <p>From the foregoing analysis, it may be noted that the heat or
        enthalpy for the hydrogen generation portion of the cycle is
        equal to -28.76 K Cal/Mol-Eqn, which means that the reaction is
        exothermic. For the "Reverse Reaction" or the oxygen
        disproportionation part of the cycle, the heat or enthalpy
        figure is +6.40 K. Cal/Mol-Eqn. This means that the
        disproportionation part of the cycle is endothermic, but that
        the heat required is much less than that generated in the other
        portion of the cycle. With thoroughly insulated equipment the
        heat generated during the exothermic portion of the cycle, in
        the same or other adjacent reaction chambers, is more than
        sufficient to provide the heat needed during the
        disproportionation part of the cycle. It may also be noted that
        the positive entropy value for the "Reverse Reaction", or the
        disproportionation cycle, indicates that this reaction will go
        forward spontaneously. </p>
      <p><b>ENERGY BALANCE--SECOND MODE</b> </p>
      <p>Another pair of (1) Displacement of Hydrogen and (2)
        Disproportionation reactions appears below, together with a
        classical Gibbs Free Energy Analysis. Also included are the text
        citations for the entropy and enthalpy values used in the
        analysis. The following mode emphasizes the production of
        hydrogen peroxide, H.sub.2 O.sub.2, and carries over its use in
        the disproportionation part of the cycle. It may also be noted
        that the first mode and second mode presentations are not
        precisely comparable as H.sub.2 O.sub.(e) is assumed as an input
        for the first mode, and H.sub.2 O.sub.(g) is assumed as an input
        for the second mode as set forth below. As indicated by the
        negative value of the enthalpy for the two reactions of the
        second mode, it is also exothermic on an overall basis. </p>
      <p>The equations for (1) hydrogen displacement and (2) oxygen
        disproportionation, are set forth below, together with their
        associated Enthalpy (H), Entropy (S) and Gibbs Free Energy
        functions. </p>

      <p>From the negative value of -8Kcal/Mol-Eqn. of the enthalpy
        (heat) of the entire reaction, including both displacing
        hydrogen from water vapor and disproportionating oxygen from the
        reactant, it is clear that the process is exothermic, in
        addition to generating hydrogen and/or hydrogen peroxide. And
        this surprising result, in one or the other or a combination of
        the modes described in the foregoing equations has been
        confirmed by the operation of prototypes using manganese oxide
        as the reactant. </p>
      <p>Set forth below is a further analysis involving the photon
        dissociation of H.sub.2 O, and an examination of the energy
        "borrowed from nature" and "returned to nature", or to the
        environment. In connection with the following analyses, it may
        be noted that the energy for photon dissociation of the H.sub.2
        O is obtained from the heat reservoir of hot reactant which is
        of course maintained at an elevated temperature by the net
        exothermic nature of the hydrogen displacement and oxygen
        disproportionation cycle. When mention is made of the combustion
        of H.sub.2 O.sub.2 in the following analysis, this combustion is
        in the course of performing useful work such as driving an
        engine, or the like, apart from the reaction chamber as

      <p>In closing, reference is again made to my copending patent
        application Ser. No 768,808, filed Feb. 15, 1977, in which more
        detail is presented relative to the temperatures, pressures, and
        other reactions which may be used. As noted in the prior
        specification, the temperature of operation should be above the
        dissociation temperature for oxygen for the reactant being
        employed at atmospheric pressure. Advantageous high speed
        results have been achieved with the reactant in the pyroplastic
        state of incipient fusion. Concerning pressures, the pressure
        during dissociation should be at least as low as atmospheric
        pressure, and preferably a vacuum should be applied to reduce
        the pressure to a fraction of atmospheric. The vacuum may be
        applied to draw the tailings through the burner to extract
        additional heat from the tailings. During the hydrogen
        displacement portion of the cycle the pressure should be well
        above atmospheric to facilitate sequestering of the oxygen by
        the reactant. Successful results may be achieved with reactants
        such as MnO with gauge pressures of about 100 to 130 or 150 and
        up to 500 pounds per square inch. Even higher pressures may be
        employed. Concerning the active reactant, as mentioned in my
        prior copending specification, it preferably includes at least
        one metal having a plurality of valence states. It should also
        have an oxide which will, when subjected to water vapor at
        elevated temperature and/or pressure, and preferably both,
        combine with the oxygen and displace the hydrogen in gaseous
        form exothermically. The reactant also preferably has the
        property of disproportionation or dissociation to release the
        combined oxygen when the temperature is raised or preferably
        when the pressure is reduced, and when the evolved oxygen is
        separated from the reactant. Advantageously, the heat required
        in the disproportionation part of the cycle is significantly
        less than that generated in the exothermic portion of the cycle
        when the reactant combines with the oxygen in the steam and
        releases hydrogen, so the entire cycle is exothermic. Also, the
        reactant should be susceptible of remaining in the pyroplastic
        state of incipient fusion during the change in state from one
        oxidation level to another, and back again, under the described
        conditions. </p>
      <p>Some of the metals and oxides thereof which fulfill the
        foregoing requirements include (1) antimony, (2) cesium, (3)
        barium, (4) iron, (5) manganese, (6) chromium, (7) iridium, (8)
        nickel, and (9) thallium. Other metals which have multiple
        valence states are known, but most of these have practical
        problems which preclude their use. Thus, for example, mercury
        has too low a melting point, and its oxides are unstable. In the
        case of other metals having multiple valence states, their
        oxides may be poisonous, they may be caustic or are not
        available in practical or commercially available quantities.
        Other metals having multiple valence states have oxides which
        will not readily disproportionate. Combinations of reactants
        satisfying the requirements indicated above may be employed in
        the form of alloys, eutetics, and with other materials to obtain
        desired temperature and mechanical properties. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 14 and 15 are particularly useful in analyzing the
        apparatus of the present invention from a radiation standpoint.
        FIG. 14 shows spectral radiant emittance, or power in watts
        radiated at various wavelengths from a "black body" having a
        temperature of 1000.degree. Kelvin, while FIG. 15 is a similar
        plot showing photon emission, or the number of photons emitted
        at various wavelengths. The FIG. 14 plot drops off more rapidly
        than that of FIG. 15 because shorter wavelength photons are more
        energetic and have higher power. In accordance with known
        principles, the energy is directly proportional to the frequency
        and inversely proportional to the wavelength. It may also be
        noted that, in the plots of FIGS. 14 and 15 the visible range is
        from about 0.4 to 0.7 microns. Accordingly for the temperature
        of 1000.degree. Kelvin (about 727.degree. Centigrade and about
        1341.degree. Fahrenheit), which is plotted in FIGS. 14 and 15,
        the radiation peaks in the spectrum at wavelengths somewhat
        longer and at frequencies slightly lower than the visible band.
      </p>
      <p>FIGS. 16, 17, and 18 show a system for applying radiant energy
        to a feedstock. In FIG. 17 the feedstock is applied to reaction
        chamber 302 by inlet tube 304 which is connected to manifold
        306. Manifold 306 is supported by insulating ceramic material
        308 which may either be in the form of a ring or a series of
        supporting blocks. </p>
      <p>The reaction chamber has an outer cylindrical stainless steel
        wall 310 secured to upper and lower stainless steel end plates
        312 and 314. The chamber 302 is provided with a cylindrical
        ceramic liner 316 and upper and lower inner ceramic end plates
        318 and 320. Suitable insulation 322 such as ceramic foam and an
        outer casing 324 are also provided. </p>
      <p>A series of coated wires 326 extend for most of the length of
        the chamber 302 between upper and lower electrically conducting
        support members 328 and 330. As shown in FIG. 16, the wires 326
        are made up of an inner wire 332 of conducting or resistive
        material and an outer coating 334 of ceramic material of
        radiation emitting material of one or more of the types
        previously described. </p>
      <p>The upper and lower wire supporting members 328 and 330 may be
        held apart by the elongated ceramic member, and the metal rod
        338 which extends into the lower hollow end of ceramic member
        336. The coated wires 326 are heated up by the application of
        electricity to power input conductors 340 and 342 to a
        temperature in the order of 1000.degree. Kelvin. This causes a
        certain amount of thermal expansion in the wires, and by using a
        suitable metal rod 338 which has a slightly higher coefficient
        of thermal expansion, the wires 326 may be maintained in
        operative positions relative to each other. </p>
      <p>In the case of a process involving steam as the feedstock and
        where it is desired to have hydrogen gas and H.sub.2 O.sub.2 as
        the output product, air may be supplied either through input
        tube or pipe 304 and/or through separate input 344 to the
        apertured ring shaped manifold 346 which is held in position by
        supports 348. Output product is drawn off through pipe 350. </p>
      <p>In practice, and as indicated in the block diagram of FIG. 18,
        air may be supplied to the reaction chamber 302 either through
        input 304 along with the input feedstock such as steam, or
        through input 344 at the upper zone of the reaction chamber.
        When the air is supplied through input 344, toward the upper end
        of 302, it combines with the previously-formed hydrogen,
        resulting from dissociation of the water vapor, to form H.sub.2
        O.sub.2. </p>
      <p>Other blocks shown in FIG. 18 include a source of electrical
        power 354, a supply of liquid water at 356, a steam formation
        unit 358, and a storage container 360 for fuel gas such as
        gaseous hydrogen H.sub.2 and hydrogen peroxide H.sub.2 O.sub.2.
        The supply line for water is indicated at 362, and that for air
        at line 364. </p>
      <p>As indicated by line 366, a portion of the fuel gas which is
        formed may be fed back to the steam formation unit 358 to
        increase the temperature of the water vapor being supplied to
        reaction chamber 302. After the unit is in operation for a short
        period of time, the steam is supplied to the reaction chamber
        302 at a temperature well above the intended operating
        temperature of reaction chamber 302 so that little or no
        electricity need be supplied from the source 354. Thus, for
        example, with steam being supplied at between 1100.degree. and
        1200.degree. Kelvin, the temperature of 1000.degree. Kelvin
        desired within the reaction chamber 302 may be sustained with
        the supply of very little or no electricity over line 368. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 20, the coated wires 326 are shown
        supported by a screen 370 which may be made of any suitable high
        temperature resistant conducting material. The wires 326 are
        woven in and out of the surface of the screen 370 to form the
        array as shown in FIG. 17. It may be noted that the frame or
        support members 328 and 330 of FIG. 17 are shown as being formed
        of two parts. These two parts are open frame members which clamp
        the screen 370 as shown in FIG. 20 and support it. If desired or
        if the conductivity of the particular coating employed in the
        system is relatively low, the coated wires 326 may be scraped
        bare and welded contacts made at points such as those indicated
        at 372 in FIG. 20 to make better conductive engagement with the
        screen 370 by which electricity is initially supplied to these
        wires. It is also noted that, instead of using the screen as
        shown in FIG. 20, the supporting structures 328 or 330 may be
        simple perforated plates with the coated wires 326 threaded
        through them. </p>
      <p>Now, considering one specific example, the wires 326 of FIG. 17
        may be coated with the host and sensitizer materials set forth
        in examples Nos. 1 and 2 of the 15 examples set forth
        hereinabove in the present specification. </p>
      <p>More specifically, before going into the example in detail, it
        may be noted that various units are used in the present
        specification in reference to the wavelength of the radiations
        which are employed. For reference purposes and for ease in
        converting various units, it may be noted that the visible range
        extends from about 4000 Angstrom units to 7000 Angstrom units,
        with an Angstrom unit being equal to 10.sup.-8 centimeters.
        Expressed in microns this visible range corresponds to
        wavelengths from 0.4 to 0.7 microns, with a micron being equal
        to 10.sup.-4 centimeters. Similarly, when millimicrons are
        employed to measure wavelength, they correspond to 10.sup.-7
        centimeters, and the visible spectrum range is from 400 to 700
        millimicrons. </p>
      <p>It may also be noted, in converting frequency to wavelength and
        vice versa that the frequency of light is equal to 3 times
        10.sup.10 cms. per sec. and that the product of frequency and
        wavelength is equal to the velocity of light. Accordingly, using
        this simple expression that the product of the frequency times
        the wavelength is equal to the velocity of light, easy
        conversion may be made from frequency to wavelength, and vice
        versa. For convenience, reference is also made to Table I which
        indicates the location of the visible light band relative to the
        infrared and ultraviolet frequency bands, in addition to the
        remainder of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum. </p>

      </p>
      <p>With the foregoing background, reference is again made to
        examples Nos. 1 and 2 of the 15 numbered examples set forth
        earlier in the present specification. It may be noted that the
        emission, for Example No. 1 was approximately 0.69 microns
        corresponding to a frequency of approximately
        4.34.times.10.sup.14 cycles per second. This corresponds to a
        red color in the visible spectrum. Example No. 2 provides a
        yellow output light with a wavelength of approximately 0.59
        microns corresponding to a frequency of approximately 5.08 times
        10.sup.14 cycles per second. Incidentally, another yellow line
        is produced by the materials of Example 12, with a wavelength of
        0.61 micron, corresponding roughly to 4.91 times 10.sup.14
        cycles per second. </p>
      <p>Referring back to FIG. 17, one-half of the wires extending from
        support 328 to support 330 are coated with material providing
        red output radiation such as specified in Example No. 1 referred
        to above, and one-half of the wires are coated with material
        providing a yellow output radiation. These wires are threaded
        through the supports 328 and 330 so as to be interspersed with
        one another so that the yellow and red output radiation wires
        are not grouped together but are entirely interspersed with one
        another. </p>
      <p>When feedstock is supplied to the reaction chamber 302, the
        radiation will be directed from the wires to the medium and the
        radiation of different frequencies will impinge upon the
        discontinuities provided by the feedstock vapors and will beat
        with one another and will be converted into sum and difference
        frequencies. More specifically, cnsidering examples Nos. 1 and
        2, the frequency for the red radiation of Example 1 was
        approximately 4.34 times 10.sup.14 cycles per secod, and the
        frequency for Example No. 2 was approximately 5.084 times
        10.sup.14 cycles per second. One frequency which will be formed
        as these radiations impinge on the feedstock will be the sum
        frequency equal to approximately 9.42 times 10.sup.14 cycles per
        second. This corresponds to a wavelength of about 0.32 microns,
        in the near ultraviolet frequency spectrum. Water vapor has a
        number of absorption peaks in the near ultraviolet frequency
        spectrum and these peaks are broadened by the elevated
        temperature present at 1000.degree. Kelvin at which the reaction
        chamber 302 is operated. Accordingly, in addition to the
        dissociation action produced by the direct radiation at the red
        and yellow frequency bands, the powerful ultraviolet radiations
        will have a strong dissociative effect on the water vapor being
        transmitted through the reaction chamber 302. Incidentally, the
        energetic nature of the radiations in the near ultraviolet may
        be noted from the far right-hand column in Table No. I in which
        the radiation in the near ultraviolet is shown to have an energy
        level in the order of double that in the red and yellow regions
        of the visible spectrum. </p>
      <p>Attention is also directed to the plot of FIG. 21 showing the
        absorption characteristic for hydrogen peroxide H.sub.2 O.sub.2
        which is being formed in the radiation chamber 302. More
        specifically, it may be seen that the absorption coefficient
        increases rapidly from the near ultraviolet range of 3000
        Angstroms, or about 0.3 microns, to the far ultraviolet range
        toward the left of FIG. 21. Accordingly, with near ultraviolet
        radiation being employed in the chamber of FIG. 17 (reaction
        chamber 302) to dissociate water vapor, it may be noted that the
        desired product gas H.sub.2 O.sub.2 will be little affected and
        will be essentially transparent to this near ultraviolet
        radiation and will thus remain in its H.sub.2 O.sub.2 chemical
        state, after it is formed, without adverse effect from the near
        ultraviolet radiation. </p>
      <p>FIG. 19 shows a alternative reaction chamber 376 which is
        divided into an upper section 378 and a lower section 380.
        Dividing these two sections of the chamber is a perforated
        ceramic plate 382. In addition, two different sets of coated
        wires 384 in the upper section and 386 in the lower section, are
        provided. These two sets of wires are electrically
        interconnected by the links 388 which extend through the ceramic
        plate 382 and join the lower support 390 for the upper set of
        wires 384 to the upper support 392 for the lower set of wires
        386. Apart from being divided into two chambers with two sets of
        different coated wires in the upper and lower portions 378 and
        380 of the reaction chamber 376, the chamber of FIG. 19 is
        generally similar in configuration to that of FIG. 17. </p>
      <p>With regard to the nature of the coatings on the wires 384 and
        386, the upper wires 384 are coated as described above in
        connection with FIG. 17 to produce ultraviolet radiation. </p>
      <p>The lower set of wires 386, however, are coated to provide
        strong output radiation in the infrared radiation spectrum, as
        disclosed hereinabove in connection with examples A, B, and C.
        Accordingly, the arrangement of FIG. 19 is organized to provide
        powerful radiation in portion 380 which will impinge vigorously
        on the feedstock and provide an initial very substantial
        dissociative effect on the water vapor. Then, in the upper
        portion 378 of the reaction chamber the dissociation of the
        water vapor is continued, but at a frequency in the near
        ultraviolet range which is clearly at a frequency spectrum with
        respect to the hydrogen peroxide, H.sub.2 O.sub.2, product gas
        which will not adversely affect or dissociate it. The combined
        effect of the two stage radiation chamber with different
        radiation frequencies being employed in each of the two
        chambers, is such as to maximize the production of the desired
        output gas. </p>
      <p>Of course, in connection with FIGS. 16 through 21, two specific
        examples of reaction chamber arrangements employing radiation to
        produce desired product gases have been set forth. It is to be
        understood that through the examination of the spectral
        absorption characteristics of the feedstocks and products, and
        by suitably providing radiation within the reaction chamber
        matched to the characteristics of the feedstock and the product,
        many other similar combinations may be developed by those
        skilled in the art. </p>
      <p>It is also particularly to be noted that through the use of
        coated wires, the amount of intial heat input required to raise
        the reaction chamber to operating temperature conditions, is
        greatly reduced. </p>
      <p>For completeness, one set of dimensions for the wires 326, 384
        and 386 will now be given. The overall diameter of the coated
        wires may be 0.00257 inch, and the diameter of the inner metal
        wire is 0.00157 inch with the coating being about 0.0005 inch
        thick, adding about one-thousandth of an inch to the diameter.
        The inner metal wires may, for example, be made of tungsten or
        other metal having a relatively high melting point and adequate
        strength at 1,000.degree. Kelvin. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 22 and 23 show an alternative arrangement for applying
        high frequency radiation to feedstock supplied to a reaction
        chamber. In FIG. 22 the reaction chamber per se is made up of
        two hemispheres 402 and 404 which are secured together by bolts
        406 which extend through the mating flanges 408 and 410 of the
        hemispheres 402 and 406. An outer sheet metal housing 412 is
        provided to enclose the unit and to support the various enclosed
        elements of the system. Thus, for example, the hemispheres 402
        and 404 are supported from brackets 414 secured to the housing
        412. Between the reaction chamber 402, 404 and the housing 412
        is suitable insulation for 416 of the ceramic foam insulation
        type. </p>
      <p>Feedstock is supplied to the reaction chamber 402, 404 through
        input pipe 418, and product gases are withdrawn from the
        reaction chamber through pipe 420. </p>
      <p>Input radiation is supplied to the reaction chamber 402, 404
        through the window 422 which may, for example, be made of high
        temperature resistant quartz glass. </p>
      <p>FIG. 23 is taken along line 23--23 of FIG. 22. Shown to
        advantage in FIG. 23 are the two lasers 424 and 426 which direct
        coherent radiation of different colors through the window 422
        into the reaction chamber 402, 404 which has a highly polished
        interior surface. One of the lasers 424, 426 is a ruby laser
        with output radiation in the red spectral region, while the
        other laser is an yttrium aluminum garnet, or Yag laser with
        output radiation in the green frequency band. These lasers are
        directed at an acute angle through the window 422 so that the
        radiation of the two lasers beat to produce a higher frequency
        in the ultraviolet spectrum, as discussed and developed
        hereinabove in connection with the radiation from the wires of
        FIGS. 17 and 19. Accordingly, the feedstock supplied to the
        reaction chamber through the pipe 418 will be irradiated not
        only with the red and green direct laser illumination, but also
        by the beat frequencies which arise when the red and green
        radiation impinge on the discontinuities provided by the
        feedstock materials supplied to the chamber. </p>
      <p>It may also be noted that in all of the embodiments described
        herein, where additional oxygen is supplied, and hydrogen
        peroxide, or H.sub.2 O.sub.2, is formed, this reaction is
        exothermic and supplies heat to the reaction chanmber. This
        factor is useful in increasing the efficiency of the processes,
        and contributes to the self-sustaining nature of the processes,
        as discussed above. </p>
      <p>On a general basis, the processes described herein provide a
        mechanism for the transformation of low grade thermal radiation
        into specific coupled modes of intense monochromatic radiation
        providing new higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths with
        considerably increased power. </p>
      <p>The energy change is accomplished through the creation of
        controlled spatial harmonics beating together while passing
        through media discontinuities within a non-linear medium. The
        effect is much like a parametric amplifier which controls the
        disposition of the electromagnetic energy conveyed by the waves.
        On a comprehensive basis, the transformation of the broad black
        body radiation into specific monochromatic frequencies of high
        energy which are matched to the absorption bands of the
        feedstock and to the transmission bands of the product, make for
        process efficiencies which are extremely high. </p>
      <p>With regard to the operating temperatures and pressures for the
        apparatus of FIGS. 16 through 19, and that of FIGS. 22 and 23,
        the temperatures and pressures are less critical than for the
        embodiments disclosed earlier in the present case. In general,
        in order to provide radiation in the desired spectral range the
        apparatus of FIGS. 16 through 19 should be operated at a
        temperature in the order of 1000.degree. Kelvin; however, other
        temperatures may be employed which produce adequate radiation at
        the desired frequencies, and a departure of 100.degree. or
        200.degree. above or below 1000.degree. K. would be operative,
        it is expected, with radiation drop off toward the lower end of
        this temperature range and possible materials failure problems
        toward the upper end of the range. Concerning the embodiment of
        FIGS. 22 and 23, a lower temperature such as 250.degree. F.,
        above the boiling point for water at the pressure which is
        employed, would be adequate. </p>
      <p>Concerning pressures, somewhat lower pressures are adequate, as
        compared with the embodiments involving the use of metallic
        oxides, and no change in pressure is needed. For the embodiments
        of FIGS. 22 and 23, a gauge pressure of 3 or 4 pounds would be
        adequate, although higher pressures of up to several hundred
        pounds, for example, could be employed where higher fuel gas
        reservoir pressures are desired. Similar pressure considerations
        are applicable to the apparatus of FIGS. 16 through 20. </p>
      <p>The apparatus of FIGS. 1 through 23, described hereinabove,
        were also described in the co-pending patent applications of
        which the present patent application is a continuation-in-part.
        New FIGS. 24 through 32 will now be described. </p>
      <p>FIG. 24 represents an alternative form of reaction chamber
        which may be employed in a system substantially conforming to
        FIG. 18 of the present drawings. More particularly, the reaction
        chamber 502 of FIG. 24 could be employed as the reaction chamber
        302 of FIG. 18. </p>
      <p>Referring more particularly to FIG. 24, it includes an outer
        cylindrical shell 504 which may, for example, have a stainless
        steel interior surface, and contains a substantial number of
        closely spaced mercury vapor lamps 506 having quartz envelopes.
        The mercury vapor discharge tubes 506 may, for example, be cold
        cathode tubes and have electrical terminals 508 at one end of
        the chamber, and 510, at the lower end of the reaction chamber
        502. The mercury vapor discharge tubes 506 may be supported by
        the upper and lower aluminum plates 512 and 514. </p>
      <p>Apertured transverse plates 516, 518 and 520 extend
        transversely across the reaction chamber 502, and plate 518 may
        serve much the same function as the transverse baffle 382 in
        FIG. 19. Feedstock is applied to reaction chamber 502 through
        inlet 522 at the bottom of the reaction chamber, and the output
        products from reaction chamber 502 are carried off through tube
        524. The space below baffle 516 serves as an input manifold,
        while that above baffle 520 serves as an output manifold. In
        accordance with the reaction which is to be undertaken, the
        radiation in the input portion of the reaction chamber 502,
        between baffle plates 516 and 518, may be of a somewhat
        different frequency of radiation, than that in the output
        irradiation portion of the reaction chamber 502 between baffle
        plates 518 and 520. The design factors going into the
        irradiation and to specific frequencies in the input and output
        sections of the reaction chamber were discussed hereinabove in
        connection with the embodiment of FIG. 19. Similar
        considerations, of course, apply here. </p>
      <p>The physical mounting arrangements and electrical connections
        for each mercury vapor tube may be provided as indicated in FIG.
        25. More particularly, as shown in FIG. 25, the mercury arc
        lamps 506 are provided with conducting terminals 508 which are
        silver soldered to the existing pins extending from the ends of
        commercially available mercury arc lamps. A thick silicone
        rubber sheet 526 is provided to support, cushion and locate the
        ends of the mercury arc lamps 506. In addition, the silicone
        rubber heavy wall tubes 528 enclose the electrical terminals 508
        and insulate them from the aluminum conducting end plate 512.
        The sheet 526 and tubes 528 may be either integral or separate,
        with the tubes ending even with the lower surface of plate 512.
      </p>
      <p>Helically wrapped around the outer cylindrical surface of the
        mercury arc tubes 506 are filaments 532 which are formed of
        laser-type material. The laser-type material included in the
        filaments 532 may be of the host and sensitizer type as
        discussed hereinabove, or they may be of ruby laser-type
        material, if desired. </p>
      <p>The mercury arc tubes 506 extend through clearance holes in the
        plates 516, 518 and 520. As indicated in FIG. 26, the plate 520
        is provided with holes 534 which are of slightly larger diameter
        than the outer diameter of the tubes 506. If desired, the tubes
        may be firmly supported as indicated in FIG. 25 at both ends of
        the reaction chamber and merely pass freely through the plates
        such as plate 520 of FIG. 26. Alternatively, each of the
        apertures in plate 520 may be grooved to receive a lamp
        retaining spring which will provide additional support and
        location to each of the mercury vapor lamps. These lamp
        retaining springs 536 are shown schematically in FIG. 26. </p>
      <p>The filaments 532 and 532' of FIGS. 27 and 28, respectively,
        may include a central metal filament 538 which may be of
        resistive material as disclosed hereinabove in connection with
        FIG. 16 of the drawings, or the filaments may be made up
        entirely of laser-type material, as indicated in FIG. 28. The
        central metal filaments 538 may be employed to ohmically heat
        the filaments to an elevated temperature to produce the desired
        output radiation as discussed above in connection with the
        embodiments of FIGS. 17 and 19, for example. Under these
        operating conditions, electricity would be applied both to the
        individual filaments to heat them to the proper temperature, and
        also across the terminals 508 and 510 of the mercury gas
        discharge tubes to appropriately energize them. </p>
      <p>The laser-type materials for use in the coating 540 of FIG. 27
        or as the entire filament in FIG. 28 may be of any of the
        host-sensitizer types as discussed hereinabove in connection
        with other embodiments of the invention. Alternatively, other
        known laser materials such as suitably doped aluminum oxide,
        used in the ruby laser, may be employed. Other known laser
        materials may also be used. </p>
      <p>To enhance laser action, the filaments 532 or 532' of FIGS. 27
        and 28, respectively, may be provided with one or more
        semi-transparent, or partially reflective layers 544 and 546
        (see FIG. 27), or 548 constituting an outer peripheral partially
        transparent metallic coating on the outer surface of filament
        532', in FIG. 28. The semi-transparent surfaces 544, 546, and
        548 may be made by depositing a thin layer of chromium or other
        good reflecting material on the filament 532 or 532' as they are
        being formed. The distance between substantially perpendicular
        surface areas of the semi-transparent layers 544 and 546, for
        example, along the line segment 550, should be an integral
        multiple of half wavelengths, in order to maximize lasing effect
        and to product essentially coherent output radiation. Similarly,
        the diametral distance 552 in FIG. 28 should be an integral
        number of half wavelengths at the desired output radiation
        frequency. </p>
      <p>Concerning the radiation within the reaction chamber, it is a
        function of the output radiation both of the mercury arc lamps
        506, and also the radiation produced by the filaments 532 and/or
        532'. With media discontinuities within the reaction chamber
        caused by the presence of feedstock within the reaction chamber,
        the different frequencies which are generated will "beat" with
        one another and produce sum and difference frequencies. Thus,
        for example, if ruby laser-type material is employed as the
        laser-type material as indicated by the reference numerals 540
        and 542 in FIGS. 27 and 28, respectively, the radiation
        wavelength is approximately 7.0.times.10.sup.3 Angstrom units.
        The output radiation from the mercury arc lamps includes a
        prominent spectral line at 2.537.times.10.sup.3 Angstrom units,
        and a very broad emissions band which peaks at about
        3.0.times.10.sup.4 Angstrom units. When these radiations impinge
        on the media discontinuities provided by water vapor feedstock,
        for example, the resultant sum frequency has a wavelength of
        approximately 1.752.times.10.sup.3 Angstrom units, in the
        ultraviolet frequency spectrum. This high frequency ultraviolet
        radiation is within the U. V. absorption band of water vapor as
        shown in FIG. 29 of the drawings. Accordingly, by way of
        example, this combination of frequencies may usefully be
        employed in the input section of the chamber of FIG. 24 between
        the baffles 516 and 518. This is particularly useful in this
        area in view of the high energy content of the
        1.7.times.10.sup.3 Angstrom unit ultraviolet radiation, and the
        low concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the input section of
        the reaction chamber. As noted in FIG. 21, H.sub.2 O.sub.2 has a
        relatively high absorption coefficient for 1.7.times.10.sup.3
        Angstrom radiation, and it is preferred that far ultraviolet
        radiation of this type not be used in the output section of the
        reaction chamber 502, between baffle plates 518 and 520, where
        high concentrations of H.sub.2 O.sub.2 are present, for most
        efficient use of the radiated energy. On the other hand, in this
        output region, it would be preferable to have irradiation of the
        water vapor at lower frequencies and longer wavelengths, to
        couple to selected water vapor absorption bands that are present
        at longer wavelengths as shown in FIG. 10 of the drawings,
        thereby avoiding absorption of the radiation by hydrogen
        peroxide. Suitable materials for producing such radiation are
        disclosed hereinabove in Examples (a) through (e) in the section
        of this specification entitled "Host/Sensitizers for Water Vapor
        Feedstock". Similarly, other design controlled radiation systems
        may be developed for both the input sections and the output
        sections of the reaction chamber 502 to smoothly facilitate the
        desired dissociation and recombination chemical reactions. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 30, 31, and 32 of the drawings show an important
        embodiment of the invention in which spheres are employed in
        proximity to the outer surface of the gas discharge tubes,
        instead of the filaments shown hereinabove. Specifically, as
        shown in FIG. 30, the outer surface of all of the quartz mercury
        vapor tubes 506 are provided with a large number of spheres 556.
        These spheres may be formed of any of the laser type materials,
        or the host-sensitizer materials discussed hereinabove, and they
        are preferably coated with a semitransparent metallic coating to
        facilitate the radiation of substantially coherent radiation.
        With regard to dimensions, the quartz tubes 506 may be in the
        order of 3/4 inch in diameter; the spheres 556 may be in the
        order of 0.002 to 0.004 inches in diameter, and the
        semireflecting coatings are preferably spaced apart along a
        diametral line by an integral number of half wavelengths at the
        output radiation frequency of the laser type material. The
        spheres 556 may be secured in proximity to the outer surface of
        the tubes 506 in any desired manner, preferably by the use of
        glass frit, fired when the spheres are firmly held against the
        quartz envelope by a suitable high temperature wrapping. The
        spheres may occupy in the order of 50% of the area of the tube,
        or a greater or lesser area depending on the scheduled relative
        radiation from the mercury vapor lamps and the laser spheres,
        which is desired for the reaction being undertaken. </p>
      <p>As more clearly shown in the diagram of FIG. 31, the reflective
        coating extends over most of the outer surface of sphere 556 but
        stops at line 558. With the reflective coating not present where
        sphere 556 engages the outer surface of gas discharge tube 506,
        the pumping radiation from the mercury gas discharge, indicated
        by rays 560, has easy access to the laser material within sphere
        556, by passing through the transparent glass frit 566. </p>
      <p>In the diagram of FIG. 31, the pumping radiation 560 serves to
        raise the atoms in the laser-type material to the excited state;
        and the rays 562 represent the coherent radiation characteristic
        of laser materials, which is generated as atoms drop from the
        excited state to lower energy levels triggered by arriving
        radiation from other transitions within the sphere. The
        reflecting coating on the outer surface of sphere 556 is
        preferably in the order of 70% to 90% reflecting and only 30% to
        10% transmissive in order to enhance the generation of harmonic
        radiation. Accordingly, the output radiation as indicated by the
        rays 564 may have a significant energy content which is at a
        frequency which is a multiple of the basic output frequency of
        the laser material in sphere 556. </p>
      <p>For example, with the ruby laser having a fundamental radiation
        wavelength of just under 7,000 Angstrom units, the fourth
        harmonic would have a wavelength of about 1,750 Angstrom units,
        in the far ultraviolet. </p>
      <p>Incidentally, as shown in FIG. 31, the transparent glass frit
        566 is shown securing the spheres 556 onto the quartz envelopes
        506. With suitably transmissive material being selected for the
        frit 566, and with the semi-reflective coating stopping at line
        558, the mercury vapor radiation from within the discharge tubes
        readily passes into the spheres 556. </p>
      <p>In the diagram of FIG. 32 the quartz envelope 506 separates the
        gas discharge region 572 from the reaction chamber region 574.
        In the gas discharge region 572, electrons 576 are shown moving
        at high velocities downward, and the heavy ionized mercury
        molecules 578 are drifting upwardly. Collisions cause the
        radiation of energy from the mercury vapor, and the complex
        atomic structure of mercury produces radiation at a large number
        of spectral lines. The resultant radiation is shown
        schematically at 582, 584, and 586. </p>
      <p>Within the reaction chamber region 574 are shown water vapor
        molecules 592, oxygen molecules 594 and hydrogen molecules 596,
        with the showings being in the form of circles of progressively
        reduced size. It is also interesting to note that some of the
        radiation from the ionized mercury vapor provides pumping energy
        to spheres 556, and some of the radiation passes directly into
        the radiation chamber region 574. </p>
      <p><b>CHAIN REACTIONS</b> </p>
      <p>The apparatus of the present invention are particularly well
        suited for the implementation of chain reactions. This is
        particularly true of the reaction chambers shown in FIGS. 19 and
        24, in which different frequencies of radiation may be applied
        to incoming feedstocks as compared with feedstocks during the
        subsequent portion of the chain reactions. </p>
      <p>In considering the mechanisms involved in photochemical
        kinetics, it is important to recognize that most complete
        photochemical reactions may be divided into three somewhat
        overlapping stages: (1) The initial act of absorption of radiant
        energy, (2) the primary process, and (3) secondary reactions. </p>
      <p>Background texts relating to this subject matter include
        "Photochemistry of Gases", by William Albert Noyes, Jr. and
        Philip Albert Leighton, published in 1941 by Rheinhold
        Publishing Company; "Combustion, Flames and Explosions of
        Gases", published by Academic Press, Inc., 1961, by Lewis and
        Von Elbe; and "Photochemistry", by Calvert and Pitts, published
        by Wiley, in 1966. </p>
      <p>One form of chain reaction which is diagramed below involves
        the absorption by molecule A by radiation such as light, and its
        dissociation into identical fragments. The secondary reactions
        involve a chain which may be stopped at low pressures by the
        removal of the carriers at the walls, and at high pressures by a
        homogeneous recombination involving a third body or reactant.
        The overall reaction produced by the chain is A+B.fwdarw.2C.
        Various examples are to be found among "halogenation" and
        "hydrogen-oxygen" reactions. The mechanism is as follows: </p>

      </p>
      <p>Concerning radiated energy effects, when a molecule or a
        polyatomic ion is irradiated by electromagnetic energy of a
        wavelength appropriate to couple with the molecule or ion, this
        radiation may be absorbed, and the energy of the molecule or
        polyatomic ion may be increased; the molecule or ion may be
        excited rotationally, vibrationally, or electronically, or one
        or more of the covalent bonds that hold the molecule together
        may be broken. This bond-breaking gives rise to the formation of
        atoms, or groups of atoms, which have one "unpaired" electron
        each and are called "free radicals". </p>
      <p>Accordingly, the absorption of radiated energy by a molecule
        may cause it to decompose into fragments or free radicals, which
        are extremely more reactive than the original molecule. When
        this is the case, the sequence of reaction steps leading to the
        final products involves these free radicals (even though they
        may exist only temporarily in the reaction mechanism), rather
        than the original molecules of the reactant. </p>
      <p><b>CHAIN REACTION EXAMPLE NO. 1</b> </p>
      <p>The first example of chain reactions which we will consider
        involves the reaction of hydrogen gas H.sub.2 with Chlorine gas
        Cl.sub.2 to form HCL gas. When a Cl.sub.2 molecule absorbs
        radiated energy it passes to a higher energy or an excited
        state, and if the energy of this excited state is sufficiently
        high, the bond of the Cl.sub.2 molecule may be broken to form
        two Cl atoms. In this connection it may be noted that in order
        to dissociate a Cl.sub.2 molecule into its two atoms, a
        relatively large quantity of energy, in the order of 58.16
        kilocalories per mole of Cl.sub.2 gas must be supplied. The
        decomposition of Cl.sub.2 molecules by absorption of radiated
        energy is illustrated by the following equations, which also
        involve the presence of hydrogen gas: </p>
      <p>______________________________________ (1) ##STR15## (.DELTA.H
        = +58.16) (2) ##STR16## (.DELTA.H = +7.02) (3) ##STR17##
        (.DELTA.H = -51.14) ______________________________________
        .circle..DELTA.H +7.02 + (-51.14) = -44.12 KCAL </p>
      <p>The chain reaction is eventually broken when a Cl atom collides
        with another Cl atom, perhaps absorbed on the wall of the
        reaction chamber, to reform a Cl.sub.2 molecule. The chain
        reaction may also be interrupted when a Cl atom reacts with some
        impurity present in the system to form a product which no longer
        contributes to maintaining the chain reaction. </p>
      <p><b>CHAIN REACTION EXAMPLE NO. 2</b> </p>
      <p>This second chain reaction example involves the reaction of
        methane CH.sub.4 with Chlorine Cl.sub.2 to form methyl chloride,
        CH.sub.3 Cl, and hydrogen chloride HCl. </p>
      <p>The primary reaction is as follows: ##STR18## </p>
      <p>The chain initiation step involves the absorption of radiated
        energy by the Cl.sub.2 molecule to break the bond as in the
        previous example: ##STR19## </p>
      <p>Various chain propagation steps now follow. First, a Cl atom of
        high kinetic energy comes in contact with a CH.sub.4 molecule, a
        carbon-hydrogen bond is broken, while a hydrogen-chlorine bond
        is formed. By losing an H atom, the CH.sub.4 molecule becomes a
        CH.sub.3 radical: ##STR20## </p>
      <p>Now, a methyl radical CH.sub.3 comes in contact with a Cl.sub.2
        molecule; a chlorine-chlorine bond is broken, while a
        carbon-chlorine bond is formed. The products are a methyl
        chloride molecule and a chlorine atom: ##STR21## </p>
      <p>The two chain propagation steps 2 and 3 are repeated many times
        before the chain reaction is broken by adverse reactions or one
        of several chain terminating reactions of the type mentioned
        hereinabove. </p>
      <p>The uniformity of radiation extending throughout the reaction
        chambers as disclosed in the present patent application is
        particularly advantageous in reactions such as the formation of
        methyl chloride CH.sub.3 Cl. This advantage arises particularly
        from the fact that the substitution of chlorine atoms can
        proceed further, forming the di-, tri-, and finally the
        tetra-chlorocompound, CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2, CHCl.sub.3, and
        CCl.sub.4. </p>
      <p>It is understood that an H atom of CH.sub.3 Cl is more readily
        substituted, or replaced by a Cl atom than is an H atom of
        methane, CH.sub.4. Also, an H atom of CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 is more
        susceptible to further substitution by a Cl atom than an H atom
        of CH.sub.3 Cl.sub.2, and similarly for CHCl.sub.3. In the
        present case, the C--H bond becomes more readily susceptible to
        substitution by a Cl--Cl bond as the number of Cl atoms already
        attached to the C atom increases. In terms of energetics, the
        compound CH.sub.3 Cl is thermodynamically stable with respect to
        a mixture of CH.sub.4 and Cl.sub.2, but the di-, tri-, and
        tetra- substituted compounds, CH.sub.2 and Cl.sub.2, CHCl.sub.3,
        and CCl.sub.4, are even more stable, their stability increasing
        with the number of Cl atoms in the molecule. </p>
      <p>If a reaction chamber were irradiated unevenly, with certain
        localized areas of very intense radiation, and others where
        there was little irradiation, then the reaction would proceed to
        the (undesired) final product CCl.sub.4. However, in the present
        case, by using reaction chambers which are very uniformly
        flooded with radiation, the bulk of the methane is only subject
        to a single substitution of the activated chlorine atom Cl, and
        it occurs very soon after these highly activated chlorine atoms
        are formed by the impact of radiation on the chlorine gas
        Cl.sub.2. In addition, a substantial excess of CH.sub.4 is
        provided. Therefore, under these conditions, CH.sub.3 Cl is the
        principal product of the chlorination of methane, although the
        more substituted products may also be formed in much smaller
        yields. In accordance with the teachings of the present
        invention, and the apparatus disclosed therein, precise amounts
        of energy of the proper energy level are delivered evenly
        throughout the reaction chamber, with the photons bombarding the
        target molecules, atoms or fragments of molecules from all
        directions simultaneously. In addition, as mentioned above,
        large amounts of intense energy of controlled wavelengths
        coupled to absorption bands of specific molecules or atoms is
        provided. This eliminates the steric factor, which is a normally
        expected problem. </p>
      <p><b>PHOTOCHEMISTRY OF WATER VAPOR</b> </p>
      <p>The absorption spectrum of water vapor in the ultraviolet
        region is shown in FIG. 29. As compared with FIG. 10, it may be
        noted that FIG. 29 is directed to a band which starts just below
        2,000 angstrom units. This would correspond to 0.2 microns. As
        mentioned hereinabove, the visible spectrum ranges from about
        4,000 to about 7,000 angstroms, which is equal to 0.4 to 0.7
        microns. Accordingly, the plot of FIG. 29 is in the ultraviolet,
        well below the visible spectrum, and the plot of FIG. 10 is in
        the infrared, above the visible spectrum. In comparing FIGS. 10
        and 29 it may also be noted that in FIG. 29 peaks of absorption
        extend upwardly, whereas in FIG. 10 peaks of transmittance are
        plotted upwardly, and peaks for absorption extend down toward
        zero on the vertical scale. </p>
      <p>There is considerable evidence that the photolysis of water at
        all wavelength regions leads to hydrogen and OH radicals. The
        following primary reactions are probably significant: ##STR22##
      </p>
      <p>These reactions become possible energetically at wavelengths
        less than 2,420 angstrom and are probably the major reactions in
        the longer wavelength absorption bands of ultraviolet radiation.
        At wavelengths less than 1,356 A.degree. units, another reaction
        leading directly to the obtaining of excited individual oxygen
        atoms, is understood to predominate. </p>
      <p>As the dissociation/formation processes proceed in our
        examples, the cleavage or fragmenting of the H.sub.2 O, O.sub.2,
        or H.sub.2 molecules yield H--OH, O--H, HO--OH, HO.sub.2 --H,
        H--O.sub.2, HO--O, H--H, and O--O products. Among these are very
        "hot" radicals, fragments, or atoms, because as described
        earlier, the greater part of the surplus energy that is absorbed
        is carried away by the latter fragments or atoms. Although in
        the case of an oxygen or hydrogen molecule, where scission of
        either of these molecules results in an equivalent weight
        distribution, actually, either or both atoms may become hot
        atoms, especially under constant bombardment. Then, each single
        atom or fragment, or radical, is capable of initiating a chain
        and/or a branching chain reaction, by destroying a normal
        H.sub.2 O, H.sub.2, or O.sub.2, and H.sub.2 O.sub.2 molecule. </p>
      <p><b>CHAIN REACTION EXAMPLE NO. 3</b> </p>
      <p>In this and the next example, chain reactions involving water
        vapor and oxygen will be considered: ##STR23## </p>
      <p>The foregoing chain reaction number 3 will now be analyzed from
        a Gibbs free energy standpoint, with the numbers in the
        following analysis corresponding to the equations set forth
        above. ##STR24## </p>

        of water vapor and oxygen when high intensity and high frequency
        radiant energy is applied to it. </p>

      <p><b>CHAIN REACTION EXAMPLE NO. 5</b> </p>
      <p>When water vapor alone, or when air including oxygen, and water
        vapor, are supplied to one of the reaction chambers, chain
        reactions occur which involve only the water vapor. The
        following example will consider such a chain reaction. In actual
        practice the reactions may follow a large number of branching
        patters, but it has been determined that the example set forth
        below includes the principal reaction mechanisms which occur. </p>
      <p>Initially, the activation energies of the bonds of interest
        will be tabulated: </p>

      </p>
      <p>The activation energy will amount of .about.5.5 percent minimum
        of the bond energy of the bond to be broken. Then, for the
        reaction A+BC.revreaction.AB+C, if the reaction is exothermic
        from left to right, the activation energy estimated by the
        semiempirical method will be .about.5.5 percent of the molecule
        BC. The activation energy of the reverse endothermic step will
        be this amount, plus the heat of the reaction. For our purposes,
        we used the figure of 0.06 (6.0) percent for our calculations.

      <p>In summary, the apparatus described hereinabove may clearly be
        designed to provide the staged and compartmentalized irradiation
        of reactions to obtain conditions which are favorable to the
        reaction mechanisms of interest. Different radiation frequencies
        may be employed at the input feedstock area and at the output
        feedstock area to enhance the desired reaction. Certain selected
        reactions have been considered in some detail. Other reactions
        involving breaking molecular bonds and substituting new elements
        or radicals may be implemented by the same type of technique
        used in the apparatus as disclosed herein or similar apparatus.
        Typical products which may be input feedstocks include methane,
        ethane, propane, isobutane, N-pentane, isopentane, neopentane,
        and the alkyl amines. The apparatus as described in the present
        application are also particularly suited to hydrogenation and
        olefin formation, the dehydration of alcohols, addition
        reactions of olefins, and to reactions involving polysubstituted
        saturated hydrocarbons, benzene, unsaturated hydrocarbons
        including the alkyne series, alcohols, carboxylic acids,
        aldehydes, and ketones. </p>
      <p>For completeness, certain matters relating to the gas discharge
        tubes and certain laser-type materials which may be used will
        now be reviewed. Initially, as mentioned above, the gas
        discharge tubes are preferably made of quartz and are mercury
        gas discharge lamps. One typical lamp available from
        Westinghouse is rated by the manufacturer at 39.0 watts, 0.420
        amperes, for 115 volts A.C. operation. The emitted ultraviolet
        radiations are rated by the manufacturer at 38.5 percent of
        input power, or at about 15+watts. Quartz, depending on its
        quality will transmit ultraviolet radiations with a cut-off of
        between 1000 Angstrom units and 2,000 Angstrom units. </p>
      <p>The lines in the ultraviolet emission spectrum of mercury are
        set forth below, with particularly strong lines appearing at
        2536 A.degree. and at 1849 A.degree.. </p>

      <p>Four known laser type materials which may be used are as
        follows: </p>
      <p>1. Aluminum Oxide (Al.sub.2 O.sub.3) doped with chromium
        (Cr.sup.3+), requiring input pumping radiation of from 0.32 to
        0.42 microns, or from 3200 A.degree. to 4200 A.degree., and
        having a fundamental output wavelength of 6934 A.degree.. </p>
      <p>2. Yttrium Oxide (Y.sub.2 O.sub.3) doped with europium
        (Eu.sup.3+), requiring input pumping radiation of from 2000
        A.degree. to 2800 A.degree., and having an output wavelength of
        6113 A.degree.. </p>
      <p>3. Calcium Tungstate (CaWO.sub.4) doped with erbium (Er.sup.3+)
        requiring input pumping radiation between 2000 A.degree. and
        2800 A.degree. and having a fundamental output wavelength of
        16,120 A.degree.. </p>
      <p>4. Aluminum Oxide (Al.sub.5 O.sub.12) doped with erbium
        (Er.sup.3+) requiring input pumping radiation of between 3200
        A.degree. and 4200 A.degree., and having a fundamental output
        wavelength of 16,602 A.degree.. </p>
      <p>Considering Example No. 1 and Example No. 2, it is clear that
        mercury vapor spectral lines from 1942 A.degree. through 2803.5
        A.degree. are available to supply pumping radiation for Example
        No. 2; and that mercury lines 3125.6 through 4046.6 are
        available for pumping Example No. 1. </p>
      <p>Concerning another point, the use of the spheres of laser type
        material mounted on the quartz envelope of the mercury vapor
        tube has been noted. As discussed in detail, the mercury vapor
        discharge provides the radiant energy to pump the laser type
        material to the desired excited state to initiate coherent
        radiation. Instead of the mercury vapor discharge, the pumping
        energy for the laser-type material spheres may be provided from
        heated filaments coated with mullite suitably doped to provide
        the desired pumping frequency. The filaments could be of the
        configuration disclosed in FIG. 16, coated with an outer
        transparent sealing coating, to which the spheres could be
        secured as shown in FIG. 30, for example. Suitable variation in
        operating conditions could then be obtained by varying the power
        applied to the filaments, and their resultant temperature, and
        output radiation. </p>
      <p>In closing, it is to be understood that the principles set
        forth in the foregoing description may be implemented by a
        number of different apparatus, with the constructions and
        materials specified herein only being exemplary of the types of
        apparatus and materials which may be employed. Reaction chambers
        of different configurations, and different laser type materials,
        as well as different feedstocks and products could be employed.
