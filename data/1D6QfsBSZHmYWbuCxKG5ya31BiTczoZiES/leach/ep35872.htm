      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>An electric arc plasma steam generator
        includes a pair of electrodes (12,14) for generating the arc
        plasma, and a housing for enclosing the arc plasma. Jets of
        water are directed into the arc plasma to convert the water into
        steam and to ionize the hydrogen and oxygen components of the
        steam. Arrangements including coils (56) and water jackets
        (48,50) are provided for circulating water in proximity to the
        arc plasma and for super-heating the water contained in the
        water jacket and/or the coils, which are preferably mounted
        within the housing. An expansion chamber (44) is connected to
        receive both the super-heated water, and also the superheated
        steam from the arc plasma, as the hydrogen and oxygen recombine
        to form steam once again. The arc plasma in one embodiment may
        be formed by electrical conduction through a spray of water
        containing an electrolyte; and in another embodiment electrodes
        may initially form the arc plasma in air or other gas, and as
        the electrodes are consumed, they may be advanced by a suitable
        mechanical arrangements including threads on the electrodes,
        keyway slots on the electrodes, and stepping motors which serves
        to advance the electrodes as needed. </p>
      <p>This invention relates to steam generation. </p>
      <p>Steam generation is normally accomplished using boilers and
        heat transfer tubes with the heat supplied wither within or
        outside of the tubes, and water to be heated on the other side
        of the walls of the tubes. </p>
      <p>Steam generation boilers are relatively inefficient, and a
        principal object of the present invention is to provide a
        simpler, more efficient system and method for generating steam.
      </p>
      <p>In accordance with a broad aspect of the present invention,
        steam is generated by the injection of water, preferably jets of
        water, into an electric arc plasma. </p>
      <p>The gas plasma may be formed by ionizing a water spray
        containing an electrolyte to increase the conductivity of the
        water. A substantial electrical potential may be employed to
        initiate ionization and to maintain the resultant gas plasma in
        its ionized state. Water jets may be directed into the plasma
        arc, thereby reducing the arc temperature, vaporizing the water,
        and ionizing the hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The practically
        cooled plasma may be directed adjacent heat exchange
        arrangements, such as soils, through which water is directed,
        and this water is rapidly superheated. The superheated water can
        then be directed to an expansion chamber where the superheated
        water expands and becomes steam. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another embodiment of the invention the arc
        plasma ay be established between two metallic electrodes, and
        the water jets may be directed into the arc plasma. The
        electrodes may be very slowly consumable and may be mechanically
        advanced to maintain the desired arc spacing. </p>
      <p>As mentioned above, the arc plasma, following some reduction in
        temperature from the impinging water jets, may come into heat
        transferring proximity to one or more coils of metal tubing
        carrying water, and the channel carrying the plasma arc and
        ionized gases may be enclosed by a water jacket. The flow of
        water through the jets and through the coils of metal tubing and
        the water jacket or jackets, are at a rate so that the plasma
        has cooled to become steam at the remote end of the channel. </p>
      <p>With regard to the embodiment of the invention using water
        containing electrolyte to form the gas plasma arc, the system
        may include a tank containing a saturated solution of
        electrolyte in water, and arrangements for diluting the
        electrolyte solution before spraying it into the active unit,
        and a sump for collecting electrolyte which has not been
        converted into steam, and for recirculating the electrolyte into
        the spray to the arc plasma generator. </p>
      <p>As another facet of the invention, additional energy may be
        supplied to the steam generation process by the oxidation of
        electrode material, or of material which may be added in
        suspension to the injected water. </p>
      <p>It is further noted that the electrodes may be advanced by a
        mechanism including an elongated electrode which is threaded and
        provided with an external slot or keyway. The electrode may be
        either threaded internally and may be rotated by a stepping
        motor coupled to a gear engaging the keyway; or alternatively,
        the electrode may be externally threaded, and held against
        rotation by the keyway while it is advanced by a gear member
        threaded internally to mate with the external electrode threads,
        with the gear member having external spur gear teeth which are
        driven by a stepping motor provided with a drive gear. </p>
      <p>Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will
        become apparent for a consideration of the following detailed
        description, and from the accompanying drawings. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Referring more particularly to the drawings, the system of
        Figure 1 is an electric arc plasma generation system wherein the
        high voltage electrodes 12 and 14 may be mounted approximately
        48 inches apart, and may provide an energizing voltage in the
        order of approximately 2500 volts. A spray of a very dilute
        solution of water and an electrolyte such as sodium sulfate is
        supplied from the ceramic member 16 which has a large number of
        very small diameter holes extending through it from top to
        bottom. A saturated solution of the sodium sulfate may be
        maintained in the tank 18, and is supplied through the pipe 20
        by the input electrolyte pump 22. The concentrated electrolyte
        is brought into the section 24 of the input compartment above
        the spray member 16. Water to dilute the concentrated
        electrolyte is brought into the chamber 26 in this upper
        compartment, and is mixed with the concentrated electrolyte.
        Accordingly, by the time the electrolyte reaches the chamber 34
        immediately above the spray member 16,it is at a relatively
        dilute concentration desired for spraying into the chamber 36
        where the arc plasma will be formed. </p>
      <p>Once the arc plasma is formed, the sprayed water will be
        converted to steam, and the steam will have its components
        ionized so that the electric arc plasma will include the normal
        air present in the chamber, and hydrogen and oxygen ions from
        water and steam. The very high temperature ionized gases will
        then flow through the opening 38 into the chamber 40, as a
        result of the presence of the output pipe 42, coupling chamber
        40 with the steam expansion chamber 44 which appears to the
        right in this Figure 1 of the drawings. The arc plasma which is
        formed raises the temperature of the gas to a very high level,
        in the order of 50,000 to 100,000 degrees F, and these very high
        temperature ionized gases will be directed vigorously through
        the opening 38 down the center of the chamber 40. </p>
      <p>Water jets are then directed through the nozzle 46 into the
        center of the plasma. This will have the effect of
        instantaneously converting the input jets of water into steam,
        and in many cases into ionized gas particles, and also will have
        the collateral effect of cooling down the plasma as it passes
        from left to right through the chamber 40. it may be also noted
        that the chambers 36 and 40 are provided with water jackets, 48
        and 50, respectively through which water flows and is heated.
        Following flow through the water jackets 48 and 50, water is
        directed by the metal pipe or tubing 52 to the front turn 54 of
        the coil 56, serving the function of further cooling the ions
        and steam present in the chamber 40 and flowing from left to
        right therein. By the time the water flowing in coil 56 reaches
        the output of pipe 58 coupling it to the steam expansion chamber
        44, it is at a very high temperature, in the order of a few
        thousand degrees Farenheit. Accordingly, when the superheated
        water from pipe 58 is permitted to enter the expansion chamber
        44, it immediately turns to steam. </p>
      <p>Concerning other points relative to the system of Figure 1, it
        may be noted that the cold water or ambient temperature water is
        supplied to the system at input of pipes 62 and 64. it may also
        be noted that the pipes 66 and 68 supply water to jets which
        spray in toward the center of the chamber 40 from the near side
        thereof, and similar jets are provided on the rear of the
        chamber 40, so that water is sprayed into the chamber from at
        least 8 points, as shown in Figure 1, and a larger number of
        input radially directed jets may be employed if desired. </p>
      <p>Concerning another point, a sump 70 is provided below the
        electrode 14, with the pump 72 returning the reclaimed
        electrolyte to the tank 18 including the saturated solution of
        electrolyte. </p>
      <p>A conventional mechanical base 74 and supporting the framework
        76 is provided for the unit; and a thick layer of high
        temperature insulation 78 encloses the entire apparatus, to
        reduce thermal losses, due to the very high temperatures which
        are present within the unit. Steam from the expansion chamber 44
        is supplied through the large diameter steam delivery channel 82
        to power turbines or the like. Steam pressure gauges 83 measure
        the pressure in chamber 44. Insulation material 85 is provided
        around the expansion chamber 44 and conduit 82, to reduce heat
        losses. </p>
      <p>In the foregoing description of Figure 1, the system was
        described wherein the arc is initiated between two electrodes
        with a spray of water containing a dilute solution of an
        electrolyte being directed between the two electrodes. Ion the
        embodiment of Figure 2 a different configuration of electrodes
        is employed, in which a plasma arc is initiated in air or gas
        between metallic electrodes, and arrangements are provided for
        advancing the electrodes, as they are consumed or erode. </p>
      <p>Referring now to Figure 2, it includes the two electrodes 102
        and 104 between which an electric arc plasma is established, by
        the application of high voltage on the input conductors 106 and
        108. The arc between the electrodes 102 and 104 may initially be
        started as a result of the breakdown of air or gas being
        supplied through a conduit 114. Once the electric arc plasma is
        initiated between the electrodes 102 and 104, jets of water are
        sprayed into the volume 112, from a series of jet spray orifices
        116 which are supplied from the input cold or ambient water pipe
        118. The input jets of water from the orifices 116 provide the
        water which is immediately converted to steam and then to
        ionized gas, principally oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons, within
        the chamber 112. From an overall standpoint, the system is
        comparable to the system of Figure 1, in that various heat
        exchangers are provided to transfer the heat from the electric
        arc plasma to water from enclosing water jackets and from coils
        upon which the ionized gases impinge. Finally, the superheated
        water is coupled to an expansion chamber (not shown) though the
        output pipe or tubing 122, while the steam from the main chamber
        is routed to the expansion chamber through the output conduit
        124. The foregoing arrangements provide a vigorous left to right
        flow of the ionized gases from the electric arc plasma
        generation zone 112. </p>
      <p>Now, considering the water flow in greater detail, it starts
        from the input pipe or conduit 118 and flows to the water jacket
        128 which surrounds the main plasma arc chamber 112, and directs
        water to each of the jet orifices 116 which open from the water
        jacket 128. From the water jacket 128, the cooling water is
        coupled at point 136 to one end of the coil 138. From the end of
        the coil 138 at point 140, the water flows into an inner water
        jacket 142, and is coupled by the fitting 144 to conduit 146
        which directs the ater to water jacket 148 toward the output end
        of the system of Figure 2. The tapered or conical coil 150
        receives water from the water jacket 148 by the short curved
        section of tubing 152 leading through the axis of the coil to
        the front end of the tapered coil 150. The output from the
        right-hand end of coil 150 is coupled to the output tube 122
        leading to the expansion chamber of the type shown in Figure 1.
        Radially extending, tapered support vanes 154 support the
        conical tapered coil 150 in its desired axial position, while
        permitting free passage of the gases from the arc discharge, now
        at least principally converted back to superheated steam. These
        vanes 154 may be made of machineable ceramic material as noted
        below. </p>
      <p>Figure 3 is an enlarged diagrammatic showing of the critical
        electric arc plasma generation zone 112 of the system of figure
        2. The nozzles 116 by which jets of water are sprayed into the
        electric arc plasma zone from four directions, are also clearly
        shown in Figure 3 of the drawing. In the embodiments as shown in
        Figure 3 of the drawings, the exterior surfaces of the
        electrodes 102 and 104 are threaded, and are also provided with
        a slot for preventing their rotation. In operation, referring to
        electrode 104, a stepping motor 122 rotates the spur gear 124
        which in turn rotates the mating spur gear 126 which has
        internal threads in the inner collar 128 which mesh with the
        exterior threads 130 on the electrode 104. The stationary block
        132 has an inwardly extending rib which extends into a
        longitudinally extending recess (not shown) on the electrode
        104, to prevent the rotation of electrode 104, and to constrain
        the movement of electrode 104, and to constrain the movement of
        electrode 104 to the linear, axial direction, as the motor 122
        is actuated and the gear assembly 126 is rotated. In a similar
        manner, actuation of the motor 136 associated with the electrode
        102 causes the axial forward movement of electrode 102 to
        compensate for erosion which occurs at the outer end thereof. </p>
      <p>Incidentally, when the electrode is formed of iron or an alloy
        containing substantial quantities of iron, the particles of iron
        which are oxidized provide additional energy to the system,
        conforming to the exothermic reaction whereby iron becomes iron
        oxide. </p>
      <p>Figure 4 shows an alternative arrangement for advancing the
        electrodes in which the electrode 142 has internal threads 144
        which mat with the external threads on a fixed threaded member
        146 which does not rotate. The collar 148 is provided with a rib
        which extends into a slotted keyway 150 in the side of the
        electrode 142, so that the electrode 142 rotates with the spur
        gear 152 which is secured to the ribbed collar 148. With the
        spur gear 154 in meshing engagement with the gear 152, when the
        stepping motor 156 is actuated the electrode 142 will rotate and
        will be advanced with the fixed, non-rotating threaded shaft 16.
        Of course, the motor 156 and its associated gears 154 and 152,
        together with the ribbed collar 148 secured to the gear 152, do
        not move axially with respect to the entire apparatus, but only
        the electrode moves to the right, as indicated in Figure 4. In
        Figure 4 operates in substantially the same manner as the
        externally threaded electrode 104 of Figure 3 in that, as the
        motors are energized, the electrodes are advances. </p>
      <p>Figure 5 shows the water jackets and the water coils. In
        greater detail and in a partially exploded view, as compared
        with the showing of Figure 2. In general, the parts as shown in
        Figure 5 carry the same reference numerals as in Figure 2.
        However, certain parts which were unnumbered in Figure 2 include
        the input collar 162 which directs ionized gas through the
        central opening 164 into a heat conducting relationship with the
        coil 138 and the water jacket 132. Similarly, the outer housing
        166, toward the right-hand end of the unit, was not previously
        mentioned in connection with Figure 2, now was the end closure
        member 168. </p>
      <p>Figure 6 is another exploded view, showing some of the
        remaining parts of Figure 2, which were not previously described
        separately. In Figure 6, the parts bear the same reference
        numerals as those used in Figure 2. pertinent parts which appear
        in Figure 6 which were not specifically mentioned in connection
        with the description of Figure 2 will now be identified. The
        input electrode 102 is enclosed within the stainless steel
        bellows 172 to more positively seal the unit against the escape
        of the high pressure and high energy gases from the arc plasma.
        Further, the electrode bellows assembly 102, 172 is mounted
        within the metal cylinder 174 which is closed by a sealing end
        plate 176. Similarly, the electrode 104 and its associated
        assembly is mounted within the stainless steel bellows 178,
        which is in turn mounted within the transversely extending
        housing 180 with its enclosing end plate 182. The unit 186
        having the enclosing water jacket 128, and having the central
        electric arc plasma discharge region 112 is also shown
        separately in Figure 6. In addition, the ends 192 and 194 are
        shown in separate views. Finally, to the right in Figure 6 is
        shown the heat exchange cylinder 166 which includes, for
        example, the water jacket 132. </p>
      <p>Referring now to Figure 7 of the drawings, Figure 7 is a
        showing of a further alternative input arc discharge assembly
        which may be employed in the implementation of the invention,
        The embodiment of Figure 7 is somewhat similar to that of Figure
        1 in that a dilute electrolyte is sprayed as indicated at
        reference numeral 202 through apertures 204 in the ceramic block
        206. Unlike the arrangements of Figure 1, however, in Figure 7 a
        ring-shaped ceramic member 208 is provided with apertures 210
        for spraying dilute electrolyte upward in a somewhat converging
        conical spray 212, toward the downwardly directed spray 202. The
        center of the lower ceramic member 208 is open so that the
        ionized gases from chamber 214 may expand downwardly into zone
        216 where appropriate heat exchangers are provided, of the types
        shown to the right in each of Figures 1 and 2. <br>
        Massive insulated input conductors 218 and 220 supply power to
        the electrodes 222 and 224, respectively, with the electrode
        spacing being in the order of 48 inches, and the power being
        supplied at a voltage in the order of 2500 volts. </p>
      <p>Relatively concentrated electrolyte is supplied to the unit of
        Figure 7 through conduits 218 and 222, and dilution is
        accomplished by water supplied through pipes 224 and 226 so that
        good mixing is accomplished prior to spraying from the apertured
        ceramic members 206 and 208, respectively. </p>
      <p>The result is a vigorous electric arc discharge in the center
        of the chamber 214, with the resultant ionization of the sprayed
        water, and a downward flow of the stream of ionixed gases into
        chamber 216 as indicated by the arrows toward the lower zones in
        Figure 7. </p>
      <p>Cooling water is supplied to the cooling jacket 232 from input
        conduit 234. The cooling water flows upward through the jacket
        232 and enters the very thin peripheral opening 236 and is
        permitted to flow down the inner surface of the side walls 238 o
        the chamber 214. The water serves to protect and cool the walls
        238, and the water is converted to steam and then ionized as it
        is exposed to the intense heat and the ionized gases resulting
        from the arc discharge at the center of chamber 214. Instead of
        flowing down the side walls as discussed above, the slot 236 may
        be made very narrow, and direct a spray curtain of water
        adjacent the side walls 238 of the enclosing chamber. </p>
      <p>With regard to certain other aspects of the apparatus disclosed
        hereinabove, the matter of materials which may be used deserves
        at least passing consideration. The principal materials which
        are used include a machinable electrically insulating ceramic
        material, and stainless steel.&nbsp; The machinable ceramic
        material, which may be Marcor, available from Corning Glass Go,
        is employed adjacent the electrodes, to prevent an arc discharge
        across to the walls of the chambers, and is used for example for
        parts 206, 208, and 238 in Figure 7. The main portion of the
        units in each case, away from the arc discharge electrodes, is
        formed of stainless steel; and the heat exchange coils, such as
        the coils 56 in Figure 1 and 138 and 150 in Figures 2 and 5, for
        example, are formed of stainless steel tubing. The units may be
        enclosed in ceramic wool insulation, for example. The alumina
        type known as KaoWool, available from Babcock and Wilcox, is
        indicated at 78 in Figure 1. The water supplied to the units is
        insulating, pure, distilled water, for control purposes and to
        avoid flow of electricity. Instead of using a strong electrolyte
        tank, and then diluting it, fine powder dispensers for the
        electrolyte may be provided adjacent the point of use or of
        spraying of the electrolyte and water solution to provide closer
        electronic current flow control. In the foregoing description,
        it was mentioned that, with an electrode spacing in the order of
        48 inches, a voltage in the order of 2500 volts could be used.
        With lesser electrode spacing, for example about 7 inches, a
        voltage of about 200 o 230 volts may be employed, with the power
        being in the order of 200 kilowatts. In order to implement a
        smaller unit. </p>
      <p>Now that the detailed description of the present invention has
        been completed, reference is made to certain prior art articles
        relating to plasma technology. These include an article entitles
        ‘Production Experience with plasma Technology in Metallurgical
        Processing’ by Hans G Herlitz, reprinted from ‘Iron and Steel
        Engineer’, August 1985; and Technical Report, dated January
        1984, entitled ‘SKF Steel’s Plasma Technology’ by Hans Herlitz.
        These publications describe the application of electric arc
        plasma technology to steel industry fields of interest. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, the accompanying drawings and the foregoing
        detailed description relate to illustrative embodiments of the
        invention. It is to be understood, however, that the invention
        is not limited to the precise structure as shown in the drawings
        and as described in detail hereinabove. Thus, by way of example
        and not of limitation, the formation of steam using electric arc
        plasma generation, can take somewhat different configurations.
        Thus, the electrode configuration may be in the form of
        concentric rings, instead of the linear electrodes as shown in
        the two embodiments of the invention, and the water jackets and
        cooling coils from which superheated steam is obtained may be
        arranged in different combinations both as to their geometry,
        and to their flow paths. Further, the output from the main arc
        plasma envelope need not be directed to the steam expansion
        chamber to which the superheated water is applied, but may be
        used directly in cases where such direct use of the steam is
        advantageous or desirable. It is also to be understood that
        additional valving may be employed where desired, in order to
        control the flow of spray water into the electrode area in the
        case of Figure 1, and into the electric arc plasma zone in the
        case of the embodiments of both Figures 1 and 2. In addition,
        the unit of Figure 2 may be provided with selective sump or
        drain arrangements, to insure that there is not an undesirable
        collection of water in zone 112 at startup. Accordingly, the
        present invention is not limited to that as shown and described
        in detail hereinabove. </p>
