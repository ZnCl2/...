      </center>
      <p>A novel approach to extract energy from flowing water currents.
        It is unlike any other ocean energy or low-head hydropower
        concept. VIVACE is based on the extensively studied phenomenon
        of Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV), which was first observed 500
        years ago by Leonardo DaVinci in the form of “Aeolian Tones.”
        For decades, engineers have been trying to prevent VIV from
        damaging offshore equipment and structures. By maximizing and
        exploiting VIV rather than spoiling and preventing it, VIVACE
        takes this ‘problem’ and transforms it into a valuable resource
        for mankind. </p>
      <p>Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV) result from vortices forming
        and shedding on the downstream side of a bluff body in a
        current. Vortex shedding alternates from one side to the other,
        thereby creating a vibration or oscillation. The VIV phenomenon
        is non-linear, which means it can produce useful energy at high
        efficiency over a wide range of current speeds. </p>
      <p>VIVACE devices have many potential advantages, which improve
        installation survivability in the hostile underwater environment
        and enable low-cost power production by decreasing capital cost
        and minimizing maintenance. </p>
      <p><i>High energy density </i>- permits low cost energy to be
        produced from relatively small installations - requiring up to
        50 times less ocean acreage than wave power concepts. </p>
      <p><i>Simple and rugged moving parts</i> - allows for robust
        designs that can operate for long periods in the underwater
        environment with minimal maintenance. </p>
      <p><i>Low dependence on ocean/river conditions</i> - application
        of non-linear resonance permits useful energy to be extracted
        over a wide range of current speeds. </p>
      <p>VIVACE and other renewable energy technologies also face
        regulatory hurdles. Again, VIVACE is advantaged by salient
        benefits over other technologies. </p>
      <p><i>Non-obtrusiveness</i> - installations can be positioned
        beneath the surface, thereby avoiding interference with other
        uses, such as fishing, shipping and tourism. </p>
      <p><i>Compatibility with marine life</i> - VIVACE utilizes vortex
        formation and shedding, which is the same mechanism fish use to
        propel themselves through the water. </p>
      <p>Prototype, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and the
        Office Naval Research, is currently operating in the Marine
        Hydrodynamics Laboratory at the University of Michigan. This
        device has met and often exceeded expectations; thereby,
        providing strong evidence to proceed to the next scale, a
        multi-kilowatt field demonstration. </p>

    <blockquote><i>Slow-moving ocean and river currents could be a new,
        reliable and affordable alternative energy source. A University
        of Michigan engineer has made a machine that works like a fish
        to turn potentially destructive vibrations in fluid flows into
        clean, renewable power.</i>
      <p>The machine is called VIVACE. A paper on it is published in the
        current issue of the quarterly Journal of Offshore Mechanics and
        Arctic Engineering. </p>
      <p>VIVACE is the first known device that could harness energy from
        most of the water currents around the globe because it works in
        flows moving slower than 2 knots (about 2 miles per hour.) Most
        of the Earth's currents are slower than 3 knots. Turbines and
        water mills need an average of 5 or 6 knots to operate
        efficiently. </p>
      <p>VIVACE stands for Vortex Induced Vibrations for Aquatic Clean
        Energy. It doesn't depend on waves, tides, turbines or dams.
        It's a unique hydrokinetic energy system that relies on "vortex
        induced vibrations." </p>
      <p>Vortex induced vibrations are undulations that a rounded or
        cylinder-shaped object makes in a flow of fluid, which can be
        air or water. The presence of the object puts kinks in the
        current's speed as it skims by. This causes eddies, or vortices,
        to form in a pattern on opposite sides of the object. The
        vortices push and pull the object up and down or left and right,
        perpendicular to the current. </p>
      <p>These vibrations in wind toppled the Tacoma Narrows bridge in
        Washington in 1940 and the Ferrybridge power station cooling
        towers in England in 1965. In water, the vibrations regularly
        damage docks, oil rigs and coastal buildings. </p>
      <p>"For the past 25 years, engineers—myself included—have been
        trying to suppress vortex induced vibrations. But now at
        Michigan we're doing the opposite. We enhance the vibrations and
        harness this powerful and destructive force in nature," said
        VIVACE developer Michael Bernitsas, a professor in the U-M
        Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering. </p>
      <p>Fish have long known how to put the vortices that cause these
        vibrations to good use. </p>
      <p>"VIVACE copies aspects of fish technology," Bernitsas said.
        "Fish curve their bodies to glide between the vortices shed by
        the bodies of the fish in front of them. Their muscle power
        alone could not propel them through the water at the speed they
        go, so they ride in each other's wake." </p>
      <p>This generation of Bernitsas' machine looks nothing like a
        fish, though he says future versions will have the equivalent of
        a tail and surface roughness a kin to scales. The working
        prototype in his lab is just one sleek cylinder attached to
        springs. The cylinder hangs horizontally across the flow of
        water in a tractor-trailer-sized tank in his marine renewable
        energy laboratory. The water in the tank flows at 1.5 knots. </p>
      <p>Here's how VIVACE works: The very presence of the cylinder in
        the current causes alternating vortices to form above and below
        the cylinder. The vortices push and pull the passive cylinder up
        and down on its springs, creating mechanical energy. Then, the
        machine converts the mechanical energy into electricity. </p>
      <p>Just a few cylinders might be enough to power an anchored ship,
        or a lighthouse, Bernitsas says. These cylinders could be
        stacked in a short ladder. The professor estimates that array of
        VIVACE converters the size of a running track and about two
        stories high could power about 100,000 houses. Such an array
        could rest on a river bed or it could dangle, suspended in the
        water. But it would all be under the surface. </p>
      <p>Because the oscillations of VIVACE would be slow, it is
        theorized that the system would not harm marine life like dams
        and water turbines can. </p>
      <p>Bernitsas says VIVACE energy would cost about 5.5 cents per
        kilowatt hour. Wind energy costs 6.9 cents a kilowatt hour.
        Nuclear costs 4.6, and solar power costs between 16 and 48 cents
        per kilowatt hour depending on the location. </p>
      <p>"There won't be one solution for the world's energy needs,"
        Bernitsas said. "But if we could harness 0.1 percent of the
        energy in the ocean, we could support the energy needs of 15
        billion people." </p>
      <p>The researchers recently completed a feasibility study that
        found the device could draw power from the Detroit River. They
        are working to deploy one for a pilot project there within the
        18 months. </p>

        the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation,
        the Detroit/Wayne County Port Autrhority, the DTE Energy
        Foundation, Michigan Universities Commercialization Initiative,
        and the Link Foundation. The technology is being commercialized
        through Bernitsas' company, Vortex Hydro Energy. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Tapping the Vortex for Green Energy</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><b>by</b><b> Alexis Madrigal</b> </p>
      </center>
      <p>A bane of Big Oil's offshore rigs could become a boon for
        renewable energy. </p>
      <p>By tapping the natural motion of slow-moving water, a new
        hydrokinetic generator could open vast new swaths of the ocean
        for energy production. </p>
      <p>When ocean currents flow over any kind of cylinder, like the
        long cables that hold drilling platforms in place, small
        vortices are created. They eventually spin away, or shed,
        causing vibrations that over time can destroy an oil rig's
        moorings. </p>
      <p>Now, a University of Michigan engineer who long worked on
        suppressing this phenomenon, has developed a prototype
        energy-harvester that can capture the mechanical energy it
        creates. </p>
      <p>"About four years ago, it dawned on me that we should enhance
        the vibrations and try to harness the energy," said ocean
        engineer Michael Bernitsas, who has founded Vortex Hydro Energy
        to commercialize his idea. "No one has ever thought of patenting
        this idea, even though vortex induced vibrations were first
        observed in 1504 by Leonardo da Vinci." </p>
      <p>Energy experts consider the movement of water in oceans a vast
        untapped source of clean energy&nbsp; that could provide up to
        10 percent of U.S. demand (pdf). A variety of schemes have been
        proposed to capture this mechanical energy, usually involving
        turbines to capture fast-moving water generated by tides or a
        strong current. But few projects have progressed beyond the
        science project stage. The most advanced is a Pelamis Wave Power
        project off the coast of Portugal, which provides a mere 2
        megawatts of power. </p>
      <p>One major problem is that most underwater turbines require the
        water to be moving very fast. One study suggested that
        hydrokinetic projects only made economic sense in currents
        moving at over six knots, which are highly rare. It's all the
        ocean's other currents, which are generally under 3 knots, that
        Bernitsas sees as his technology's main advantage. </p>
      <p>"There is a huge amount of hydrokinetic energy in currents but
        a lot of that we cannot harness with the present technology and
        that's where my device comes in, to extract energy at speeds
        down to 1 knot," said Michael Bernitsas, who has founded Vortex
        Hydro Energy to commercialize his idea. "It taps into a new
        energy source." </p>
      <p>That idea has attracted some name-brand backers. The National
        Science Foundation, the U.S. Navy, and the Department of Energy
        have together contributed about $2 million to Vortex to further
        develop the concept. </p>
      <p>Schematic Prototypes of the device — known as Vortex Induced
        Vibrations Aquatic Clean Energy — are essentially round
        cylinders a few inches across suspended in water on a spring.
        The vortices generated by water flow move the cylinder up and
        down. The VIVACE system converts that mechanical energy into
        electricity via rotary or linear generators. </p>
      <p>In the future, Bernitsas wants to create modular 50 kilowatt
        units, like the artist's rendering seen above. They could be
        strung together for larger applications into power plants
        producing as much as a gigawatt of power. </p>
      <p>The engineers are working on making the basic system components
        more efficient, too. The cylinders of the early designs have
        sprouted tails, which allow them to use more of the energy in
        the vortices. It's an idea that the engineer has borrowed from
        whales, fish, tadpoles and other creatures that move in liquid,
        which he says all have a bluff, or not slender, body followed by
        a tail. </p>
      <p>"The muscle power the fish have is not enough to support the
        speed at which they are going," he said. "So, if you study more
        carefully, there are lots of things going on. A fish will curve
        its body, collect a vortex, shed it, and collect one on the
        other side and shed that, alternating on the two sides of its
        body." </p>
      <p>The design of the system allows it to take much more energy out
        of the water than turbine-based systems. In technical terms, the
        energy density of the system is higher. For example, in a
        three-knot current, the VIVACE gets 50 watts per cubic meter of
        water, while the Pelamis system, considered the world leader in
        ocean energy, gets 21. </p>
      <p>The innovative nature of the idea, however, is no guarantee of
        commercial success. </p>
      <p>"I think that it's at a very, very early stage of development,"
        said Roger Bedard, an analyst at the Electric Power Research
        Institute in Palo Alto, California, and world expert on ocean
        energy. </p>
      <p>And Bernitsas' system would be subject to the United States'
        regulatory process, which was designed with large hydroelectric
        dam projects in mind, and that has hampered all hydrokinetic
        energy technology development. </p>
      <p>"You have to go through 20 to 25 different regulatory agencies
        in this country," Bedard said. </p>
      <p>Governmental risk frightens potential investors. Erik Straser
        of the Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm Mohr Davidow
        Ventures, sees potential regulatory and technical issues, too. </p>
      <p>"This seems like it would be have some issues with permitting,"
        Straser wrote in an e-mail to Wired.com. "I think that and
        reliability will be the key issues to deployment and efficacy."

      <p>Bernitsas believes that his technology is much more
        environmentally friendly than other marine projects, so he's
        looking forward to working with regulators. </p>
      <p>Still, the tide could be turning, no pun intended, for marine
        and hydrokinetic projects. The recent Wall Street bailout bill
        included tax credits for these projects, which could stir
        investor interest. </p>
      <p>For now, Bernitsas isn't focused on large-scale production just
        yet. The first ready-to-use prototype, slated for splash down in
        the Detroit River, will be ready in about a year. </p>
      <p>"We're where cars were 100 years ago," Bernitsas said.
        "Hopefully it won't take us 100 years to get where we need to
        be." </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Harnessing River Whirlpools Puts Energy on
              Tap</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>by Jim Giles</b></p>

      <p>Whirlpools created by currents as they flow over obstacles are
        powerful enough to tear apart bridges and offshore rigs. So why
        not use them as a source of renewable power? </p>
      <p>Previous attempts to harness energy from the flow of the
        world's rivers and oceans have had limited success, at best.
        Tidal flow can only be tapped at certain times of day, while
        underwater turbines are only viable if they are mounted in rapid
        currents. </p>
      <p>Now researchers led by Michael Bernitsas at the University of
        Michigan, Ann Arbor, are preparing for the first outdoor trials
        of a technology that makes use of the slow-moving currents down
        rivers and across the ocean. </p>
      <p>When water flows over an underwater obstacle, whirlpools or
        vortices form alternately above and below it. The vortices
        create a tugging effect, so the result is an alternating force
        that yanks the object up and down (see Diagram). It is these
        oscillations that can have devastating consequences for rigs and
        bridges, but Bernitsas has now created a device that turns them
        into usable amounts of electricity. </p>
      <p>In his lab, he took a cylinder 10 centimetres in diameter and
        91 centimetres long with the same average density as water and
        suspended it horizontally in a bath. Then he generated currents
        of between 0.5 and 1.0 metres per second - speeds that are
        common in rivers. The vortices generated by the flow moved the
        cylinders up and down, and by attaching the cylinders to springs
        that turn an electric generator he was able to convert the
        motion into 10 watts of electrical energy. Bernitsas calls the
        technology Vortex Induced Vibrations Aquatic Clean Energy, or
        VIVACE, and plans to commercialise it with his company Vortex
        Hydro Energy. </p>
      <p>He has also come up with an idea for squeezing more energy from
        VIVACE. At the Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering
        conference in Estoril, Portugal, in June this year, he will show
        how roughening the surface of the cylinders allows them to
        capture more energy. The idea was inspired by the fact that fish
        that use energy from vortices to help propel themselves forward
        also have rough skin. </p>
      <p>VIVACE's big test will come next year, when the team plans to
        deploy a larger version in the Detroit river. They expect it to
        generate 3 kilowatts, enough to power lights on a nearby pier,
        and claim that still larger versions could produce megawatts of
        power at a cost of around 5 cents per kilowatt-hour. This would
        make it competitive with coal and gas-fuelled generators. </p>
      <p>These projections are contested, however, by commentators who
        point out that the performance has yet to be tested in the
        fluctuating current of a real river. They also have doubts about
        the claimed cost of the power it produces, since it is not yet
        clear how much the system will cost to maintain. "It is very new
        and very different to existing devices," says Walter Musial of
        the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado.
        "There are a lot of questions still to be answered." </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> -- A converter for producing useable energy
        from fluid motion of a fluid medium. The converter includes a
        support structure, at least one movable element immersed in the
        fluid medium and supported externally on the support structure
        such that the movable element can move relatively to the
        structure in response to the fluid motion by vortex induced
        motion, galloping or combination thereof, and at least one power
        device supported on the support structure and coupled to the
        movable element. The power device converts motion of the movable
        element to useable energy. </p>
