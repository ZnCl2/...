      <p><i>A1.</i> The main advantage of the migma orbit configuration
        is that it renders it possible to store and collide MeV ions.
        All other advantages follow from it. Referring to Figure A1, we
        see that in the MeV range, the fusion cross sections are at the
        maximum, while all the loss cross sections are at the minimum.
        High energy fusion is advantageous already in a simple mirror.
        An example is given in the theoretical computation of McNally
        (Ref. 75), shown in Fig. A2. However, it is not clear how MeV
        ions, which exhibit random motion in a plasma can be confined
        with the magnetic field technology available and projected
        today. Migma is a system in which ion motions are ordered and
        MeV confinement appears possible. </p>
      <p><i>A2. What is Migma?</i> The idea of using colliding beams for
        fusion is old, but the problems of low fusion reaction rates and
        high multiple coulomb scattering rates appeared, until fairly
        recently, insurmountable. If two hypothetical intersecting
        storage rings of deuterium ions, shown in Fig. A3, were
        constructed, multiple coulomb scattering at their collision
        point would destroy the beam before any significant fusion had
        occurred. We have demonstrated that these problems can be
        overcome by storing the two colliding beams into a single
        enclosure placed in a magnetic field, instead of two storage
        rings (Fig. A3, right). The ions scattered at the intersection
        would now return to the scattering point instead of hitting the
        beam tube. In our design, the strength of the magnetic field
        decreases with the radius. This makes the ions precess about the
        center in the horizontal plane. This results in an orbital
        configuration shown in Fig. A4. Since it looks like a mixture of
        orbits, we call it migma (Greek word for mixture). The central
        region of the migma is geometrically equivalent to an infinite
        number of colliding beams intersecting at all crossing angles,
        from 0 degrees to 180 degrees. </p>
      <p><i>A3. Simple Mirror</i>. The flux lines of the mirror magnetic
        field needed to form a migma configuration are shown in Fig. A5.
        This is a B-maximum field, also known as the "simple mirror".
        The adiabatic (plasma) orbits remain attached to the flux lines
        and gyrate about them. They "bounce" back to the z = 0 region
        from the high B region at high z (if the mirror ratio and their
        pitch angle are right) typically in 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup>
        gyrations. "Adiabatic" orbits imply zero magnetic gradient
        across the orbit. There can be no axial or radial focusing with
        the zero gradient. </p>
      <p><i>A4. Semi-Open Mirror (Focusing Mirror)</i>. When an ion’s
        energy becomes so large that the diameter if its orbit equals
        the radius of the magnetic field, the magnetic gradient across
        the orbit become ~ 50% and the orbit becomes highly
        non-adiabatic. In this case the ions cut through the magnetic
        lines of force from r = 0 to r = r<sub>max </sub>and bounce
        back to the z = 0 typically in one or two turns. The focusing
        force, acting on non-adiabatic orbits confines them to the lines
        of effective potential, rather than by the flux lines, shown in
        Fig. A5. One and the same physical magnetic field acts
        differently on plasma orbits than on migma orbits. As seen in
        Fig. A5, the mirror is about one-half less open ended, or
        semi-open mirror (focusing mirror). </p>
      <p><i>Semi-Open (Focusing Mirror as Power Source</i>. Migmacell is
        nothing but a Focusing Mirror. It has been shown (e.g., App. A2)
        that, with the presently available superconductive magnet
        technology, the losses from the open-ended migmacell are
        sufficiently suppressed that it can have a favorable energy
        balance, i.e., a fusion power source. This is due to a
        combination of factors: </p>
      <p>(1) Although open-ended, a focusing mirror is about half as
        open-ended to migma ions as the simple mirror is to plasma ions;
        the rate of the angular (and energy) spread due to multiple
        scattering is suppressed by a factor of 2 from that in a simple
        mirror at the same ion energy; </p>
      <p>(2) Additional improvement comes from the fact that focusing
        mirror can confine 100 times higher ion energy than a simple
        mirror; since the reactivity for multiple scattering is
        inversely proportional to kinetic energy <sup>3/2</sup>, the
        importance of this loss mechanism is further reduced; </p>
      <p>(3) Another loss mechanism that is substantially reduced by
        higher ion energies is the charge transfer; its reactivity
        decreases exponentially with the ion kinetic energy (See Fig.
        A1) </p>
      <p>The synchrotron and bremsstrahlung radiation losses are
        discussed by R.A. Miller in App. B. </p>
      <p>Additional Improvement in the Controlled Fusion Conditions (Eq.
        A8): </p>
      <p><i>A5. Semi-Closed Mirror</i>. When the densities in excess of
        10 13 ions/cm3 are reached and exceeded, the diamagnetic field
        of the migma ions reshapes the overall magnetic field and makes
        it a minimum-B field (smallest in strength near the center of
        the cell). Thus, the "mirror ratio", which is already higher for
        the migma orbits, becomes even higher. The end losses are
        further suppressed by the positive ambipolar potential of migma.
        The "semi-open" mirror becomes "semi-closed". </p>
      <p><i>A6. Plugged Mirror</i>. In our design named Trigma, we went
        one step further; both loss cones are to be closed to ions by
        two electrostatic accelerators placed on the z-axis and facing
        one another through the migmacell. The accelerators act as
        decelerators to the leaking positive ions. They are set at
        positive voltages greater than the maximum energy of the migma
        fuel ions and, therefore, represent electrostatic plugs to the
        migmacell ions. This configuration named Trigma, consisting of a
        migmacell, injection accelerator and two plug accelerators
        (decelerators), is shown in Fig. 1 of the main text. The Trigma
        concept is possible only by the focusing action of the
        migmacell, to transmit the ions from the migmacell (where ions
        gyrate about the z-axis) to decelerator (where ion motion should
        be in the z-direction). This process of "beaming" is improved by
        the insertion of the magnetic cusp between the migmacell and
        accelerators conceptually drawn in Fig. A6, Let us follow the
        path of an ion that "leaked out" of the migmacell through the
        loss cone. It will undergo two magnetic and one electrostatic
        focusing actions: </p>
      <p>(1) magnetic loss effect at one of the z max ends of the
        focusing mirror; </p>
      <p>(2) magnetic cusp effect at one of the magnetic field
        inversions between the mirror and accelerator; </p>
      <p>(3) electrostatic lens focusing within the electrostatic
        accelerator from the last to the first electrode. </p>
      <p>All three actions (1-3) are time reversible and the ion
        trajectories are the same going from left to right, or from
        right to left. Since all the beam transport elements in +z and z
        direction are exactly antisymmetric, the ions exhibit
        oscillatory motion between the two accelerators after
        deceleration, the oscillatory process would result in a
        maintenance of the migma density. </p>
      <p>A fraction of the leaking migma ions will not return to
        migmacell, but for various reasons such as collisions, remain
        within the accelerator after having been brought to a full stop
        by deceleration. While these ions are lost as fuel, their energy
        is not lost. It has been given to the accelerator, thus making a
        positive contribution to the energy balance. Since the cost of
        ions as fuel is less than the cost of the energy it carries, the
        trigma system can be considered "closed" to this type of ion
        loss too. </p>
      <p>Finally, a fraction of ions will be lost and not return to the
        migmacell before it gives all or some of its energy to the
        accelerator. </p>
      <p>The last two processes will result in a slow decrease in the
        migmacell density, which in turn, has to be maintained by
        continuous replenishment. </p>
      <p>To electrons, the loss cone is partially closed by two
        different mechanisms: focusing and triode oscillator action
        inside the migmacell. While in principle the positive electrodes
        of the accelerators would have an attractive sucking action on
        the electrons, this is not so in the trigma design. The first
        electrode "seen" by the leak electrons is on the ground
        potential. </p>
      <p>The electrons that succeeded in leaking together with the ions
        in the direction of the accelerators are removed from the ion
        beam by the magnetic cusp. Their magnetic field will bend
        electrons much more than the massive ions. These electron loses
        from migmacell are not nearly as harmful to the energy balance
        as those of ions: electron energy in a migmacell is typically 1%
        of the energy. Part of&nbsp; the energy conversion studies will
        investigate the possibility of electron energy recovery in a
        manner similar to that in thermoelectric diodes. </p>
      <p>The electron leaks are to be recovered by electron guns coupled
        to a sensor-connected feedback circuit, responding in a matter
        of 10<sup>-4</sup> seconds to an electron content change of
        0.1%. </p>
      <p><i>Direct Linear Conversion of Ion Energy into Electricity</i>.
        The two accelerators act, at the same time, as converters of the
        ion kinetic energy into electric energy by deceleration.
        Energies of both the leaking ions and the fusion products are
        converted into electricity directly by this process, named
        "linear" conversion because the ion orbits remain nearly
        parallel to the z-axis until brought to a halt. </p>
      <p>To a single ion orbit, the process of deceleration is in every
        way equal and opposite the well-known electrostatic acceleration
        in, say, van de Graaf accelerators. The focusing action of the
        accelerator lenses is direction independent in the same way a
        symmetrical optical lense is to light rays. </p>
      <p>In practice, the ions will not behave as single ion orbits
        because of (1) space charge in the decel-accelerated beam; and
        (2) collision with residual gas in vacuum. Effects (1-2) will
        increase somewhat the emittance of the beam: </p>
      <p>(A1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Emittance = ( Delta R ) ( Delta Phi ) T ½ mr
        cm MeV ½ </p>
      <p><img src="appaeq1.jpg" height="17" width="175"></p>
      <p>in every traversal, so that eventually the beam will "blow up".
      </p>
      <p>The lifetime of the oscillating beam is a sensitive function of
        the vacuum. Taking into account the suppression of the multiple
        scattering spread due to focusing, we estimate the lifetime of
        the oscillating beam to be of the order of the fusion time. </p>
      <p><i>Condition for Controlled Fusion.</i> The problem if
        achieving controlled fusion in an open-ended system reduced
        itself, to the first approximation, to making the fusion time, t<sub>F</sub>,
        about equal to or less than the time constants of each of the
        four principal loss mechanisms: multiple scattering, t1, charge
        exchange, t<sub>2</sub>, synchrotron radiation losses, t<sub>3</sub>,
        and bremsstrahlung radiation losses, t<sub>4</sub>. If we denote
        the overall loss time by t: </p>

        probable than fusion gains, while above 1 MeV the energy losses
        are clearly less than the fusion gains. </p>

      <p><b>Figure A3.</b> Illustration (left) of the fact that two
        colliding beams in storage rings could not make a fusion reactor
        because the cross section for the multiple coulomb scattering, o<sub>MS</sub>,
        through an angle greater than, say 10° is so much greater than
        that for fusion, <i>o</i> fusion, that the beam would spread
        out and hit the walls of the rings, and cease to be a "beam"
        before any significant number of ions fuse. The scattering time
        is shorter than the fusion time. </p>
      <p>(Right) If, however, two rings are removed and two beams are
        made to collide in a single vacuum chamber placed in a uniform
        magnetic field, scatterings in the center that change either the
        angle or energy of the ions will not spread the beam in the
        center of the magnetic field. Liousville’s Theorem requires that
        after any perturbation of the ion orbit in the center, the ion
        must return to the center. This becomes less true, the farther
        away from the center the scattering takes place. Since most of
        the scatterings take place at or neat the center the orbits will
        be concentrated in the central zone for a relatively long time,
        i.e., time comparable to or longer than fusion time. This is why
        intersecting orbits in migmacell can generate fusion energy and
        intersecting storage rings. </p>

      <p>In order to demonstrate the important qualitative point that
        the important loss processes become more manageable at high
        energies, in the vicinity of 1 MeV, we calculate the time
        constants for fusion, multiple scattering end losses, charge
        transfer, bremsstrahlung, and synchrotron radiation. </p>
      <p>We perform the calculations for a 2 MeV deuteron migma with an
        effective average density of 10 14 cm-3, which is approximately
        the asymptotic average density due to diamagnetism (Ref. 32). </p>

        <p><b>Remarks on Some Stability Problems for Migma Configuration</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>1. The Migma Configuration and Its Physical Parameters ~</i>
      </p>
      <p>Since the proposal of the migma concept (Ref. 1-3), questions
        have been raised concerning the stability of the system, in
        particular at the densities of the order of 10<sup>8</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>,
        and above, where other machines have encountered difficulties.
        For a stability evaluation, migma can be briefly described, at
        low and moderate densities, as a simple mirror magnetic field
        around 3-6 x 10<sup>4</sup> Gauss, filled by injection of
        monoenergetic high energy ions (-0.5 - 1MeV) through the
        symmetry axis. That is, with nearly zero canonical angular
        momentum (&nbsp;<img src="appc1.jpg" border="0" height="38"
          width="163"> )&nbsp; being the magnetic flux enclosed in a
        circle of&nbsp; radius r). The geometry of the device is
        compact, the axial extent being about 8 cm for the present Migma
        IV state for the experiments. The chamber walls are about 50 cm
        in radius. Ideally the ion distribution function is the product
        of two delta functions,&nbsp;<img src="appc2.jpg" height="31"
          width="113">, although scattering processes will produce
        spread in energy and momentum of a magnitude which depends on
        the density. A Monte Carlo Transport Code was developed at FEC
        to study a steady state distribution of the ions (in the absence
        of instabilities) and the following characteristics were found
        to hold over a large range of densities ( ~ 10<sup>8</sup>-10<sup>12</sup>
        cm<sup>-3</sup> ). The density distribution is strongly peaked
        in the center with a radial scale length&nbsp;<img
          src="appc3.jpg" height="29" width="128"> (for instance in the
        Migma IV experiment,&nbsp;<img src="appc4.jpg" height="19"
          width="216"> ). The radial extend of the plasma&nbsp;<img
          src="appc5.jpg" height="28" width="73">, the radial scale
        length of the magnetic field&nbsp;<img src="appc6.jpg"
          height="25" width="120"> is larger than R<sub>Li</sub> and
        much greater than a. The central density peak is followed by a
        "plateau" of lower density (for Migma IV estimated to be 1/6 of
        the central density) until the density decreases to zero at r =
        2R<sub>Li</sub> (the plateau extends up to 8 cm and density
        drops to zero at 10 cm for Migma IV). </p>
      <p>The features described above correspond to a physical regime
        for which no adequate results for plasma stability exist at the
        present. Expansions in power of R<sub>Li</sub>/R<sub>o</sub>
        used for plasma systems are not satisfactory here. The strong
        decrease in density along the ion orbits implies drastic changes
        of the dielectric properties over a Larmor Radius, and this
        effect has not yet been included with any generality to be
        useful for the migma stability analysis, in the existing
        theories. In the current trend of thermonuclear research the
        assumptions <i>a</i> &gt;&gt; R<sub>Li</sub> and <i>a</i>
        &gt;&gt; <i>Lambda</i> (the wave length of a perturbation) are
        generally justified and so the WKB or the local approximations
        are largely used (See Ref 5 for instance). These techniques
        cannot be applied to the Migma case (see for instance an attempt
        done in this sense in the Robson Panel Report, Ref. 6, for the
        ion-counterstreaming instability and the FEC demonstration of
        the shortcomings of their method, Ref. 7, Appendix. </p>
      <p>Summing up, no results from the existing literature are
        applicable with confidence to Migma because of (i) zero
        canonical momentum distribution, (ii) 2R<sub>Li</sub> ~ R<sub>o</sub>,
        (iii) <i>a</i> &lt;&lt; 2R<sub>Li</sub>, and (iv) short axial
        extent typical of the Migma configuration. Properties (ii) and
        (iv) imply that the two usual adiabatic invariants of the plasma
        mirror theory --- the ion magnetic moment and the longitudinal
        invariant --- are absent in the non-adiabatic migma orbits, New
        instability calculations are needed. Some have been started at
        FEC with encouraging results (See Ref. 8) and more work is under
        way. </p>
      <p><i>2. Comments on the Instability Predictions ~</i> </p>
      <p>The goal of the migma experiments to demonstrate the
        feasibility of a self-colliding orbit type of compact
        containment of ions in the MeV range, where charge exchange
        losses become negligible, important gains in n are expected (if
        the density is Coulomb Scattering limited) relative to lower
        injection energies, and large ion orbits plus high electron
        temperature provide some stabilizing properties. </p>
      <p>The maximum density achievable practically with this scheme is
        unknown and this point cannot be decided confidently without
        actually performing the experimental research. We have noted
        already the shortcomings of the existing theories. However, even
        more refined analysis should be tested in the laboratory. In
        general, plasma collective behavior is so complex as to often
        defy a purely theoretical stability forecast. In this field, as
        in others involving many-body behavior, theory and experiments
        must follow each other closely in order to develop reliable
        knowledge. </p>
      <p>Consider the case of the drift-cone instability. B. Kadomtsev
        (Ref. 9) noted, "As is well known this instability in
        experimental mirror devices was found to be much less dangerous
        than the theoreticians had predicted". In relation to this see
        also Ref. 5. This instability may be a matter of serious concern
        for Migma at high densities, in view of the small value of a.
        But again, on the basis of present knowledge, the value of any
        definite statement about its relevance is dubious, and perhaps
        only the experiment can clarify the extent of this threat. </p>
      <p><i>3. Negative Mass Instability ~</i> </p>
      <p>The decisive identification of the negative mass instability in
        the DCX-1 experiments is reported in Ref. 8. Since the DCX-1
        magnetic field is quite similar to the migma one, although the
        investigations were aimed differently, negative conclusions have
        been drawn sometimes about the Migma project on the basis of the
        DCX experience. The relevance of the DCX-1 data for migma has
        been analyzed before in Sect. 3.3 (See also Ref. 9). The main
        points are the following: the DCX-1 was injected at a rather
        high energy producing ions of 0.3 MeV (comparable with the 0.55
        MeVof Migma IV); no flute instability was observed (Ref. 10);
        the density regime was such that w<sup>2</sup><sub>pe</sub> &gt;
        w<sup>2</sup><sub>ci</sub> &gt;w<sup>2</sup><sub>pi</sub>. The
        Migma III experiment was operated in the same regime and no
        flute instabilities were observed, or any other for that matter
        (Ref. 22). We believe this is because both experiments were
        performed at large ion Larmor radii, which has a stabilizing
        effect on the flute disruptive instability, as we shall review
        in the next point. The DCX-1 experiment identified without any
        doubt the negative mass effect, when the concentric orbit (also
        called "circular orbit") was populated with ions. In fact, the
        negative mass collective behavior is a property of the
        concentric orbit, but is reduced and tends to cancel out for
        non-concentric orbits (zero canonical momentum). This was shown
        in the migma experiment and theoretically in Ref. 6. We quote
        the conclusions from the abstract: </p>
      <p>"Negative mass instability via a 2-dimensional, electrostatic
        numerical simulation was investigated for two quite dissimilar
        orbit geometries in a simple magnetic mirror field. For the case
        of a high energy ion beam circulating about the magnetic axis,
        it is found that the system is highly unstable and the beam
        clumps azimuthally --- in agreement with theory and experiment.
        However, if the beam is displaced so as to pass through the
        magnetic axis, forming a migma-like configuration, the system
        remains highly stable and there is no tendency towards particle
        clumping even for w<sup>2</sup><sub>pi</sub>/w<sub>ci</sub>
        &gt;1. Analytical results support the conclusions reached by the
        simulation study". </p>
      <p>In fact, about two orders of magnitude improvements in the
        density threshold of DCX-1 were reported (Ref. 10) when the
        injection was shifted from the standard mode to the central mode
        (migma-like mode). The density was still assumed to be limited
        by the instability at 2 x 10<sup>8</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>.
        However, we must note that: (a) at this point the experiment may
        have been within observational error of the maximum density that
        was possible, allowing for the given injection current, the
        vacuum and the orbital properties; and (b) there was an
        important difference in the beam cross section between DCX and
        Migma (which can be traced back to the different aims in the
        research). While in Migma the beam was focused to 0.3 cm
        diameter, in DCX-1 it was about 5 cm (formed by the passage of a
        H+ beam through a water vapor cell). Hence the circular orbit
        was populated even when the injection was aimed at the center
        (migma-like mode) because of the broad beam. The DCX experiments
        were discontinued probably because the main interest was then
        attracted by the magnetic well concept. </p>
      <p>In the Migma III experiment the unstable orbit was avoided and
        the density exceeded the instability threshold of DCX-1 by an
        order of magnitude without any instability observed (Ref. 22).
        The density was limited only because of limitations in the
        current and vacuum available. </p>
      <p>Another experiment of injection through the axis of a simple
        mirror field which presented remarkable stability properties was
        the MMII at Fontenay-aux-Roses (Ref. 11), although the energy
        was lower (70-80 KeV) then the previously mentioned ones.
        Unfortunately, the experiment was discontinued in the course of
        policy-making priority decision about the French Fusion Program
        (Ref. 12), apparently for reasons not related to the scientific
        merits of the project. </p>
      <p><i>4. The Flute Instability ~</i> </p>
      <p>[ Line missing in text ] </p>
      <p>of density limitation in simple mirrors. However, the existence
        of a great variety of devices and physical regimes of operation
        does not allow for such a simple experiment, During the 60s,
        much was written on the simple mirrors and many effects, like
        the finite Larmor radius stabilization, the influence of
        metalwallsm the presence of uncompensated space charge, etc.,
        were studied in connection with the stabilization of flutes.
        Some&nbsp; results of the time may have been left in the shadow,
        so to speak, by the new trend in mirror research, the minimum-B
        concept, that has dominated since the middle 60s up to the
        present. In fact, even the most unstable m = 1 mode is
        influenced by finite Larmor radii effects. We will presently
        review the relevant information. </p>
      <p>Rosenbluth, Krall, and Rostoker (Ref. 13), using a finite
        albeit small RLi theory, found that all the flute modes except
        the m = 1 were stable for cylindrical geometry. The fact that,
        in their radially unbounded plasma model, the m = 1 has a
        uniform electric field associated with it is the main reason for
        the persistence of the flute instability. As a consequence, the
        electric drift is the same for both species, ions and electrons,
        and is not affected by the size of orbits. However, it is
        precisely the non-uniformity of the electric field along the
        ion’s orbits that provides the finite Larmor radius
        stabilization effect. This was shown in&nbsp; a clear physical
        way by F. Hoh (Ref. 4). Afterwards many authors have shown that
        the electric field of the perturbation can be non-uniform even
        for the m = 1 mode in bounded plasmas. Hence the finite Larmor
        radius stabilization can be found also for the m = 1 mode,
        contrary to a widespread belief. See for instance L. Kuo, <i>et
          al</i>. (Ref. 15, 16), A. Futch, <i>et al.</i>, (Ref. 17), K.
        Jungwirth, and M. Seidl (Ref. 18), to quote a few of the most
        relevant works. The non-uniformity of the electric field in
        these more realistic models is due to the finite radial size of
        the plasma and the presence of the chamber walls. </p>
      <p><i>4.1 Flutes at Low Density, w<sup>2</sup><sub>pi</sub>
          &lt;&lt; w<sup>2</sup><sub>ci</sub></i> </p>
      <p>The calculations of Kuo, <i>et al</i>. (Ref. 15; see also
        Futch, <i>et al</i>, Ref. 17) were intended to explain the
        results of the Phoenix Mirror experiment, This device operated
        at 30 KeV and at densities such that w<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>i
        &lt;&lt; w<sup>2</sup><sub>ci</sub>. Flute instabilities were
        observed at densities above a certain threshold, but for low
        values of the magnetic field (large Larmor radius) the stability
        improved as the density threshold was shifted toward the highest
        densities achievable with the apparatus. The theory was always
        about one order of magnitude below the observed data in its
        prediction of the density threshold, probably because it was not
        accurate enough at very large ion orbits, i.e., R<sub>Li</sub>
        comparable with R<sub>p</sub>, and also because the axial
        inhomogeneity was ignored in the model. In spite of these
        shortcomings, the enhanced stability effect at large ion orbits
        was brought in evidence and qualitatively reproduced by the
        model. In the paper of Futch, <i>et al</i>. (Ref. 17), space
        charge effects (deviation from neutrality in the plasma) on the
        flute modes were also computed. A more recent study of this
        stabilizing effect was given by Putvinsky (Ref. 20). Although
        this effect contributes,it is doubtful that it may provide full
        stabilization acting alone, since intolerably high space charge
        would be needed to quench the m = 1 mode. </p>
      <p>The Kuo, <i>et al</i>. results (Ref. 15) can be compared with
        the Migma III experiments. The average density of Migma III was
        near the threshold and the central density well above it.
        However, in view of the differences between the density
        distribution in Migma and the Kuo, <i>et al</i>., model and the
        approximate nature of their results, infinite conclusions cannot
        be drawn here. The absence of flute in Migma III (and also in
        DCX-1) may be due to the stabilization mechanism incorporated in
        the above mentioned model and consistent with the Phoenix
        experience at low magnetic fields. </p>
      <p><i>4.2 Flutes at High Densities, w<sup>2</sup><sub>pi</sub>
          &gt;&gt; w<sup>2</sup><sub>ci</sub></i> </p>
      <p>In another work, Ku, <i>et al</i>. (Ref. 16) demonstrated that
        the m = 1 mode can be stabilized in the high density regime w<sup>2</sup><sub>pi</sub>
        &gt;&gt; w<sup>2</sup><sub>ci</sub>, at all densities (above n
        &gt;&gt; B<sup>2</sup>/4 <i>pi</i> m<sub>ic</sub><sup>2</sup> )
        compatible with the electrostatic approximation (i.e., low
        Beta). To that effect the following condition must be satisfied:
      </p>
      <p><img src="appc7.jpg" height="36" width="270"></p>
      <p>Uo being the ion velocity and omega the ion precession
        frequency die to themagnetic field gradient. This result is very
        interesting for the proposed Migma IV experiment where the
        regime w<sup>2</sup><sub>pi</sub> &gt;&gt; w<sup>2</sup><sub>ci</sub>
        is expected. With the following numerical values adequate for
        Migma IV, wci = 1.4 x 10 8 sec-1, U<sub>o</sub> = 7.2 x 10<sup>8</sup>
        cm/sec (D+, 0.55 MeV) <i>Omega</i> = 3 x 10<sup>6</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>
        and R<sub>p</sub> = 2R<sub>Li</sub>, we found that the above
        criterium is satisfied with A ~ 30. Referring to the Phoenix
        program, Kuo, <i>et al.</i>, commented that "An A of 10
        requires a field of 5 Kgauss which gives R<sub>Li</sub> / R<sub>p</sub>
        =&nbsp; ½ . Such a large ratio of Larmor radius to the plasma
        radius is of course not satisfactory but there are several means
        to improve it". What was unsatisfactory in a thermonuclear
        context, that would need many RLi to fit into the plasma,is
        instead quite natural in a high energy device such as a
        migmacell where R<sub>Li</sub> / R<sub>p</sub> = ½ is an
        intrinsic feature. If this theoretical result is confirmed by
        the Migma IV experiment, a major step forward in the compact
        fusion concept will be achieved, as the flute is a dangerous
        disruptive instability. </p>
      <p><i>4.3 More Remarks about Flutes: Intermediate Densities ~</i>
      </p>
      <p>Complete calculation for the m =1 mode in cylindrical geometry
        at intermediate densities around w<sub>pi</sub> = w<sub>ci</sub>
        and for arbitrary values of A are not available as far as we
        know. These extensions of the Kuo,<i> et al</i>. work must form
        a part of the research for Migma IV. A plane slab geometry model
        (with small R<sub>Li</sub> and large inhomogeneity scale length)
        has been worked out and may be used to give qualitative
        orientations, bearing in mind that the translation of results
        from a plane to a cylindrical geometry is unsatisfactory. In the
        plane model the flute mode shows an unstable gap between two
        stable regions at high and low densities respectively. From
        Mikhailovskii’s general review (Ref. 21, Chap. 6, p. 127, vol
        II), it can be seen that the unstable gap is defined by </p>
      <p><img src="appc8.jpg" height="42" width="144"></p>
      <p>approximately, for<i> lambda</i><sub>y</sub> = R<sub>Li</sub>,
        i.e., translating crudely from the plane to the cylindrical
        geometry for the m = 1 mode. </p>
      <p>This is ignoring the axial inhomogeneity (plasma infinite in
        z). When the short axial extent of devices like migma is taken
        into account the stabilizing effect of metal conducting ends
        (which enforce finite values on the axial wavemnumber) appears.
        For the same model (Mikhailovskii, Ref. 21, Ch. 6, p. 126, vol
        II, and taking into account that (w<sub>pe</sub> a/c)<sup>2</sup>
        &lt; 1, in Migma IV) the stability condition, when conducting
        ends play a role on the flute mode, is </p>
      <p><img src="appc9.jpg" height="47" width="115"></p>
      <p>which holds well for the migma parameters. </p>
      <p>Another question is raised in the literature of the 60s
        regarding the flutes is that some models show that ion viscosity
        dissipation can be destabilizing, even when the finite Larmor
        radius effect is operating (see for instance Ref. 21, p. 131).
        The effect was not observed in low density experiments. For
        migma we estimate its growth rate of the order of the relaxation
        frequency of the ions, which due to the MeV range ion injection
        energy, is extremely low. This may explain why this effect was
        not observed. </p>
      <p>Thus the Migma IV experiment will provide an opportunity to
        test critically the several stabilization mechanisms of the
        flute modes and will contribute to answering the many unsettled
        questions in the stability of large ion orbits. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">Biography of Bogdan Maglich</font></b></center>
      <p>Bogdan Maglich was born in 1928 in Yugoslavia. His father was a
        lawyer and an electrd member of the Yugoslav (Royal) Parliament.
        At age 12m he was, with his mother, imprisoned in a Nazi
        concentration camp for Serbs, then escaped. </p>
      <p>Maglich graduated in Physics from the University of Belgrade in
        1951; obtained a MS Degree at the Univ. of Liverpool, England in
        1955; PhD degree at MIT in 1959. He joined the research staff of
        Dr Louis Alvarex at Lawrence Berkeley Lab in 1959. In 1961 he
        discovered the omega meson for which he and the entire team
        received a White House Citation by President Kennedy. In 1962 he
        invented and patented the sonic spark chamber. </p>
      <p>In the period 1963-67 he was senior staff member of CERN
        European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva,
        Switzerland. He was Deputy Group Leader of the British team,
        then Group Leader of a predominantly Swiss team of 30
        physicists. In 1964 he invented "Missing Mass Spectrometers" and
        discovered a number of new particles. </p>
      <p>In 1967 he became professor at the Univ. of Pennsylvania;
        visiting faculty at Princeton Univ.; and in 1969, Professor and
        Principal Investigator for High Energy Physics at Rutgers Univ.
        until 1974, when he resigned to form Fusion Energy Corp. </p>
      <p>He was Group Leader in a number of experiments at Brookhaven
        National Lab, Princeton-Pennsylvania Accelerator, Argonne
        National Lab and Fermilab (National Accelerator Lab). </p>
      <p>He was a member of the US delegation to the International
        Conference on High Energy Physics in Vienna 1968); Kiev (1970);
        course lecturer at international postdoctoral schools of physics
        in Erice (Italy), Madras (India), Erevan (USSR); invited
        lecturer at a number of scientific institutions such as American
        Physical Society, British Physical Society, W. German Physical
        Society, Yukawa Hall (Japan), Nobel Institute (Sweden), Tata
        Univ. (India) and most of the US, Canada and Western European
        universities and laboratories; Resident Scientist at a UN
        Seminar on the Economic Development of East Africa in Kenya. In
        1973, nominated by the President of Switzerland, he became an
        honorary citizen of that country. </p>
      <p>In 1976 he became Chairman of the Yugoslav-American
        Bicentennial Committee. In the same year, President Ford sent
        him as Special Representative of the President to a Yugoslav
        National Celebration. </p>
      <p>Maglich is President of Fusion Energy Corporation and Chairman
        of Migma Institute of Clean Fusion, its research laboratory. He
        is also Editor and Publisher of World Science Education, Inc.,
        which publishes the series <i>Adventures in Experimental
          Physics</i>. </p>
