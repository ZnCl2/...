      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;A fusion program less ambitious in its objectives and
        technology than the official programs, but such that could be
        reduced to practice before the large "ignited" plasma fusion
        power reactors with "infinite gain" become a reality, is
        described. "Migmacell" is designed as a "driven" power
        amplifier, energized by fusion, with a gain of 1.5 to 3. By
        recirculating a significant fraction of the output power,
        migmacell is a small (1 m. in diam.), self-sustained power
        source of 100 KW to 5 MW. By using direct nuclear collisions in
        "self-colliding orbits", it operates at the equivalent kinetic
        "temperatures" at least 100 times higher than thermonuclear
        devices. From the point of view of plasma physics, migmacell is
        a simple "colliding-beam" mirror with large gyroradius, highly
        non-adiabatic orbits and highly non-isotopic density peaked at
        the center. Focusing action results in low classical end-losses
        compared to plasma mirrors. The fusion power density is high,
        0.1 KW/cm<sup>3</sup>. Diamagnetic effects are confined mostly
        to the central region. </p>
      <p>High-energy migma fusion renders it possible to utilize the
        environmentally acceptable "advanced fuels" such as D, He<sup>3</sup>
        or Boron, rather than D-T, thus lending itself to a "clean
        fusion" power source, which is neutron-free or
        neutron-deficient. Larger plants are envisioned as a plurality
        of standardized migmacells, thus solving many problems in power
        transmission and distribution. </p>
      <p>Three stages of the program are completed. The experimentally
        achieved collision energy of ~ 1 MeV (equivalent kinetic
        "temperature" of 10 10 degrees K) and the energy confinement
        time of (2.21 <u>+</u> 0.05) seconds are sufficient for an
        advanced-fuel fusion reactor, but the central density of (2.2 <u>+</u>
        0.7) x 10 d<sup>+</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, limited by the vacuum
        and the injection rate, is low. The colliding beam luminosity
        (rate per o = 1) is L = 10<sup>27</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.
        Apparatus for Stage 4 (1 year program) whose aim is to achieve a
        large density regime, has been assembled and tested. Economic
        projections indicate a competitive power source.
        State-of-the-art technology is assumed throughout. </p>
      <p><b>1. Introduction ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>1.1 ~ Problems Associated with Fusion Reactor Concepts of
          the Official Government Programs</i> </p>
      <p>It has been generally assumed that the "ignited" fusion power
        reactors, using Tritium-Deuterium and Lithium as fuel, whose
        power gain ration is theoretically infinite, will be the
        ultimate source of energy. It is also believed that they will
        become an engineering and economic reality only in the next
        century. Their scientific feasibility has not yet been proven.
        There are a number of experimental difficulties, some expected
        and understood, some not (Ref. 1-3). The concept of inductive
        toroidal heating has been substituted by the neutral beam
        injection into tepid plasma. </p>
      <p>It has been pointed out recently that, if and when the planned
        ignited reactors work, they may not be acceptable to their
        ultimate users, the electric power industry (Ref. 4-6). This is,
        firstly, because of their use of the radioactive tritium as
        fuel: the tritium-deuterium-lithium fuel cycle planned for
        plasma fusion reactors could result in the radioactive waste
        problems comparable to those of the fission reactors; the second
        problem is their large size, high cost and long lead time (Ref.
        7-11). For example, the projected size of the ignited fusion
        reactor UNMAK-1 is comparable to the Great Pyramid of Cheops
        (Ref. 12). </p>
      <p>Additional difficulties with the T-D-Li fusion reactors arise
        from their high neutron flux which can be used to breed
        plutonium, thus opening a new nuclear proliferation problem. It
        has become known that the USSR has temporarily abandoned Tokomak
        as a fusion power source. Soviet Tokomaks are being developed
        now as neutron sources for the hybrid fusion-fission satellite
        reactor (Ref. 14). </p>
      <p>There are also problems associated with the fuel supply for
        fusion reactors. Today, tritium is being produced in the fission
        reactors. This implies that the first generation fusion reactors
        may depend on uranium for fuel. The world’s supply of lithium
        may also be limited. </p>
      <p><i>1.2 ~ What are the Aims of the Migma Program?</i> </p>
      <p>The Migma Program of Controlled Fusion is a less ambitious
        fusion program than that of the US, Soviet or other governments,
        but such that could be implemented before the ultimate answer to
        the world’s energy needs --- the ignited fusion power reactors
        --- become a reality. The elemental fusion power cell of the
        Migma Program, the migmacell, can be considered a "power
        amplifier using fusion" rather than a fusion power reactor. It
        is designed to output only 1.5 to 3 times as much energy as put
        in. In spite of this low gain, the energy output exceeds the
        input. Thus, a part of the output energy can be fed back into
        the input and the energy generating process will be
        self-sustained. </p>
      <p>The migmacell differs conceptually from other energy systems in
        that is not an "ignited", but a "driven" energy generator. </p>
      <p>All energy systems used today, once ignited, are sustained by
        feeding into them only one ingredient, fuel, whether fossil or
        nuclear. </p>
      <p>A possible exception is the automobile, where a small fraction
        of newly generated power goes back into the cylinder to provide
        the spark. However, the spark energy is negligible compared to
        the energy released in internal combustion. Therefore, an
        internal combustion engine, too, is an "ignited" system; it
        operates almost entirely by the addition of fuel. </p>
      <p>Ignited systems are fuel-intensive. Their energy gain is
        "infinite" since zero (or very little) of the system’s energy is
        fed back into the system. </p>
      <p>In contrast, both fuel and energy must be fed into the
        migmacell. This input of fuel and a significant amount of energy
        produce, say, three times as much energy out; in turn, one-third
        of that output energy is fed back into the input of the cell.
        The energy gain in the migmacell is, then, 3:1. This is
        considerably smaller gain than that of all other energy machines
        today. This is why the migmacell is called a driven energy
        source, or a "power amplifier", to differentiate it from a
        fusion reactor. </p>
      <p>The idea of a power amplifier (as opposed to a power reactor)
        has been proposed and discussed by others in the past (Ref. 78).
        The Migma Program is the first experimental program aimed at
        achieving it. </p>
      <p>The essence of the approach of Fusion Energy Corporation is its
        belief that, if the aims (in terms of energy gains) for a fusion
        engine can be reduced, controlled fusion can become a reality
        sooner. Our view is that the official fusion programs have not
        produced energy after 25 years of research because they are
        aiming too high: at "ignited" systems with "infinite" energy
        gain. Our position is that the higher energy input, the more
        likely the controlled fusion system will work; and that the
        presently pursued plasma fusion devices are "under-capitalized"
        in terms of energy invested. </p>
      <p>Since the migma fusion process is initiated by direct nuclear
        collisions in intersecting orbits (a modified concept of
        "colliding beams") rather than by the heating of plasmas, it
        does not have to use the uranium-tritium-deuterium-lithium
        cycle. If migmacell works, it will utilize "advanced fuels" such
        as non-radioactive deuterium, helium-3 or boron which will
        provide environmentally clean, non-radioactive, non-polluting,
        neutron-free (or neutron-deficient) power source with a minimal
        waste heat released to the environment. It is the view of at
        least some projectionists to the utility industry that only the
        advanced fuel fusion reactors may be acceptable to the industry,
        and that advanced fuel fusion research should have a parallel
        rather than a follow-on role (Ref. 4-6, 15). </p>
      <p>Our detailed scientific and engineering projections (Ref. 16)
        show that, if our theoretical expectations are correct, a
        demonstration power cell can be built 5 years from the
        completion of the "critical tests" of Stage 4. Stage 4 is a
        one-year program. </p>
      <p><i>1.3 ~ Physics is a Living Science</i> </p>
      <p>Controlled fusion is considered to be still very far away only
        because most of the fusion programs have been, for historical
        reasons, based on the attempts to almost literally "tame the
        H-bomb". If you started working on fusion today, you would do it
        differently from the way it was started 25 years ago. Controlled
        fusion will not necessarily emerge from Plasma Physics. </p>
      <p>Physics is a living science. Every decade brings a number of
        new ideas and concepts in physics. An example is the development
        of the laser technology (Ref. 17) of the 1970s, developed in
        High Energy Particle Physics, is another example. </p>
      <p>The Migma Program uses mostly the concepts and technologies of
        the 1970s, rather than those of the 1950s. </p>
      <p><i>1.4 ~ Concepts and Technologies of the Migma Program</i> </p>
      <p>Migmacell uses a combination of 17 ideas, concepts, and
        inventions (Ref. 18, 19), many of them borrowed from operational
        devices. These are: </p>
      <p>(1) colliding beams <br>
        (2) self-colliding orbits (Ref. 10-22) <br>
        (3) weak focusing (App. A4 of this paper and Sect. 4 of Ref. 23)
        <br>
        (4) synthetic plasma --- electron-impregnated migma or "eligma"
        (Sect. 2.4) <br>

        24) <br>
        (9) energy-coincidence ("fast-slow" coincidence) of charged
        fusion products (Ref. 26) <br>

        charge (Ref. 27, 28) <br>
        (11) time average neutralization by electron oscillations and
        tunable migmacell (Ref. 29) <br>
        (12) ion and electron morphodynamics (Ref. 30, 31), "tailoring"
        of particle distributions in phase space (Ref. 23) <br>
        (13) fast fusion (See Sect. 2.1) <br>
        (14) high energy fusion (Sect. 3.1) <br>
        (15) advanced fuel fusion (Ref. 15, 19), or "clean fusion" <br>
        (16) dynamic non-linear stabilization (Sect. 2.7) <br>
        (17) bunched fusion (Sect. 6 of Ref. 23) <br>
        (18) diamagnetic increase of the mirror ratio (Ref. 32 and App.
        A5) </p>
      <p><i>2. ~ The "Philosophy" of the Migmacell System Design</i> </p>
      <p>The "philosophy" of the migmacell design differs from that of
        the governmental fusion power reactor programs with regard to
        (1) size and power density, (2) power gain, (3) power output per
        unit, (4) method of initiating and maintaining the fusion
        process, (5) time structure of operation, (6) extraction of
        fusion products, and (7) instabilities. </p>
      <p><i>2.1 ~ Size and Power Density</i> </p>
      <p>For the ignited reactors it is believed that the larger the
        device is, the more likely it is to work. In contrast, our
        premise is that the smaller the fusion device is, the more
        likely it will work. </p>
      <p>Migmacell is about 1 meter in diameter. The fusion reaction
        volume is 0.01 to 0.1 m<sup>3</sup>, depending on the strength
        of the magnetic field on the superconductor that can be
        achieved. (Fig.1 [Not available]) </p>
      <p>The stabilizing effect of Larmor radii large relative to the
        size of the device is theoretically and experimentally known
        (See Sect. 2.7). </p>
      <p>The smaller the device, the nearer the fuel to the
        superconductor, the more advantage it will derive from the
        magnetic field; the fusion power densities in any device is
        proportional to the fourth power of the field strength. The
        kinetic-to-magnetic energy density ratio, <i>beta</i>, in migma
        is expected to be near 1. </p>
      <p>Diamagnetism has a small effect on the size of the Migma (Ref.
        32). Because the migma density is peaked at the center (r = z =
        0), the diamagnetic field carves out a "hole" in the B(r) at r =
        0, while at the periphery, r = r<sub>max</sub>, B retains nearly
        its original value. The ions are confined by the peripheral
        field even when the field at the center is zero. With the
        state-of-the-art superconductive magnet technology, we expect a
        fusion power density of 0.1 kw/cm<sup>3</sup> (this is 2 or 3
        orders of magnitude higher than that expected for "mainline"
        fusion devices, Ref. 33). The fuel ions will be compressed to a
        smaller volume accessible to external manipulation:
        instabilities may be controlled by a number of corrective
        actions used in electronic circuits and tubes (See Sect. 2.7). </p>
      <p>High power density implies that a large fraction of the fuel
        content of the cell is "burned" per unit time. This we refer to
        as fast fusion. Our power balance calculations indicate the burn
        fraction in the range of 0.1 to 0.7 (Table 2). This is an order
        of magnitude higher than expected for the mainline devices. </p>

        <p><img src="1table3.jpg" height="329" width="423"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Experiments with such small devices are relatively easy to
        commit. The hardware of an experimental unit costs less than $1
        million. Theories can be tested fast and rejected fast; designs
        and directions can be easily changed. </p>
      <p><i>2.2 ~ Power Gain</i> </p>
      <p>The power gain of the "ignited" reactors, which is the aim of
        the mainline program, is infinity. In contrast, our stability
        considerations (See Sect. 2.7 and <a href="migma2a.htm">App. C</a>)
        and the engineering requirements to implement them have
        convinced us that the lower the fusion power gain aimed at (the
        higher the ion energy), the more likely it is that the fusion
        power device can be made operational and useful. This ism of
        course, true only as long as the system is self-propelled, i.e.,
        Q &gt; 1. Our detailed calculations (See Sect. 4) based on the
        state-of-the-art technology give the gain: </p>
      <p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Q = power input / power output = 1.5 to 3.5 </p>
      <p>The advantages of the low gain are consequences of the physical
        and engineering advantages of high-energy (MeV) fusion, as
        opposed to thermonuclear (KeV) fusion (See also Sect. 3.1 and
        Fig. A1 and A2 in <a href="migma2a.htm">App. A</a>). </p>
      <p>The adverse effect of the low gain is the high "circulating
        power" needed. A large fraction of the fusion power generated
        must be fed back into the system. This results in: (1) an
        increased fuel consumption, and (2) the requirement that the
        conversion of the fusion energy into electricity be done with
        the efficiency higher than that of thermal conversion. </p>
      <p>These difficulties may be offset by the facts that: (1) the
        cost of fusion fuel, such as deuterium or boron may be
        negligible compared to the capital cost; (2) the use of advanced
        fuels, whose fusion products are charged particles, makes high
        efficiencies les difficult because the direct conversion into
        electricity becomes feasible. As shown in Sect. 4 and 5, the
        efficiencies in the 80-90% range that are desirable, appear to
        be possible in direct conversion. Yet, these high efficiencies
        are not essential. If the "burn" percentage can be increased,
        efficiencies as low as 30% will make the migmacell operational,
        although only marginally so (See Table 2). </p>
      <p><i>2.3 ~ Power Output Per Unit</i> </p>
      <p>While the typical design figure for the ignited reactors is
        5000 MW, we are aiming at a power output per migmacell in the
        range of 100 KW to 5 MW. A large power station can be built by
        multitudes of power cells. Advantages of having the power
        stations consisting of 10s to 1000s of identical low to medium
        power units are: </p>
      <p>(1) Economy of mass production. This would introduce
        standardization in the power plant construction, a feature long
        desired by the utility industry. </p>
      <p>(2) Power stations can be made large or small. As a result, the
        pattern of the power distribution in the nation will change.
        Local stations (e.g. for peak load) would become possible. The
        costly power transmission can be reduced. A study of the effects
        of a migmacell-based power production on distribution of
        electric power has been carried out by Power Technologies, Inc.
        (Ref. 34). </p>
      <p>(3) Planning and construction time would be reduced, thus
        reducing the already high and increasing indirect costs of
        inflation and interest during construction. </p>
      <p>(4) Power plant size can be increased with load eliminating the
        need for large overcapacity to allow for future growth. </p>
      <p><i>2.4 ~ Method of Initiating and Maintaining the Fusion
          Process</i> </p>
      <p>Ordered motions of the fuel ions are the key to the operation
        of migmacell. Random motions of fuel ions have been the main
        obstacle to achieving the controlled fusion conditions in
        plasma. Random motions can be easily confined by gravitational
        and inertial methods (stars and the fusion bomb), but not
        necessarily by the magnetic confinement. The nature of the
        magnetic forces acting on the randomly moving particles of both
        signs of charge is intrinsically different from the
        gravitational and inertial forces. The latter are independent of
        the sign of charge and the direction of motion; the former are
        not. </p>
      <p>Migmacell is based on ordered motion of ions, thus the magnetic
        field acts like a guiding field rather than the "pressure"
        field. Of course, the ion motions in a migmacell are ordered
        only to a certain degree and in comparison with a magnetic
        bottle filled with small Larmor radius ions. The orbits pass
        through the center, thus have "zero" or small canonical angular
        momentum. At higher densities the orbits will spread; however,
        the system will conserve some of its salient properties such as
        the peaked central density and the ion Larmor radius comparable
        to the size of the plasma. </p>
      <p>Migma is not electrically neutral. Like all mirrors, the
        ambipolar potential of migma is always positive. Because of its
        small size, the positive potential is expected to be maintained
        to a good degree of precision by a fast-response electronic
        feedback control of the number of electrons in the migma. In
        such a system in which both the electric and magnetic fields are
        present, the electron motions become quasi-ordered too. The
        electrons in migmacell are expected to exhibit motions similar
        to those of the "solid body rotation" of the electron space
        charge in a magnetron (Ref. 27, 28), as well as oscillations
        (Ref. 29, 30, as in a Barkhausen oscillator in a triode tube). </p>
      <p>This "synthetic" mixture of the migma ion and electrons we
        refer to as "electron impregnated migma" or "eligma". We note
        that, if the surplus of the positive over negative charge in
        eligma does not exceed the "space charge limit" as defined in
        accelerator physics, migma orbits may be expected to behave
        nearly like the single particle orbits even at high densities. </p>
      <p><i>2.5 ~ Time Structure of Operation</i> </p>
      <p>The mode of injections into migmacell is either DC, or a
        continuous train of "buckets", or "bunches", as in linacs. This
        is in contrast to the colossal bursts every few seconds of the
        plasma machines. We reject the idea that one should build a
        fusion engine the same way one builds a fusion bomb. The
        engineering considerations give practical preferences to steady
        operational-energy generators. The utilities have no experience
        with electric generators operating in big pulses. </p>
      <p><i>2.6 ~ Extraction of Fusion Products</i> </p>
      <p>The small size of migma renders it possible to extract the
        charged fusion products at the energies near to their original
        energy as released from the reaction, that is in the MeV range.
        This contrasts with other approaches in which it is assumed that
        the fusion products would thermalize before extraction. It also
        facilitates removal of high charge nuclei which "poison" fusion
        reactors. </p>
      <p>By having the nuclei produced in fusion in the energy range of
        1 to 10 MeV, one can apply magnetic beam-shaping methods such as
        magnetic cusps, to transform the curly radial migma motions of
        those nuclei into a beam. This process is the reverse of the
        "electron ring acceleration" in which a beam is transformed into
        a curly, radial movement by a magnetic cusp (Ref. 35). </p>
      <p>Once the nuclei produced in fusion are made into a beam, their
        kinetic energy can be converted into electric energy by
        directing this beam into a decelerator, i.e., an accelerator at
        a repulsive potential. As the beam is being slowed down, it will
        give its kinetic energy to the rings of the decelerator via the
        vacuum displacement current. This, in turn, will result in
        megavolt potentials suitable for power transmission. The exiting
        beam can be modulated [ ...line of text cut off at bottom of
        page... ] </p>
      <p><i>2.7 ~ Instabilities</i> </p>
      <p>For the reasons listed at the end of this section, we expect
        the migma to be more stable than other plasma devices. The word
        "stable" has a relative meaning. Every engineering system
        involving energy exchange would exhibit various intrinsic
        instabilities if the external or internal corrective mechanisms
        were not used. Thus, we consider it prudent to keep a watch out
        for the appearance of collective oscillations and to have a
        developed repertoire of general techniques for treating any
        which could present a problem. Our effort is to make the
        diagnostics sufficiently sensitive (Ref. 25, 26) to detect the
        appearance of collective oscillations well before they reach the
        levels that produce significant losses. The effort is directed
        to making the power cell small and accessible to both passive
        and active corrective measures to de-energize the instability
        growth. This is in contrast to the mainline programs aimed at
        building bigger and bigger devices in the belief that there is a
        certain size at which the system will overcome the effects of
        instability. </p>
      <p>Several methods of dealing with hypothetical instabilities have
        been borrowed from electronic engineering. One such method is
        "dithering", a non-feedback technique known in engineering and
        described by Lashinsky (Ref. 36). The salient feature of
        dithering is that is possible to stabilize some instabilities by
        the continuous application of a high frequency signal without
        the need to sense and feed back the incipient instability. It is
        our plan to apply dithering to the migmacell by modulating the
        beam injection. That is, the stored ions will be the main agent
        of fathering we foresee, playing the role of the grid in an
        electronic tube oscillator. An interesting example of dynamic
        stabilization by modulation of an ion beam had been described by
        Decker and Levine (Ref. 36). </p>
      <p>Other dynamic stabilization methods have been described in the
        same book (Ref. 36), as well as in Refs. 37, 38. Interaction of
        high frequency fields with the plasma has also been studied as a
        way of avoiding the most dangerous instabilities in a recent
        review (Ref. 39) </p>
      <p>We are particularly interested in applying those dynamic
        stabilization techniques that are based on periodic and
        nonlinear corrective action, internal or external, because migma
        is a highly nonlinear system (the ion density distribution being
        one example). From our point of view, the elementary definition
        of the static instability, depicted by a ball on top of a convex
        surface, does not imply instability. Such an "unstable"
        configuration can be made dynamically stable by engineering
        means, in the same manner mercury can be dynamically forced to
        "float" on oil by vibrations (Ref. 40). Similarly, the
        "unstable" physical system known as the inverted pendulum, is
        the underlying concept of stabilization of the particle beam in
        accelerators and storage rings, known as the strong focusing
        (Ref. 41). Stability of the strong focusing machines is so much
        better than that of the naturally stable weak focusing
        accelerators, that the latter are no longer built. </p>
      <p>From our analysis (Ref 42), we list below the favorable aspects
        that will contribute to the stability of migma: </p>
      <p>(1) The stabilizing finite Larmor radius effect has been
        well-known since the Rosenbluth-Krall-Rostoker paper (Ref. 43),
        and was later shown to include the M = 1 flute mode (Ref. 44,
        45) </p>
      <p>(2) The configuration of centrally focused orbits will generate
        a central core with a fair degree of isotropy in the mid plane
        as a result of energy and angular momentum spread. This
        configuration of orbits suppress the negative mass instability.
        The mixing of ion trajectories in the core should provide local
        stability for electrostatic perturbations. The high energy ions
        will simulate a high ion temperature that should favor Landau
        damping effects, locally, in the core where trajectories are
        nearly rectilinear. </p>
      <p>(3) The central density gradient is expected to reduce or
        suppress beam-driven instabilities. It was shown by Bers and
        David (Ref. 46) that the presence of a density gradient in the
        beam direction, reduces the instability growth rate, and also
        reduces the amplitude level of the electric field generated by
        the instability in the nonlinear regime as compared with the
        gradient-free case. Thus we expect to be able to reach a
        self-exponentiation regime in which the beam is trapped mainly
        by the migma core. </p>
      <p>(4) A relatively high electron temperature is expected (around
        100 KeV) as the density increases. This will provide a
        stabilizing effect because of the enhanced Landau damping of
        electron waves along the magnetic field, combined with the short
        axial length of migma. </p>
      <p>(5) We add the following points of merit for migmacell.
        Assuming the validity of typical analysis of the plasma
        dispersion relation for migma, it can be shown: </p>
      <p>(a) that the frequency convective loss-cone is stable for L<sub>m</sub>
        / R<sub>L</sub> &lt; 65 (where I<sub>m</sub> is the length
        between the mirrors and R<sub>L</sub> is the ion Larmor radius).
      </p>
      <p>(b) that the negative energy mode, which would dominate at low
        density (w<sup>2</sup><sub>pi</sub>/w<sup>2</sup><sub>ci</sub>
        &lt; 1) is stable for L<sub>m</sub>/R<sub>L</sub> &lt; (m<sub>i</sub>/m<sub>e</sub>)
        ½. </p>
      <p>(c) that the Alfven ion cyclotron mode, which is driven by p <sub><u>|</u></sub>&nbsp;
&gt;





        p<sub>||</sub> and is characterized by an axial wavelength
        comparable to the mirror length, is stable for R<sub>p</sub>/R<sub>L</sub>
        ~ 4 where R<sub>p</sub> is the plasma radius (Baldwin, Ref. 47)
      </p>
      <p>There is a fourth instability connected with the loss-cone, the
        drift-cyclotron mode. It is a possible "candidate" to appear in
        migma experiments at higher densities. This is a non-disruptive
        type of instability, which is very sensitive to the presence of
        small amounts of warm plasma, as was shown in the LLL
        experiments (Ref. 48) </p>
      <p>In summary, out of the four loss-cone-like instabilities, three
        are inherently stable due to the geometry of the migma device,
        and the rather high electron temperature that results as a
        consequence of the&nbsp; ~ MeV ion injection. However, the
        assumption that the ordinary stability results can be applied to
        migma must be examined carefully. Appendix C is devoted to this
        point and to our overall evaluation of the stability problem. </p>
      <p><i>3. ~ Remarks on Scientific Background of the Migmacell
          Concept</i> </p>
      <p>So different is the "philosophy" of the Migma Program from the
        official thinking that the initial reaction of those who have
        been exposed to the plasma fusion reactor concepts for many
        years is one of disbelief in its scientific "legitimacy". Some
        ideas and concepts will be discussed below. Reader is also
        referred to Appendices A, B, and C. </p>
      <p><i>3.1 High Energy Fusion</i> </p>
      <p>The salient feature of the migma concept is that, because of
        the ordered ions motions, storage and collision of high-energy
        ions, at the levels of MeV, becomes possible. This should be
        compared with thermonuclear temperatures in plasmas, which are
        at KeV levels. Already in Migmacell models 2 and 3, deuterium
        and helium-3 ions have been stored in the migma-like
        self-colliding orbit distribution, with an average collisional
        energy of 1 MeV. To achieve the same collisional energies in a
        plasma, the plasma would have to be heated to a temperature in
        excess of 10 billion degrees Kelvin (The average
        "temperature"-energy relation is T<sup>o</sup>(K) ~ 10<sup>7</sup>
        E(KeV). </p>
      <p>The mere fact that the confinement of high-energy ions is
        feasible opens up a host of advantages. They can be divided into
        three categories: (i) advantages in the single-particle or
        "classical" properties; (ii) advantages in the collective
        behavior, and (iii) practical advantages. </p>
      <p>(i) <i>Single-Particle or Classical Properties</i> ~ Referring
        to Figure A1 (in App. A), the reader can see that at the MeV
        temperatures, the fusion reactivities, &lt;<i>ov</i>&gt;,
        leading to energy gains are greater than the reactivities for
        all the electromagnetic processes which lead to the energy
        losses, this, coupled to the focusing action (Ref 49) results in
        low classical end losses (Ref 31) compared to plasma mirrors.
        This is described in Appendix A and B. </p>
      <p>(ii) <i>Collective Behavior</i> ~ Both the large Lamor radii
        of the migma orbits and the rosette-like configuration (zero
        canonical angular momentum have been known to have stabilizing
        effects against collective phenomena); see Sect. 2.7 and App. C.
      </p>
      <p>(iii) <i>Practical Advantages</i> ~ The practical advantages
        are that high energies (Ref. 51-55) render it possible to use
        the ultimate advanced fuels such as non-radioactive deuterium,
        He<sup>3</sup> and boron, which cannot be easily confined in a
        random, thermonuclear system with the magnetic fields available.
        The experiments can be carried out now using real fusion fuel,
        while in most plasma fusion experiments of today, the light
        hydrogen (which does not undergo fusion) is being used to
        simulate the process, because of the inherent difficulties in
        handling the real fuel, tritium, and its contamination. </p>
      <p>Experiments can be done now at the "temperatures" equivalent to
        those of the reactor conditions, thus avoiding waste of time in
        solving the problems at the low (KeV) temperatures which are
        irrelevant to the operation of an advanced fuel power source. </p>
      <p><i>3.2 ~ Theoretical and Experimental Base</i> </p>
      <p>The migma experiments and theory are based on the established
        standards of scientific rigor and technological reality. No
        fictional technology is involved, Concepts and ideas are backed
        either by experiment or calculations (Ref. 19, 31, 49, 50). We
        have generalized the Lawson criteria to make it applicable to
        non-ideal physical systems (Ref. 51-55) which rendered it
        possible to analyze the detailed behavior of the engineering of
        the fusion power systems. Critiques (Ref. 52, 58) of this
        revision have been found to be based on differences in
        philosophies (Ref. 52, 58; see Sect. 2). Experimental results
        are obtained with both the statistical and systematic errors
        equal to or smaller than those in typical plasma experiments
        (Ref. 24, 59, 60). </p>
      <p>Another example is the self-consistent calculation of the
        effects of diamagnetism on energy balance (Ref. 32). Its
        conclusion is that a migma power cell, to yield about 0.5 MW of
        fusion power, is conceivable within the realm of the
        state-of-the-art magnet technology (B<sub>o</sub> = 5.3 Tesla).
        This is in rough agreement with an earlier calculation (Ref. 62)
        which, however, does not include a factor for the effects of
        focusing in the Z direction. Noting (from Equation 12 of Ref.
        32) that the fusion rate scales as B<sub>o</sub><sup>4</sup> R<sup>4</sup>
        when &lt;<i>Beta</i>&gt; ~ 1, it seems that advances in the
        technology of superconductive magnets may permit significantly
        higher fusion power per cell. </p>
      <p>These results (Ref. 32) are diametrically opposite to the
        official unpublished results of Robson, <i>et al.</i> (Ref 63).
        From their non-self-consistent calculations (based on a
        non-physical model of migma), these authors concluded that the
        diamagnetism limits the fusion power to such low intensities (a
        small fraction of a watt), that the synchrotron radiation power
        will always exceed the fusion power. In their "Final Report"
        (Ref. 63), the authors presented this incorrect conclusion as
        the "fundamental obstacle" which will prevent Migma from working
        as a power source. This is an example of the use of official
        secrecy to hide mistakes from the scientific community. </p>
      <p>Our energy balance computations typically include all
        energy-gain and loss processes, involving up to 100 parameters
        to describe non-ideal reactor conditions (Ref. 64-67). Monte
        Carlo codes are used to simulate the operating conditions of a
        fusion reaction volume (Ref. 68). These data are accepted only
        when they agree with the approximate analytical methods. </p>
      <p>Our technological planning is done by management consultants
        (Ref. 16), as are the economic projections (Ref.69). </p>
      <p><i>3.3 ~ Irrelevance of the Instabilities Observed in DCX-1</i>
      </p>
      <p>The instabilities observed in an early (1950s) mirror machine
        known as DCX-1 which had similar shape of the magnetic field to
        migma, are not relevant to migma. The DCX-1 was never operated
        in the pure migma-like mode. The rosette-like migma orbits pass
        through the center of symmetry of the magnetic field and have
        "zero" canonical angular momentum. In contrast, nearly all DCX
        data were obtained in the "circular orbit" mode, in which the
        ions circulated in an orbit whose center is the center of the
        magnetic field. Moreover, it is not a self-colliding orbit, thus
        it is not relevant to high-energy fusion; it can be used only to
        heat the plasma. </p>
      <p>However, there were two short DCX runs in which both the
        circular and migma-like orbits were simultaneously established.
        Although the ions were aimed at the center, pure migma orbits
        could not be made. This was because the beam was so wide ( ~ 5
        cm / whm) that a significant number of ions always spilled out
        of the rosette orbit and entered the circular orbit as well.
        Even under these unclean conditions, the remarkable stability of
        migma orbits (Ref. 70) was observed: </p>
      <p>When run in the pure circular mode (non-migma mode), the DCX-1
        negative-mass instability threshold was observed at anion
        density of 10 5 ions cm3. </p>
      <p>When run in the mixture of circular plus migma mode, the system
        became 100-fold more stable. The instability threshold increased
        by at least 2 orders of magnitude to &gt;10<sup>7</sup> ion cm<sup>3</sup>.
        The experimentalists proved, by "scraping" the circular orbits,
        that the remnant instability originated entirely from the ions
        in the circular orbits (Ref. 70); the instability disappeared
        when circular orbit was destroyed. </p>
      <p>In the Migmacell III experiments, we have exceeded this density
        by another order of magnitude (above the DCX-1 threshold in the
        migma-plus-circular mode), without observing any instabilities
        (Ref. 24). By focusing the injected beam to an order of
        magnitude smaller spot (&lt;0.3 cm / whm), no ions were allowed
        to enter the unstable circular orbit and the negative mass
        instability was avoided. </p>
      <p>The DCX and Migma III results are in agreement with the
        predictions (Ref. 71), obtained by Monte Carlo simulations, of
        negative-mass instabilities for ions in the migma-type orbits. </p>
      <p>Why did the DCX-1 experimentalists not pursue the migma
        configuration in the 1950s? The reader is reminded that the
        principle of self-colliding orbits was published only in 1970.
        The physicists were unaware of the unusual stability properties
        of these large gyro-radius orbits with "zero" canonical angular
        momentum. Furthermore, the applicability of the principle of
        self-colliding orbits to particles of the like charge was
        pointed out in late 1971 (Ref. 21), and in more detail only in
        1973 (Ref. 22). Prior to that, the idea of igniting fusion by
        direct collisions rather than by heating was practically
        nonexistent in the literature. High-energy ions were being
        injected into the DCX machines as a means of collisional heating
        of the plasma. The purpose of the program was to degrade the
        injected ions to thermonuclear (KeV) temperatures, rather than
        to maintain their energy in the near MeV range. </p>
      <p>Therefore, I must conclude the DCX experimentalists did not
        pursue the migma orbits --- in spite of their proven stability
        --- for the lack of theoretical motivaion to make fusion in
        direct collisions. </p>
      <p>Theory of the stability of the migma-type orbits does not
        exist. The densities at which a migmacell will produce an excess
        energy (10<sup>14</sup> ions/cm<sup>3</sup>) have already been
        achieved in plasma physics. In addition to the arguments in
        favor of the migma stability listed in Sect. 2.7 and Appendix C,
        the migma orbits should be more stable against perturbations
        because of their 100 to 1000 times higher energy. A local
        electric field of 10<sup>5</sup> V is a 1000% perturbation to
        thermonuclear orbits, but only a 10% perturbation to migma. </p>
      <p>Plasma orbits are unstable because they have properties of a
        fluid (adiabatic orbits). The large gyro-radius migma orbits
        have properties of an elastic spring (non-adiabatic orbits) of
        high rigidity. </p>
      <p>Some of the proposed techniques involved in the migmacell
        operation are yet untested, and therefore there is a danger of
        the unknown. No known calculable physical effect or phenomenon
        has been shown to present an obstacle to the operation of
        migmacell. The migma concept has not been proven and has not
        been disproven. Only the experiments will decide on the migma
        stability at increased densities. </p>
      <p><i>4. ~ Fusion Power Generated in Migmacell</i> </p>
      <p>Viability of migma as power amplifier depends on the power
        balance. Our economic projections (Ref. 69) have shown that, in
        order for a migmacell to be viable, it must have fusion power in
        excess of 100 KW. A self-consistent calculation (Ref. 32) shows
        that migmacell can operate in the regime in which the ratio of
        the kinetic and magnetic energy density is unity, <i>Beta</i> =
        1. </p>
      <p>We present here the results of calculations (Ref. 68) of the
        power balance which shows that tens of Megawatts per m<sup>3</sup>
        of fusion power density can be produced in migmacell. This
        program requires much computer time and is expensive. It has
        been used to develop analytical models which can show trends in
        important parameters. Only the first stage of the calculations
        has been completed, which assumes the mirror ratio produced by
        the external magnetic field only (case A, "semi-open" mirror).
        For the mirror ratio enhanced by the diamagnetic effect, this
        author presents his estimates (case Bm "semi-closed" mirror). No
        numbers are given for "plugged mirrors". Therefore, the
        presented power balance results are conservative. </p>
      <p><i>4.1 ~ Three Fuel Cycles</i> </p>
      <p>Three fuel cycles have been considered: (1) pure He<sup>3</sup>,
        (2) pure D, and (3) mixed D + He<sup>3</sup>. </p>
      <p>For each of the fuels, the results for two cases, A =
        "semi-open" mirror, B = "semi-closed" (diamagnetic mirror ratio)
        in Tables 1, 2, and 3. </p>
      <p><i>4.2 ~ Results for Case A: "Semi-Open" Mirror</i> </p>
      <p>Pure He<sup>3</sup> (1A) and pure D Fuels (2A): Results show a
        fusion power density of 10 Megawatts/m<sup>3</sup> for pure D
        fuel, for a 7 tesla external field, and the scaling proportional
        to the fourth power of the field strength. This is shown in
        Figure 2. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Mixed D-He<sup>3</sup> Fuel (3A): Using the results for the
        pure fuels, we estimate a fusion power density of 30 Megawatts
        /m<sup>3</sup> for D-He<sup>3</sup> fuel. These fusion power
        densities, 2 to 30 Megawatts/m<sup>3</sup>, are achievable at
        the average ion densities in the range 5 x 10<sup>13</sup> - 10<sup>14</sup>
        ions/cm<sup>3</sup> which have already been reached in the major
        plasma devices. </p>
      <p><i>4.3 ~ Results for Case B: "Semi-Closed" Mirror</i> </p>
      <p>Diamagnetism increases the effective mirror ratio which, in
        turn, increases the burn. </p>

        power density of 6 Megawatts/m<sup>3</sup> for pure He<sup>3</sup>

      <p>Mixed He<sup>3</sup>-D (3B): Using the results for pure fuels,
        we estimate a fusion power density of 100 Megawatts/m<sup>3</sup>
        for the mixed He<sup>3</sup>-D fuel </p>
      <p><i>4.4 ~ Power Flow Diagram</i> </p>
      <p>The results have been displayed in terms of the Power Flow
        Diagram shown in Figure 3. The accelerator (ACCEL) injects an
        ion current I (amp) at the accelerating voltage V (MV), that is,
        the beam power P<sub>I</sub> (MW) into the Migmacell. The
        accelerator efficiency is n<sub>I</sub> = P<sub>I</sub> / P<sub>circ</sub>,
        where P<sub>circ</sub> = the circulating power. The beam
        trapping efficiency to make migma is not a free parameter, but
        is compiled as a function of migma density and other factors.
        The fusion power released is determined by the computed
        quantity: BURN percentage = (equiv. Fusion rate): ion loss rate
        due to multiple coulomb and nuclear elastic scattering. </p>
      <p>The fusion rate plus power output from the cell is partitioned
        between charged particles, CP; neutrons, <i>n</i>;
        electromagnetic radiation, <i>r</i>; and leaking electrons, <i>e</i>.
        Charged particles are split into two components: charged fusion
        products and non-fused fuel ions. The power carried out of the
        cell by the sum of these two components is labeled P<sub>CP</sub>,
        and that taken away by the neutrons, P<sub>n</sub>. The power
        carried by radiation comes only from the stored fuel ions,
        because the fusion products storage time in migmacell is short.
        The sum of the radiation and electron carried power is labeled P<sub>r,e</sub>.
      </p>
      <p>The efficiencies for direct and thermal conversion are <i>n</i><sub>DC</sub>
        and <i>n</i><sub>TC</sub> respectively, so that <i>n</i><sub>DC</sub>
        = P<sub>DC</sub> / P<sub>CP</sub> and <i>n</i><sub>TC</sub> /
        (P<sub>n</sub> + P<sub>r,e</sub>). The waste heat HEAT<sub>DC</sub>
        = P<sub>CP</sub> (and similarly for TC). The net electric power
        output is: </p>
      <p>P<sub>net</sub> = P<sub>DC</sub> + P<sub>TC</sub> - P<sub>circ</sub>.
      </p>
      <p>The waste heat from ACCEL is: </p>
      <p>HEAT<sub>acc</sub> = P<sub>circ</sub> - P<sub>I</sub>. </p>

      <p><i>4.5 ~ Discussion of Efficiencies</i> </p>
      <p>The efficiencies are displayed in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>
      </p>
      <p>Accelerator Efficiency, n<sub>I</sub>&nbsp; : So far, there has
        been no demand to the accelerator manufacturers to increase the
        efficiencies of ion accelerators. Efficiencies of commercially
        produced 2 MeV electron accelerators with the isolated curve
        transformer, ICT, are: power line-to-tube = 0.9; and
        tube-to-beam = 0.9. In a mature design, some or all P<sub>circ</sub>
        from direct converter (decelerator) to the accelerator will flow
        directly, from each ring of decelerator to the corresponding
        accelerator ring, i.e., deceleration and acceleration will be in
        the same tank. Thus, we take: n<sub>I</sub> = 0.9. We think the
        eventual injector will be Linac whose <i>n</i> is known to
        increase with the beam power and can probably exceed 0.9 under a
        development program. An inverse cyclotron-type a.f. direct
        converter has been proposed, too. The natural operating
        frequency of this converter can be made equal to the optimum
        accelerating frequency of the Linac. </p>
      <p>Thermal conversion efficiency: n<sub>TH</sub> = 0.4 was used in
        all cases. </p>
      <p>Direct conversion efficiency, n<sub>DC</sub> : Studies of
        direct conversion collectors in the KeV range at LLL have
        indicated&nbsp; n<sub>DC</sub> = 0.88 - 0.97. The migma program
        envisages an efficient system using the decelerator technique. </p>
      <p>Minimal efficiency for direct conversion nmin is obtained by
        seeking the value of n<sub>DC</sub> when P<sub>net</sub>&nbsp; =
        0 which implies "engineering breakeven". N<sub>min</sub> are
        given in Column 3 of Table 1. We see that the migma system will
        be self-sustained for n<sub>DC</sub> as low as 0.3 for mixed
        fuels. The situation is most difficult for pure He<sup>3</sup>,
        which requires n<sub>min</sub> = 0.7 with the state-of-the-art
        technology. We note, however, that in arriving at n<sub>min</sub>,
        we assume the simplest conversion into heat, n<sub>TH</sub> =
        0.4, without the advanced thermal conversion methods such as
        electrochemical with n<sub>TH</sub> &gt; 0.65. </p>
      <p>A simplified relation between the minimum efficiency, nmin, and
        the ratio of the fusion raction energy to the energy invested in
        the colliding ions, W/2T<sub>i</sub> is given by: </p>
      <p>(2)&nbsp;<img src="1eq2.jpg" height="66" width="221"> </p>
      <p>Equation (2) is obtained from Equation (9) of p. 79 of Ref. 19,
        with n<sub>i</sub> = n<sub>f</sub> = n<sub>nf</sub> = n<sub>min</sub>
        and G = 1 (breakeven). It shows a weak dependence of the
        efficiencies on G or the more commonly used Q. Letting n<sub>t</sub>
        &lt;<i>ov</i>&gt; = 0.5, we obtain the minimum efficiencies for
        the three types of fuels: </p>
      <p>(3) Pure He<sup>3</sup>: n<sub>min</sub> ~ 0.74 </p>
      <p>(4) Pure D: n<sub>min</sub> ~&nbsp; 0.66 </p>
      <p>(5) Mixed He<sup>3</sup>: n<sub>min</sub> ~&nbsp; 0.34 </p>
      <p>The values (3-5) should be compared with more accurate
        estimates in Table 1. </p>
      <p><i>4.6 ~ Technical Problem I: Superconductive Magnet</i> </p>
      <p>The superconductive magnet that can be designed and made today
        would not allow for space between the migma chamber and the
        magnet structure, which must be occupied by the neutron
        modulator and absorber. Pure D fuel will be releasing 1.1 MW,
        and He<sup>3</sup>-D, &lt;0.1 MW of neutron power. This power
        cannot be taken by the superconducting magnet cooling system, as
        it will result in a very high rate of liquid helium boil-off.
        Only pure He<sup>3</sup> is neutron-free. Therefore, we are
        forced to consider only the He<sup>3</sup> fuel as the
        possibility for our first migma fusion power amplifier. </p>
      <p><i>4.7 ~ Technical Problem II: Ion Current</i> </p>
      <p>Column 1 of <a href="#table1">Table 2</a> reveals the problem
        # II: Ion currents of the order of 1 to 2.4 amps are needed at
        Megavolt accelerating voltages. Technology of ampere ion
        accelerators at Megavolts is under development for the super
        high energy accelerator at CERN in Geneva. Also, R.Martin is
        developing an 0.5 amp 4 MV machine for inertial fusion at
        Argonne. From an accelerator that may be built commercially, we
        hope to get 0.03 amps of He<sup>3</sup>. This limits the power
        output to about 1% of the values listed in Columns 6-8, i.e.,
        from 6 MW to 60 KW (case A), and from 180 KW to 2 KW (case B) </p>
      <p><i>5. ~ Conclusions</i> </p>
      <p>Referring to <a href="#table1">Tables 1, 2, and 3</a>, a
        number of conclusions can be drawn. We selected some of them: </p>
      <p>Conclusion I ~ Using mixed fuel D-He<sup>3</sup>, driven power
        amplifiers with gain Q = 3 would produce net useful power of 2
        MW, if direct conversion efficiency of 0.9 can be achieved.
        However, the superconductive magnet, giving 7 tesla in the
        middle of the cell, of sufficiently large size needed to avoid
        the neutron-induced liquid helium boil-off is not within the
        state-of-the-art. </p>
      <p>Conclusion II ~ Mixed fuel D-He<sup>3</sup> migmacell would
        operate at the engineering breakeven, with as low a direct
        conversion efficiency as 0.3, if the neutron problem can be
        handled. </p>
      <p>Conclusion III ~ Pure D fueled migmacell could generate 0.6 MW
        with direct conversion efficiency of as low as 0.7, when 2 amps
        of D<sup>3+</sup> ions current at 2 MeV becomes available, and
        if the neutron problem can be handled. </p>
      <p>Conclusion IV ~ Pure He<sup>3</sup> fuel is the only one for
        which a large enough superconductive magnet can be built with
        certainty, but it requires an accelerator delivering 1 amp of He<sup>3+</sup>
        ions at 4 MV, in which case it will have a fusion gain of 2 and
        a useful power output of &gt;1 MW, provided a direct conversion
        efficiency of 0.9 is possible. </p>
      <p><i>6. ~ Our Experimental Progress</i> </p>
      <p>We have built four operational laboratory models of migmacell
        named Migma I, II, III and IV. We did experiments with the first
        three models. We have achieved: </p>
      <p>6.1 ~ a reliable production of D (and He<sup>3</sup>) migma
        (Fig. 4, 5, 6); </p>
      <p>6.2 ~ an energy confinement time of (2.21 <u>+</u> 0.05)
        seconds (Fig. 7. 8); </p>
      <p>6.3 ~ a collisional energy of about 1 MeV. To achieve the same
        collisional speeds in a plasma, plasma would have to be heated
        to 10 billion degrees centigrade, this is 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup>
        higher than the equivalent temperature of plasma fusion devices
        (Fig. 9); </p>
      <p>6.4 ~ the total number of deuterium ions stored in Migma III of
        1.4 x 10<sup>10</sup>. This number is limited by the injection
        rate and vacuum, which were 0.1 and 6 x 10<sup>-8</sup> torr,
        respectively. The volume average ion density was n<sub>v</sub> =
        ( 1.25 <u>+</u> 0.4 ) x 10<sup>8</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>; the
        central peak density n<sub>c</sub> = ( 2.2 <u>+</u> 0.7 ) x 10<sup>9</sup>
        cm<sup>-3</sup>; and the effective average density n<sub>eff</sub>
        = 3.5 x 10<sup>8</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>. </p>
      <p>Migma has exhibited no instabilities at this density. In
        contrast, a plasma machine with the similar embodiment, DCX-1 of
        the 1950s, had shown clear "negative mass" instability at 1000
        times lower density. Our theoretical calculations show that the
        migma orbit configuration ("rosette") is responsible for this
        stability (See Sect. 2.7). </p>
      <p>6.6 ~ The product of density and confinement time achieved is:
      </p>
      <p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp; n<sub>vt</sub> = 4 x 10<sup>8</sup> scm<sup>-3</sup>&nbsp;
and





      </p>
      <p>(7) n<sub>ct</sub> = 5 x 10<sup>9</sup> scm<sup>-3</sup> </p>
      <p>This is a 10<sup>4</sup> fold improvement over Migma III. </p>
      <p>6.7 ~ The overall performance indicator (Ref. 75, 76), the
        product of temperature, density, and time reached T<sub>nt</sub>
        is 1 to 5 x 10<sup>9</sup> MeV sec cm<sup>-3</sup>. </p>
      <p>Figure 10 shows that this value T<sub>nt</sub> has put migma in
        the same ball park as the leading fusion devices. We wish to
        point out that while the new criterion (Ref. 75, 76) is better
        than that of Lawson, it does not provide information as to how
        near the device is from making energy. The unified criterion
        (Ref. 77) of proximity to controlled fusion is an attempt to
        provide that. </p>
      <p>6.8 ~ Migma IV is expected to leap 100 fold to 1000 fold in the
        overall performance from Migma III. This is expected by the
        100-1000 fold increase in density and 3 fold increase in the
        confinement itme. To accomplish this, a 100 times better vacuum,
        and 20 times better ion injection is needed. In the test runs in
        December 1976, we have achieved (ref. 74) the pumping speed of
        10,000 liters/sec., and a vacuum of better than 10<sup>-9</sup>
        torr has been maintained while 0.5 ms of ion beam (7 fold
        increase over Migma III) was being continuously injected into
        the chamber. The experiments with this system could not be done
        because of lack of funds. The tests with Migma IV are considered
        "critical" because the migma fuel will enter the regime in which
        the ( w<sub>p</sub> / w<sub>c</sub> )<sup>2</sup> exceeds 10. </p>
      <p><i>7. ~ Economic Projections of Migma Fusion</i> </p>
      <p>An elaborate economic study, using the generally established
        procedures in estimating and projecting capital, operating and R
        &amp; D costs for power plants shows that migma fusion can
        generate electricity for 1cent/KW to 6 cent/KWh, depending on
        the level of development which is competitive with present power
        sources. It also indicates that present power sources are
        subject to large increases in costs. </p>
      <p>These projections have been made without invoking a crash
        program, i.e., on the conservative assumption if no
        extraordinary intense development effort that may be dictated,
        for example, by a crisis. </p>

      and dissociated within 0.5 cm from the center of the
      superconductive magnet with central field strength of 3.3 Tesla.
      The 2-step dissociation process starts with the Lorentz and gas
      dissociation, creating "seed" migma, then collisional dissociation
      takes over. The distribution of locii of D<sup>2</sup>
      dissociation is shown in Fig. 5, and the migma density
      distribution in Fig. 6. Statistical fluctuations in the migma ions
      induce rf currents in a pair of discs (not shown) placed above and
      below the migma. This is picked up as an incoherent rf signal
      whose power is proportional to the numer of ions in migma. At 10<sup>-7</sup>
      torr, 10<sup>10</sup> d+ were stored for 2 seconds. Both the
      number and confinement time were limited by vacuum (From ref. 24).</blockquote>

      dissociated uniformly throughout the chamber by collisions with
      the residual gas. The narrowness of the observed peak indicates a
      highly localized dissociation process near the center. We
      postulated but have not proven the two-step process. See caption
