      </center>
      <p>This invention relates to nuclear fusion reactors, and more
        particularly, but not exclusively, to a method and means for
        deriving electrical power from nuclear fusion produced by the
        self-colliding of the ions within a mixture of accelerated ions
        of like charge in a magnetic field. </p>
      <p>In the field of nuclear energy and nuclear power generation, it
        is advantageous to use the nuclear process in which two ions
        (nuclei) collide and form, as a result of their interaction, new
        ions (nuclei), the sum of whose masses is smaller than the sum
        of the masses of the two original colliding ions, the mass
        difference being converted into the kinetic energy of the new
        ions (nuclei). </p>
      <p>Various means have been proposed to this end comprising the
        systems described in the review: "Controlled Fusion Research and
        High Temperature Plasmas" published in <i>Annual Review of
          Nuclear Science</i>, vol 20 (970), p. 509, <i>et seq</i>.
        However, these and the other systems proposed or attempted
        heretofore are based on a plasma thermonuclear approach; that
        is, they employ various means to heat neutral and negative ions
        (nuclei, molecules and electrons) to a high enough kinetic
        temperature so that the ions gain sufficiently high velocities
        to overcome their electrostatic repulsion and thus undergo the
        fusion reaction by collision. None of the hitherto proposed
        devices associates self-trapping and self-colliding features;
        stable self-confinement for periods of seconds; automatic
        multiple traversal and high kinetic temperature of the order of
        over a thousand million degrees needed to produce a sufficient
        number of nuclear reactions for the net production of fusion
        energy; nor do they have, because of the relatively high plasma
        densities involved, the possibility for conversion of the fusion
        energy into electricity in a simple manner. </p>
      <p>Historically, the idea of achieving nuclear fusion in colliding
        beams of positively charged ions is at least 20 years old. The
        rejection of the idea is very nearly as old. The main problem
        encountered has been that the Coulomb scattering removes
        particles from the reacting beam so much faster than fusion
        occurs that producing a net power output is hopeless. </p>
      <p>Recently, however, several developments have occurred which
        make this old idea look very attractive. Firstly, the concept of
        self-colliding orbits was conceived in 1969 by R. Macek and B.
        Maglich and published in the paper "The Principle of
        Self-Colliding Orbits and its Possible Application to pi-pi and
        mu-mu Collisons", published in <i>Particle Accelerators,</i>
        vol. 1, p. 121-136 (1970). Secondly, it was realized that this
        concept, originally proposed for collisions of particles of
        opposite charges, makes possible mixing of positively charged
        particle beams and head-on collisions of the particles of the
        same charge in spite of the fact that they precess in the same
        direction. Thirdly, it was realized that this concept makes
        possible the construction of a device which produces automatic
        return to the reaction region of elastically scattered particles
        in one revolution, i.e., instantaneously, thus increasing the
        probability of self-collision between the particles. Fourthly,
        it was realized that the vertical and horizontal focusing in
        such a self-colliding device is capable of greatly reducing
        losses due to elastic scattering beyond the vertical and
        horizontal confinement angle, namely, that the effect of
        focusing on the scattering of ions with residual gas which was
        originally found in the accelerator studies and published e.g.
        by Fisher in "Residual gas scattering, beam intensity, and
        interaction rate in proton storage rings" CERN Report ISR-VAC
        167-16, is also applicable to the scattering between accelerated
        ions in the organized mixture of ions. Fifthly, it was realized
        that by using deuterons and injecting them into the
        self-colliding device with a particular range of energies, a
        breeding effect can be achieved releasing significantly greater
        ion energy per fusion. </p>
      <p>Finally, the first device for colliding beams of nuclei, the
        CERN Intersecting Storage Rings at Geneva, has provided
        supporting experimental information on the long-term stabilities
        of organized systems of colliding positively charged ions in
        contrast to the well-known instabilities problem with plasmas.
        In particular, it was found empirically, that the removal of the
        electrons from the colliding system by the use of clearing
        fields and ultra-high vacuum increases the stability of the
        colliding beams by a factor of 10<sup>5</sup> (see report by K.
        Johnson in Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on
        High-Energy Accelerators --- CERN 1971). </p>
      <p>According to the present invention there is provided a fusion
        reactor comprising: </p>
      <p>(a) means defining an evacuated volume having a central axis
        and a center plane normal thereto; </p>
      <p>(b) means for producing a magnetic field within said volume
        which field decreases with the radial distance from the central
        axis and increases with the distance along the central axis from
        the center plane; </p>
      <p>(c) means for injecting ions of like charge from the periphery
        into the vicinity of said magnetic field with induced vertical
        oscillation and with an initial rate of injection sufficient to
        produce fusion reactions by the collisions of the resultant
        orbitally precessing ions with each other. </p>
      <p>According to the present invention there is also provided a
        method for controlled release of nuclear fusion power,
        comprising the steps of: </p>
      <p>(a) producing a magnetic field within an evacuated reaction
        volume having a central axis and a center plane normal thereto,
        the strength of which field decreases with the radial distance
        from the central axis and increases with the distance along the
        central axis from the center plane so as to induce precession
        of. And exert radial and axial focusing forces on, orbiting ions
        within said volume; and </p>
      <p>&nbsp;(b) injecting a beam of ions of like charge from the
        periphery into the vicinity of the center of symmetry of said
        magnetic field with induced vertical oscillation and with an
        initial rate of injection sufficient to produce fusion reactions
        by the collisions of the resultant orbitally precessing ions
        with each other. </p>
      <p>According to the present invention there is also provided a
        fusion reactor comprising: </p>
      <p>(a) means for defining an evacuated volume; </p>
      <p>(b) a plurality of cell means within said volume, each having a
        central axis and a venter plane intersecting normally at a
        center of symmetry and means for producing a magnetic field
        therein which field decreases with the radial distance from the
        central axis and increases with the distance along the central
        axis from the center plane; and </p>
      <p>(c) means for injecting ions of like charge into each of said
        cell means from the periphery into the vicinity of the center of
        symmetry of its magnetic field with induced vertical oscillation
        and with an initial rate of injection sufficient to produce
        fusion reactions by the collisions of the resultant orbitally
        precessing ions with each other; </p>
      <p>(d) said cell means being arranged in a three-dimensional
        matrix with their central axes and center planes in substantial
        alignment. </p>
      <p>Embodiment of the present invention include a magnetic field
        which decreases with the radial distance from its central axis
        and increases with the distance along the central axis from its
        center plane, so that injected accelerated ion beams are mixed
        in an organized manner in precessing orbits designed so as to
        make them collide head-on or nearly head-on in the central
        region of the device continuously and automatically; and ions
        that have not undergone fusion are continuously and
        automatically retuned by the field to the collision region, thus
        considerably increasing the collision probability through
        self-multiplication of collisions by such multiple traversals
        which may occur on the order of 10<sup>8</sup> per second. </p>
      <p>The collision probability is further increased by accelerating
        (rather than by heating) the ions to an energy at which the
        reaction parameter (the product of the fusion cross-section and
        the relative ion velocity) is maximized. For example, in the
        preferred embodiment described below, deuterons are accelerated
        to an energy of 2.6 MeV which corresponds to a kinetic
        temperature of collision of over 10 thousand million degrees
        centigrade; at these temperatures, the reaction parameter for
        deuteron-deuteron fusion is about 104 times larger than at
        thermonuclear temperatures. </p>
      <p>Additionally in embodiments of the present invention, the
        properties of the self-colliding orbits can be exploited to
        inject and confine the atomic nuclei without external means,
        namely based purely on their "self-trapping" processes to be
        explained below, thus differing from all other injection and
        containment schemes hitherto proposed for fusion devices. </p>
      <p>Also in embodiments of the present invention by limiting the
        injection energy of the deuterons to a particular range, it is
        possible to achieve a breeding effect such that seven times more
        ion energy per fusion is released as compared with other ranges
        of injection energy. </p>
      <p>Finally, embodiments of the present invention may have means to
        maintain the density of the organizes ion mixture along with a
        geometrical configuration of the magnetic field producing coils
        and the external electrical fields in such manner that the
        charged nuclei resulting from the fusion reactions may have
        their energy directly converted into electric energy by a
        decelerating electric potential outside the magnetic field. </p>
      <p>An advantageous consequence is miniaturization in the field of
        nuclear power sources based on simple elements with sizes of the
        order on one-inch radius, particularly suited to economical mass
        production. </p>
      <p>For the purpose of the following description the organized
        mixture of precessing self-colliding orbits of positively
        charged ions will be referred to as a migma (Greek word for
        mixture). An elemental migma fusion power source device
        disclosed herein will be referred to as a migmacell. A migma
        fusion reactor consists of a plurality of migmacells. </p>
      <p>The invention will now be described by way of example with
        reference to the accompanying drawings, in which the elements
        have like references, and </p>
      <p>Figures 1a and 1b are graphic diagrams of the shape of a
        magnetic field B<sub>z</sub> as a function of a radius <i>r</i>,
        and the vertical distance from a center plane <i>z</i>,
        respectively, for the ion orbits shown in Figure 3a and 3b. The
        equations describing this field are approximately given by </p>
      <p>B<sub>z</sub> = B<sub>o</sub> [ 1-k (r/R)<sup>2</sup> + 2k
        (z/R)<sup>2</sup> ] </p>
      <p>where the constant k is the "field index", less than 1; and B<sub>o</sub>
        is the field at the center; and this field shape can be obtained
        in a number of ways by combining two or more pairs of coils.
        Figure 1c is an example of the simplest configuration of coils
        to achieve the field (the correction coils are not shown). </p>

        in the head-on collision configuration at the center, with a
        multiple traversal factor of about 10<sup>8</sup>/sec. For
        simplicity of presentation, the orbits are drawn as circles (the
        true shape of the orbits is shown in Figure 2a. </p>

        respectively in the horizontal (3a) and vertical (3b) plane in a

        the deuteron was scattered through a vertical angle of 10° at
        the center; its automatic return to the center is facilitated by
        the focusing properties of the field. Figure 3c shows the
        vertical oscillations vs. time of the deuteron shown in Figure
        3b; the small dots are equally spaced markers to correlate the
        various projections at equal times. Note that large values of r
        correspond to large values of <i>z</i>. </p>

        charge transfer. The line (d) is the ration of the charged
        energy release in d-d fusion, 0.7 W over the injected energy 2T,
        minus 0.3 (the latter term following from the fact that a
        fraction of the injected energy is carried by the uncharged
        neutron). To have a net energy generation, the sum of (a), (b)
        and (c) must lie below (d). A vacuum of 10 <sup>-11</sup> torr
        is assumed in computing the curve. </p>

      <p>Referring first to Figure 2a, the path of an ion 100
        circulating in an orbit 101 off center in a magnetic field
        acting perpendicularly to the plane of the figure is shown. For
        concreteness, the large circle of radius R may be thought of as
        a pole tip. The ion orbit 101 has radius a ~ ½ R. </p>
      <p>If the magnetic field is not homogeneous but decreases slightly
        towards the outside, that is, has the shape given in Figures 1a
        and 1b, the circular orbit 101 will not close, but will precess
        about the center of symmetry O<sub>1</sub>, as shown in Figures
        2a and 2b. In Figure 2c it will be seen that orbit 101 reverses
        the particle velocity vector after half a precession period, ½ <i>tp</i>.
        If a second ion 200 is injected at that time with an orbit 102
        as shown in Figure 2c, the two paths 101 and 102 meet head-on at
        the center O<sub>I</sub>, which facilitates a head-on collision
        between the between the ions and results in fusion, if the ions
        are deuterons or some other ions that can undergo a fusion
        reaction. The two orbits 101 and 102 continue precessing as
        shown in Figure 2d, about the center O1, maintaining their
        head-on collision configuration which, in turn, may result in
        about 10<sup>8</sup> multiple traversals, by the ions per
        second. This increases their collision probability by the same
        factor. </p>
      <p>The described system of two revolving, and at the same time
        precessing, particle trajectories is similar to the common
        household dual-rotor mixer, which combines both rotor and the
        mixing bowl rotation. The main differences are: (1) the
        colliding orbits "rotate" in the same direction, which cannot be
        done in the cited mechanical system without rotor collision; and
        (2) a migma precesses typically at a rate of about 10<sup>9</sup>
        RPM, having no moving parts. </p>
      <p>A more efficient orbit configuration is shown in Figures 3a and
        3b, resulting from particles of like charge which have been
        continuously injected into the center of the magnetic field for
        one precession period or more so that the magnetic field region
        ios filled with orbiting particles. </p>

        orbits are predetermined so as to produce an automatic return to
        the central zone of all particles, by virtue of horizontal and
        vertical focusing by the field. Any perturbation of a particle
        in the central zone, such as caused by scattering between migma
        particles, will be overcome and the particle restored to its
        orbit within one revolution period by these forces, regardless
        of the energy transfer to it (or from it) during the collisions;
        and regardless of its angle, provided the vertical component of
        the perturbation is not above the vertical confinement angle of
        the device (i.e. the orbital angle with respect to the central
        plane above which the ion overcomes the vertical focusing forces
        and leaves the migma). This return effect is due to the fact
        that, contrary to the situation in plasmas, the migma orbits are
        large compared to the size of the device so that the field
        gradient across the orbit is large too, and the net focusing
        forces are felt by the particles in every turn. By way of
        contrast it should be realized that the gyroradius of plasma
        orbits is very small so that it takes very many turns of the
        plasma ion to move from the strong field region into a region of
        weak field (and vice versa) thus resulting in slow restoring
        forces. </p>
      <p>This return effect is illustrated in Figure 3b for a vertical
        scattering through O<sub>z</sub> = 10° and a field index <i>k</i>
        = 0.2. </p>
      <p>This automatic return feature within the closed axially
        symmetric system makes a migmacell advantageous over the simple
        concept of two colliding ion beams as used in the previously
        mentioned CERN Intersecting Storage Rings. By comparison, a
        migma is the equivalent of an infinite number of colliding beams
        all intersecting at one point with all crossing angles confined
        to a single volume. </p>
      <p>One simple shape of the magnetic field preferred for the
        migmacell which has the requisite precessing and focusing
        properties is given by the equation: </p>
      <p>(1) B<sub>z</sub> = B<sub>o</sub> [ 1 - k ( r / R )<sup>2</sup>
        ---&gt; 2k ( z / R )<sup>2</sup> ],&nbsp;<img src="form1.jpg"
          height="27" width="343"> </p>
      <p>where <i>r</i> is the distance from the axis of the field, R
        measures the physical size of the field, and <i>k</i> (&lt;1)
        the field index determines both the strength of the vertical
        focusing and the precession rate. </p>
      <p>An example of a simple coil configuration for producing a
        magnetic field such as given by equation (1) is shown in Figure
        1c. Two pairs of coils 1a and 1b, and 2a and 2b are wound
        co-axially about a central axis Z in the same direction so as to
        carry current in the same direction, over respective stainless
        steel tubes 3a and 3b,and 4a and 4b. The opposing coils in each
        pair are equidistantly spaced from each other so as to define a
        central plane for the system, that is a plane perpendicular to
        the Z axis and half-way between the opposing surfaces of the
        respective pairs of coils, which is indicated by the line r in
        Figure 1c. The intersection of the Z-axis with the central plane
        will be the center of symmetry of the magnetic field and a
        central zone of the system which may be defined as a spherical
        volume with its center at the center of symmetry and having a
        radius of about 10% of the radial distance from the center of
        symmetry to the outer edges of the outermost coils 1a and 1b.
        Preferably, the opening between the outer edges of the outermost
        pair of coils 1a and 1b defines a radial angle <i>B</i> of
        approximately 45° with respect to the center of symmetry. </p>
      <p>A pair of jackets 5 and 6 for conducting cooling agents is
        disposed about each of these sets of coils. For clarity, these
        cooling jackets 5 and 6 are only shown disposed about the lower
        set of coils in Figure 1c, but it will be understood that the
        system is completely symmetrical about the central plane. The
        inner jacket 5 may contain circulating liquid helium to
        facilitate superconductivity in the surrounded coils. The outer
        jacket 6 may contain circulating liquid hydrogen to facilitate
        removal of heat generated by stray ions from the migma which may
        strike and impart their energy to it. </p>
      <p>To provide for the clearing fields for low energy electrons,
        two pairs of metallic plates 7a, 7b and 8a, 8b are disposed
        within the magnetic field as shown in Figure 1c at suitable
        electric potentials with respect to one another with polarities
        as noted in the figure. The combination of the two pairs of
        plates makes the average electrical field felt by a precessing
        ion equal to zero if the right-hand pair of plates 7a, 7b sets
        up an electric field opposite in sign but equal in magnitude to
        the left-hand pair of plates 8a, 8b. Each of the plates may be
        approximately semicircular in plan view. </p>
      <p>Superconducting leads 9 and 10 to the respective cooling
        jackets 5 and 6 as well as the leads 11 and 12 to the clearing
        field plates 7a and 8a, respectively, are shown in the upper
        part of Figure 1c only. The stainless steel bar 110 between the
        leads 9 and 10 provides rigid support. </p>
      <p>The precession period tp and the revolution period tR
        (cyclotron period) are related approximately by: </p>

        For the preferred embodiment k = 0.8, a = 2 cm, B<sub>o</sub> =
        200 Kgauss, v = 1.5 x 10<sup>9&nbsp; </sup>cm (2.2 MeV
        deuterons), <i>tp</i> ~ 3 x 10<sup>-8</sup> sec. The preferred
        embodiment will be described in terms of the injection and
        collisions of 2.2 MeV deuteron ions producing the fusion
        reactions: d + d --&gt; He<sub>3</sub> + n and d + d --&gt; t +
        p and releasing about 2.6 MeV per reaction in charged energy on
        the average. However, all the statements are generally valid for
        all kinds of fusion reactions, for example, d + t --&gt; He<sub>4</sub>
        + n and d + Li<sub>6</sub> --&gt; 2 He<sub>4</sub>. </p>
      <p>It is apparent from Figures 3a and 3b that both the radial and
        vertical density of particles in a migma are highly peaked in
        the central zone. The migma density, that is, ion density, as a
        function of the distance from the center is shown by the solid
        line in Figure 4. </p>
      <p>This is one of the advantageous features of a migma. The
        particles are concentrated so much in the center where the
        particles have large relative velocities, v12, that the
        probability of fusion reactions is greatly enhanced. Typically,
        50% of the reactions occur in 2% of the radius. </p>
      <p>Hence, a migma may be thought of as a spherical "core" on the
        order of 1 mm in radius, surrounded by a "cloud" of root mean
        square radius of about 3 cm which is relatively inert. These
        dimensions are given for a preferred embodiment (2.2 MeV
        deuterons in a central field B<sub>o</sub> = 200 Kgauss and the
        field index <i>k</i> = 0.8). </p>
      <p>Because of the high density and high relative velocities at the
        center, most Coulomb scattering will occur there. However, since
        it is a property of the migma configuration that any particle
        leaving the center will be returned to the center, the losses
        due to Coulomb scattering will be reduced by orders of magnitude
        from those that would occur in a colliding beam system. An
        additional mechanism that reduces multiple scattering losses is
        the restoring force of the radial and axial focusing of the
        magnetic field described by Equation (1) and Figures 1a and 1b.
      </p>
      <p>The current density <i>c</i> = distribution in a migma is also
        shown in Figure 4 as the dotted line. It should be noted that
        where the charge density is highest (at the center), the current
        is zero. The magnetic field due to this current is a negligible
        perturbation to the guiding field. </p>
      <p>A further advantageous feature of a migma is that, while all
        crossing angles from 0° to 180° are allowed, the average
        crossing or intersecting angle is about 155° since it is very
        likely that two orbits will overlap somewhat so that there will
        be two intersections between them near the center. Thus, the
        near head-on collisions are enhanced. This is shown in the plot
        of Figure 5. </p>
      <p>The energy distribution of particles in a migma is distinctly
        non-Maxwellian, being very sharply peaked at the injection
        energy (see Figure 6). The effective energy dispersion which
        combined the energy and angular spread (emittance) is made
        sufficiently large to avoid the negative-mass and other known
        accelerator type instabilities. </p>
      <p>The effective kinetic energy of the collision of an ion with
        injection energy T<sub>1</sub> is seen by another ion of the
        same mass at an angle <i>a</i> is given by T<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>
        = 2T<sub>1</sub> ( 1 - cos <i>a</i> ). Since the average
        crossing angle is <i>a</i> = 155° , the average effective
        collision energy is about 4 times the injection energy. As a
        result, unlike in a plasma, 80% of the particle pairs in a migma
        collide at an energy greater than the injection energy. This is
        seen in the plot in Figure 7. </p>
      <p>The energy distributions shown in Figures 6 and 7 are true only
        at the time of injection however. The multiple collisions will
        gradually spread the special extent of the migma, which, in
        turn, will lead to losses of fast particles and eventually
        "thermalize" the distribution down to Maxwellian. But, this
        process is comparatively slow and the fusion energy will be
        extracted long before this happens. </p>
      <p>For instance, the d-d relaxation time for 2.2 MeV deuterons is
        of the order of 10<sup>3</sup> seconds. In contrast, the present
        intention is to store and siphon off energy of the order of 1%
        of the total potential migmacell energy in about 1 second and to
        refill the migmacell in the same time, thus maintaining the
        non-thermal energy distribution shown in Figures 6 and 7 by
        virtue of this continuous regeneration. </p>
      <p>An important advantage of the migmacell is that the particles
        in the preferred embodiment will be injected with energies above
        2 MeV as opposed to energies of 1<sup>-10</sup> KeV in current
        plasma machines. Figure 8 shows the benefit of the higher
        energies in larger fusion parameter &lt;<i>dv</i>&gt;, where the
        averaging was done for migma velocity distribution. </p>
      <p>It will be noted that two head-on colliding deuterons of 2.2
        MeV correspond to about a 10 MeV laboratory deuteron incident on
        a stationary target. In terms of kinetic "temperature" --- if it
        has meaning here --- 10 MeV corresponds to about 10<sup>21</sup>°
        degrees. </p>
      <p>Unlike in a plasma, the kinetic energy of the fusion products
        is of the same order of magnitude as the kinetic energy of the
        primary deuterons, thus it can be recuperated by the same
        technique used to extract the kinetic energy from the fusion
        products. The relatively low migma density allows the singly
        charged products to fly out of the reaction volume without
        interacting. Thus by disposing an array of positively charged
        plates outside of the reaction volume all of their energy can be
        recovered directly as electrical energy. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, by choosing a relatively high kinetic energy for
        the injected deuterons, the fusion reaction products are highly
        peaked along the velocity collision direction. Since the
        collision direction in the central zone lies in (or nearly in)
        the central plane, and most of the fusion reactions take place
        in the central zone 90% of the charged fusion products leave the
        zone within a radial angle of about 22.5° about the central
        plane, without interacting with the field coils. </p>
      <p>The present fusion method is therefore "non-thermonuclear"
        because no attempt is made to heat the ionized deuterium gas to
        thermonuclear kinetic temperature, 1 to 10 KeV. The present
        method starts with accelerated ions about 1,000 times more
        energetic and in the form of beams; and fires them against each
        other in a special manner. The energy distribution is not
        allowed to become Maxwellian in a migmacell. The magnetic field
        which confined the migma is more a guiding field than a
        "pressure field", as it is required to contain particles of only
        one charge and having a very restricted set of momenta and
        positions. In contrast, the magnetic field of plasma devices
        must contain particles of both signs having a great variety of
        momenta and positions. </p>
      <p>And finally, since it is an essential part of the device to
        remove the electrons from the migmacell by means of clearing
        fields, such as by the pairs of plates 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b shown in
        Figure 1c, and keep the electron/ion ratio at the 10<sup>-2</sup>
        level or less, the electron ion thermal equilibrium --- an
        essential feature of plasma --- is meaningless here. The
        consequence of the absence of the electrons is that the energy
        losses due to synchrotron radiation and bremsstrahlung are
        absent in a migma. </p>
      <p>The maximum total number of ions, N, that can be stored in a
        migmacell is determined by the "Space Charge Limit". This limit
        is reached when the electrostatic repulsion of the migma on an
        iuon becomes equal to the focusing restoring force. The space
        charge limit N is for the preferred embodiment with a magnetic
        field of B<sub>o</sub> = 200 Kgauss and 2.2 MeV deuterons: </p>
      <p>(3) N = 4 x 10<sup>12</sup> ions </p>
      <p>N is proportional to the injection energy to the 3/2 power. </p>
      <p>The fusion reaction rate <i>I</i> of a migmacell is
        proportional to N<sup>2</sup> and is approximately given by: </p>
      <p>(4) <i>I</i> = 1 x 10<sup>25</sup> &lt;<i>dv</i>&gt; fusions
        per second. </p>
      <p>Which for 2.2 MeV deuterons gives from the diagram in Figure 8,
      </p>
      <p>(5) <i>I</i> = 2 x 10<sup>10</sup> fusions per second. </p>
      <p>This gives a net charged power production in a steady state
        regime in which the losses are continuously replenished by new
        injection: </p>
      <p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Net Power = 3 m Watt per migmacell </p>
      <p><b>Criticality Condition for the Migmacell Source ~</b> </p>
      <p>The condition for a critical power source is obtained from the
        requirement that the electric energy output be at least equal to
        the energy input, the input rate being balanced by&nbsp; losses.
        The three main loss mechanisms in a migmacell are: (a)
        peripheral multiple scattering, (b) vertical multiple
        scattering, and (c) charge transfer in gas (see Figure 9). If T<sub>1</sub>
        is the deuteron injection energy, the charged power output, W,
        to total power input has been found to be: </p>
      <p>(7) 0.71 W / 2T<sub>1</sub> = 0.3 </p>
      <p>The sum of the ratio of all three losses to the fusion rate
        must be smaller than the value of Equation (7) in order to
        achieve a critical power source. Referring to Figure 9, this
        implies that the sum of all three curves (a), (b), and (c) must
        be below the "criticality line" given by Equation (7). We can
        see that this condition is easily met for deuteron injection
        energies above 0.5 MeV. </p>
      <p><b>Energy Gain Factor of Migmacell Power Source ~</b> </p>
      <p>To determine the energy gain factor in a migmacell ocnsider
        that the gross power output P<sub>+</sub>, and the power input
        in the quasi steady-state regime P<sub>-</sub> may be expressed
        as: </p>
      <p>(8) P<sub>+</sub> = I F<sub>c</sub> ( W + 2T<sub>1</sub> ) </p>
      <p>(9) P<sub>-</sub> = I ( 2 + &gt; ) T<sub>1</sub> </p>
      <p>where I = fusion reaction rate; F<sub>c</sub> = charged
        fraction of the average reaction energy W, T<sub>1</sub> =
        injection energy and lambda the leak losses, which are added to
        reaction losses 2T<sub>1</sub>. Equation (9) means that the
        deuterons are replenished at their loss rate --- the factor 2
        comes from the fact that each fusion process removes 2 deuterons
        from the migma. </p>
      <p>The "energy gain factor" of the migma power source G is defined
        as: </p>
      <p>(10)&nbsp;<img src="form10.jpg" height="44" width="329"> </p>
      <p>Since for the d-d reaction F<sub>c</sub> = 0.71, and W = 3.655
        MeV, the maximum gain factor (lambda = 0) for injection energies
        of 0.5, 1 and 2.2 MeV are G = 230%, 100% and 29% respectively.
        With leak losses of 20% (lambda = 0.2), G = 200%. 82% and 18%
        for T<sub>1</sub> = 0.5, 1 and 2.2 MeV respectively. On the
        other hand the absolute rate of power production is proportional
        to T<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>. Let is define as the earning
        factor E the product: </p>
      <p>(11)&nbsp;&nbsp; E = G T<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> </p>
      <p>Taking into account that the leak losses lambda also decrease
        with the increase of energy, it can be shown that the optimal
        earning factor E is obtained at the highest possible injection
        energy T<sub>1</sub>. This will be shown hereinafter to be 2.2
        MeV for a breeder reactor. </p>
      <p><b>The Method of Injection ~</b> </p>
      <p>The method of injection and trapping of ion beams into a migma,
        which will be called "self-snaring" will now be more fully
        described. It makes use of the salient property of
        self-colliding orbits, that is, the high central density, to
        trap the injected beam by interacting with itself. </p>
      <p>There are two types of self-snaring: (1) the self-ensnaring of
        atomic ions, which will be referred to as "self-trapping" and
        (2) the self-ensnaring of molecular ions, referred to as
        "self-capturing". </p>
      <p><i>Self-Trapping</i> is based on the multiple Couloimb
        scattering in the central region of a migma. In a small region
        at a large radius of the main magnetic field, a perturbing local
        field is created. This local field may be in the form of a
        "magnetic channel", such as described in the text "<i>Particle
          Accelerators</i>" by M.S. Livingston and J.P. Blewett, p. 309,
        <i>et seq. </i>(McGraw-Hill 1962), and is created in a manner
        well known in the synchrocyclotron beam extraction art. The
        magnetic channel will differ from 1-10% in strength from the
        magnitude of the main field given by Equation (1). Ions are
        injected into the center of symmetry of the field from the
        periphery through this magnetic channel. By coordinating, in
        accordance with synchrocyclotron principles, the injection
        angle, the shape of the magnetic channel, the magnetic field
        strength and ion energy, the ion may be kept inside the field
        for many precession periods without violating the well-known
        Liouvilles’s theorem. If the ion is injected at an angle <i>phi
          z</i> to the vertical plane so as to induce vertical
        oscillations, these combined with the precession will keep the
        particle from returning to the entry point for say, <i>v</i>
        precession periods, or for the time <i>v tau p</i>. Note that
        this time is a metastable containment, because it does not
        change the density in phase space. It is suggested by orbit
        studies that for <i>phi z</i> = 10 degrees, the ion can be kept
        in the migma for 40 precession periods, (<i>v</i> = 40). During
        the artificial confinement the ions undergone Coulomb
        interaction between themselves, thus changing their density in
        phase space and gradually resulting in a stable confinement.
        This requires a very fast buildup of the central migma density
        --- a high instantaneous current I<sub>o</sub>. The density will
        increase linearly with time while the scattering rate increases
        quadratically. </p>
      <p>The instantaneous current I<sub>o</sub> needed to have 50%
        particles escape the injection point after precessions is given
        by : </p>
      <p>(12)&nbsp;<img src="form12.jpg" height="46" width="304"> </p>
      <p>where &lt;<i>dv</i>&gt;ms is the product of the cross-section
        for deviation through an angle delta phi by multiple scattering
        averaged over the migma distribution. A Monte Carlo calculation
        shows for <i>delta phi</i> = 2.5 mrad, that&nbsp; &lt;<i>dv</i>&gt;<sub>ms</sub>
        ~ 10<sup> -9</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>. For a field
        index of <i>k</i> = 0.8, <i>tau p</i> ~ 10<sup>-7</sup> sec.,
        so that with <i>v</i> = 40, </p>
      <p>(13)&nbsp;&nbsp; I<sub>o</sub> ~ 10 Amps. </p>
      <p>Such instantaneous currents can be obtained from pulsed ion
        sources (100 microsec. Pulse length) within the realm of present
        technology. </p>
      <p><i>Self-Capturing</i> is the process of injection of molecular
        ions which leads to dissociation collisions in the central zone
        in the same manner as self-trapping leads to multiple
        scattering. The processes are: </p>
      <p>D<sub>2</sub> + D<sub>2</sub> <sup>4</sup> --&gt; 2D<sup>+</sup>
        + e- + D<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>; --&gt; 3D<sup>+</sup> + e<sub>-</sub>
        + D<sup>0</sup>; --&gt; 4D+ + 2e<sub>-</sub>. Since the
        dissociated atoms have one-half of the injected momentum, all of
        them will find themselves captured. </p>

        measured to be <i>o</i> <u>~</u> 1 x 10<sup>-16</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>
        at about 2.2 MeV, so that &lt;<i>ov</i>&gt; ~ 10<sup>-9</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>
        sec<sup>-1</sup>. This gives the same magnitude for the reaction
        parameter &lt;<i>ov</i>&gt; as that for multiple scattering (MS)
        beyond 2.5 mrad. Therefore, for self-capturing, the
        instantaneous current needed is also given by Equation (13). </p>
      <p><b>Method of Breeding Fusion Fuel ~</b> </p>
      <p>A further benefit is obtained by injecting the deuterons into
        the system with energies within a particular range so as to
        produce a "breeding" effect. This improved method wherein the
        injected deuteron-deuteron migma is converted into a deuteron-He<sub>3</sub>
        migma which releases 7 times more ion energy per fusion will now
        be described. </p>
      <p>A deuteron-deuteron migma yields 3 charged fusion products from
        the following two reactions: </p>
      <p>(14) d + d --&gt; t + p + 4.04 MeV (55%) </p>
      <p>(15) d + d --&gt; He<sub>3</sub> + n + 3.27 MeV (45%) </p>
      <p>Since He<sub>3</sub> is doubly charged, it will be appreciated
        that under certain conditions, the exit of the He<sub>3</sub>
        ions from the migma can be prevented while letting the tritons
        and protons fly out, to give their energy to an outside
        electrical system. This latter condition is achieved when the
        deuteron injection energy T<sub>1</sub> is greater than a
        certain value given by: </p>
      <p>(16) T<sub>1</sub><sup>min</sup> = 0.1154 W (dd --&gt; He<sub>3</sub>
        n ) = 377 KeV </p>
      <p>With Equation (16) satisfied, the migma will be continuously
        enriched by the retained He<sub>3</sub> ions which, in turn,
        collide with the deuterons from the migma producing another
        fusion reaction: </p>
      <p>(17) D + He<sub>3</sub> --&gt; He<sub>4</sub> + p + 18.34 MeV </p>
      <p>It can be easily shown that in order to extract the energy from
        the reaction (17) by extracting both the doubly charged He<sub>4</sub>
        and the proton from the migmacell, another condition has to be
        imposed unto the injection energy T<sub>1</sub>. This condition
        is achieved when T<sub>1</sub> is less than a certain value
        given by: </p>
      <p>(18) T<sub>1</sub><sup>max</sup> = W ( d He<sub>3</sub> ) / 8 =
        2.29 MeV </p>
      <p>If the conditions of (16) and (18) are both fulfilled at the
        same time, the He<sub>3</sub> ions will stay inside the migma
        while all the other charged fusion products will exit. Thus, the
        appropriate conditions for fusion fuel breeding occur when the
        deuteron injection energy lies between the limits given by: </p>
      <p>(19)&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.377 MeV &lt; T<sub>1</sub> &lt; 2.29 MeV </p>
      <p>It will now be seen that based on Equation (19) we chose an
        injection energy T<sub>1</sub> = 2.2 MeV for our preferred
        embodiment, although the breeding will be inoperative for a
        range of T<sub>1</sub> within the limits in (19). With: </p>
      <p>(20)&nbsp;&nbsp; T<sub>1</sub> = 2.2 MeV </p>
      <p>the charged fusion products exiting from the migmacell will
        have the following energies: </p>
      <p>(21) triton (t): T<sub>t1</sub> =&nbsp; 2.2 MeV </p>
      <p>proton from d-d (p): </p>
      <p>(22) T<sub>p1</sub>=&nbsp; 6.33 MeV </p>
      <p>proton from He<sub>3</sub>-d(p): </p>
      <p>(23) T<sub>p</sub> = 17.97 MeV </p>
      <p>(24) He<sub>4</sub>: T<sub>4</sub> = 4.49 MeV </p>
      <p>while the He<sub>3</sub> ions whose energy will be: </p>
      <p>(25) He<sub>3</sub>: T<sub>3</sub> = 1.92 MeV </p>
      <p>will be contained within the migmacell and the migma will be
        continuously enriched by the high-power fuel, thus increasing
        the power output beyond the values given by Equation (6), as
        well as the energy gain values computed from Equation(12). </p>
      <p>Broadly speaking, then, breeding is accomplished by matching
        the migmacell radius R to its average magnetic field B to
        satisfy the following relationship: </p>
      <p>(26)&nbsp;<img src="form26.jpg" height="33" width="207"> </p>
      <p>where T<sub>1</sub> is the d+ ion injection energy in KeV,
        given by the limits in (19) and B is in Kilogauss, Equation (26)
        along with (19) defined the conditions for maintaining the He3
        in the migma while extracting all the other fusion products from
        reactions (14), (15), and (17), thus promoting breeding. </p>
      <p><b>Direct Conversion of Fusion Energy into Electricity ~</b> </p>
      <p>A means for converting the energy of the charged products of
        the fusion reactions as well as for recovering the energy of the
        primary injected ions will now be described. It is based on the
        following facts: </p>
      <p>(1) At the high colliding energies considered, 90% of the
        products of fusion reactions are emitted at within 45° of the
        collision plane which is nearly the horizontal plane. </p>
      <p>(2) In the d-d reaction, 71% of the fusion energy is carried by
        the charged particles and 100% in the He<sub>3</sub> + d
        reaction (breeder mode). </p>
      <p>(3) With the deuteron injection energy of 2.2 MeV, the charged
        fusion product ions carry the energies stated in Equations
        (20)-(25). </p>
      <p>Although the magnetic field strength is designed to contain
        both the He<sub>3</sub> and the deuterons, some of these ions
        will leak out of the migmacell as the result of single and
        multiple elastic scattering and the space charge effects ("leak
        losses") at a rate of about 10% of the fusion products rate. </p>
      <p>Since He<sub>3</sub> and He<sub>4</sub> are doubly charged,
        they can be decelerated and fully stopped by positively charged
        plates placed in their path at potentials of 0.96 and 2.2 MeV
        respectively. </p>
      <p>The tritons, the protons from d + d fusion, the protons from He<sub>3</sub>
        + d fusion, and the primary deuterons may be stopped by plates
        at 2.2, 6.3, 18 and 2.2 MV respectively. </p>
      <p>It will be noted that nearly the same potential stops He<sub>4</sub>,
        tritons, and deuterons. This permits the use of four plates to
        stop the six kinds of particles listed in Equation (20)-(25).
        However, for practical reasons, it is advisable to subdivide the
        gaps between the plates, so as not to exceed 400 KV per gap. </p>
      <p>Figures 10a and 10b are a top cross-sectional view and an
        elevation, respectively of the migmacell shown in Figure 1c
        enclosed by a plurality of cylinders of which only seven,
        201-207, are shown for simplicity. The cylinders, 201-206 are
        thin (5 micron) aluminium foils stretched onto a copper mesh of
        about 98% transparency as frames for rigidity. The outermost
        cylinder 207 is made of about ½ cm thick copper. All the
        cylinders are embedded at their upper ends into an insulating
        plate 300 made of isostatically pressed high alumina ceramic,
        with respective high voltage connectors 301-307 for each plate.
        The superconducting leads 9 and 10 held by stainless steel
        supports 110 between them provide mechanical support for the
        upper and lower pairs of coils, with the open space between them
        defining the reaction region. </p>
      <p>The whole system is immersed in a jacket 408 through which
        liquid Freon is circulated by piping upwardly from below as a
        cold liquid and back down as a warm liquid at a rate such that
        the Freon never becomes a gas, and using known cooling
        techniques. </p>
      <p>The migmacell coils 1a and 2b, as well as the leads 9 and 10
        are at ground potential. The cooling jackets 5 and 6 are not
        shown in Figures 10a and 10b. The cylinders 201, 202 and 206 are
        at positive potentials of 0.8, 2.2 and 6.3 MV respectively.
        Cylinders 203, 204 and 205 are at about 3.5 and 5 MV
        respectively. A plurality of cylinders not shown in the drawing
        is put between each pair of cylinders in a well-known manner to
        provide a gradual voltage distribution. </p>
      <p>The outer cylinder 207 is used to stop the 18 MeV protons from
        the He<sub>3</sub> + d fusion reaction by the combined action of
        the features: (1) a decelerating voltage in the range above 6.3
        Mv and up to the energy of the proton 18 Mv; and (2) the
        stopping power of the thick plate and the liquid Freon.
        Therefore only a fraction of the energy of these high energy
        protons is expected to be converted into electricity. The
        remaining energy will be converted into heat and carried away by
        the circulating liquid Freon. </p>
      <p>The bottom of the copper cylinder 207 is sealed to a pyrex
        glass cylinder 208. A set of 8 tungsten pins (of which 4 are
        shown 209-212) provides support to an outside jacket 408 made of
        isostatically pressed high alumina ceramic. High voltage
        feedthroughs 400-407 are used for the respective leads. </p>
      <p>Through this cylindrical arrangement, the 2.2 MeV deuteron beam
        500, focused at the center of the migmacell by a system of
        quadrupole lenses 412 is injected through a tube 411 at an angle
        of 30° to the vertical into the lower coil of the migmacell to
        produce the migma and the resultant electric power output. </p>
      <p><b>Migma Fusion Reactor ~</b> </p>
      <p>A migma fusion reactor may be constructed comprising a
        plurality of migmacells. In a preferred embodiment, 100
        migmacells are stacked in a column, called a "migmacolumn" and a
        matrix of 100 by 100 migmacolumns may be used to make the
        reactor. </p>
      <p>A top view of a section of two migmcolumns in a preferred
        embodiment is shown in Figure 11a. The elevation view of the
        same is shown in Figure 11b. it is seen in Figure 11b that each
        migmacell is suspended by its stainless steel bar 110 sandwiched
        between the superconducting leads 9 and 10. </p>
      <p>A technical advantage to be obtained with a migmacolumn
        configuration over that of a single migmacell (Figure 10a and
        10b) is that the positively charged repulsive cylinders can be
        replaced by plat plates, comprising thin metal foils stretched
        over a 98% transparent copper mesh. </p>
      <p>Referring to Figures 11a and 11b, the plates, 611, 711, 811 and
        911 are placed at a potential of +0.8 MV; plates 612, 712, 812
        and 912 are at +2.2 MV; and plates 613, 713, 813 and 913 are at
        6.3 MV. A plurality of plates not shown in the drawings is put
        between each pair of the above-cited plates in a well-known
        manner to provide a gradual voltage distribution. Plates 514,
        614, 714, 814, 914 and 1014 of ½ cm thickness are placed at a
        decelerating voltage in the range from above 6.3 MV and up to
        the energy of the proton from the He3 + d fusion reaction, 18
        MV, to stop it by the combined action described in connection
        with outer cylinder 207 above. </p>
      <p>All of the plates are suspended from a plate 620 made of
        isostatically pressed high alumina ceramic and connected to a
        high voltage source through connectors 641. Plate 650 is made of
        the same insulating ceramic. </p>
      <p>Plates 514, 614, 714, 814, 914 and 1014, together with plates
        620 and 650 provide a jacket for circulating liquid Freon in the
        manner described in connection with jacket 408 above. </p>
      <p>It will be seen from Figure 11a that while two pairs of coils
        are used for a single migmacell, in a migmacolumn three pairs of
        coils will act to provide the magnetic fields for two
        migmacells, so that in general, N + 1 pairs of coils will
        provide the field for N migmacells. Therefore, for a migmacolumn
        of 100 migmacells only 101 pairs of coils, 550a and 550b are
        required. </p>
      <p>It should be noted that migmacolumns are not made up of a
        number of physically independent migmacells, but are rather a
        system of coupled migmacells. An advantage of this coupled
        configuration is that when all of the cells are filled with a
        migma, the end losses through the escape cone, defined by the
        vertical confinement angle, along with the Z-axis is reduced by
        the number of cells in the column, This is accomplished by the
        following automatic mechanism. </p>
      <p>If a deuteron enters the escape cone of one migma cell, that
        is, starts moving, as a consequence of the multiple Coulomb
        scattering, through the cell coils into the next migmacell, the
        combined action of the sharp repulsive potential of the migma in
        the next cell and the Coulomb scattering therein are such that
        the probablility is 50% for the ion to deviate away from the
        Z-axis and stay trapped in the new migmacell with new initial
        conditions, thus contributing to the fusion rate. </p>
      <p>The filling of a migmacolumn utilizes the same 60° injection
        technique as the filling of a single migmacell except that the
        ion injection rate is adjusted such that only a small fraction,
        approximately 1% of the ions, become self-ensnared in each cell
        in the column. The remaining ions enter the next cell, precess
        in an artificial confinement mode and, if not captured continue
        into the following cell, following the trajectory 999. </p>
      <p>The filling time for a migmacolumn is approximately 10<sup>-4</sup>
        sec. The accelerated ion beam 900 is then shifted to the next
        migmacolumn according to the well-known technique of
        two-dimensional scanning developed by the High Voltage
        Engineering Corporation for ion implantation and for
        accelerating and scanning micrometeorites in the NASA Space
        Program. Refilling is performed periodically in intervals of the
        order of one second or longer as may be required by the need to
        replace the deuterons lost through fusion and leaks. </p>
