        <b>ANEUTRONIC ENERGY: A Search for
          Non-RadioacticeNon-Proliferating Nuclear Power</b>
        <p><b>Dr. Bogdan Maglich</b>&nbsp;</p>
        <p> The Tesla Foundation Inc. ~ P.O. Box 3037 ~ Princeton, New
          Jersey 08543 USA</p>
      </center>
      <p>Can we design a nuclear power source that --- like Robbie in
        Asimov's classic tale "I, Robot" --- is pre-programed never to
        harm a human? </p>
      <p>Can there be a nuclear process whose fuel will never be
        converted into nuclear weapons? </p>
      <p>The recent report (1) of a special committee of the U.S.
        National Research Council implies that the world may be only one
        step away from being able to say "yes" to both of these
        questions. Conclusions of the First International Symposium on
        Feasibility of Aneutronic Power, held at the Institute for
        advanced Study in Princeton in the Fall of 1987, suggest that
        this last step may well be imminent. </p>
      <p><b>What is Aneutronic?</b> </p>
      <p>Energy-releasing nuclear reactions involving nonradioactive
        nuclei (both as the reactants and reaction products) and
        producing no neutrons have been known for half a century. We
        define a nuclear reaction as "aneutronic" if not more than 1% of
        the total energy released is carried by neutrons and if not more
        than 1% of the reactants ("fuel") and reaction products
        ("waste") are radionuclides. The definition is somewhat
        arbitrary and serves only as a guideline. Their product in all
        cases is predominantly helium, a nonradioactive inert gas. </p>
      <p><b>Success of the Migma IV Experiment~</b> </p>
      <p>In an experiment carried out in 1982, referred to as Migma IV,
        AELabs demonstrated that a 1-Mev deuteron migma can be
        neutralized by oscillating electrons and exceed the space charge
        limit density without instability. Fuel density of migma was
        1000 times lower than that of the best tokamak but migma's
        temperature was 100 times higher than that of the best tokamak
        and its confinement 15 times longer, so that their product is
        1,500 times higher than that in tokamak. The migma program had
        spent $23 million over 10 years. The Western world has spent $10
        billion on the conventional plasma fusion program over the past
        30 years. </p>
      <p>Reflecting this development, the Senate's Appropriations
        Committee stated in 1982: </p>
      <p>"To date, basic research in the field of nuclear fission and
        fusion has largely overlooked the potential for aneutronic
        nuclear alternatives using light metals, such as lithium, that
        produce no radioactive side effects. The Committee recommends
        that the Department of Energy give higher priority to this
        non-radioactive and non proliferative nuclear potential." </p>
      <p><b>Strategic and Commercial Ramifications of Aneutronic Power ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: Aerospace --- low reactor weight because of no need for
        shielding as well as very large power-to-weight ratio; low fuel
        weight (100,000 X more concentrated fuel energy than non-nuclear
        fuels); 10% lower fuel cost than uranium (for dirty
        fission);reasonable fuel availability; lower plant capital cost;
        no heat pollution; modular - units as small as 1 megawatt may be
        economical. </p>
      <p>B: Power supply for radar and telecommunications --- The
        smallest aneutronic power plant (30 KWe), similar to the
        proposed Migma V, would have a wide application: this is the
        power needed to run a radar or CCC station. </p>
      <p>C: Naval application --- The advantage of lightweight
        aneutronic power production also applies to ship propulsion,
        where specific power is less critical than in aerospace case. </p>
      <p>D: Terrestrial applications for utilities --- First, an
        aneutronic reactor can be small, producing megawatts of electric
        (MWe), while the minimum economical size of a fission or
        (projected) fusion power plant is about 1000 MWe. Hence, the
        small nuclear power plant, impossible today, becomes feasible. A
        small power unit implies mass production, which results in lower
        capital cost per kilowatt of capacity than with large reactors
        that are built one or two at a time. (Initial capital cost is
        one of the major barriers to nuclear energy in developing
        countries and smaller communities of developed countries).
        Second, there are clear environmental advantages of
        nonradioactive fuel, nonradioactive waste, and the absence of
        waste heat (heat pollution). </p>
      <p>E: Non-Proliferation --- Absence of neutrons means that the
        aneutronic reactor cannot breed plutonium for nuclear weapons.
        Since radioactive fuel, radioactive waste, heat pollution, and
        proliferation are the main current environmental and political
        issues for nuclear power, the implications of aneutronic nuclear
        energy for the environment are obvious: not only an acceptable
        but an attractive nuclear power technology. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">"Will Migma Fusion End the Energy Crisis?"</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><b>by Bogdan Maglich</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Fighting for the Idea ~</b> </p>
      <p>In 1969, while I was working in high-energy physics with a
        physicist by the name of Macek, we developed the principle of
        self-colliding particle orbits. We published a paper then,
        called "Fusion Reactions in Self-Colliding Orbits", but we said
        it was a completely impractical device. The first time I
        realized that the migma idea could have practical applications
        was in 1972. </p>
      <p>Then, unfortunately, I had an accident where my finger was
        badly cut and I had to have four operations, so I was pretty
        well tied up at home. I had a lot of time to make calculations,
        and then the idea of high-energy nuclear fusion developed. </p>
      <p>The patent application was submitted in April 1972, and it’s
        still being kicked back and forth at the Patent Office. We have
        been granted patents in some other countries, but not in the
        United States. It is very unusual for something so utterly new
        to be patented. The patent examiners very often return things
        for further information. They just don’t understand, because
        there is no earlier invention. </p>
      <p>As soon as we applied for a patent we felt we needed three
        tests, which would cost $3 million, so we applied to the Atomic
        Energy Commission. After almost a year, we were turned down.
        They said nothing wrong was found, but the policy of the
        government was to pursue other fusion schemes that were further
        ahead. </p>
      <p>As soon as we were turned down, Rutgers University --- where I
        was then a professor --- took the attitude that if the
        government turns you down there must be something wrong. Among
        professors there was the same attitude, surprisingly, although
        experts who analyzed our project found that there was nothing
        wrong. Nevertheless, the chairman of the department, a new man
        from the National Science Foundation, came and said, "Oh, at NSF
        I talked to the experts who have been in the field 20 years, and
        they say it will not work". </p>
      <p>This opposition we’ve met is nothing new, and as a scientist I
        find it very invigorating, particularly when we see that we are
        winning. Three years ago we were considered total idiots. Two
        years ago some people were saying, well, it looks rather crazy,
        but there may be something to it. Now the skepticism is
        disappearing so fast, what better recognition do you want to see
        than something like that? </p>
      <p><b>Revolt of the Plasma People ~</b> </p>
      <p>Clearly, there is nothing wrong with our scheme. I think our
        opposition has come from the vested interests in plasma fusion.
        These people have been in the field 25 years. Ever since the
        hydrogen bomb exploded they have made their careers in plasma
        fusion. They are developing devices for then year 2000, so they
        don’t have goals that can be made and immediately verified. They
        will retire and be on their retirement funds by that time, so
        they can actually keep developing this for the rest of their
        lives. </p>
      <p>And, I may add, it’s a very closed community. The people in the
        CTR [Controlled Thermonuclear Research] division at the AEC are
        all ex-researchers from various plasma labs who have been
        working on this idea for the last 25 years, mainly those who
        were not very successful in experimental research and were
        kicked upstairs to become bureaucrats. Their loyalties lie with
        these labs. With the huge amounts of money at stake, it is not a
        scientific question anymore. </p>
      <p>I don’t get angry, but our opponents get very angry. They start
        shouting, "We’ve been in this field so many years", and so on.
        At the AEC last year, two fusion experts, the military and
        Congresspeople were there. We asked them, Okay, so just tell us
        why this will not work. One man who is a very famous plasma
        theorist said, "Well, there are certain rules of thumb that we
        have learned over the last 20 years in plasma, certain rules of
        thumb". I said, "Please write down the equation for the rule of
        thumb. What kind of scientific approach is that?" </p>
      <p>These "rules of thumb" really mean ingrained thinking. For
        instance, one of their ideas is that the more ordered a system
        is, the less likely it is to produce energy. That’s because
        they’re working on a random system. Plasma fusion is random.
        Their second belief is that we will not succeed in getting high
        densities, which we are already working on now. </p>
      <p>Because of this opposition, we had to form our own corporation
        with one objective: to raise funds for Rutgers to build a lab.
        The reaction at Rutgers back then was incredible, very
        emotional. For a professor to bring $3 million to Rutgers was
        unrealistic, and, formally, we were turned down. In the
        meantime, the Navy came to Rutgers and favorably reviewed our
        project. Then the president of Switzerland, their ex-minister of
        energy, ordered a review of migma --- I have lived in
        Switzerland and I go there quite often. </p>
      <p>At that time something unusual happened. A big Swiss aluminum
        corporation called Alusuisse came in and said they would give us
        $3 million for one third of the stock, which we agreed to. To
        avoid speculation, we have not sold stock to any individuals. We
        had people here from Merrill Lynch and many other houses asking
        for stock, and many individuals, but we feel that selling stock
        would be wrong because we do not guarantee that we will make a
        source that will be the answer to humanity’s prayers for energy.
      </p>
      <p>Now we do plan to bring in a new group of high-technology
        American investors, not just any corporations, but corporations
        that know the ups and downs of research. We know we are going to
        have ups and downs and delays, so we want to get companies that
        are sophisticated in their corporate structure and that know
        that things are not always rosy. </p>
      <p>We have private investors now, but we will also be willing to
        take money from the government, We are not turning down money;
        it’s just that it takes a tremendous effort to raise money. You
        almost have to stop doing research just to keep coming to
        Washington to negotiate a $10 million deal. We would have to
        triple our staff. Without government aid, we can operate with
        simplicity. We have practically no administration, and all our
        management is technology management. </p>
      <p><b>The Future of Migma Power ~</b> </p>
      <p>This country has shown that once a principle has been
        demonstrated --- like in the case of the atomic bomb --- we can
        put so many resources and so much technological manpower into a
        project that it will take very little time to produce an
        economical device. Once we demonstrate that we can produce even
        the smallest amount of electricity from the Migma Principle,
        there will be all kinds of migmacells. </p>
      <p>First there will be single units used for military
        applications, because the military does not care about economy.
        The Air Force is very interested in having a compact power
        source to power a laser, because the whole future of warfare is
        laser warfare. The Navy is interested in having remote
        underwater power stations to detect Soviet submarines. These
        military applications could be developed in 5 years from the
        moment the principle is shown. </p>
      <p>The next step is to develop a migmacell of one megawatt, which
        can then be stacked into any configuration. A big nuclear power
        plant is a thousand megawatts, and a cube of migmacells ten
        units on a side will give you as much power as a large nuclear
        power plant. Our calculations show that a migmacell power plant
        can produce as much as six megawatts, enough for some small
        local power stations, but in a space about 4 feet in diameter. </p>
      <p>We had envisioned individual household power units, but we were
        told by the Westinghouse people that it takes them about 8 to 10
        years just to develop a new concept for something like a
        toaster, because household people just always push the wrong
        buttons at the wrong times. With the household units about a
        decade away, it’s better to have professional manpower to use
        for a block or a section of a town, or even a single building,
        but attended by somebody who really knows what he is doing. </p>
      <p><b>Migma at the Moment ~</b> </p>
      <p>Where does our project stand now? The first test was to make
        migma. A first, migma was a very beautiful computer drawing of
        an ordered system, and our first experiment was to demonstrate
        that it could be made. We have done this. We’ve shaped a beam of
        nuclei so that it comes back and collides with itself. The
        products are mostly charged particles carrying the nuclear
        energy. </p>
      <p>So we do have fusion, but the only way we can prove that the
        fusion is coming from the migma is to demonstrate that the
        fusion rate obeys the basic law of colliding beams, the
        quadratic law, which states that the collision rate is
        proportional to the square of the beam intensity. We are taking
        the very strict attitude that the only way to prove fusion is to
        prove the quadratic law experimentally. This is what we are
        doing now, in a test that may last from 6 to 8 months. </p>
      <p>This is our second test, but that is still not enough. We
        really want to break even. We want to have the energy out to be
        equal to the energy in. Our third test is to compact more
        nuclei. Since the nuclei all have the same positive charge,
        we’re going to put negative charges in the migma to overcome
        their natural repulsion. In this way, we hope to build the
        density of the migma and reach the break-even point. </p>
      <p>Our current plan is to get an experimental confirmation of the
        last two tests within the next 18 months. Our next objective is
        to build an operational prototype fusion power plant which will
        be the first to produce more than break-even energy. At the rate
        we are working now, this will take from 4 to 6 more years. </p>
      <p>I spent 6 months approaching the leading scientists in the
        country in every field, including Nobel Prize winners, to set up
        one meeting here which lasted two days. At the end of June, we
        presented our theories and our work at a meeting of independent
        scientific and engineering consultants whom we hired to evaluate
        our project and report their findings to our board of directors.
        They unanimously endorsed the project. Not only did they say
        they found nothing wrong with the principle, but they said they
        saw nothing that will prevent it from working. </p>
      <p>When I formed this committee of consultants and informed some
        of our business people, they said they had never heard of
        anything such as this, where the president of a company invites
        such an independent board that can essentially demolish you. But
        we received their unanimous endorsement. </p>
      <p>The general belief that fusion will not be conquered before the
        next millennium is bases on misguided research in plasma fusion.
        In my opinion, effecting controlled fusion is a relatively easy
        task, provided that one gets rid of all old concepts and accepts
        the high-energy fusion concept. </p>
      <p>The US Energy Research and Development Administration is not
        supporting one clean fusion project. Their projects are all
        based on tritium, an artificial isotope which is highly
        radioactive. </p>
      <p>We are being criticized for keeping our work too quiet, but I
        believe that it is better to make big advances in the lab than
        to talk in advance about what you are going to accomplish. To
        our knowledge, we are the only group throughout the world that
        is working on a totally non-polluting, clean fusion power
        source. It is just shocking that, in spite of all the pressure
        on the part of environmentalists, the government is not
        supporting one nuclear fusion power source that is clean. </p>

      <p><b>Dr Maglich Explains the Nuts and Bolts of Migma Fusion ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first artificial fusion energy reaction which released
        significant amount of nuclear energy was the explosion of the
        hydrogen bomb in 1952. Since then, physicists have tried without
        an explosion to use it as a source of cheap power in the form of
        electrical energy. </p>
      <p>Until now there have been two approaches to controlled fusion.
        As a basic fuel, our method uses the natural isotope of
        hydrogen, deuterium, which is not radioactive and which can be
        extracted from ordinary water. The oceans contain enough
        deuterium fuel to meet our energy needs for millions of years. </p>
      <p>In the deuterium fusion process, almost all energy released
        goes into charged particles. The kinetic energy of charged
        particles can be converted directly into electricity, thus
        eliminating cumbersome boilers and turbines, and the heat and
        radiation pollution associated with neutrons. </p>
      <p>Instead of heating, we use the concept of colliding beams. We
        accelerate the nuclei of deuterium to higher speeds than can be
        accomplished by heating, and we fire them head-on against each
        other at these high speeds. </p>
      <p>In our method, we use one single accelerated deuteron beam and
        make it collide head-on with itself. This configuration we call
        the "figure-of-eight". The deuterons in both the lower and upper
        loop move clockwise and collide nearly head-on. As time
        progresses, the figure-of-eight configurations superimpose one
        on another, until a mixture --- and the Greek word for mixture
        is migma --- of orbits has been established. In this mixture the
        deuterons being to interact and fuse. </p>
      <p>In plasma fusion you heat the ions to high temperatures often
        by magnetic means. In laser fusion, you heat the nuclei by
        concentrating the power of light. We threw away the concept of
        heating. We know better. With heating, the motions are random.
        Today, we can direct particles head-on against each other. An
        analogue to this process is two machine-gun bullets colliding in
        midair. As you realize, it’s quite difficult to aim bullet
        against bullet. Well, we’ve already mastered that. We can
        already aim nuclei to collide head-on. </p>
      <p>Now we go even one step further. We have invented a process in
        which one beam collides with itself. We shoot a beam and bend it
        so that it comes back against itself. The principle doesn’t
        change; we still have an ordered system. </p>
      <p>Migma is an ordered system in which fusion is ignited by
        head-on collisions instead of heat. Once you have that, then you
        can have much higher collision energies, because in fusion what
        counts is the relative velocity with which one nucleus hits
        another, not the temperatures involved. </p>
      <p>Inside the stars, fusion is accomplished by heating, but we
        don’t seriously intend to build a star on Earth. We make no
        bones that we are building a machine. It has to be done
        differently, completely artificially. There is nothing natural
        about our process, the same as there is nothing natural about a
        rocket or a car engine. </p>
      <p>Once we have these higher energies of collision, we can ignite
        clean fuel, for example helium-3. Nothing becomes radioactive.
        The energy released is carried off by charged bodies --- protons
        and nuclei --- which can be collected by a series of
        positively-charged plates surrounding the cell. As the
        positively-charged bodies approach the plates, they slow down,
        giving up their energy to the plates. Connecting an external
        circuit to the plates would draw off an electric current. </p>
      <p>Our products are clean, and everything is converted directly
        into electricity. </p>

        designed to be used as a clean <br>

      <p>Nuclear fusion, according to its proponents, will be the
        ultimate cheap-fuel energy source, an answer to the world’s
        energy problems --- if they can make it work. Although
        significant progress has been made in recent years, development
        has been much slower than the first proponents of fusion hoped
        when they began 40 years ago. </p>
      <p>About 12 years ago, at a meeting of the American Physical
        Society, physicist Bogdan Maglich presented an unorthodox method
        of approaching fusion. At the time, other physicists were quite
        skeptical. Now, in the Feb. 25 <i>Physical Review Letters</i>,
        Maglich and co-workers report a significant achievement in what
        they call "aneutronic fusion" --- "a word so new it is not yet
        in any dictionary". Other physicists are still somewhat
        reserved. </p>
      <p>In principle, "conventional" magnetic fusion experiments
        involve the formation of a plasma (consisting of atomic nuclei
        and electrons) by ionizing a gas. This plasma is then confined
        by a suitably shaped magnetic field and heated to a temperature
        at which significant numbers of fusions occur. In practice,
        magnetic fields do not confine very well. Instabilities in the
        plasma’s behavior tend to build up until they enable the plasma
        to break out of confinement. So the race is to hold the plasma
        at least long enough for a useful number of fusions to occur. </p>
      <p>In conventional experiments the plasma is heated so that the
        nuclei gain enough energy to overcome the electrical repulsion
        between them and so are able to fuse. In Maglich’s scheme, which
        he calls a migma (from the Greek word for mixture), the nuclei
        gain energy not by heating by being accelerated in a linear
        accelerator. In the current experiment, deuterons --- the nuclei
        of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen --- come out of the
        accelerator with 0.7 Million electron-volts energy, the
        equivalent to heating to 7 billion kelvins. They also have a
        directed motion rather than the random motions of a thermally
        energized plasma. Therefore, a magnetic field can be set up in
        the migma cell, as they call the vessel they use, that forces
        the nuclei into self-intersecting orbits that form a kind of
        rosette around the center of the field. Orbits of this kind
        provide many opportunities for nuclei to encounter each other
        and fuse. </p>
      <p>The containment time in this experiment, 20 seconds, was less
        than the 60 seconds of the DCX-1 device, a conventional
        experiment chosen for comparison. But the triple product of
        energy confinement time and density --- three critical
        parameters --- is 10 to 20 times that of DCX-1, and none of the
        instabilities formed. </p>
      <p>The word "aneutronic" comes from the reaction they ultimately
        hope to use, in which hydrogen and lithium fuse to helium with
        two protons left over. The easiest reaction (and the goal of
        most conventional experiments) is deuterium and tritium yield
        helium plus a leftover neutron. The neutron is a penetrating and
        potentially dangerous particle. The protons from the lithium
        reaction, being electrically charged, are easy to capture and
        not damaging. Energy is harvested from these leftover particles
        and that, too, is easier with charged particles. </p>
      <p>According to James Nering of United Sciences, Inc., in
        Princeton NJ, the organization Maglich and co-workers formed to
        do these migma experiments, the present experiment used
        deuterons because they make measuring and following the
        reactioneasier. </p>
      <p>In 1973,when Maglich first presented the idea, the physics
        community reacted so skeptically that he could not get funds
        from the DOE, which funds most of the US fusion program. He did,
        however, obtain $20 million in private funds from sources in
        Japan, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, and the USA. Now, according to
        an announcement by United Sciences, money is included in the
        Defense Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 1985 for a study of
        migma’s space applications. </p>

        </p>
        <p><b>By D.E. Thomsen</b></p>

      <p>"Aneutronic" is a word that has not yet made its way into the
        dictionaries.It refers to processes of thermonuclear fusion that
        produce few or no neutrons. In energy-producing fusion reactors,
        aneutronic processes would have advantages in both safety and in
        ease of gathering the energy released. However, this breed of
        has had low priorityin the fusion research program funded for
        the last 40 years by the DOE and its predecessors. Now something
        of a push toward them seems to be developing. </p>
      <p>Last week, the Committee on Advanced Fusion Power of the
        National Research Council’s Air Force Studies Board issue a
        report advising the Air Force that research on aneutronic fusion
        processes is worth supporting as a possible answer to Air Force
        requirements both for electric current and for propulsion. As
        the report was issued, many of the interested scientists were
        gathered at the Symposium on Feasibility of Aneutronic Power,
        meeting at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton NJ. </p>
      <p>The study was generally well received, although some people,
        particularly Bogdan Maglich of AELabs in Princeton, thought it
        too pessimistic in predicting how many years it would take to
        bring about practical aneutronic reactors. </p>
      <p>Conventional fusion requires confining atomic nuclei at high
        density and high temperature. The easiest conditions of
        confinement and temperature, and therefore the ones sought first
        by the mainstream fusion program, are those for fusion of
        deuterium and tritium. However, the energy released in such a
        fusion is carried away by neutrons --- dangerous, penetrating
        particles, which will yield their energy only by the inefficient
        means of heating something. </p>
      <p>But in an aneutronic reaction (for example, deuterium and
        helium-3), the energy comes off with protons. Protons can be
        converted directly into electrical power in the form of radio
        waves. Protons are not very damaging or dangerous and so minimal
        shielding is necessary. However, in the jargon of the DOE, these
        substances are "advanced" fuels because the confinement and
        temperature conditions necessary for them go beyond those for
        deuterium-tritium. </p>
      <p>Proponents of aneutronic fusion say that to the DOE "advanced"
        means far in the future or even in the hereafter. But Bruno
        Coppi of the Massachusetts Institute of technology argues that
        experimentation with deuterium and helium-3 could be done in
        some current mainstream experiments --- MIT’s Alcator, for
        example. "You could make with today’s technology an experiment
        that burns deuterium and helium-3", he says. However, it lacks
        funding. Quoting the Swedish physicist Hannes Alfven, one of the
        grand old men of this kind of physics, Coppi says that there
        seems to be "a conspiracy not to do fusion". </p>
      <p>Instead of depending on more or less random encounters of
        nuclei that have been heated to overcome their repulsion for one
        another, as the mainstream experiments do, aneutronic systems
        like Maglich’s "migma" use the principle of colliding beams,
        directing the nuclei into intersecting orbits, where they are
        more likely to encounter each other. "Our position is that the
        whole concept of heating to achieve collisions is obsolete", he
        says. </p>
      <p>The most recent migma experiment, Migma III, achieved
        confinement conditions that rival those of conventional
        experiments, and did it without the disruptive instabilities
        that plague conventional experiments. Migma IV, to be built in
        Palatka, FL, in collaboration with the University of Florida at
        Gainesville, will attempt to increase the density of nuclei in
        the center of the experiment to 300 billion, ten times that of
        Migma III, reaching the "space-charge limit", the point where
        electric repulsions will prevent further crowding. It will test
        whether neutralizing some of the charge by introducing electrons
        will permit higher densities, and it will also test predictions
        that the resulting plasma should be stable under these
        conditions. </p>
      <p>If deuterium-helium-3 fusion works out as a source of power, it
        will require a continuing supply of helium-3 (Deuterium can be
        obtained from sea water). Although helium-3 is rare on earth,
        George Miley of the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign
        notes that is "one of the most plentiful fuels we can find in
        the universe". But we will have to get off the earth to get it.
      </p>
      <p>On earth, the immediate source is radioactive decay of tritium,
        a by-product of nuclear fission reactors. According to Miley and
        the National Research Council, by the year 2000 we can obtain
        about 600 kilograms of helium-3 from tritium decay. This would
        run a 200-megawatt power plant for 20 years, "not enough for an
        economy", says Miley. </p>
      <p>Scientists would have to go to the moon and mine helium-3,
        which the solar wind generates in the lunar surface. Ultimately,
        when space travel is sophisticated enough, says Miley, we could
        get it from Jupiter. </p>
