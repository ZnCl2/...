      NEXT year when you go to a dentist to have a tooth filled he may
      connect the cavity up to a small dynamo and fill your tooth
      electrolytically with gold or silver, in the same way that metal
      articles are gold or silver-plated.<br>
      <br>
      Dentists are working along these lines because the prevailing
      method of making gold inlays involves the use of wax impressions,
      which frequently are slightly inaccurate, leaving unfilled pockets
      in the tooth as a source of future trouble. Cavities would be
      coated with chemically pure graphite as an electric conductor,
      filled with an electrolytic liquid bearing a solution of a gold
      salt, and the current turned on to deposit a perfect filling in
      the tooth. <br>

      <b> </b><br>
      The invention relates to a method for implanting a functional
      biological coating on the surface of an implant. The method is
      characterized in that a functional biological coating is implanted
      on surface of the implant in an electrolytic deposition manner,
      the implant is a dental implant, a bone implant or a
      cardiovascular stent, and the functional biological coating is a
      siRAN coating, a miRNA coating or a DNA coating. The method has
      the advantages that chitosan and a functional biological material
      are jointly deposited on the surface of a titanium dioxide
      nanotube array on the basis that chitosan has a characteristic of
      cathodic electrodeposition and has a transfer effect on the
      functional biological material, and as the pH value of chitosan
      changes after electrodeposition, the dissolution rate of the
      chitosan slows down, and the controlled-release characteristic of
      the functional biological material can be realized to a certain
      degree.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0031]<br>
      In the loading surface siRNA studies pre inventors also conducted
      many attempts have simple dropping and coating methods combining
      the chitosan / siRNA complexes, but low efficiency of this method,
      the adsorption amount can not be controlled, and does not apply to
      combined three-dimensional materials.<br>
      Then using layer-by-layer method cumulative adsorption layer by
      layer chitosan / siRNA complexes, however, this approach each
      about 20min, usually do 8 to 10 layers, time-consuming and
      requires a lot of siRNA solution , the cost is high.<br>
      The cathodic electrodeposition method of the present invention is
      applied quickly and easily, and can be applied to
      three-dimensional material, preferably sustained-release effect,
      is an excellent siRNA loading.<br>
      <br>
      [0032]<br>
      The present invention utilizes chitosan as siRNA (miRNA or DNA)
      transfer vector, and its molecular characteristics, the cathodic
      electrodeposition method of the chitosan and siRNA (miRNA or DNA)
      were co-deposited to the surface of titania nanotube array, the
      mechanism of the method is "neutral effect (neutralization)",
      i.e., the cathode such that localized high pH reduces the
      solubility of chitosan deposited on the cathode surface, concrete
      process is the electrolysis of water (2H 2 O + 2e - ? H 2 + 2OH -)
      In the formation of a large number of cathode attachment
      hydroxide, resulting in a protonated chitosan loses a hydrogen
      ion, expressed as Chit-NH 3 + + OH - ? Chit-NH 2 + H 2 O.<br>
      Due to charge conservation, therefore equal amount of electrons
      consumed coating deposition amount per unit positive charge, due
      to the electron transfer is very fast, so the coating layer formed
      in this manner is very fast, in just a few minutes it reached
      saturation.<br>
      <br>
      [0033]<br>
      Implant material of the present invention, in addition to
      titanium, also may be a conductive material such as stainless
      steel.<br>

      [0034]<br>
      Titanium implants are used for dental implants, bone implants
      aspects body, cardiovascular stents, to enhance bone formation
      activity of titanium implants, dental implant neck fibroblast
      activity, and anti-inflammatory activity, and promote the role of

        </b><b>Osteosynthesis with nano-silver</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b> An antibacterial coating that is composed of silver is
      disclosed, as well as medical tools and implants comprising such a
      coating, and a method and an apparatus for the production of such
      a coating. The medical tools or the dental or orthopaedic implant
      comprises a metal or metal alloy having a treated surface wherein
      the treated surface is at least partially converted to an oxide
      film by plasma electrolytic oxidation using a colloid-dispersed
      system and wherein the converted surface is partially covered by
      islands formed by colloid-dispersed silver-particles of the
      colloid-dispersed system. An Ag-TiO2 coating shows excellent
      properties in terms of antibacterial efficacy (even against
      multi-resistant strains), adhesion and biocompatibility. The
      life-time of an implant in a human body is increased.; The
      antibacterial coating can be used in the field of traumatology,
      orthopaedic, osteosynthesis and/or endoprothesis, especially where
      high infection risk exists.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates generally to a multifunctional
      antibacterial coating which is composed of silver, to implants
      and/or to medical tools comprising such a coating and to a method
      as well to an apparatus for the production of such a coating.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is known that silver ions strongly inhibit the growth of
      bacteria and other microorganisms. Silver ions destroy important
      cell components of microorganisms, so that their vital functions
      do not work anymore. Silver shows a broad-spectrum antibacterial
      activity and is even efficient against antibiotic-resistant
      strains. Moreover, silver targets numerous sites within the
      bacterial cell, thus decreasing the chance for the bacteria to
      develop any kind of resistance.<br>
      <br>
      With increasing resistance of most of the pathogen germs against
      the usually used antibiotics, silver was recently rediscovered as
      an antibacterial active substance. In fact, due to its
      disinfectant property, silver has long been used for hygienic and
      medicinal purposes.<br>
      <br>
      For instance, silver compounds were major weapons against wound
      infection in World War I until the advent of antibiotics. In 1884
      German obstetrician C.S.F. Crede introduced 1% silver nitrate as
      an eye solution for prevention of Gonococcal ophthalmia
      neonatorum, which is perhaps the first scientifically documented
      medical use of silver. Further, silver sulfadiazine cream was a
      standard antibacterial treatment for serious burn wounds and is
      still widely used in burns units.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, many silver containing products are available on the
      market such as wound dressings, catheters and/or tumor prosthetic
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      One known coating fabrication method is based on a vacuum coating
      method which offers reliable protection for the surfaces of
      medical implants against bacterial contamination. A pure silver
      coating is applied via a PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) process
      followed by a silicon oxide coating deposited via a PECVD (Plasma
      Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition) process. The coating thickness
      is generally below 200 nm.<br>
      <br>
      PVD and CVD processes usually require highly expensive coating
      systems. Further, they are also energy consuming due to the high
      vacuum requirements. Furthermore, the PVD technique is a
      “line-of-sight” technique, which means that complex surfaces would
      be very hard to coat homogeneously.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, irreversible pigmentation of the skin and/or the eye,
      i.e. argyria or argyrosis, due to possible “excessive” silver
      deposition, may develop after prolonged exposure to silver or
      silver compounds.<br>
      <br>
      Besides, leukopenias and neuromuscular damages could be caused by
      increased silver concentrations. Allergic reactions were described
      in the literature. Past coating attempts with silver salts or
      elementary silver were reported to cause significant increases of
      silver concentrations in the serum of the concerned patients.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a
      medical device, for instance embodied as an implant, having a
      coating of advanced properties.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably such a coating should be provided as an antibacterial
      coating, for instance on metallic implants.<br>
      <br>
      In particular it should be possible to control or to adapt the
      antibacterial efficacy, for instance the leaching rate, of such a
      coating.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the ingrowth of human tissue and/or bone should be
      promoted by such a coating on an implant.<br>
      <br>
      The fabrication of such a coating should be based on an easy and
      cost reduced concept.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Accordingly, the invention proposes a method for treating a
      surface of a medical device, in particular a metallic medical
      device, preferably of a non-biodegradable material, comprising the
      following steps:<br>
      <br>
      providing a colloid-dispersed system,<br>
      subjecting a medical device to the colloid-dispersed system such
      that a surface of the medical device which is to be treated is
      immersed in the colloid-dispersed system,<br>
      generating a, preferably asymmetric or symmetric or a combination
      of both asymmetric and symmetric, AC voltage difference between
      the medical device as a first electrode and/or a second electrode
      positioned in the colloid-dispersed system<br>
      to convert the immersed surface to an oxide film by plasma
      electrolytic oxidation wherein the converted surface is partially
      covered by islands formed by colloid-dispersed particles of the
      colloid-dispersed system.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also proposes a medical device comprising a,
      preferably non-biodegradable, metal or metal alloy having a
      treated surface wherein<br>
      <br>
      the treated surface is at least partially converted to an oxide
      film by plasma electrolytic oxidation using a colloid-dispersed
      system and wherein<br>
      the converted surface is partially covered by islands formed by
      colloid-dispersed particles of the colloid-dispersed system.<br>
      <br>
      A porous oxide film or layer is grown by the plasma electrolytic
      oxidation (PEO) process. By the PEO process, the metallic
      substrate is provided as the first electrode, preferably as an
      anode, in an “electrolytic cell”. Its surface is converted into
      the corresponding metal oxide under the applied electrical field.
      The oxide film consists of crystalline phases, with a highly
      porous surface and with components derived from both the
      colloid-dispersed system and the medical device, for instance an
      implant, as a substrate. It is provided a synthesis of a
      metal-oxide-particle-nanocomposite-coatings by in situ deposition.
      The particles are applied onto the surface of the medical device
      when oxidizing the medical device surface. The present invention
      enables the formation of a coating onto any type of shape of a
      medical device.<br>
      <br>
      The colloid-dispersed system also can be called dispersion. It is
      a liquid containing dispersed particles, in particular the
      colloid-dispersed-particles. The colloid-dispersed-particles have
      a mean average diameter of less than or equal to 100 nm,
      preferably less than or equal to 50 nm, most preferably less than
      or equal to 30 nm. The particles are also named as nano-particles.
      The particles are dispersed and not dissolved in the
      colloid-dispersed system.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the particles are not provided as a powder having
      generally a broad size distribution. In a preferred embodiment the
      particles have a narrow size distribution with a FWHM (full width
      at half maximum) of ?25 nm. Such a size distribution enables the
      formation of uniform islands and an improved conductivity in the
      dispersion.<br>
      <br>
      In one preferred embodiment the particles are provided by
      silver-particles (Ag-particles or Ag-nano-particles). Such a
      nanoSilver coating on medical device surface, for instance an
      implant surfaces, shows several beneficial effects: a reduction of
      bacterial adhesion, and an inhibition of bacterial growth. So far,
      no resistance mechanism was reported and detected against silver
      effect. Since silver acts more like an antiseptic than an
      antibiotic. Such a nanoSilver coating shows excellent properties
      in terms of antibacterial efficacy (even against multi-resistant
      strains), adhesion and biocompatibility (for further benefits see
      the detailed description of the invention). This nanoSilver
      containing layer is provided by a surface chemical conversion of
      the implant induced by means of the plasma electrolytic oxidation.<br>
      <br>
      As a supplement or as an alternative, the particles are provided
      by apatite-particles, preferably HA-particles (hydroxyapatite).
      The apatite is at least one apatite selected from a group
      consisting of hydroxyapatite, Si-substituted hydroxyapatite,
      flourapatite and carbonated apatites. At least one Ca-atom of an
      apatite can be replaced by a Mg, Zn, Cu, Na, K and Sr.<br>
      <br>
      Hydroxyapatite improves osteoconduction. This enables for instance
      a strong fixation of an implant inserted in a human or animal
      body. The HA-particles according to the invention also cover
      HA-Si-compounds (Si-substituted hydroxyapatite). A HA-Si-compound
      is HA-compound in which at least one PO4&lt;3-&gt; group is
      replaced by a SiO4&lt;3-&gt; group. Such a HA-Si-compound is
      characterized by an enhanced bio-compatibility.<br>
      <br>
      As a further supplement or as a further alternative, the particles
      are provided by at least one type of particles selected from a
      group consisting of copper and zinc. This type of particles also
      shows an antibacterial effect.<br>
      <br>
      In a further embodiment an additive, preferably a nano-sized
      additive, is provided in the dispersion. Accordingly, the
      particles comprise an additive wherein the additive is at least
      one material selected from a group consisting of metals, oxides,
      earth minerals and phosphates. Some typical examples are magnesia,
      calcium phosphate, a-TCP (tri-calcium-phosphate), sodium water
      glass, potassium water glass and/or silicon. Glass water is
      effective in bone mineralization. The additive is dissolved or
      dispersed in the colloid-dispersed system. It is emphasized that
      above mentioned additives are exemplary and not restricted to this
      enumeration.<br>
      <br>
      The colloid-dispersed system can be based on any kind of liquid,
      in particular of low or zero conductivity. In one embodiment the
      colloid-dispersed system is provided as a water-based dispersion.
      Preferably the dispersion means are pure water or ion-exchanged
      water. The used water essentially comprises no electrolytes. In a
      preferred embodiment intentionally no additional electrolytes are
      introduced in the distilled water. The ph-value of the used water
      is less than or equal to 7 or the ph-value of the used water is
      less than or equal to 7.4.<br>
      <br>
      The particles as the dispersed phase of the dispersion are
      provided with a concentration of less than or equal to 100 mg/l,
      preferably less than or equal to 20 mg/l, most preferably less
      than or equal to 2 mg/l. In the most preferred embodiment the
      concentration is less than or equal to 2 mg/l. This value is in
      particular suitable for metallic particles, in particular for
      Ag-particles to avoid cytotoxic effects. Moreover, these values
      are in particular suitable for metallic particles, in particular
      Ag-particles, to provide a sufficient conductivity in the
      colloid-dispersed system.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment the conductivity in the
      colloid-dispersed system is essentially only or only provided by
      the colloid-dispersed-particles themselves. This is in particular
      suitable for metallic particles, as for instance Ag-particles, in
      particular in combination with an emulsifier. Preferably the
      particles, for instance Ag-nano-particles, are the only carrier or
      the most active carrier for the electrical charge in the
      dispersion. In a preferred embodiment the particles or metallic
      particles are provided by a material, forming the islands on the
      oxide film. One material example represents silver. As a
      supplement or as an alternative the metallic particles or the
      dispersed metallic particles are provided by a component which is
      a component of the substrate material. For instance the particles
      are provided by Ti-particles if the substrate (representing the
      medical device) comprises titanium. A contamination can be
      avoided. Also dissolved material, as for instance dissolved
      material of an immersed medical device, can contribute to the
      conductivity in the colloid-dispersed system.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternative or as a supplement at least one electrolyte is
      provided in the colloid-dispersed system. The electrolyte is
      dissolved in the colloid-dispersed system. In one embodiment the
      electrolyte comprises at least one material selected from a group
      consisting of metals, oxides, earth minerals and phosphates. In
      another embodiment the electrolyte comprises at least one
      electrolyte selected from a component of the substrate material.
      I.e. the electrolyte is adapted to the substrate material. For
      instance the electrolyte is provided by Ti-ions if the substrate
      (representing the implant) comprises titanium. A contamination can
      be avoided. It is emphasized that above mentioned electrolytes are
      exemplary and not restricted to this enumeration.<br>
      <br>
      In a further embodiment a gas is provided in the colloid-dispersed
      system. The gas is for instance provided by a kind of bubbling.
      Particularly the gas is provided such to influence the PEO and/or
      to participate in the PEO. The gas comprises at least one type of
      gas selected from a group consisting of N2, Ar, Kr and Xe. The
      mentioned noble gases are in particular suitable to achieve an
      enhanced densification of the converted layer.<br>
      <br>
      The converted medical device surface, for instance the converted
      implant surface, is uniformly covered with the oxide layer.
      Preferably the converted surface is continuously covered with the
      oxide layer. The oxide film has a thickness of 1 µm to 100 µm,
      preferably 10 µm to 100 µm, most preferably of 20 µm to 40 µm. The
      oxide film is characterized by hills and/or plateaus separated by
      grooves and/or channels. Such an appearance represents a typical
      feature of a PEO process. Such a structure results in a medical
      device surface or implant surface of large specific surface area.<br>
      <br>
      As already stated in the preceding description the particles are
      applied onto the surface of the medical device when oxidizing the
      medical device surface. A small fraction of the particles are also
      embedded in the oxide layer. The main fraction of the particles is
      deposited onto the surface of the oxide layer forming the islands.<br>
      <br>
      There exists no sharp interface between the oxide layer and the
      deposited particle layer. The particle concentration in the
      surface converted medical device, for instance the surface
      converted implant, is decreasing, preferably continuously
      decreasing, with increasing depth.<br>
      <br>
      The islands are provided by means of micro-arcs in the PEO
      process, for instance by implantation and/or deposition and/or
      agglomeration of the dispersed particles. The islands are
      surrounded by the oxide layer. The islands have a typical
      average-size of less than 300 nm. An average thickness is in the
      range of 1 nm to 1000 nm, preferably in the range of 5 nm to 400
      nm. Some islands also can be connected to each other. Typically,
      there is essentially no or only few porosity in the islands, in
      particular forming nano-areas.<br>
      <br>
      However, the islands represent a non-continuous layer or film, for
      instance of silver, on the oxide film. In one embodiment the
      medical device surface is a TiO—Ag-nano-composite-coating.
      Accordingly, the elements or compounds Ti, TiO2, Ag and AgO are
      directly “visible” respectively detectable on the surface. The
      treated surface has an average island cover amount of below or
      equal to 20%, preferably below or equal to 10%.<br>
      <br>
      A chemical characterization of a treated surface results in a
      composition of colloid-dispersed-particles, preferably silver, of
      0.5 to 10 at. %, preferably 1 to 10 at. % most preferably 2 to 6
      at. %.<br>
      <br>
      The chemical characterization of nano-silver on titanium or on a
      titanium alloy results in the following composition:<br>
      <br>
      Ag&nbsp; Ti&nbsp; Al&nbsp; V&nbsp; O<br>
      at. %&nbsp; 1-10&nbsp; 5-40&nbsp; 0-5&nbsp; 0-2&nbsp; 30-70<br>
      <br>
      The controlling of the covering amount of the islands can be used
      to adjust the “effect” of the islands. For instance the
      antibacterial efficacy can be adjusted. One parameter for the
      antibacterial efficacy represents the leaching rate for instance
      of silver ions.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment of Ag-particles the treated surface has an Ag
      ions leaching rate of less than 120 ng·cm&lt;-2&gt;·day&lt;-1&gt;.
      A surface treatment with silver respectively nanoSilver shows a
      very high antimicrobial efficacy with very small potential side
      effects. Due to the high surface on volume ratio of nanoparticles
      (size preferably between 2 and 50 nm), a high efficiency is
      expected even at small doses, thus, reducing the risk of noxious
      effect on cells.<br>
      <br>
      The AC voltage or alternating voltage is applied to the first
      electrode and/or the second electrode. The AC voltage is provided
      with a frequency of 0.01 Hz to 1200 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment the AC voltage is provided as an
      asymmetric AC voltage. The asymmetric AC voltage difference or
      asymmetric AC voltage represents an unbalanced AC voltage. This is
      an alternating voltage with different amplitudes to the negative
      and the positive components. It is emphasized that a pulsed DC
      voltage can be also interpreted as the AC voltage. The negative
      component is provided with an amplitude ranging from -1200 V to
      -0.1 V. Preferably, the negative component is provided with an
      amplitude ranging from -350 V to -0.1 V. In one embodiment, the
      negative component is provided with an amplitude below -180 V or
      ranging from -350 V to -180 V. The positive component is provided
      with an amplitude ranging from 0.1 V to 4800 V. Preferably, the
      positive component is provided with an amplitude ranging from 0.1
      V to 1400 V. In one embodiment, the positive component is provided
      with an amplitude above +250 V or ranging from +250 V to 1400 V.
      In particular the quotient of the positive amplitude divided by
      the negative amplitude needs to be adjusted. The absolute value of
      the quotient ranges from larger 1 to 4.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment the AC voltage is provided as a symmetric AC
      voltage. The negative component of the AC voltage is provided with
      an amplitude ranging from -2400 V to -0.1 V. Preferably, the
      negative component is provided with an amplitude ranging from
      -1200 V to -0.1 V. The positive component of the AC voltage is
      provided with an amplitude ranging from +0.1 V to +2400 V.
      Preferably, the positive component is provided with an amplitude
      ranging from 0.1 V to 1200V.<br>
      <br>
      A combination of both an asymmetric and a symmetric AC voltage is
      also possible. Such a voltage distribution is for instance
      suitable for a step-by-step-process or a multi-step-process for
      the fabrication of one coating. In a first step an asymmetric
      voltage or a symmetric voltage is applied to form the coating. In
      a further or second step, in particular after an interruption, the
      formation of the coating is continued by the application of a
      symmetric voltage or an asymmetric voltage respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The voltage difference is provided with a magnitude which is
      sufficient for carrying out PEO. The voltage is above a breakdown
      voltage of the oxide film growing on the surface of the implant.
      Preferably the maximum of the AC voltage difference is provided in
      the range of 0.1 V to 4800 V. Most preferably the maximum of the
      AC voltage difference is provided in the range of 100 V to 1400 V.
      In dependence on the conductivity of the colloid-dispersed system
      and an optional additional electrolyte, the applied voltage
      difference results to a current density of 0.00001 to 500
      A/dm&lt;2&gt;, preferably of 0.00001 to 100 A/dm&lt;2&gt;.
      Preferably, the applied voltage or voltage distribution is
      essentially constant or unchanged and the current density is
      adjusted during the PEO process.<br>
      <br>
      A deposition rate in the range of 0.01 µm/s to 1 µm/s is achieved.
      Accordingly, with respect to the advantageous thickness of the
      oxide layer and/or the particles islands a deposition time in the
      range of 1 s to 1200 s, preferred 1 s to 300 s, most preferred 20
      s to 260 s, is achievable.<br>
      <br>
      To enable a stable dispersion, the colloid-dispersed system is
      provided with a temperature of -20° C. to +150° C., preferably
      -20° C. to +100° C., most preferably between 0° C. to 75° C. The
      colloid-dispersed system is circulated with a circulation rate of
      0 to 5000 liter/min, preferably 0.01 to 500 liter/min. This is for
      instance achieved by a mixer or mixing means or stirring means. As
      an optional supplement an emulsifying agent or emulsifier is
      provided in the colloid-dispersed system, in particular to avoid
      or to reduce an agglomeration of particles. A typical volume of
      the colloid-dispersed system is in the order of 0.001 liter to 500
      liter, preferably 0.1 liter to 500 liter, most preferably 3 to 20
      liter. Such volumes support an improved electrical field
      distribution in the dispersed system.<br>
      <br>
      An initial medical device surface without any polishing is
      sufficient to achieve a suitable uniform converted surface and a
      suitable stable bonding of the converted surface to the bulk
      material. The initial surface describes the surface before
      subjecting the medical device to the PEO process. A mechanically
      polishing of the initial surface is sufficient to achieve enhanced
      properties. A cost-intensive electro-polishing resulting in a very
      smooth surface is not necessary.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also proposes an apparatus for the treatment of a
      surface of a medical device, in particular a metallic medical
      device, by plasma electrolytic oxidation comprising following
      components:<br>
      <br>
      a bath for containing a colloid-dispersed system,<br>
      preferably means for mixing a colloid-dispersed system in the
      bath,<br>
      means for holding a medical device such that a surface of a
      medical device which is to be treated is immersed in a
      colloid-dispersed system wherein a medical device provides a first
      electrode,<br>
      means for providing a second electrode in a colloid-dispersed
      system contained in the bath,<br>
      a power supply unit for generating an AC voltage which is supplied
      to the first electrode and/or the second electrode,<br>
      means for connecting the first electrode and/or the second
      electrode to the power supply unit wherein<br>
      the means for connecting the first electrode are adapted to an
      immersed medical device such that the cross section ratio ranges
      from 0.1 to 10. Preferably, the cross section ratio ranges from
      0.75 to 4.<br>
      <br>
      The cross section ratio represents the quotient of the medical
      device cross section divided by the cross section of the means for
      connecting the first electrode. The adapted ratio is particularly
      determined in the vicinity of the interface between the medical
      device and the means for connecting.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the means for connecting the first electrode are
      embodied to provide an essentially uniform electric field
      distribution between the first electrode and the second electrode,
      in particular in the vicinity of the treated surface of the
      medical device.<br>
      <br>
      A uniform electric field distribution between the first electrode
      and the second electrode is advantageous to achieve a surface
      conversion of enhanced uniformity. The inventors surprisingly
      discovered that the electric field distribution between the first
      electrode and the second electrode is strongly influenced by the
      embodiment of the means for connecting the first electrode. In
      detail, the electric field distribution is strongly dependent on
      the design and/or the dimensions of the means for connecting the
      first electrode.<br>
      <br>
      The required uniform electric field distribution is achieved by
      means for connecting the first electrode having an adapted reduced
      or an adapted increased cross section with respect to the cross
      section of the connected medical device. In one embodiment the
      means for connecting the first electrode have a, preferably
      circular, cross section with an average diameter of less than or
      equal to 5 mm, preferably less than or equal to 1.5 mm. In a
      preferred embodiment the means for connecting the first electrode
      are provided as a wire. The wire is metallic. The wire is embodied
      to carry an electric current and is for instance embodied as a
      thread, a rod or a strand. The wire can be flexible or
      non-flexible. The means for connecting the first electrode are
      fixed to the medical device as the first electrode. The means for
      connecting the first electrode, in particular the wire, can be
      fixed by welding, gluing, clamping and/or screwing. Preferably,
      the means for connecting the first electrode are provided with the
      same material as a connected medical device. It is emphasized that
      the means for connecting the first electrode can be also provided
      by the means for holding the medical device. I.e. the means for
      holding the medical device and the means for connecting the
      medical device are provided by only one component. In one
      embodiment the means for connecting the first electrode are at
      least partially provided with a thread.<br>
      <br>
      In a further embodiment means for adapting the electrical field
      are provided. For instance the means for adapting the electrical
      field are provided as a component to avoid edges and therefore to
      avoid regions of enhanced electrical field density. In one variant
      according to the invention the means for adapting the electrical
      field are embodied as a cap. This cap can be screwed on the
      thread.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment a gas supply to the colloid-dispersed system
      is provided.<br>
      <br>
      The antibacterial coatings according to the invention could be
      used in the field of traumatology, orthopaedic, osteosynthesis
      and/or endoprothesis, especially where high infection risk exists.
      A high number of currently existing implants or products could
      benefit from such a anti-bactericidal coating.<br>
      <br>
      The medical device is a medical device which is at least partially
      inserted or positioned in a human body and/or an animal body. The
      medical device can be any kind of a medical device.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment the medical device is an implant. The implant is
      a dental implant or an orthopaedic implant. Exemplary embodiments
      of such an implant according to the invention are plates, screws,
      nails, pins, and/or all, preferably external, fixation systems. It
      is emphasized that these applications are exemplary and not
      restricted to this enumeration.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment the medical device is a medical instrument
      or tool. Exemplary embodiments of such a medical instrument are
      surgical instruments and/or diagnostic instruments. One example of
      a surgical instrument represents a scalpel. One example of a
      diagnostic instrument represents an endoscope. It is emphasized
      that these applications are exemplary and not restricted to this
      enumeration.<br>
      <br>
      The surface converted implants according to the invention base in
      a preferred embodiment on biocompatible materials but preferably
      not on biodegradable materials. They are intended for long-term
      application, for instance for several days up to months, and/or
      for quasi-permanent application, as for instance for long term
      implantation of surgical implants and/or prothesises. However, the
      present invention is also applicable for biodegradable materials.<br>
      <br>
      The implant comprises at least one metal selected from the group
      consisting of titanium, titanium alloys, chromium alloys, cobalt
      alloys and stainless steel. An alloy comprises at least 50
      weight-% of the named main element. Some typical examples for
      titanium alloys are TiAl6V4, TiAl6Nb7 and/or TiZr. Some typical
      examples for chromium alloys are CrNi and/or CrNiMo. Some typical
      examples for cobalt alloys are CoCr and/or CoCrMo. Some typical
      examples for stainless steel are types 316L and/or 304. It is
      emphasized that above mentioned alloys are exemplary and not
      restricted to this enumeration.<br>
      <br>
      In particular the apparatus according to the invention is adapted
      to execute any of the method steps according to the invention. In
      particular the method according to the present invention is
      feasible by means of the apparatus according to the invention. In
      particular the medical device, for instance an implant, according
      to the invention is producible, preferably is produced, by means
      of the apparatus according to the invention and/or with the method
      according to the invention. The or a medical device, for instance
      embodied as an implant, comprises a surface composed of an oxide
      film which is partially covered with islands of an antimicrobial
      material, preferably silver, and/or with an apatite, preferably
      HA.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is explained subsequently in more detail on the
      basis of preferred embodiments and with reference to the appended
      figures. The features of the different embodiments are able to be
      combined with one another. Identical reference numerals in the
      figures denote identical or similar parts.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      FIG. 1 illustrates an apparatus for the fabrication of a coating
      according to the invention. The subsequent detailed description is
      only directed to an implant as one exemplary embodiment of a
      medical device. For instance for the coating of long term
      implantation surgical implants the present innovative technique
      based on the Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) has been
      developed. PEO is an electrochemical surface treatment process for
      generating oxide coatings on metals. As a pulsed alternating
      current, with a high voltage, is passed through the
      colloid-dispersed system 4 or the electrolyte bath 4, a controlled
      plasma discharge is formed and sparks are generated on the
      substrate surface. This plasma discharge converts the surface of
      the metal into an oxide coating. The coating is in fact a chemical
      conversion of the substrate and grows both inwards and outwards
      from the original metal surface. Because it is a conversion
      coating, rather than a deposited coating (such as a coating formed
      by plasma spraying), it has excellent adhesion to the substrate
      metal (see FIGS. 9a and 9b). A wide range of substrate alloys can
      be coated with this technique.<br>
      <br>
      The dispersed system 4 is provided in a bath 5. An implant 20 as a
      first electrode 1 is provided in the dispersed system 4. In the
      illustrated embodiment the implant 20 is completely immersed in
      the liquid 4 respectively the dispersed system 4. A second
      electrode 2 is provided as a cup also immersed or provided in the
      colloid-dispersed system 4. The second electrode 2 “surrounds” the
      first electrode 1.<br>
      <br>
      The temperature of the dispersed system 4 is maintained or
      controlled by a heat exchanger 6 and/or a pumping system 7 and/or
      means for mixing 8. A circulation and/or mixing of the dispersed
      system 4 is achieved by the means for mixing 8. The means for
      mixing 8 are for instance provided by an acoustic hydrodynamic
      generator. As a possible and shown supplement a gas supply 9, for
      instance for air, can be also provided to the means for mixing 8.
      The circulation of the liquid avoids an agglomeration of the
      nano-particles contained in the dispersed system 4.<br>
      <br>
      In a further non-shown embodiment the second electrode 2 is
      provided by the bath 5 or the container 5 itself. This is for
      instance suitable for a container 5 which is provided by a
      conductive material. In such an embodiment the bath 5 and the
      second electrode 2 are provided as one-piece.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment the first electrode 1 is approximately
      positioned in the center of the second electrode 2 to achieve a
      uniform electrical field distribution. The design of the means for
      connecting 3 the first electrode 1 is chosen to preserve an
      essential uniform or adapted electric field distribution between
      the first electrode 1 and the second electrode 2. For this the
      cross section and/or the geometry of the means for connecting 3
      the implant 20 is/are adapted to the cross section and/or the
      geometry of the implant 20. FIGS. 1b to 1d schematically show
      three exemplary embodiments of the means for connecting 3 the
      implant 20.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 1b to 1d illustrate possible embodiments of the means for
      connecting 3 each having an adapted reduced cross section with
      respect to the implant 20. Accordingly, the cross section ratio
      (representing the quotient of the medical device cross section
      divided by the cross section of the means for connecting the first
      electrode) is greater than 1 and less than 4. The reduced cross
      section of the means for connecting 3 is illustrated by the
      diameters d1 and d2 with d1&lt;d2. The adapted reduced cross
      section is particularly determined in the vicinity or the area of
      the interface 35 between the implant 20 and the means for
      connecting 3.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 1b the means for connecting 3 the first electrode 1
      (respectively the implant 20) are embodied as a wire 3. The wire 3
      is embodied as a, preferably cylindrical, rod 3. The rod 3 is
      embodied both for enabling the electrical contact and for holding
      the implant 20.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1c illustrates the coating configuration for a nut as an
      implant 20. Since nuts 20 are generally quite small, for instance
      below or equal to 1 cm, the coating of a nut 20 is quite
      “complicated”. The means for connecting 3 the first electrode 1
      are also embodied as a wire 3. The wire 3 is partially embodied as
      a, preferably cylindrical, rod 3. The end-section of the rod 3 is
      embodied with a thread 31. The nut 20 is screwed on the thread 31.
      A cap 32 is applied or screwed to the end-section of the thread
      31. The gaps above and below the nut 20 have a size of about 1 mm.
      The application of such a cap 32 enables the formation of a
      uniform coating also on the upper and the lower front side of the
      nut 20. The cap 32 represents means for adapting the electrical
      field. The rod 3 is embodied both for enabling the electrical
      contact and for holding the implant 20.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 1d the means for connecting 3 the first electrode 1
      (respectively the implant 20) are embodied as well as a wire 3.
      The wire 3 is now embodied as a strand 3. The strand 3 enables
      only the electrical contact. It is fed through a holder 33 which
      is preferably non-conductive. The holder 33 mechanically holds the
      implant 20.<br>
      <br>
      The AC voltage is provided by the power supply 10 (see FIG. 1a).
      The application of an asymmetric pulsed AC voltage results in a
      dense coating. The positive part of the pulse enables the growing
      of the converted surface. At the beginning of the oxide layer
      growing process the converted surface is characterized by a dense
      structure. With increasing oxide layer coating thickness the
      coating is getting more and more porous. The particles of the
      coating are getting more and more loosen. These loosen particles
      are removed in the negative part of the pulse. Accordingly, the
      negative part of the pulse is a so-called etching part. An
      asymmetric AC voltage is a voltage with different amplitudes to
      the positive and negative components. In particular the quotient
      of the positive amplitude divided by the negative amplitude needs
      to be adjusted. The absolute value of the quotient ranges from
      &gt;1 to 4. For illustration purposes FIG. 1e schematically shows
      an asymmetric AC voltage distribution for amplitudes U1 of +200 V
      and -50V. These voltages are for instance applied to the implant
      20 as the first electrode 1 (see FIG. 1a). In this embodiment the
      voltage of the second electrode 2 is for instance on ground
      potential. The shape is illustrated as being approximately
      rectangular-shaped. The shape can also be, in particular
      partially, a kind of a sinus or a sinus. For some applications
      also a symmetric AC voltage distribution is suitable. One
      exemplary application is the obtaining of a coating with a very
      high surface roughness for improved implant-bone bonding. For
      illustration purposes FIG. 1f schematically shows a symmetric AC
      voltage distribution for amplitudes U1 of -200 V and +200V.<br>
      <br>
      Nanosilver particles with a particle size of about 1 to 20 nm,
      preferably 15 nm, are very suitable. This leads to an enhanced
      specific surface area and therefore to a high amount of
      dissolvable silver ions. The silver ions are responsible for the
      specific activity against a broad variety of bacteria, fungi and
      yeasts.<br>
      <br>
      Silver ions inactivate critical physiological functions like
      cell-wall synthesis, trans-membrane transport, nucleic acid
      reproduction or protein functions. All of these actions result in
      a short-term death of microorganisms. Because of this multiple
      modes of antimicrobial action, it is very improbable, that the
      microorganisms develop a resistance to silver. Beyond the
      antimicrobial activity of the silver ions, new research projects
      show, that nanosilver in particular shows an activity against
      viruses like HIV or hepatitis.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 2a to 11b show experimental results of an Ag—TiO2 coating
      according to the invention. The used substrate or implant material
      is TiAl6V4 ELI alloy. TiAl6V4 ELI alloy (Extra Low Interstitials,
      ISO 5832-3) is a higher purity grade of TiAl6V4 alloy. This grade
      has lower oxygen, carbon, and iron content. It is commonly used in
      biomedical applications such as surgical instruments and
      orthopedic implants.<br>
      <br>
      First, FIGS. 2a to 2d show the results of a topographical
      characterization (according to ISO/TS 10993-19:2006). As an
      example a screw having a coating according to the invention was
      analyzed. The coating surface topography has been investigated by
      stereo light microscopy (FIG. 2a) and scanning electron microscopy
      (SEM) in topography contrast mode (FIGS. 2b to 2d).<br>
      <br>
      The images show a uniform and homogeneous coating of the surface
      (FIGS. 2a and 2b). At higher magnification the characteristic
      features of the PEO coatings are revealed: flat elevated plateaus
      with some deepening between them (FIG. 2c). The average deepening
      is 20 µm deep (FIG. 2d). The topographical characterization
      reveals a dense coating with a high specific surface area.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 2c and 2d show the typical features of a converted surface
      by PEO. For illustration purposes FIG. 2e schematically shows a
      converted surface in a cross sectional view. The converted surface
      is continuously covered with the oxide layer. A typical thickness
      is below 25 µm. The oxide film is characterized by hills and/or
      plateaus separated by grooves and/or channels. On top of the oxide
      layer said islands are developed forming a non-continuous layer of
      metallic Ag and partially Ag0. The islands can be formed on the
      plateaus and in the grooves. The islands have a typical thickness
      below 100 nm and a typical diameter ranging from 5 nm to 200 nm.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 3a and 3b show the results of a physico-chemical
      characterization (according to ISO/TS 10993-19:2006). The SEM
      images in chemical contrast mode show the presence of a heavy
      element on the coating surface, in particular embodied as island
      (bright areas on FIG. 3b). Energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS)
      confirms the presence of silver (FIG. 3a). Silver is homogeneously
      or uniformly distributed all over the coating surface. The typical
      silver-containing areas are much less than 1 µm.<br>
      <br>
      In FIGS. 4a and 4b results of a chemical characterization
      (according to ISO 10993-18:2005) are presented. The surface
      elemental composition was more precisely assessed by X-ray
      Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) using a PHI 5500 ESCA
      spectrometer (monochromatic Al Ka radiation), each values reported
      below are the mean value of three independent analyses.<br>

      The coating surface is mostly composed of titanium oxide with
      silver and carbon. Extremely low amount of nitrogen, chlorine and
      sulfur has also been found as contaminants.<br>
      <br>
      XPS depth profiling (sputtering with a 3 keV Ar ions beam, surface
      area 3.8×4.2 mm) was performed on the coating to investigate its
      in-depth composition uniformity; an estimation of the thickness of
      the silver containing part of the coating was thus obtained:
      &lt;100 nm.<br>
      <br>
      After 2 min of sputtering the carbon content sharply decreases
      revealing the presence of a small organic surface contamination
      (FIG. 4a). This carbon surface contamination is often found by XPS
      and is probably due to the transport and the handling of the
      samples prior to the analysis. It's, also, after 2 min of
      sputtering that the highest concentration of Ag is detected (FIG.
      4b).<br>
      <br>
      Afterwards a continuous decrease of the Ag concentration is
      observed, revealing a diffusion pattern of the silver into the
      oxide layer. This observation is also consistent with the SEM
      results which indicate that the silver is present as small
      particles and not as a continuous layer. There is no sharp
      interface between the oxide layer and the Ag island. For instance,
      this is in contrast to surfaces converted to an oxide and
      deposited with an Ag coating.<br>
      <br>
      High resolution binding spectra were also recorded (results are
      not shown). The 0 binding spectra refer mainly to TiO2, with a
      small amount of other metal oxides (mainly Al and Ag). The Ag
      binding spectra shows the presence of silver oxides and metallic
      silver, no silver chloride was observed.<br>
      <br>
      Subsequently are shown the results for the anti-microbial efficacy
      assessment of the coating according to the present invention.
      Materials for osteosynthesis (for instance pins, screws etc.)
      require for good biointegration a very specific surface, which
      allows human tissue cells to settle on them at the same time. This
      surface enables bacteria to settle, so that they compete with the
      human cells for proliferation on the surface.<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of a nanoSilver-coating is the prevention of
      problematic bacterial growth on the surface of coated materials
      for osteosynthesis. One task of the invention is to find an
      optimal silver concentration for the coating, which shows a high
      antibacterial activity without any cytotoxic effect (according to
      ISO 10993-5).<br>
      <br>
      The bacteria strain was used for every test: Staphylococcus
      epidermidis ATCC 35984.<br>
      <br>
      This bacteria strain has the following characteristics:<br>
      <br>
      Primary occupant of the skin.<br>
      Colonizes surfaces of prosthetic devices.<br>
      Biofilm formation<br>
      shield against the patient's immune system use of antibiotics
      necessary.<br>
      Antibiotic resistant strains are spreading (actual rate of MRSE
      related to all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains in Germany: ca.
      70%.).<br>
      <br>
      No relevant standard has been found in common literature to assess
      the inhibition of a biofilm formation. Consequently a custom-made
      test was developed: The tests were performed using the
      Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984 strains. Pure silver rods
      were used as positive control and pure titanium alloy rods were
      used as negative control.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5a illustrates the steps to prepare the samples and FIG. 5b
      shows the results of said biofilm formation test: The Bacteria
      amount found on the nanoSilver, Ag-rods and Ti-alloy rods
      depending on the incubation time. A sharp reduction of the
      bacteria amount has been observed on the Ag—TiO2 coating compare
      to titanium-alloy (&gt;log 3 reduction) after 12 h of incubation.
      The nanoSilver coating even shows better results than pure silver
      (FIG. 5b). After 18 h of incubation, no more bacteria were found
      on the surface of the Ag—TiO2 coating. One explanation bases on an
      enhanced ratio of surface/volume of a nano-silver coating.<br>
      <br>
      There exist several standard-test methods to determine the
      antimicrobial activity of coated surfaces. For screening purposes,
      a proliferation test is used. Bacteria commonly attend to adhere
      on surfaces. This ambition is mainly disturbed by antimicrobial
      and/or hydrophobic functionalization of surfaces, leading to a
      strong decrease in bacteria adhesion. The proliferation test shows
      this effect by the help of a specific test procedure. The
      bacterial growth behavior leads to an estimation of an
      antimicrobial effect on treated surfaces compared to an untreated
      surface. FIG. 6a shows the steps to perform the proliferation
      test.<br>
      <br>
      The test is conducted with exponentially growing bacteria with
      commercially available 96-well-microtiter-plate. The test
      specimens ideally have a cylindrical shape with 4 mm diameter and
      a length of 12 mm.<br>
      <br>
      The bacterial proliferation is determined by measuring the optical
      density at 578 nm in a special designed 64-fold-photometer.<br>
      <br>
      For each sample an individual growth curve is displayed (see FIG.
      6e). The interpretation of the growth curves is illustrated in
      FIGS. 6b to 6d: (b) exponential growth—no antibacterial activity,
      (c) lag phase growth—slight antibacterial activity and (d) no
      detectable growth—strong antibacterial activity.<br>
      <br>
      Samples (in each test round, internal controls were also tested):<br>
      <br>
      Negative control: HDPE-rods (have to show exponential growth).<br>
      Medium growth control: Some wells of the microtiter-plate were
      filled up with contaminated nutrient solution to control the
      bacterial growth under optimal conditions.<br>
      Sterility control: blank wells and uncontaminated samples shall
      not show any bacterial growth.<br>
      Positive control: Pure Ag-rods (no growth should be detectable).<br>
      <br>
      The antibacterial efficacy of the nanoSilver coating is estimated
      by comparing the bacterial growth on that surface with an
      untreated surface (Blank).<br>
      <br>
      Blank samples: TiAl6V4 Eli Alloy rods.<br>
      Samples with nanoSilver coating: TiAl6V4 Eli Alloy rods with
      Ag—TiO2 coating (5% recipe).<br>
      <br>
      The results are presented in FIG. 6e. All controls show the
      expected growth curves, the test is valid. Compared to pure
      titanium rods, the Ag—TiO2 coated rods show a strong antibacterial
      efficacy, which is as high as of pure silver rods.<br>
      <br>
      A test for antimicrobial activity and efficacy is performed
      according to JIS 22801. The JIS Z 2801 standard specifies the
      testing methods to evaluate antimicrobial activity and
      antimicrobial efficacy on bacteria on the surface of antimicrobial
      products. The value of antimicrobial activity shows the difference
      in the logarithmic value of viable cell counts between
      antimicrobial products and untreated products after inoculation
      and incubation of bacteria. So in contrast to the Proliferation
      test the antibacterial activity can be quantified.<br>
      <br>
      This testing method is applicable to products other than textile
      products, such as plastic products, metal products, and ceramic
      products.<br>
      <br>
      The test samples were inoculated with a certain number of bacteria
      after preparation. To assure a good distribution of the inoculum,
      the test piece is covered with a special film (PE-foil). The test
      pieces are incubated at 37° C. for 18 h. After incubation, the
      bacteria were washed out with nutrient solution. With this washing
      suspension a viable cell count (agar plate culture method) is
      conducted.<br>
      <br>
      Samples:<br>
      <br>
      Blank sample: TiAl6V4 Eli Alloy disks.<br>
      Sample with nanoSilver coating: TiAl6V4 Eli Alloy disks with
      Ag—TiO2 coating (5% recipe).<br>
      Negative control: Polystyrene-surface (a certain number of
      bacteria have to survive, otherwise the test has to be rejected).<br>
      <br>
      The results show a strong antimicrobial activity of the
      nanoSilver, with more than log 4 reduction compared to TiAl6V4 Eli
      Alloy.<br>
      <br>
      Further investigations were directed to silver leaching (according
      to ISO 10993-17:2002). The intention of this work package includes
      the correlation between antimicrobial activity and amount of
      released silver ions from the sample surface. It is developed a
      method of silver trace and species analysis with an appropriate
      method of sample preparation.<br>
      <br>
      The analysis is performed by graphite furnace atomic absorption
      spectrometry (GF-AAS). The main focus has been laid on silver
      release mechanisms under physiological conditions. A test set up
      has to be created, which simulates conditions similar to the
      environment of the coating in a patients tissue. Therefore
      Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) was chosen as a leaching agent.<br>
      <br>
      The Test Procedure is as Following:<br>
      <br>
      Test Series A (Pseudo-Dynamic Model):<br>
      <br>
      Samples are immersed in 1 ml PBS.<br>
      After 1 day gently shaking at 20° C. samples are transferred into
      the next vial with new PBS.<br>
      Test Series B (Static Model):<br>
      Samples are immersed in 10 ml PBS.<br>
      After certain intervals of gently shaking at 37° C. an aliquot
      (0.5 ml) is transferred into a fresh vial.<br>
      The Following Test Steps are Analogue in Both Test Series:<br>
      Ag content in PBS is analyzed after addition of nitric acid.<br>
      Silver analysis, done by graphite furnace atomic absorption
      spectrometry (GF-AAS).<br>
      Tested Samples:<br>
      Blank samples: TiAl6V4 Eli Alloy rods (Ti rod).<br>
      Samples with nanoSilver coating: TiAl6V4 Eli Alloy rods with
      Ag—TiO2 coating.<br>
      Positive control: pure silver rods (Ag rod)<br>
      <br>
      The Following Results are Achieved:<br>
      <br>
      Test series A: The nanoSilver coating shows silver release quite
      similar to pure silver rods.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 shows analytical results obtained by GF-AAS of released Ag
      amount (ng) from the sample surface (mm&lt;2&gt;) as a function of
      immersion time (days) at RT in PBS. The displayed error bars show
      the variance of three independent analyses. The leaching rate is
      essentially uniform as a function of immersion time.<br>
      <br>
      After 15 days:<br>
      <br>
      Daily release from pure silver rod remains constant after a
      decrease in the first days.<br>
      Daily release from nanoSilver rod constant.<br>
      Sum of leached Ag amounts during 15 days of leaching: 6.3 µg.<br>
      <br>
      The antibacterial activity (shown in the proliferation test)
      corresponds to the amount of released silver ions.<br>
      <br>
      Test series B: According to our kinetics-test-conditions an
      equilibrium is reached after 24 hours.<br>
      Agaq&lt;+&gt;?Agsolid&lt;+&gt;[from oxidized Ag(AgCl, Ag1O . . .
      )]<br>
      <br>
      In this case the silver release at the equilibrium is about 0.4
      ng·g&lt;-l&gt;·mm&lt;-2 &gt;<br>
      If the 10 ml solution would be changed daily for 8 weeks, one can
      expect a total silver release of about 22.4
      ng·g&lt;-1&gt;·mm&lt;-2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 shows GF-AAS results of released Ag (ng) from the sample
      surface (mm&lt;2&gt;) as a function of time (days) at 37° C. in
      PBS. The analytical data are a mean value of three independent
      analyses. The leaching rate is essentially uniform or constant as
      a function of immersion time.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 9a and 9b show the results of a mechanical testing. Stereo
      light microscopy images of a coated rod after bending test are
      presented. The Ag—TiO2 coating adhesion has been investigated
      according to the ASTM B571-97 standard. The coated samples have
      been bent at various angles and the deformed area has been
      observed by stereo light microscopy for any sign of peeling or
      flaking of the coating from the substrate. No peeling or flaking
      of the coating has been observed even after failure of the
      substrate has occurred. The adhesion strength of the coating is
      greater than the cohesion strength of the substrate, which reveals
      a perfect adhesion according to the used standard.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 shows the experimental results with respect to
      biocompatibility evaluation: ZK20 cells growing on
      nanoSilver/TiAl6V4 disks.<br>
      <br>
      Cell culture has been performed using coated and uncoated TiAl6V4
      disks as substrates. For this study two cell lines have been
      selected: the Osteosarcoma cell line (HOS TE85) and a primary
      mesenchymal stem cells from human bone dust (ZK20). The samples
      incubation has been performed at 37° C. in a 95% air-5% CO2
      atmosphere. After various incubation times (days or weeks,
      depending on the cell lines) the samples were prepared for light
      microscopy analysis and cells viability and proliferation have
      been investigated.<br>
      <br>
      The two types of cell present a good adhesion and proliferation on
      the two types of surfaces (TiAl6V4 and nanoSilver). The two types
      of cell tend to agglomerate on the nanoSilver coating surface.<br>
      <br>
      After a special fixation procedure, aimed at killing the cells
      with the least distortion of structure possible, the samples have
      been analyzed by electron microscopy. An SEM image of ZK20 cells
      on nanoSilver coating is presented. The SEM image confirms the
      good cell adhesion and proliferation on the nanoSilver coating
      surface. Even a kind of cell anchor is visible.<br>
      <br>
      Summarizing, it was shown that an Ag—TiO2 coating according to the
      invention shows excellent properties in terms of antibacterial
      efficacy (even against multi-resistant strains), adhesion and
      biocompatibility.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, FIG. 11 presents a XRD image of a Ti-screw with a HA
      coating (hydroxyapatite). In detail it is presented the detected
      number of counts as a function of the angle 2 theta.<br>
      <br>
      The parameters for this analysis are as follows:<br>
      <br>
      Apparatus: Bruker D8 GADDS XRD (voltage: 40 KV and intensity: 40
      mA)<br>
      Measurement range: Theta angle: 17-93.7° increment: 0.02° and
      steptime: 60 s<br>
      Measuring point: Top of the titanium screw.<br>
      <br>
      The sample contains mostly Titanium and Anatase (TiO2). Titanium
      and TiO2 originate from the bulk respectively the converted
      surface. Also a very small quantity of HA is detected. The
      intensity differences of certain HA peak is due to a preferential
      orientation of the crystallites on the surface of the screw.
      However, these are the first hints that it is possible to detect
      HA itself on the converted surface and not only constituents of
      HA.<br>
      <br>
      The small amount of detected HA can be explained by the selected
      configuration of the experimental set-up. The chosen angular range
      of the analysis beam results in an enhanced sensitivity to the
      bulk material (Ti) covered with a layer of TiO2 (thickness of
      several µm) and to a reduced sensitivity to a surface and a near
      surface composition of HA (thickness of some 100 nm or below).<br>
      <br>
      It is expected to detect an increasing amount of HA in a so-called
      grazing incidence geometry. In this geometry the analysis beam is
      directed to the surface in a small angle (for instance of about
      1.5 degree) with respect to the surface which is to be analyzed.
      The sensitivity for the surface composition and the near surface
      composition is enhanced in this grazing incidence geometry.<br>

        <b> </b><b>METHOD FOR PREVENTING DISEASE IN ORAL CAVITY</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To electrically prevent the onset of dental
      caries through diminishing electrical potential difference present
      in the oral cavity. ;<br>
      SOLUTION: A method for preventing the onset of dental caries is
      provided, including the following process: both the endothelia and
      cuticles of the oral cavity are installed with polarizable anodes
      using a carbonaceous material to diminish the electrical potential
      difference between the teeth and gingiva to inhibit dissolving by
      electrolytic dissociation calcium phosphate as the main component
      of the teeth. In the method, as material for the electrodes, a
      carbonaceous material such as active carbon, bone charcoal,
      charcoal, graphite or carbon black is preferable; and it is a
      preferable method for installing the electrodes that, for the
      endothelia of the oral cavity, a flexible resin compound filled
      with powdery carbonaceous material is installed in the mouth,
      while for the cuticles of the oral cavity, a sheet-like
      carbonaceous electrode is installed on the cheek or underjaw; and
      negative electric charges are generated in the oral cavity through
      electric double layer to diminish the electrical potential
      difference in the oral cavity of 100-500 mV in the non-installed
      case to 100 mV or less to make the electrochemical reactions among
      the teeth and between the teeth and gingiva slower. <br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001]<br>
      The present invention relates to a polarizable electrode in order
      to prevent diseases by changing the electrical environment in the
      oral cavity.<br>
      The main oral diseases to which the present invention is directed
      to tooth decay, teeth and gums pain, relates to the field, such as
      dry mouth and heartburn.<br>
      <br>
      [0002]<br>
      Caries certain oral bacteria produce an acidic substance from
      carbohydrate, this tooth is because the cause dental caries by.<br>
      To brushing good teeth for this, periodically carried out a
      scaling, by performing the fluorine treatment, and ingest instead
      xylitol sugar has become a major precautions as a sweetening
      ingredient.<br>
      However, looking at the results of the survey that the Ministry of
      Health, Labour and Welfare is doing, but the effect of preventive
      measures is seen slightly, and whether look try has become what
      the effect over a lifetime, about self-specific tooth 7 percentage
      has continued to state that they've been lost in until about 80
      years of age, large preventive effect of can not read it has
      become a reality.<br>
      Of teeth and gums pain, has become a main and drug treatment to be
      performed from the symptoms is also generated with respect to dry
      mouth and heartburn, perfectly valid prophylaxis not it is at
      present.<br>
      <br>
      [0003]<br>
      For 2005 fiscal year dental disease survey results (Ministry of
      Health, Labour and Welfare)<br>
      <br>
      [0004]<br>
      The inventors have, caries of teeth rather than by the production
      of just acidic substance, and the perspective of electrochemical
      action between teeth and teeth and gums is the major cause,
      prevention of tooth decay occurs that to establish the plan was
      the initial challenge.<br>
      Gums pain, with respect to dry mouth and heartburn as it found
      expression effect in association with the cavities of precautions,
      it was not expected challenge from the beginning.<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      The present invention, electricity is arranged polarizable
      electrodes composed mainly of carbon out of oral and / or oral
      cavity and reduce the potential difference to be distributed in
      the oral cavity, generated between between the teeth and the teeth
      and gums chemistry relaxed and is for a means of preventing the
      development of dental caries.<br>
      The principle is, I thought in the following manner.<br>
      Carbon electrodes are positively charged when proximate to or in
      contact with a living body, the living body There are negatively
      charged, it becomes possible to produce a so-called electric
      double layer.<br>
      It is to neutralize the electrical environment that has a positive
      charge around the teeth adjacent, so reducing the potential
      difference between the teeth and gums.<br>
      Therefore, an electrochemical reaction between the teeth and gums
      dissolution of calcium less is relaxed.<br>
      Between the living body site and a non-contact state of the living
      body where the carbon electrode is in contact potential difference
      20~100mV was observed.<br>
      In this case, the site where the carbon electrode is in contact
      with positive, non-contact portion has been a negative potential.<br>
      In over 50 adults, was observed potential difference of about
      50~500mV in a state without attachment of the carbon electrodes,
      150mV or more high potential difference in the case of persons
      with untreated dental caries was observed.<br>
      No juvenile of 10 before and after the age of tooth decay, was
      generally less than 100mV.<br>
      If the galvanic type electrochemical cell provided with an
      aluminum foil to the carbon electrode and the counter is close to
      the living body in the mouth and out, a decrease in potential
      difference in the oral cavity is observed but the skin is felt
      itching around electrode redness and allergy symptoms occurred.<br>
      It is presumed that a current flows in the vicinity of the skin
      surface.<br>
      This phenomenon carbon single electrodes did not occur.<br>
      The present invention also, at the same time occurrence and
      prevention of dental caries, was also effective as a means of
      improving the teeth and gums pain, dry mouth, and heartburn.<br>
      Means of the present invention is placed in proximity to or in
      contact with (1) a synthetic resin film, paper, carbon material
      held in the woven or nonwoven oral endothelial oral outer skin or
      oral endothelial and oral hull, between the teeth and a method for
      preventing tooth decay, tooth and gum pain, dry mouth and
      heartburn by relaxing the electrode reaction between the teeth and
      gums.<br>
      (2) natural resin, a mixture of synthetic resins or natural resins
      and synthetic resin as a binder, powder, granular or powdery and
      molded article oral endothelium a mixed carbon material granulated
      was a filler, oral hull or is arranged close to or in contact with
      the oral endothelial and oral outer skin, a method for preventing
      tooth decay, tooth and gum pain, dry mouth and heartburn by
      relaxing the electrode reaction between the teeth and between the
      teeth and the teeth and gums .<br>
      (3) natural resins, oral endothelial while the mixture film or
      molding of a binder, powder on the surface, coated granular or
      powdery and granular carbon material of synthetic resin or natural
      resins and synthetic resins , is arranged close to or in contact
      with the oral outer skin or oral endothelial and oral hull, caries
      by relaxing the electrode reaction between and between the teeth
      and gums of the teeth, the teeth and gums pain, dry mouth and
      heartburn how to prevent.<br>
      (4) above (1), (2) and (3) a carbon material as described
      comprises a water soluble calcium salt, is located close to or in
      contact with the oral endothelium, between the teeth and the teeth
      and gums method for preventing tooth decay, tooth and gum pain,
      dry mouth and heartburn by relaxing the electrode reaction between
      by 4 way over.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      Carbon material to be used activated carbon, alone or in a mixture
      of bone black or charcoal is preferred harmless to the human body.<br>
      Graphite, also carbon black is available.<br>
      It is easy Carbon fiber is also effective to scatter collapsed
      fiber, measures such solidify fibers together was necessary.<br>
      The shape of the carbon material is of a powder or / and
      particulate are used.<br>
      Powder or / and by molding the granular carbon material in advance
      in bulk it is also possible to use.<br>
      (3) are preferably used by coating the powder or / and processed
      surface of the mouthpiece as granular carbon material to conform
      to the shape, such as toothed in the mouth in the case of.<br>
      As a method for coating, heating the carbon material at about 200
      ?, is brought into contact with the mouthpiece, the mouthpiece
      surface is softened by high temperature of the carbon material,
      the melt adhesion method the carbon material is integral with the
      mouthpiece is preferably at the same time.<br>
      Coating method using conventional techniques for applying a paint
      containing a carbon material to the film or molding surfaces are
      also applicable.<br>
      Natural resin to be used, Sapotaceae, Apocynaceae, ester gum
      obtained from chicle or rosin that produced the sap collected from
      plants such as Moraceae or Euphorbiaceae are preferred.<br>
      Synthetic resin polyisoprene, polyvinyl acetate resin, EVA resin
      or silicon and silicon rubber is particularly preferable.<br>
      In addition, polyethylene, polypropylene, PET, vinyl chloride
      resin, nylon, such as polyurethane resin generic can also be used.<br>
      These resins processed molded articles, foam moldings that there
      is internal to fine cavity can also be used.<br>
      Hardness of the molded article and I is determined by considering
      the usability to hard objects from soft ones.<br>
      When using an acrylic resin having a self-adhesive, it is possible
      to improve the wearability becomes possible to the electrode
      itself tacky.<br>
      <br>
      [0007]<br>
      Carbon material to be placed in the oral cavity, was preferred
      those rod around an outer diameter of 10mm filled with a carbon
      material in a bag-like woven or non-woven in the case of (1).<br>
      Also, spread activated carbon uniformly between two cotton woven
      fabric, which is quilting process to be good results methods of
      wrapping is obtained.<br>
      When placed outside the mouth, the synthetic resin film for
      holding the carbon material as a base material, subjecting the
      paper, woven fabric, the adhesive processed into non-woven or
      carbon material, was considered a form of paste directly to the
      skin may be convenient.<br>
      (2) thickness 1~2mm, those flat chewing gum-like length 30~50mm
      was preferred in the case of.<br>
      Its shape is flat, granular, star-shaped, is capable of any shape
      such as granular, determined with an emphasis on ease of use.<br>
      This molded product, was good usability without discomfort
      especially when used in the oral cavity.<br>
      The thickness of the molded product, it is possible to thin while
      holding the effect to about 0.01mm.<br>
      When there is a problem with the thickness of thin strength is
      applied or bonded to the reinforcing sheet substrate.<br>
      The ones that are filled with carbon material into the pores of
      the molded article having pores was also effective.<br>
      (3) above as used to embed the granular carbon material onto the
      surface of the mouthpiece for sports in a heated state and the
      mounting property is good, effectively it is possible to use the
      case.<br>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      The potential difference in the mouth, using a tester can measure
      the DC voltage of up to 1mV, was focused measured around the
      teeth.<br>
      When a carbon material at any location and placed in the oral
      cavity, the carbon material side showed a positive potential.<br>
      The potential difference in the mouth individual differences is
      large, about 100mV above in adults, if a value greater than 50mV
      in people with low potential difference was almost.<br>
      With the carbon electrode of the present invention, this intraoral
      potential difference is less than 50mV, it is possible to be a
      less often 30mV, it was able to mitigate the electrode reaction
      between the teeth and the teeth and the teeth and gums.<br>
      It should be noted that teen before and after the juvenile was
      almost less than 100mV of intraoral potential difference.<br>
      <br>
      [0009]<br>
      By the carbon material of the present invention is placed in the
      mouth and out as polarizable electrodes, calcium potential
      difference is observed which is the main component of the teeth is
      reduced during and between the teeth and gums of the teeth in the
      mouth dissolved becomes difficult.<br>
      Dental caries is unlikely to occur due to this.<br>
      Generation of plaque was also extremely low.<br>
      Plaque is the concentration of calcium reaches saturation, it is
      considered a substance composed mainly of excess calcium is caused
      to precipitate on the surface of the tooth, the electrodes to be
      placed in the oral cavity of the present invention pre-soluble
      calcium salt the includes, for allowance of up to the saturation
      solubility is low, I is considered to have the effect of
      preventing the dissolution of the calcium of the teeth.<br>
      In addition to these effects, improves the teeth and gums pain,
      dry mouth and heartburn that the mouth is dry and I have found
      that saliva can be improved is abundantly secreted.<br>
      Quality improvement of life to be able to eat hard food also
      commonly has been achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0010]<br>
      Described in the section Means for Solving the Problem (1), (2),
      considered the best strategy (3) and (4) out of the way (1).<br>
      Fibers for holding the carbon material is made of cotton plain
      unstained, is suitable strike string having a diameter of about
      10mm.<br>
      Striking straps, has a hollow structure, I pack here in a coconut
      shell activated carbon that has been crushed to 60 mesh as a
      carbon material full.<br>
      Both ends of the compression straps, sealed and tied to not spill
      contents by winding a cotton thread to a finished electrode.<br>
      The electrode is cooled by scalding about 10 minutes in boiling
      water, to live and be placed between teeth and lips.<br>
      After electrode placement, the secretion of saliva coming become
      popular in about 10 minutes.<br>
      This saliva may be even spit swallow.<br>
      Dentition by this process can be restored to normal health at
      approximately a few hours.<br>
      After this, 1 × 2cm of graphite sheet (manufactured by Hitachi
      Chemical Co., HGP-207 0.25t) on the cheek and chin are life stuck
      in the plaster, then, not that the teeth of the state is
      exacerbated, subsequent three years occurrence of dental caries
      over was not.<br>
      Are thinking good following this strategy, it is a strategy (2).<br>
      Electrode replacing Among these calcium carbonate, which is
      formulated as a filler for chewing gum on coconut shell activated
      carbon has become the preferred result.<br>
      In this case, it becomes to be spit after chewing for about 30
      minutes and has excellent palatability There is also sweet.<br>
      On the other hand, the effect can be continuously maintained if
      enforced about three times a day but there is a disadvantage that
      prolonged oral placement difficult.<br>
      Carbon electrode to be placed in the oral cavity it is preferable
      to include a water soluble calcium salt.<br>
      Calcium salt may be less than or equal to 5% by weight of apatite
      of teeth and the same material for carbon.<br>
      Preferably may be a 2-3%.<br>
      About me is illustrated by the following examples.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]<br>
      Cotton fabric punch string (Kawamura made string Kogyo, outer
      diameter 10mm unstained product) was 5cm collected and sealed tied
      wound five laps at one end lower end yarn.<br>
      Other end to the coconut shell activated carbon is injected into
      the core of the string is pouring (Nara carbon steel, grain type)
      3 g.<br>
      Then the injection port by winding 5 laps at the bottom thread is
      tied to seal to the electrode.<br>
      This is immersed to be disinfected and cooled for 10 minutes in
      boiling water.<br>
      This present inventors have 2-3 hours in the morning sandwiched
      between one person of front teeth and the lips of, 3-4 hours
      afternoon, it was life while wearing about two hours after dinner.<br>
      As a result tester of pain of chronic disease and had teeth that
      thirst is extinguished mouth in about 5 minutes after the
      electrode wear also lost even heartburn.<br>
      Maximum potential difference of electrode wear before in the mouth
      was 250mV.<br>
      Is the maximum potential difference between the teeth and gums to
      35mV, 5 hours at 30 minutes after wearing it was able to reduce up
      to 20mV.<br>
      Before electrode wear felt the pain in that you bite the apple,
      but in about 20 hours after the wear electrode was able to eat
      without pain.<br>
      <br>
      [0012]<br>
      Chewing gum (Lotte, Black Black gum) is coconut shell activated
      carbon 2g spraying was used in Example 1 on one side of the upper
      surface thereof, after warming the same chewing gum to other one
      the superimposed about 40 ? to and strongly compressed with a
      finger two of chewing gum is I was not allowed to peeling
      integrated.<br>
      Place the this chewing gum between the upper and lower teeth was
      discarded chewing about 30 minutes.<br>
      In the morning this behavior, afternoon and before going to bed, I
      went a total of three times.<br>
      Between the operation 7, the result of a different person was
      continued as in Example 1, the same effect as in Example 1 were
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0013]<br>
      Diameter 100mm, are prepared three the dish height 10mm, (1) 11
      micron thick aluminum foil on the bottom of a single petri dish
      (ion Corporation sold, for cooking), (2) and the other one petri
      dish The carbon paper (Onchi metal foil made, foil stamped paper)
      laid, I was allowed to stand for about 2 g fish (sea bream) bone
      in the state (3) and the other one dish that is not laid anything.<br>
      Was observed the state of the bone by adding pure water to about
      30cc thereon.<br>
      About 200mV between the bone and the aluminum, that a potential
      difference of about 150mV has occurred between the carbon paper I
      was observed.<br>
      Aluminum minus, carbon paper was positively charged.<br>
      The (1) and with water (3) was able to see that the macroscopic
      that dissolves bone colored pale yellow (2) Most dissolution of
      bone without observing the colored to the naked eye most was not
      happening.<br>
      From this result, bone electrical environment, I found that hard
      to melt the bone when the positive potential difference of degree
      to make a carbon material.<br>
      <br>
      [0014]<br>
      Analgesic acetylsalicylic acid have been taking (Bufferin,
      manufactured by Lion "strain"), but of tooth pain to reduce,
      eliminate the effect of complete pain was not obtained.<br>
      Could not also be biting an apple.<br>
      <br>

      The results I were obtained the same effect as in Example 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0019]<br>
      The present invention, the oral disease is intended to prevent in
      a manner that does not rely on agents, and is based on completely
      new concepts.<br>
      Its cost-effectiveness is large, I believe that to fix as a large
      industry in the future.<br>

      </div>
      <b> </b>&nbsp;<br>
      An apparatus and method for electrolytic etching of cast dental
      alloys and pre-existing amalgam restorations provides a DC source
      for etching of the selected metalwork and an AC source for removal
      of the oxide coating produced by the etching process. Metal
      framework so etched and cleaned facilitate resin bonding as in
      resin-bonded retainers for fixed bridgework, resin-bonded crowns,
      resin-bonded orthodontic brackets, resin-coated amalgam and cast
      restorations, resin-coated partial denture clasps, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Technical Field</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to dentistry and more specifically to
      apparatus and method for etching metal bridgework, orthodontic
      brackets amalgam restorations, and the like, preparatory to resin
      coating.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Background Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A significant and relatively recent development in aesthetic
      operative dentistry has been the acid-etched composite resin
      bonding technique. The most recently developed composite resins
      used with this technique have high levels of micro-filled ceramic
      particles with excellent characteristics of color stability and
      wear resistance. The technique of etching the enamel with 30% to
      50% phosphoric acid creates microscopic voids which the resin can
      invade instigating a micro-mechanical bond. This etching technique
      and subsequent micro-mechanical bond allows aesthetic materials to
      adhere to the enamel without the traditional deep preparations for
      retention. The etching technique is thus becoming increasingly
      popular.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, fixed bridgework, periodontal splints and
      post-orthodontic splints have been bonded to enamel with acid etch
      resin techniques. Earlier techniques involved creating mechanical
      retention by machining a series of funnel-like preparations in the
      framework. The resin could then invade the preparations and lock
      the framework to the acid-etched enamel. There has also been
      introduced a technique for etching metal castings by corrosion.
      This process creates microscopic voids in the metal which can be
      invaded by resin for a micromechanical bond much like the
      phosphoric acid-etched resin bond of enamel.
      Electrolytically-etched frameworks for resin bonding of fixed
      bridge retainers has also been suggested. Lingual retainers have
      also been electrolytically etched in nitric acid and cleaned in
      hydrochloric acid with ultrasonic vibration. Another known
      procedure involves electrolysis of the casting in a dilute
      sulfuric acid solution.<br>
      <br>
      The advantage of a microscopically-etched metal surface as well as
      an etched enamel surface is that the interdisposed bonding layer
      of resin is better protected without outside preparations. Also,
      the etched metal surface and enamel surface allow for a thinner
      and stronger resin layer. Most precious and non-precious metals
      can be etched by the electro-chemical process called
      electrostripping. Electrostripping is an electro-chemical process
      similar to electroplating. Electrodeposition occurs at the
      cathode, or negative lead, whereas electrostripping occurs at the
      anode, or the positive lead. If an object is to be
      electrostripped, i.e., etched, it must, therefore, be attached to
      the anode in the electrolytic solution. When an object is
      electrostripped, the surface texture of the object after the metal
      is oxidized depends greatly on the crystalline grain structure of
      the alloy. Although most dental alloys can be electrolytically
      stripped, some alloys leave better etched textures than others due
      to the different phases in the alloys crystalline grain structure.
      After electrostripping is complete, the etched surface is usually
      cleaned in hydrochloric acid with ultrasonic vibration and is
      washed and then stored in alcohol to protect the etched surface
      prior to completion of bonding.<br>
      <br>
      The quality and depth of the etch obtained by electrostripping
      depends on the applied amperage and voltage. Most etching
      rectifiers are designed to operate at about 0 to 25 volts DC and 0
      to 1000 milliamps DC. The length of time of current exposure also
      determines the depth and quality of the etch. Thus, it is possible
      not only to underetch but also to overetch the casting. In order
      to obtain a uniform etch, it is necessary to maintain the current
      level substantially constant and preferably within .±.5 to 10
      milliamps of the proper current setting. The ammeter is monitored
      and operating conditions are adjusted as required.<br>
      <br>
      Most electroplating units can be used to electrostrip an object.
      However, the half rectified wave form produced by conventional
      electroplating units while satisfactory for electroplating does
      not provide a uniform etch when the unit is used for
      electrostripping. A fully rectified and filtered wave form
      eliminates amperage fluctuation and provides a better unformity in
      electrolytic etching. Therefore, most electroplating units cannot
      be used for electrolytic etching of dental alloys. The most
      satisfactory electrolytic units incorporate a bridge diode and a
      filter circuit to provide a uniform amperage flow circuit.<br>
      <br>
      The conventional etching technique also has the disadvantage of
      requiring the alloy to be etched in the laboratory and all
      surfaces not etched to be covered with a sticky wax and including
      the electrode. The process is time consuming and requires sticky
      wax removal and cleanup. Furthermore, if modifications are made
      during try-in, the bridge must be necessarily sent back to the
      laboratory for re-etching prior to bonding. Also, this technique
      does not allow etching of alloys already fixed in the oral cavity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The apparatus and method of the present invention is designed to
      produce a cleaner and more uniform etch than is available with the
      previously-described conventional laboratory apparatus and
      methods. Of particular significance, the apparatus and method of
      the invention is adapted for use chairside without requiring that
      the metal be immersed in the laboratory beaker. The method of the
      invention is directed to etching an electrically conductive
      surface of a dental device preparatory to bonding a covering
      material to the surface which is etched. A DC voltage source is
      established with leads connected to the positive and negative
      terminals. The positive connected lead is attached to the
      electrically conductive dental device surface to be etched. The
      free end of the negative connected lead mounts means for retaining
      a dilute acid solution and etching is effected by intermittently
      touching portions of the surface being etched with the retainer
      means after which the etched surface is cleaned with an
      appropriate dilute acid. The etching and cleaning operation leaves
      an undesirable oxide coating. To remove such coating, the
      invention method also involves establishing a source of AC voltage
      and reconnecting the mentioned pair of leads to the AC source. The
      free end of one of the AC-connected leads is connected to the
      surface which has been etched. The free end of the other
      AC-connected lead mounts means for retaining a dilute acid and the
      etched surface is cleaned of oxide coating left over from the
      etching operation by intermittently touching the etched surface
      with the AC-connected lead having the dilute acid retainer means.
      The apparatus of the invention provides both the mentioned source
      of DC voltage as well as the mentioned source of AC voltage. The
      mentioned DC-connected and AC-connected leads may be one pair
      interchangeably connected to the DC and AC sources or separate
      pairs each connected to one of the sources. The method and
      apparatus of the invention thus allow the etching process to take
      place chairside without requiring the bridgework or other dental
      work being etched to be immersed in a laboratory beaker setup as
      in the prior art practice. Furthermore, the invention method and
      apparatus eliminate the need for coating the non-etched surfaces
      with sticky wax or the like.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 1 is a schematic drawing of an apparatus adapted to
        provide both a DC source as well as an AC source for
        implementing the etching and cleaning techniques of the
        invention with the leads being shown in solid lines connected to
        the DC source and in dashed lines to the alternative AC source.</b><b><br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Making reference to the drawings, the apparatus 10 of the
      invention is housed in a cabinet 12 having a top panel 14. Panel
      14 mounts a DC milliammeter 16 having a range of 0 to 1000
      milliamps; a DC voltmeter 18 having a range of 0 to 15 volts; an
      on-off switch 20 in series with a red indicator light 22 to
      indicate when the source of AC power, normally 115 volts AC,
      supplied by power line 25 is connected; a single-pole,
      double-throw switch 28 enabling a selection of an output
      transformer voltage of either 6 volts AC or 12 volts AC from the
      step down transformer 30 (FIG. 2); a double-pole, double-throw
      switch 35; and a control knob 40 for setting a variable resistor
      42 to control the DC output. Panel 14 also mounts a first pair of
      outlets 50 for receiving a suitable pair of leads 52, 54 having
      the respective positive clip connector 55 and negative clip
      connector 56 which are used in the manner later described.<br>
      <br>
      Making reference to FIG. 2, it will be noted that when the power
      supply cord 25 is suitably connected to a source of AC voltage,
      typically 115 to 120 volts AC, 60 cycles, the red indicator light
      22 is energized thus indicating to the operator that the apparatus
      is on. Switch 28 will normally be positioned initially in the 6
      volt AC position and the double-pole, double-throw switch 35 will
      be positioned to apply the 6 volt AC voltage to terminals 60, 62
      which applies the same voltage across the bridge network 64 which
      in conjunction with the filter capacitors 66, 68 produce a
      rectified, filtered DC voltage across terminals 70, 72 and across
      resistor 42. Thus, by adjustment of the control knob 40, a
      filtered and controlled, relatively-low DC voltage is made
      available at the outlet connectors 50, 51 with the current and
      voltage being measured by the respective milliammeter 16 and volt
      meter 18. When it is desired to increase the output DC voltage
      available at connectors 50, 51, switch 28 can be switched to the
      12 volt AC position to produce a comparable increase in voltage at
      the connectors 50, 51.<br>
      <br>
      With continuing reference to FIG. 2, it will also be noted that
      when the double-pole, double-throw switch 35 is moved to connect
      to terminals 74, 76 an AC voltage will be produced at connectors
      58, 59 with the AC voltage in this mode of operation, at
      connectors 58, 59 being either 6 volts AC or 12 volts AC dependent
      on the position of switch 28. From this description it will be see
      that when the leads 52, 54 are connected to the connectors 50, 51,
      a DC voltage is available on connectors 55, 56 whereas when leads
      52, 54 are connected to the respective connectors 58, 59, as
      indicated in dashed lines in FIG. 1, an AC voltage is available at
      the connectors 55, 56. Because of the brief exposure time and low
      AC voltage, the use of an AC ammeter and AC voltmeter has not been
      found necessary though may be employed. With this explanation, it
      is believed those skilled in the art will now fully appreciate the
      circuit aspects of the invention and the description next proceeds
      to operation of the invention apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      As schematically illustrated in FIG. 1, the positive connection is
      directly to the metal framework, generally represented by the
      numeral 80, by means of the small clip 55. The negative or cathode
      clip 56 is attached to a cotton tip applicator 82 of the type used
      in dental offices. Prior to attaching the cathode clip 56 to the
      cotton tip applicator 82, the cotton end of the applicator 82 is
      dipped and saturated in dilute nitric acid or dilute sulfuric
      acid, depending on the alloy to be etched. Dilute nitric acid (5N)
      works well on alloys containing copper or silver phases whereas
      dilute sulfuric acid (10%) works best for alloys containing
      chromium and nickel phases. Non-precious metals, such as Rexillium
      III, which contain around 67% nickel and 30% chromium, etch best
      in dilute sulfuric acid. A few very inactive metals including
      platinum and gold are best etched by a mixture of concentrated
      nitric and hydrochloric acid, commonly known as Aqua Regia.<br>
      <br>
      After the cotton tip of applicator 82 has been suitably saturated
      with the selected acid and clip 55 has been suitably secured to
      the metal framework 80, switch 20 is moved to the on position,
      switch 28 to the 6 volt AC position, switch 35 to the position for
      applying the 6 volt AC voltage to terminals 60, 62 and knob 40 is
      adjusted to provide 6 volts DC at connectors 50, 51. The
      cotton-tipped applicator 82 is then touched to the specific area
      of the metal framework 80 to be etched with the current being held
      within a range of 550-600 milliamps at 6 volts DC, with this
      operation taking place for approximately 2 minutes. This technique
      creates a miniature electrolytic bath at the cotton tip-metal
      framework interface. The direct current passes through the cathode
      into the cotton tip to the framework 80 and into the anode, i.e.,
      clip 55, to complete the circuit. The described operation enabling
      the bridge or other metal framework to be spot etched takes place
      chairside and thus eliminates the previous practice of immersing
      the bridgework or other metal framework in a complicated
      laboratory setup and also eliminates the need for the non-etched
      surfaces to be coated with a sticky wax.<br>
      <br>
      After the selected metal framework has been spot etched in all of
      the appropriate areas with direct current, the framework is washed
      with water and lightly dried and is then examined microscopically
      with loops for uniformity of the etch. If adequately etched, the
      dark oxide or slight metal membrane produced during the etching
      process is removed by changing the output applied to the
      respective clips 55, 56 from direct current to alternating
      current. Direct current tends to produce a deep, dark etch whereas
      alternating current on the other hand has been discovered to
      produce a white, superficial etch and has been found effective for
      cleaning the oxide off after the metal has been deep etched with
      direct current.<br>
      <br>
      Once the etching process has been completed, switch 20 is opened,
      the leads 52, 54 are disconnected from the DC connector outlets
      50, 51 and reconnected in the AC outlets 58, 59. Clip 55 is left
      attached to the metal framework 80. A clean cotton tip applicator
      82 is employed and is dipped and saturated in 10% hydrochloric
      acid. Switch 28 is set at the 6 volt AC position, switch 35 is
      switched to apply the 6 volt AC voltage to terminals 74, 76 which
      allows the 6 volt AC voltage to be provided at the AC connector
      receptacles 58, 59. Clip 56 is attached to the new cotton tip
      applicator 82, switch 20 is moved to the on position and the
      cotton tip of the new applicator 82 is applied over the dark
      etched surfaces for approximately 30 to 60 seconds. This procedure
      has been found to be effective to remove all of the dark oxide
      metal residue and to leave a clean, bright, white etched surface.
      When this cleaning process utilizing alternating current has been
      completed, switch 20 is opened, clips 55, 56 are removed and the
      metal work 80 is washed in water and alcohol and then dried. The
      bridge, splint, or other device, forming the framework 80 is now
      ready for bonding to the enamel with conventional composite
      bonding techniques.<br>
      <br>
      To increase retention of the dentin by short clinical crowns, the
      internal metal surfaces of the crown can be etched by placing the
      acid saturated cotton tip applicator inside the upside down crown
      with the anode clip, i.e, clip 55, being attached to the metal
      collar at the lingual of the crown. The spot etch technique just
      described can also be used to etch metal within the oral cavity
      for bonding to pre-existing amalgams, metal crowns or castings.
      Various applications include resin adhesion bonding of fixed
      bridgework to metal restorations, orthodontic bonding of brackets
      or splints to pr-existing metal restorations, repair of ceramic or
      acrylic bridgework in the mouth by acrylic coating of exposed
      metal, coating of pre-existing amalgam or cast restorations in the
      mouth for aesthetic reasons and resin coating of partial denture
      clasps for aesthetic reasons.<br>
      <br>
      To electrolytically etch amalgam or cast restorations in the
      mouth, special care must be taken. Although the applied voltage is
      low, i.e., six volts DC, if both electrodes are carelessly touched
      to wet soft tissue, a very slight electric shock may be felt.
      While the voltage is not high enough to cause any damage, it can
      be about as uncomfortable as an electric pulp tester set on medium
      strength. Of course, if the clips are applied as diagrammed in
      FIG. 1, the patient will feel no current since there will be no
      circuit traveling through the soft tissues. It is also desirable
      that the area being etched be carefully isolated with a rubber dam
      to keep the dilute acid off the surrounding tissues with an
      immediately water wash being desirable in the event of unexpected
      contact between the dilute acid and any surrounding tissue. Care
      must also be taken when etching in the mouth not to overheat the
      restoration and thereby thermally damage the pulp. Therefore, it
      is desirable to use a thermal probe with a digital-type thermal
      probe being desirable for this application. In general, the
      temperature should never exceed 140 DEG F. and if excess
      temperature is sensed, the circuit may be momentarily broken by
      simply removing the anode clip 55 to allow time for the heat to
      dissipate. Different alloys will be noted as having different
      heating characteristics due to the difference in their internal
      resistance to electric current.<br>

      An apparatus, suitable for forming a liquid in situ for the
      treatment of teeth for removal of caries and plaque, prevention of
      calculus and for brightening of teeth, comprises a reservoir means
      2 for a liquid mixture which will form the treating compound when
      subjected to electrolysis, a pump 6, e.g. a pulse generator with
      suitable drive, for supplying the liquid mixture to an
      electrolytic cell 8, flexible hose or tubing 10 and nozzle 14,
      which may be a hypodermic needle, for applying the treating liquid
      to the teeth. The stream of liquid is preferably a pulsating
      stream. The treating liquid is advantageously formed from an amino
      compound and a chloride, bromide or iodide of an alkali or
      alkaline earth metal.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to dental apparatus, and more
      particularly to apparatus for application of treating liquids to
      the teeth.<br>
      <br>
      It is known to apply to the teeth liquids which are useful in
      treating the teeth, e.g. for removal of caries and plaque, and
      prevention of calculus, and for brightening the teeth.<br>
      <br>
      A class of compounds which are useful for this purpose comprises
      N-haloamines containing a hydroxy group, a sulfonic group, an
      N-acetyl group, or a carboxylic acid group. Many of these
      N-halomines which are most useful for such purposes are relatively
      unstable, and must be prepared in sitte.<br>
      <br>
      It is the object of the present invention to provide apparatus for
      application of treating liquid to the teeth and which is adapted
      to permit the preparation of treating compounds immediately prior
      to use.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention apparatus, for forming a
      treating liquid in sifg and applying it to the teeth, comprises,
      in combination, reservoir means for a liquid mixture which will
      form the treating compound when subjected to electrolysis, an
      electrolytic cell having an inlet and an outlet, a pump
      communicating with said reservoir and with the inlet of said cell
      for passing liquid under pressure from said reservoir to said
      cell, means for initiating and stopping operation of said pump,
      piping of which at least part is flexible having one end
      communicating with the outlet of the electrolytic cell, and a
      nozzle communicating with the other end of said piping.<br>
      <br>
      For the formation of a suitable N-haloamine, a solution of an
      alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal halide may be decomposed
      electrolytically so as to provide free halogen which then reacts
      to form hypohalide in the presence of hydroxide ion. In order to
      form an N-halo derivative, the starting solution should also
      contain a suitable amino compound or compounds. The hypohalite
      reacts to form an N-halo derivative as soon as it is formed in the
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      The starting solution may contain one or more alkali metal or
      alkaline earth metal halides MX and/or M2X2, where M is Li, Na, K,
      Rb, Cs and M2 is Ca, Sr, Ba and X is Cl, Br, I. These solutions
      are electrolytically decomposed according to the following
      equations:<br>
      <br>
      Anode M++e+H2OMOH+ 1/2H2<br>
      Cathode X~il/2X2+e or<br>
      Anode M++ +2e+ 2H2OM2(OH2)+ H2<br>
      Cathode 2X-X2 +2e<br>
      The free halogen obtained immediately forms hypohalite.<br>
      <br>
      2M0H +X2MOX + MX +H20<br>
      M2(0H)2+X2XM2X(OX)+H20<br>
      2M2(0H), + 2X2M2(OX) + M2X + 2H20<br>
      These hypohalites can then reaction with a suitable amino
      compound(s) to give the N-halo derivatives(s).<br>
      <br>

      preferably 10.5 to 11.5, most preferably 11 to 11.5. Desirably the
      electrolysis is carried out to form a solution 0.004 to 0.016
      molar in N-haloamine and while not essential, it is preferable to
      have present excess unhalogenated amine, i.e. in an amount up to
      15 times the halogenated amine and preferably 6 to 8 times the
      N-halogenated amine on a molar basis.<br>

      Hypohalites MOX and/or M2X(OX) and/or M2(OX)D and/or N-halo
      derivatives specified above, can be generated in the stream of an
      aqueous solution, e.g. to be delivered as a liquid jet stream.<br>
      <br>
      The electrolysis step is carried out in a flow system upstream of
      means adapted to direct the stream of activated solution onto an
      affected area such as the teeth. By way of Example, the cell may
      be coupled to a dispenser nozzle, either at the nozzle itself or
      in a separate location and coupled to the nozzle through piping
      such las flexible hose.<br>
      <br>
      The stream of liquid may be at constant pressure, but preferably
      it is used as a pulsating stream so as to act on affected tooth
      material not only by abrasion caused by the stream flow, but also
      by erosion caused by mechanical fatiguing of the affected material
      by the pulsating jet.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will be understood best in connection with the
      drawing wherein the single figure is a diagrammatic illustration
      of an apparatus for carrying out the invention.<br>
      <br>
      Referring more specifically to the drawing there is provided a
      reservoir 2 for starting aqueous solution containing, for example,
      sodium chlorine and glycine (as well as hydroxide, e.g. NaOH to
      control the pH). The solution then goes vs a suction check valve 4
      to a pump 6, e.g., a pulse generator with a suitable drive. The
      solution then goes to an electrolytic cell 8 whenever needed. Flow
      of the solution is controlled by a foot switch 16 in the current
      supply to the pump. The hypohalite, e.g. sodium hypochorite is
      formed in situ in the cell 8 and immediately forms the Nhalo
      compound, e.g. N-chloro-glycine, the cell has an inlet 20 and an
      outlet 22. After leaving the outlet 22 the N-halomine formed goes
      via a flexible hose or tubing 10 to a hypodermic needle or other
      nozzle 14 which can be held by a handle 12 and the flow of
      solution directed to a patient's mouth.<br>
      <br>
      The starting solution advantageously contains (i) MX and MOH or
      M2(OH) and/or M2X2 and M2(OH)2 or MOH and (ii) a suitable water
      solution amino com pound, capable of forming an N-halo derivative
      by reacting with the hypohalite. Illustrative hydroxides are
      sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, barium
      hydroxide.<br>
      <br>
      The pump 6 may generate, for example, a steady pressure of 10 to
      200 psi, preferably 20-40 psi, or a pulsating flow in which the
      liquid pressure varies from 0 to between 10 psi and 200 psi
      inclusive, during each pulse. Pulse frequency may conveniently be
      from 100 to 1500 inclusive per minute, and preferably 40750 pulses
      a minute.<br>
      <br>
      The electrolytic cell must contain an anode, preferably of a
      graphite and cathode, preferably of stainless steel. The anode is
      connected to the plus pole and the cathode to the minus pole of an
      electric current source (not shown), for instance, a battery.<br>
      <br>
      Potential between the anode and cathode may conveniently be
      between 2.0 and 5.0 volts.<br>
      <br>
      A thermostatically controlled heating means is preferably
      employed, e.g., a low volume/high surface heater or a direct
      electric current heater, in the liquid flow circuit to allow
      maintenance of a temperature preferably between 35 and 45"C, and
      especially at body temperature 37"C in the solution projected from
      the nozzle.<br>
      <br>
      The flexible hose or pipe is preferably capable of free bending
      and able to with stand pressures up to 200 psi at a maximum
      temperature of, e.g., 4S"C. It could cay a nozzle of a gauge of,
      say, 19 to 30, and preferably 20 to 23. It is useful to have an
      exchangeable nozzle, such as a hypodermic needle. By way of
      example, in the preparation of a decayed tooth for filling, any of
      the solutions below may be delivered through the above-described
      apparatus, either as a steady jet or as a pulsating jet stream, to
      remove caries or plaque from teeth. Steady stream conditions are
      less efficient than pulsating conditions.<br>

        <b> </b><b>METHOD AND DEVICE FOR TREATING DENTAL OR
          OSTEOARTICULAR SURFACES</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      A method for treating dental or osteoarticular surfaces, involves
      applying to said surfaces, by means of two electrodes, an electric
      field located in an electrolytic medium on a solid or gelled
      support. A device for implementing the method is also provided.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      "Treatment method for tooth surfaces or osteo've ± iculaires,
      devices for its implementation."<br>
      The present invention relates to a method for treating tooth
      surfaces or osteo-articulaires.<br>
      It is also capable of causing the disappearance of discolored
      tooth.<br>
      A tooth surface treatment processes include, firstly cleaning
      techniques, scaling and bleaching, the other of the surface
      preparation techniques] enamel, dentin and cementum to e.g.
      bonding bio-materials such as adhesives type materials
      dentin-enamel and composite resins.<br>
      In periodontal surgery, to favor a "reattachment" collagen fibers
      on a cementum surface, one must remove the surface of any residual
      tissue and necrotic cells.<br>
      In the field of surface preparation techniques of the enamel and
      dentin for bonding bio-materials, changes in dentistry over the
      past twenty years has re- duce the use of size cavities with
      rotary instruments before placing metal restorations: inlay or
      silver amalgam.<br>
      Dentistry limited to the eviction of pathological tissues,
      preparation of tissues by gluing products and the introduction of
      composite resins has gradually imposed.<br>
      At one stage of the bonding, the enamel is currently treated with
      orthophosphoric acid at 37% presented in the form of a colored gel
      or acid solutions.<br>
      The resulting acid etchants and acid balances the same need to be
      systematically removed.<br>
      This is usually done using a water jet.<br>
      However, these methods are uncertain and uncontrolled and have
      failed so far to obtain statements of suitable surfaces root
      planing.<br>
      Similar problems also arise in the field of collages in bone and
      joint surfaces.<br>
      Extrinsic staining of the teeth are usually due to the deposition
      of secondary mineralized plaque.<br>
      Chromogenic bacteria are the cause of discoloration associated or
      not with for- mation of tartar, the latter being colored by the
      tobacco tar, caffeine, etc.<br>
      The tooth cleaning processes are designed to remove these stains
      and deposits by methods either mechanical or chemical.<br>
      In recent years, new tooth whitening techniques have come onto the
      market, which carry first alteration, either of the organic
      matrix, or the mineral structure and the diffusion through the
      enamel of hydrogen peroxide, which acts on intrinsic pigments of
      the tooth.<br>
      All existing methods assume the pose of a complex surgical field
      to avoid chemical burns of the mucosa.<br>
      It would therefore be desirable to have techniques for local
      applications, limited in space and does not require lengthy
      maneuvers (and random) isolation when they are implemented
      remotely necks of the teeth.<br>
      The present invention aims to propose a method of treatment of
      dental surfaces and osteoarticular that overcomes the drawbacks of
      the techniques of the prior art.<br>
      The invention thus provides a method for treating tooth surfaces
      and bone articulai- res, characterized in that there is applied to
      the surface to be treated, by means of two electrodes, a localized
      electric field, in an electrolytic medium solid or gelled medium.<br>
      According to a first embodiment, the solid support is in the form
      of a buffer consisting advantageously of a material selected from
      cotton, fiber or paper impregnated.<br>
      According to a second embodiment, the support and the electrolytic
      medium form a gel chosen advantageously among agar, a polysila-
      not, pectin and a polyester.<br>
      The conductivity in the electrolytic medium that can be provided
      by a neutral salt, preferably selected from KN03, NaCl and KC1 in
      an aqueous medium when the operating time is greater than about 2
      minutes.<br>
      It is ensured more advantageously by a basic salt, dilute aqueous
      solution of alkali hydroxide, preferably selected from KOH, NaOH
      and LiOH or a weak acid when the duration of intervention must be
      less than 2 minutes, or when the is desired a more powerful action
      on the surface.<br>
      Advantageously, the electric field is radial.<br>
      Preferably is applied between the two electrodes a voltage of
      between 2 and 5 V and an intensity comprised between 5 and 100 mA.<br>
      The inventive method of treatment of dental surfaces or
      osteoarticular is advantageously used for cleaning dental or bone
      surfaces.<br>
      It provides micro-reliefs preparing tooth surfaces for bonding
      biomaterials and bone and joint surfaces for bonding biomaterials
      in bone and joint treatments.<br>

      the tapered end 13 of the syringe 3 and comes into contact with
      the loop formed by a second electrode 6 arranged as above to the
      outside of the syringe 3 and wound on the end thereof opposite the
      piston.<br>
      The device shown in the embodiment of Figure 2 operates in the
      same manner as described above.<br>
      Tests were conducted on samples of human teeth.<br>
      Appraised results in a scanning electron microscope show that the
      electric current used by these methods have a specific action on
      the tooth surfaces, whether it be enamel, dentine or cementum.<br>
      This action modulated through flexible electrical parameters can
      be used in vivo for cleaning, superficial or deep laundering and
      microreliefs achievement to prepare surfaces for bonding dental
      biomaterials by formation on an area being smaller than the
      diameter of the smaller electrode, or about 1 to 3 millimeters,
      micro-reliefs in the form of micro-wells of micron or sub-micron
      diameter, the assigned depth can be controlled by adjusting the
      parameters of electrochemical treatment.<br>
      Compared with current techniques of cleaning dental surfaces by
      thermo-chemical route, the benefits of the invention are periods
      of intervention shorter, an absence of problems of dripping or
      confinement by banks through the use of gels or porous or fibrous
      materials instead of liquids, a job in a work area well eir-
      conscripted may be very small, and. great, job security through
      currents and low electrical potentials.<br>
      Compared to known methods mechanically or chemical surface
      preparation for bonding acid bio-materials, the invention allows
      easier control by adjusting the working parameters.<br>
      It provides micro-reliefs on the tooth surface quite conducive to
      bonding biomaterials, and suggests the prospects for therapeutic
      collages in elderly patients with caries collar.<br>
      Tests conducted on the compact and spongy bone have shown that the
      invention allowed the process to eliminate the materials located
      between the lamellae of Haversian systems.<br>
      On the cancellous bone, the method of the invention allows to
      eliminate the residues endostées cavities and create
      micro-features on the spans.<br>
      Prospects in the field of collages in the musculoskeletal
      therapeutic are therefore also possible.<br>
