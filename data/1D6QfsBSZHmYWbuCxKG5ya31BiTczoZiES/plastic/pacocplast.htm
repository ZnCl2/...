            All The Plastics In The Oceans</b><br>
        </big><br>

      <br>
      19-year-old Boyan Slat has unveiled plans to create an Ocean
      Cleanup Array that could remove 7,250,000 tons of plastic waste
      from the world’s oceans. The device consists of an anchored
      network of floating booms and processing platforms that could be
      dispatched to garbage patches around the world.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of moving through the ocean, the array would span the
      radius of a garbage patch, acting as a giant funnel. The angle of
      the booms would force plastic in the direction of the platforms,
      where it would be separated from plankton, filtered and stored for
      recycling.<br>
      <br>
      At school, Boyan Slat launched a project that analyzed the size
      and amount of plastic particles in the ocean’s garbage patches.
      His final paper went on to win several prizes, including Best
      Technical Design 2012 at the Delft University of Technology. Boyan
      continued to develop his concept during the summer of 2012, and he
      revealed it several months later at TEDxDelft 2012.<br>
      <br>
      Slat went on to found The Ocean Cleanup Foundation, a non-profit
      organization which is responsible for the development of his
      proposed technologies. His ingenious solution could potentially
      save hundreds of thousands of aquatic animals annually, and reduce
      pollutants (including PCB and DDT) from building up in the food
      chain. It could also save millions per year, both in clean-up
      costs, lost tourism and damage to marine vessels.<br>
      <br>
      It is estimated that the clean-up process would take about five
      years, and it could greatly increase awareness about the world’s
      plastic garbage patches. On his site Slat says, “One of the
      problems with preventive work is that there isn’t any imagery of
      these ‘garbage patches’, because the debris is dispersed over
      millions of square kilometres. By placing our arrays however, it
      will accumulate along the booms, making it suddenly possible to
      actually visualize the oceanic garbage patches. We need to stress
      the importance of recycling, and reducing our consumption of
      plastic packaging.” <br>

      But really, seriously, Folks : Fishing Trawlers can be refitted to

      plastic can be processed into oil on site aboard a fleet of
      freighters ( There are fleets of mothball freighters sitting @

      Problem: The plastic is not static, it moves around.<br>
      <br>
      Solution: Why move through the oceans, if the oceans can move
      through you?<br>
      <br>
      Fix the sea water processors to the sea bed, and save vast amounts
      of funds, manpower and emissions.<br>
      <br>
      Problem:Oceanic 'Garbage Patches' are huge, and cleaning them up
      would result in huge amounts of by-catches.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore there is a huge variety in debris sizes.<br>
      <br>
      Solution: By using floating booms instead of nets, much larger
      areas will covered.<br>
      <br>
      No mesh means that even the smallest particles will be diverted
      and extracted. No mesh - together with its low speed - will result
      to virtually no by-catch.<br>
      <br>
      Although this hypothesis still has to be tested, even the
      planktonic species - due to their density being close to that of
      the sea water - may move under the booms along with the water
      flow.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Problems: A clean-up operation would generate significant
      emissions. Besides that, in high seas much plastic would escape.<br>
      <br>
      Solution: The platforms will be completely self-supportive,
      receiving their energy from e.g. the sun, currents and waves.<br>
      And by letting the platforms' wings sway like an actual manta ray,
      we can ensure contacts of the inlets with the surface, even in the
      roughest weather.<br>
      <br>
      Problem: Conventional clean-up ideas have never been financially
      realistic, let alone remediation of millions of square kilometres.<br>
      <br>
      Solution: This concept is so efficient, that we estimate that by
      selling the plastic retrieved from the 5 gyres, we would make in
      fact more money than the plan would cost to execute. In other
      words; it may potentially be profitable.<br>

      <b>PLEASE READ THIS FIRST</b><br>
      <br>
      The last couple of days several (spontaneous) articles have been
      published, claiming The Ocean Cleanup Array is a 'feasible method'
      of extracting plastic from the gyres.<br>
      <br>
      This is an incorrect statement; we are currently only at about
      1/4th of completing our feasibility study. Only after finishing
      that study, we believe such statements should be made. Although
      the preliminary results look promising, and our team of about 50
      engineers, modellers, external experts and students is making good
      progress, we had and have no intention of presenting a concept as
      a feasible solution while still being in investigative phase.<br>
      <br>
      Please stay tuned for this study, which will be published online
      in several months' time.<br>
      <br>
      We kindly request the press to refrain from any further
      publication, until all assumptions of this concept have been
      confirmed.<br>

      <br>
      The Ocean Cleanup Array project would then sell the retrieved

      the ire of some biologists who fear for sea life that may become
      entangled during the plastic recovery process.<br>

      from Delft University of Technology. <br>
      <br>
      Sometimes it takes big ideas to solve big problems.<br>
      <br>
      A 19-year-old Dutch aerospace engineering student has come up with
      what he believes is a way to remove millions of pounds of plastic
      trash from the world’s oceans.<br>
      <br>
      Dubbed the Ocean Cleanup Array, Boyan Slat’s concept involves
      anchoring 24 sifters to the ocean floor and letting the sea’s own
      currents direct the plastic bits into miles of booms, or connected
      chains of timbers used to catch floating objects.<br>
      <br>
      What started out as a college paper earned Slat the Best Technical
      Design award from Delft University of Technology.<br>
      <br>
      Slat, demonstrating his concept, wants to anchor 24 sifters to the
      ocean floor and let the sea’s own currents direct the plastic bits
      into miles of booms, or connected chains of timbers used to catch
      floating objects.<br>
      <br>
      From the start, Slat said he was motivated to get to work by the
      very scope of the problem facing the world.<br>
      <br>
      “It will be very hard to convince everyone in the world to handle
      their plastics responsibly, but what we humans are very good in,
      is inventing technical solutions to our problems,” Slat said on
      his website. “And that’s what we’re doing.”<br>
      <br>
      Powered by the sun and ocean currents, the Ocean Cleanup Array
      network aims to have as little impact on sea life as possible
      while sifting out some 7.25 million tons of plastic over the
      course of just five years.<br>
      <br>
      The bulk of the ray-shaped sifters and booms would be set up at
      the edges of the five swirling ocean gyres to trap the most
      plastic particles possible.<br>
      <br>
      Slat, who presented his idea to an audience at the TED lecture
      series in October, believes the recovered plastic could more than
      pay for the cleaning process. <br>

      Slat, who presented his idea to an audience at the TED lecture
      series in October, believes the recovered plastic could more than
      pay for the cleaning process. <br>
      <br>
      Able to function in high seas and rough weather, the booms would
      trap floating plastic bits, then suck them into a trash sifter.
      Once the plastic is retrieved, Slat envisions, it will be brought
      ashore and sold.<br>
      <br>
      “This concept is so efficient, that we estimate that by selling
      the plastic retrieved from the 5 gyres, we would make in fact more
      money than the plan would cost to execute. In other words; it's
      profitable,” Slat’s website states.<br>
      <br>
      The plan is not without its critics, however.<br>
      <br>
      “Ships on fixed moorings and thousands of miles of booms (because
      the scale of this is also improbable) have the potential to create
      a lot more marine debris, and seem particularly hazardous to
      entanglement-prone marine life.” Biologist Miriam Goldstein wrote
      on the University of Washington’s “Marine Debris Listserv”<br>
      <br>
      Goldstein also raised questions about whether plankton, or small
      and microscopic life, would be killed by the sifting process.<br>
      <br>
      For Slat, however, it’s full speed ahead. The wunderkind founded
      The Ocean Cleanup Foundation earlier this year and is looking to
      partner with plankton biologists, engineers, and, of course,
      philanthropists to turn his dream into a reality.<br>

      <i>Map showing the oceans' five major gyres</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The Garbage Patch is located within the North Pacific Gyre, one of
      the five major oceanic gyres.<br>
      <br>
      The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, also described as the Pacific
      Trash Vortex, is a gyre of marine debris in the central North
      Pacific Ocean located roughly between 135°W to 155°W and 35°N and
      42°N.[1] The patch extends over an indeterminate area, with
      estimates ranging very widely depending on the degree of plastic
      concentration used to define the affected area.<br>
      <br>
      The Patch is characterized by exceptionally high concentrations of
      pelagic plastics, chemical sludge and other debris that have been
      trapped by the currents of the North Pacific Gyre.[2] Despite its
      size and density, the patch is not visible from satellite
      photography, since it consists primarily of suspended particulates
      in the upper water column. Since plastics break down to even
      smaller polymers, concentrations of submerged particles are not
      visible from space, nor do they appear as a continuous debris
      field. Instead, the patch is defined as an area in which the mass
      of plastic debris in the upper water column is significantly
      higher than average.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Discovery</b><br>
      <br>
      Map showing large-scale looping water movements within the
      Pacific. One circles west to Australia, then south and back to
      Latin America. Further north, water moves east to Central America,
      and then joins a larger movement further north, which loops south,
      west, north, and east between North America and Japan. Two smaller
      loops circle in the eastern and central North Pacific.<br>
      <br>
      The Patch is created in the gyre of the North Pacific Subtropical
      Convergence Zone<br>
      <br>
      The Great Pacific Garbage Patch was predicted in a 1988 paper
      published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
      (NOAA) of the United States. The prediction was based on results
      obtained by several Alaska-based researchers between 1985 and 1988
      that measured neustonic plastic in the North Pacific Ocean.[3]
      This research found high concentrations of marine debris
      accumulating in regions governed by ocean currents. Extrapolating
      from findings in the Sea of Japan, the researchers hypothesized
      that similar conditions would occur in other parts of the Pacific
      where prevailing currents were favorable to the creation of
      relatively stable waters. They specifically indicated the North
      Pacific Gyre.[4]<br>
      <br>
      Charles J. Moore, returning home through the North Pacific Gyre
      after competing in the Transpac sailing race in 1997, came upon an
      enormous stretch of floating debris. Moore alerted the
      oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer, who subsequently dubbed the
      region the "Eastern Garbage Patch" (EGP).[5] The area is
      frequently featured in media reports as an exceptional example of
      marine pollution.[6]<br>
      <br>
      The patch is not easily visible because it consists of very small
      pieces, almost invisible to the naked eye,[7] most of its contents
      are suspended beneath the surface of the ocean,[8] and the
      relatively low density of the plastic debris at, in one scientific
      study, 5.1 kilograms of plastic per square kilometer of ocean
      area.[9]<br>
      <br>
      A similar patch of floating plastic debris is found in the
      Atlantic Ocean. See: North Atlantic Garbage Patch.[10][11]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Formation</b><i><br>
      </i><br>
      It is thought that, like other areas of concentrated marine debris
      in the world's oceans, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch formed
      gradually as a result of marine pollution gathered by oceanic
      currents.[12] The garbage patch occupies a large and relatively
      stationary region of the North Pacific Ocean bound by the North
      Pacific Gyre (a remote area commonly referred to as the horse
      latitudes). The gyre's rotational pattern draws in waste material
      from across the North Pacific Ocean, including coastal waters off
      North America and Japan. As material is captured in the currents,
      wind-driven surface currents gradually move floating debris toward
      the center, trapping it in the region.<br>
      <br>
      There are no strong scientific data concerning the origins of
      pelagic plastics. The figure that an estimated 80% of the garbage
      comes from land-based sources and 20% from ships is derived from
      an unsubstantiated estimate.[13] Ship-generated pollution is a
      source of concern, since a typical 3,000-passenger cruise ship
      produces over eight tons of solid waste weekly, a major amount of
      which ends up in the patch, as most of the waste is organic.[14]
      Pollutants range in size from abandoned fishing nets to
      micro-pellets used in abrasive cleaners.[15] Currents carry debris
      from the west coast of North America to the gyre in about six
      years,[16] and debris from the east coast of Asia in a year or
      less.[17][18] An international research project led by Dr.
      Hideshige Takada of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology
      studying plastic pellets, or nurdles, from beaches around the
      world may provide further clues about the origins of pelagic
      plastic.[19]<br>

      Logically, the land-based sources of pollutants and plastics come
      from the great rivers from around the world. The Ganges, in India,
      is an example of a source of major sea pollution (see Pollution of
      the Ganges). The major rivers of Bangladesh, Nigeria, and other
      developing nations collectively provide another example of
      marine-pollution sources. It has been noted that the levels of
      pollution in and around these rivers constitute a major health
      hazard to people living and doing business around the water.<br>
      <b><br>
        Estimates of size</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The size of the patch is unknown, as large items readily visible
      from a boat deck are uncommon. Most debris consists of small
      plastic particles suspended at or just below the surface, making
      it impossible to detect by aircraft or satellite. Instead, the
      size of the patch is determined by sampling. Estimates of size
      range from 700,000 square kilometres (270,000 sq mi) to more than
      15,000,000 square kilometres (5,800,000 sq mi) (0.41% to 8.1% of
      the size of the Pacific Ocean), or, in some media reports, up to
      "twice the size of the continental United States".[20] Such
      estimates, however, are conjectural based on the complexities of
      sampling and the need to assess findings against other areas.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Net-based surveys are less subjective than
      direct observations but are limited regarding the area that can be
      sampled (net apertures 1–2 m and ships typically have to slow down
      to deploy nets, requiring dedicated ship's time). The plastic
      debris sampled is determined by net mesh size, with similar mesh
      sizes required to make meaningful comparisons among studies.
      Floating debris typically is sampled with a neuston or manta trawl
      net lined with 0.33 mm mesh. Given the very high level of spatial
      clumping in marine litter, large numbers of net tows are required
      to adequately characterize the average abundance of litter at sea.
      Long-term changes in plastic meso-litter have been reported using
      surface net tows: in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre in 1999,
      plastic abundance was 335 000 items/km2 and 5.1 kg/km2, roughly an
      order of magnitude greater than samples collected in the 1980s.
      Similar dramatic increases in plastic debris have been reported
      off Japan. However, caution is needed in interpreting such
      findings, because of the problems of extreme spatial
      heterogeneity, and the need to compare samples from equivalent
      water masses, which is to say that, if an examination of the same
      parcel of water a week apart is conducted, an order of magnitude
      change in plastic concentration could be observed.[21]<br>
      <br>
      Further, although the size of the patch is determined by a
      higher-than-normal degree of concentration of pelagic debris,
      there is no specific standard for determining the boundary between
      the "normal" and "elevated" levels of pollutants to provide a firm
      estimate of the affected area.<br>
      <br>
      In August 2009, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography/Project
      Kaisei SEAPLEX survey mission of the Gyre found that plastic
      debris was present in 100 consecutive samples taken at varying
      depths and net sizes along a 1,700 miles (2,700 km) path through
      the patch. The survey also confirmed that, while the debris field
      does contain large pieces, it is on the whole made up of smaller
      items that increase in concentration toward the Gyre's centre, and
      these 'confetti-like' pieces are clearly visible just beneath the
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      Charles Moore has estimated the mass of the Great Pacific Garbage
      Patch at 100 million tons,[22] which would be several tons per km2
      .<br>
      <br>
      Although many media and advocacy reports have suggested that the
      patch extends over an area larger than the continental U.S.,
      recent research sponsored by the National Science Foundation
      suggests the affected area may be twice the size of
      Hawaii,[23][24] while a recent study concluded that the patch
      might be smaller.[25] This can be attributed to the fact that
      there is no specific standard for determining the boundary between
      the "normal" and "elevated" levels of pollutants and what
      constitutes being part of the patch. The size is determined by a
      higher-than-normal degree of concentration of pelagic debris in
      the water. Recent data collected from Pacific albatross
      populations suggest there may be two distinct zones of
      concentrated debris in the Pacific.[26]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Photodegradation of plastics</b><br>
      <br>
      The Great Pacific Garbage Patch has one of the highest levels
      known of plastic particulate suspended in the upper water column.
      As a result, it is one of several oceanic regions where
      researchers have studied the effects and impact of plastic
      photodegradation in the neustonic layer of water.[27] Unlike
      organic debris, which biodegrades, the photodegraded plastic
      disintegrates into ever smaller pieces while remaining a polymer.
      This process continues down to the molecular level.[28]<br>
      <br>
      As the plastic flotsam photodegrades into smaller and smaller
      pieces, it concentrates in the upper water column. As it
      disintegrates, the plastic ultimately becomes small enough to be
      ingested by aquatic organisms that reside near the ocean's
      surface. In this way, plastic may become concentrated in neuston,
      thereby entering the food chain.<br>
      <br>
      Some plastics decompose within a year of entering the water,
      leaching potentially toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A, PCBs,
      and derivatives of polystyrene.[29]<br>
      <br>
      The process of disintegration means that the plastic particulate
      in much of the affected region is too small to be seen. In a 2001
      study, researchers (including Charles Moore) found concentrations
      of plastic particles at 334,721 pieces per km2 with a mean mass of
      5,114 grams (11.27 lbs) per km2, in the neuston. Assuming each
      particle of plastic averaged 5 mm x 5 mm x 1 mm, this would amount
      to only 8 m2 per km2 due to small particulates. Nonetheless, this
      represents a very high amount with respect to the overall ecology
      of the neuston. In many of the sampled areas, the overall
      concentration of plastics was seven times greater than the
      concentration of zooplankton. Samples collected at deeper points
      in the water column found much lower concentrations of plastic
      particles (primarily monofilament fishing line pieces).[9]
      Nevertheless, according to the mentioned estimates, only a very
      small part of the plastic would be near the surface.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Effect on wildlife</b><br>
      <br>
      Some of these long-lasting plastics end up in the stomachs of
      marine birds and animals, and their young,[5] including sea
      turtles and the Black-footed Albatross. Midway Atoll receives
      substantial amounts of marine debris from the Great Pacific
      Garbage Patch. Of the 1.5 million Laysan Albatrosses that inhabit
      Midway, nearly all are found to have plastic in their digestive
      system.[30] Of the approximately one-third of the chicks that die,
      many of them are due to being fed plastic from their
      parents.[31][32]<br>
      <br>
      Besides the particles' danger to wildlife, on the microscopic
      level the floating debris can adsorb organic pollutants from
      seawater, including PCBs, DDT, and PAHs.[33] Aside from toxic
      effects,[34] when ingested, some of these are mistaken by the
      endocrine system as estradiol, causing hormone disruption in the
      affected animal.[32] These toxin-containing plastic pieces are
      also eaten by jellyfish, which are then eaten by larger fish.<br>
      <br>
      Many of these fish are then consumed by humans, resulting in their
      ingestion of toxic chemicals.[35] Marine plastics also facilitate
      the spread of invasive species that attach to floating plastic in
      one region and drift long distances to colonize other
      ecosystems.[15][dead link]<br>
      <br>
      On the macroscopic level, the physical size of the plastic kills
      birds and turtles as the animals' digestion can not break down the
      plastic inside their stomachs. A second effect of the macroscopic
      plastic is to make it much more difficult for animals to see and
      detect their normal sources of food.<br>
      <br>
      Research has shown that this plastic marine debris affects at
      least 267 species worldwide and a few of the 267 species reside in
      the North Pacific Gyre.[36]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Research of cleanup</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In April 2008, Richard Sundance Owen, a building contractor and
      scuba dive instructor, formed the Environmental Cleanup Coalition
      (ECC) to address the issue of North Pacific pollution. ECC
      collaborates with other groups to identify methods to safely
      remove plastic and persistent organic pollutants from the
      oceans.[37][38]<br>
      <br>
      The JUNK raft project was a trans-Pacific sailing voyage from June
      to August 2008 made to highlight the plastic in the patch,
      organized by the Algalita Marine Research Foundation.[39][40][41]<br>
      <br>
      Project Kaisei is a project to study and clean up the garbage
      patch launched in March 2009. In August 2009, two project vessels,
      the New Horizon and the Kaisei, embarked on a voyage to research
      the patch and determine the feasibility of commercial scale
      collection and recycling.[42]<br>
      <br>
      The SEAPLEX expedition, a group of researchers from Scripps
      Institution of Oceanography, spent 19 days on the ocean in August,
      2009 researching the patch. Their primary goal was to describe the
      abundance and distribution of plastic in the gyre in the most
      rigorous study to date. Researchers were also looking at the
      impact of plastic on mesopelagic fish, such as
      lanternfish.[43][44][45] This group utilized a fully capable
      dedicated oceanographic research vessel, the 170 ft (52 m) long
      New Horizon .[46]<br>

      <br>
      Plastic pollution in the form of small particles (diameter less
      than 5 mm) — termed ‘microplastic’ — has been observed in many
      parts of the world ocean. They are known to interact with biota on
      the individual level, e.g. through ingestion, but their
      population-level impacts are largely unknown. One potential
      mechanism for microplastic-induced alteration of pelagic
      ecosystems is through the introduction of hard-substrate habitat
      to ecosystems where it is naturally rare. Here, we show that
      microplastic concentrations in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre
      (NPSG) have increased by two orders of magnitude in the past four
      decades, and that this increase has released the pelagic insect
      Halobates sericeus from substrate limitation for oviposition. High
      concentrations of microplastic in the NPSG resulted in a positive
      correlation between H. sericeus and microplastic, and an overall
      increase in H. sericeus egg densities. Predation on H. sericeus
      eggs and recent hatchlings may facilitate the transfer of energy
      between pelagic- and substrate-associated assemblages. The
      dynamics of hard-substrate-associated organisms may be important
      to understanding the ecological impacts of oceanic microplastic
      pollution.[47]<br>
      <br>
      The Goldstein et al. study compared changes in small plastic
      abundance between 1972-1987 and 1999-2010 by using historical
      samples from the Scripps Pelagic Invertebrate Collection and data
      from SEAPLEX, a NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer cruise in 2010,
      information from the Algalita Marine Research Foundation as well
      as various published papers. [48]<br>

      At TEDxDelft2012,[49][50] Dutch Aerospace Engineering student
      Boyan Slat unveiled a concept for removing large amounts of marine
      debris from the five oceanic gyres. With his concept called The
      Ocean Cleanup, he proposes a radical clean-up that would use the
      surface currents to let the debris drift to specially designed
      arms and collection platforms. This way the running costs would be
      virtually zero, and would the operation be so efficient that it
      may even be profitable. The concept makes use of floating booms,
      that won’t catch the debris, but divert it. This way by-catch
      would be avoided, and even the smallest particles would be
      extracted. According to Boyan Slat's calculations, a gyre could
      realistically be cleaned up in five years' time, collecting at
      least 7.25 million tons of plastic combining all gyres.[51] He
      however does note that an ocean-based cleanup is only half the
      story, and will therefore have to be paired with 'radical plastic
      pollution prevention methods in order to succeed'.[51][52]<br>

      Method, a producer of household products, took the garbage patch
      as an opportunity and began marketing a dish soap whose container
      is made partly of recycled ocean plastic. The company sent crews
      to Hawaiian beaches to recover some of the debris that had washed
      up. [53]<br>

      by severe weather on Leg 2, met the goals and objectives it set
      out to achieve.<br>
      <br>
      Beginning in the Marshall Islands on May 1, Leg 1 investigated the
      little studied Western Pacific Garbage Patch, arriving in Tokyo
      three weeks later. During their scheduled layover and crew change,
      an International Scientific Symposium was held with Captain
      Charles Moore as one of the speakers.<br>
      <br>
      Marcus Eriksen led the expedition, collecting samples for the 5
      Gyres Institute, Algalita Marine Research Foundation and several
      other colleagues, including NOAA, SCRIPPS, IPRC and Woods Hole
      Oceanographic Institute. Hank Carson. was aboard to study colonial
      communities fouling marine debris, as well as collect samples of
      plastic pollution for his students and colleagues at University of
      Hawaii at Hilo. Filmmakers Alex and Tyler Mifflin were aboard to
      document the journey for a series titled “The Water Brothers”, in
      which they explore water issues around the world. Belinda

      From October 4 to November 9, 2012, the Sea Education Association

      The amount of plastic trash in the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch"
      has increased 100-fold during the past 40 years, causing
      "profound" changes to the marine environment, according to a new
      study.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego
      found that insects called "sea skaters" or "water striders" were
      using the trash as a place to lay their eggs in greater numbers
      than before.<br>
      <br>
      In a paper published by the journal Biology Letters, researchers
      said this would have implications for other animals, the sea
      skaters' predators -- which include crabs --&nbsp; and their food,
      which is mainly plankton and fish eggs.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists also pointed to a previous Scripps study that found
      nine percent of fish had plastic waste in their stomachs.<br>
      <br>
      The "Great Pacific Garbage Patch" -- which is roughly the size of
      Texas -- was created by plastic waste that finds its way into the
      sea and is then swept into one area, the North Pacific Subtropical
      Convergence Zone, by circulating ocean currents known as a gyre.<br>
      <br>

      The Scripps Environmental Accumulation of Plastic Expedition,
      known as SEAPLEX, traveled about 1,000 miles west of California in
      August 2009.<br>
      <br>
      A statement on Scripps' website said the scientists had
      "documented an alarming amount of human-generated trash, mostly
      broken down bits of plastic the size of a fingernail floating
      across thousands of miles of open ocean."<br>
      <br>
      Scripps graduate student Miriam Goldstein, SEAPLEX’s chief
      scientist, said that plastic had arrived in the ocean in such
      numbers in a "relatively short" period.<br>
      <br>
      Dec. 29, 2007: NBC's Kerry Sanders reports on a huge mass of
      garbage floating in the Pacific Ocean that is killing marine life
      and growing larger each day.<br>
      <br>
      "Plastic only became widespread in late '40s and early '50s, but
      now everyone uses it and over a 40-year range we've seen a
      dramatic increase in ocean plastic," she said. "Historically we
      have not been very good at stopping plastic from getting into the
      ocean so hopefully in the future we can do better." <br>
      <br>
      Researchers found fish larvae growing on pieces of plastic, such
      as the one above.<br>
      <br>
      Sea skaters -- relatives of pond water skaters -- normally lay
      their eggs on flotsam such as seashells, seabird feathers, tar
      lumps and pumice. The sharp rise in plastic waste had led to an
      increase in egg densities in the gyre area, the study found.<br>
      <br>
      "We're seeing changes in this marine insect that can be directly
      attributed to the plastic," Goldstein said in a statement.<br>
      <br>
      She told BBC News that the addition of "hundreds of millions of
      hard surfaces" to the Pacific was "quite a profound change."<br>
      <br>
      Samples taken by the scientists showed how marine life, such as
      small velella pictured above, lives alongside pieces of plastic.<br>
      <br>
      "In the North Pacific, for example, there's no floating seaweed
      like there is in the Sargasso Sea in the North Atlantic. And we
      know that the animals, the plants and the microbes that live on
      hard surfaces are different to the ones that live floating around
      in the water," she added.<br>
      <br>
      A garbage patch has also been found in the Atlantic Ocean, lying a
      few hundreds miles off the North American coast from Cuba to
      Virginia.<br>
      <br>
      Oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer, who said he coined the phrase the
      "Great Pacific Garbage Patch," told msnbc.com by phone that the
      only solution was to switch to using biodegradable plastic and let
      the plastic gradually disperse.<br>
      <br>
      "We can't clean it up. It's just too big. You'd have to have the
      entire U.S. Navy out there, round the clock, continuously towing
      little nets. And it's produced so fast, they wouldn't be able to
      keep up," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Ebbesmeyer said in 10,000 years scientists might find a layer of
      plastic in the ground and use this as evidence of "the plastic
      people."<br>

      I’m not one of those guys who corners folks at parties to rant at
      them about biodiesel or calls people “fucking idiots” for being
      skeptical about global warming. But I should also point out that

      <br>
      The problem with all the bravado on both sides of the ecology
      debate is that nobody really knows what they’re talking about.
      Trying to form opinions on climate change, overpopulation, and
      peak oil hinges on ginormous leaps of faith based around tiny
      statistical deviances that even the scientists studying them have
      a hard time understanding. It gets so convoluted with all the
      yelling and the politics that sometimes you just want something
      huge and incontrovertibly awful to come along for everybody to
      agree on. Something you can show anyone a picture of and go, “See?
      We’re fucked.”<br>
      <br>
      Well, I have just such a thing. There is a Texas-size section of
      the Pacific Ocean that is irretrievably clogged with garbage and
      it will never go away. And I have seen it with my own eyes. Case
      closed. Oh, you want to hear more? OK, fine.<br>

      In the middle of the 90s, Charles Moore was sailing his racing
      catamaran back to California from Hawaii and decided on a lark to
      cut through the center of the North Pacific Gyre. The Gyre is an
      enormous vortex of currents revolving around a continuous
      high-pressure zone—if you think of the rest of the Pacific as a
      gigantic toilet, this zone would be the part where your poop bobs
      and twirls before being sucked down. Boats typically avoid it
      since it’s essentially one big windless death trap, so when Moore
      motored through it was just him, his crew, and an endless field of
      garbage.<br>
      <br>
      As long as it’s existed, the middle of the Gyre has been a
      naturally occurring point of accumulation for all the drifting
      crap in its half of the ocean. Once upon a time, flotsam circled
      into the middle of the Gyre and (because up until the past century
      everything in the world was biodegradable) was broken down into a
      nutrient-rich stew perfect for fish and smaller invertebrates to
      chow on. Then we started making everything out of plastic and the
      whole place went to shit.<br>
      <br>
      The problem with plastic is, unless you hammer it with enough
      pressure to make a diamond, it never fully disintegrates. Over
      time plastic will photodegrade all the way down to the individual
      polymers, but those little guys are still in it for the long haul.
      This means that except for the slim handful of plastics designed
      specifically to biodegrade, every synthetic molecule ever made
      still exists. And except for the small percentage that gets caught
      in a net or washes up on a shore, every chunk of plastic that’s
      dropped into the Pacific makes its way to the center of the Gyre
      and is floating there right now.<br>
      <br>
      After watching junk lap against the side of his boat for the
      better part of a week, Captain Moore decided to convert his boat
      into a research vessel and make semiannual trips into the Gyre to
      study the trash. I tagged along on his most recent voyage, joining
      a divorced, 40-something doctor and a Mexican chemist and mother
      of two as his crew. It was like a family vacation, but with more
      science and way more bummers.<br>
      <br>
      The garbage patch is located at one of the most remote points on
      earth. It takes a solid week of sailing just to get there.
      Considering how torturous the average daylong car trip gets, you
      can well imagine the kind of zap job that seven days on a 50-foot
      boat will do to your brain. You lose sight of land the first day,
      then you stop seeing other ships, then you stop seeing anything at
      all except for endless waves and occasionally a seabird, which,
      after days of nothing but water, becomes as exciting as spotting a
      UFO. Right at the point where you’ve come up with a separate song
      for every bird in the ship’s guidebook and have begun integrating
      them into a full seabird opera, you start seeing the trash.<br>
      <br>
      I had assumed (completely without any basis in research or common
      sense) that there was some contiguous mass of concentrated garbage
      the captain was steering us toward, but (sadly?) this was not the
      case. The debris patterns shift with the currents, so you just
      have to aim the boat in one direction and hope for crap. Every so
      often we’d spot a few different pieces of garbage floating sort of
      near one another, but for the most part it was just a steady
      stream of junk, passing one piece at a time. It was a little
      underwhelming at first, but keep in mind we were cutting a
      razor-thin course through one of the biggest expanses of open
      water on the planet. The fact that we couldn’t look out the window
      for the better part of the trip without seeing some piece of junk
      bobbing by holds some seriously ugly implications for the rest of
      the ocean.<br>
      <br>
      The first few times we spotted garbage, we made a big production
      of stopping the boat and going out to scoop it up. Then we began
      just picking up whatever trash we could snag from the front of the
      deck. Then we just grabbed whatever looked interesting.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the flotsam is fun stuff that fell off the side of
      container ships, like entire crates of hockey masks and Nikes. You
      might have read about the shipment of rubber duckies that got lost
      in a storm back in 1992 and have been used by oceanographers to
      more accurately plot the movement of water currents. I guess
      that’s something of a silver lining to the situation, although
      it’s a lot like thanking AIDS and cholera for all the advances
      they’ve provided to epidemiologists.<br>
      <br>
      Before we became equal parts bored and depressed with hauling
      garbage out of the sea all day, we managed to score a motorcycle
      wheel, a hard hat, and some children’s life preservers with shark
      bites in them. We also narrowly missed running into what was
      either a ship’s mast or a telephone pole. The majority of our
      haul, though, was just average crap like Coke bottles and grocery
      bags. A lot of it seemed to come from Asia, meaning it had to have
      traveled at least 5,000 miles just for us to find it. The scary,
      staggering thing to consider while holding this stuff is that only
      a fifth of it is tossed from boats. Most of it is land-born trash
      that somehow ended up in a waterway and worked a slow path out to
      sea. As the captain said a good ten or so times, “The ocean is
      downstream of everything.”<br>
      <br>
      Once we were firmly inside the patch, Captain Moore rigged up a
      trawl and started taking water samples in little petri dishes. I
      figured these would be snoozers without a microscope, but when the
      first one came in it was more horrifying than anything we’d seen
      floating past.<br>
      <br>
      There were a few water striders and tiny jellyfish here and there,
      but they were totally overwhelmed by a thick confetti of plastic
      particles. It looked like a snow globe made of garbage. Based on
      previous samples, Moore estimated the ratio of plastic to the
      regular components of seawater in what we were pulling up as 6 to
      1. As we moved closer to the middle of the Gyre, the ratio got
      visibly higher, until we started pulling in samples that looked
      like they contained solely plastic.<br>
      <br>
      This is the part of the trip that weighs heaviest on my mind. It’s
      terrible enough to litter sections of the planet with things that
      can conceivably be removed—I mean, even oil spills and radioactive
      dust can be cleaned up to a certain extent. But to fundamentally
      alter the composition of seawater at one of the farthest points
      from civilization on the globe is a whole different ballpark of
      fucking the planet. It’s fucking it right up the ass, for good and
      forever. Without lube.<br>
      <br>
      But wait, here comes the scariest part.<br>
      <br>
      Once the plastic confetti gets small enough to fit inside a
      jellyfish’s mouth, it gets sucked in and starts its way up the
      food chain back to us. As the jellies float out of the debris
      field, little fish eat them, absorbing all the built-up plastics.
      Then big fish eat a bunch of little fish, even bigger fish eat a
      bunch of big fish, and by the time you get to the point where
      we’re hoisting creatures out and eating them, you’re looking at
      entire milk crates’ worth of particles built up in their fat. It’s
      the cycle of life reimagined as a dystopian sci-fi cliché. We are
      eating our own refuse.<br>
      <br>
      Aside from clogging up the digestive tract (biologists in the
      Pacific have found the bodies of birds who starved to death
      because their stomachs were completely packed with trash),
      degraded plastics also have the tendency to sop up foreign
      chemicals that have leached into the water. There’s a whole class
      of pesticides and solvents called persistent organic pollutants
      that are basically tailor-made to attach themselves to loose
      synthetics and wreak havoc on whatever living thing happens to
      swallow them. The chemist on our boat was studying a pair of the
      most prevalent of these pollutants in the Pacific water, DDE and
      DDT. Yep, the same DDT that kills baby eagles. It’s also a
      probable carcinogen with links to diminished sperm counts and
      developmental retardation. The ocean is brimming with this shit.<br>
      <br>
      What’s worse than this is even when the plastic is free from
      outside toxins, its components can potentially wreck your body.
      Bisphenol A is a compound used in things like Nalgene bottles and
      dildos. It’s also a synthetic estrogen and can completely derail
      the reproductive system. Dr. Frederic vom Saal of the University
      of Missouri has been studying the effects of bisphenol A on lab
      mice for the past decade and has noticed ties to its exposure with
      an absurd suite of health problems including low sperm count,
      prostate cancer, hyperactivity, early-onset diabetes, breast
      cancer, undescended testicles, and sex reversal. Does the fact
      that humans can suffer SEX REVERSAL symptoms from inadvertently
      eating a compound that is used to make dildos qualify as irony?<br>
      <br>
      Vom Saal’s research is at the center of a messy dispute because it
      involves exposure in such infinitesimal quantities and nobody is
      exactly sure how the endocrine system works. There’s also a tricky
      “magic bullet” sort of quality to his findings, but after talking
      with him it seemed like even he was a little taken aback that this
      one chemical could be at the root of almost every major US health
      crisis of the past 30 years. And even if he’s only right on one of
      the above counts, yeesh.<br>
      <br>
      Still worse than any of this is the possibility that the same
      chemicals can simultaneously trigger massive disruptions in DNA.
      “All it takes is one misaligned chromosome and you’ve got things
      like Down syndrome,” vom Saal says. “If you examine the genetic
      material in animals exposed to low doses of bisphenol A, it looks
      like someone fired a shotgun into the chromosomes.”<br>
      <br>
      On the outer edge of the Gyre, we ran smack into the white whale
      of the maritime trash world: a ghost net. Ghost nets are loose
      tangles of fishing line and nets that float freely across the
      ocean, snagging anything in their path. They are the langoliers of
      the sea. Ghost nets have been found that are miles long with oars
      and sharks’ skulls and full turtle skeletons peeking out of their
      knots. The one we caught wasn’t anywhere near that big, but it was
      easily twice my size, weighed 200 pounds, and housed both a
      toothbrush and its own school of tropical fish.<br>
      <br>
      There was no way we could tow the massive clump of nets to shore,
      so we hoisted it onto the back of the ship, attached a GPS tag so
      that oceanographers could track its movement, and lowered it back
      into the water. Our camera guy Jake jumped in after it to film it
      drifting away in a cloud of slaked-off string and plastic. When he
      hopped back on board it looked like somebody had smeared body
      glitter across his chest. It was tiny chunks of plastic.<br>
