      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> - In this paper,
      a new highly-efficient water-selective composite adsorbent for
      solar-driven fresh water production from the atmospheric air is
      presented. It is synthesized by a patented <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">ultra-large pore crystalline material
        MCM-41</span> as host matrices and <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">calcium chloride</span> as a hygroscopic salt.
      Experimental data demonstrate that adsorption capacity of the new
      composites is as high as <span style="font-weight: bold;">1.75
        kg/kg dry adsorbent</span>, which is higher than composites
      synthesized by silica-gel and calcium chloride, and the adsorption
      rate of the new composites is also found attractive. The
      desorption characteristics of the new composites are also studied,
      and it demonstrates that it<span style="font-weight: bold;"> can
        desorb more than 90% of the adsorbed water at lower heating
        temperature at about 80°C</span>. A solar-driven water
      production test unit using the new adsorbent is also presented and
      tested. The experimental tests of this developed unit demonstrated
      a feasibility of the fresh water production with the daily water
      productivity more than<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 1.2 kg/m2

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract </span>-- Feasibility
      of extracting water from air on ship's environment was evaluated
      on a general cargo ship navigating between Dalian and Hamburg at
      May. Firstly, analysis of the energy equilibrium among the heat
      evaluated from fuel consumption rate and that distributed to
      different parts of the main engine system was carried out, an
      experimental unit employing the waste heat of the cylinder jacket
      water was then set up on the afterdeck nearby central air
      conditioning room. Two adsorption towers with the same size and
      capacity were design in consideration of the heat and mass
      transfer characteristic of the water vapor within the adsorbent
      bed of the silica gel and that of the composite compounded with
      calcium chlorate. Daily amount of water produced from the
      extracting unit and that from desalination plant were compared in
      terms of the main indices prescribed by the National Standard for
      Drinking Water. Results show that the waste heat of the cylinder
      jacket cooling water under normal working condition is enough to
      meet the need of the heat powering the extracting unit,<span
        style="font-weight: bold;"> silica gel with pores larger than
        mesopore is a better adsorbent in marine environment</span>, the
      composite has a better performance in water vapor adsorption, but
      performance in both silica gel and the composite will be weakened
      on board. Results also reveals that the indices of water from the
      extracting unit and the desalination plant are all within the
      permissible range prescribed by the national standard. Conclusions
      are drawn that the monolith of the adsorbent and the flexible
      connection should be used to dampen the influence from the
      vibration and bumping of the ship.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">ABSTRACT</span> -- In the present
      work, an investigation on the application of solar energy to heat
      a sandy bed impregnated with calcium chloride for recovery of
      water from atmospheric air is presented. The study also aimed at
      evaluating the effects of different parameters on the productivity
      of the system during regeneration. These parameters include system
      design characteristics and the climatic conditions. An
      experimental unit has been designed and installed for this purpose
      in climatic conditions of Taif area, Saudi Arabia. The
      experimental unit which has a surface area of 0.5 m2, comprises a
      solar/desiccant collector unit containing <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">sandy bed impregnated with calcium
        chloride</span>. The sandy layer impregnated with desiccant is
      subjected to ambient atmosphere to absorb water vapor in the
      night. During the sunshine period, the layer is covered with glass
      layer where desiccant is regenerated and water vapor is condensed
      on the glass surface. Ambient temperature, bed temperature and
      temperature of glass surface are recorded. Also, the productivity
      of the system has been evaluated. Desiccant concentration at start
      of regeneration is selected on the basis of the climatic data of
      Al-Hada region, which is located at Taif area, Saudi Arabia.
      Experimental measurements show that about <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">1.0 liter per m2 </span>of pure
      water can be regenerated from the desiccant bed at the climatic
      conditions of Taif. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Liquid
        desiccant with initial concentration of 30% can be regenerated
        to a final concentration of about 44%</span>. Desiccant
      concentration at start of regeneration is selected on the basis of
      the climatic data of Al-Hada region. The climate of Taif city is
      dry compared with that for Al-Hada region. This method for
      extracting water from atmospheric air is more suitable for Al-Hada
      region especially in the fall and winter.<br>

      A composite desiccant material is formed by a porous, absorbent
      substrate of PVA foam or non-woven fibrous sheet is soaked in a
      solution of a hygroscopic desiccant such as CaCl. The desiccant is
      held in pores or fibrous entraining areas sized ranging from 50
      microns to 1000 microns. Thin sheets are arranged in a stack in a
      multi-chamber system, while in an absorption state, uses this
      stack in a main chamber to absorb H2O from atmospheric gas flowing
      through that chamber. In a regeneration state atmospheric flow is
      stopped and low-grade energy releases the H2O from the desiccant
      into that chamber. Fans circulate moist air through the main
      chamber and into an adjacent chamber for H2O transfer through or
      past a partially permeable barrier into a cooling/condensing area.
      Both H2O and dry gas may be produced.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The subject relates to materials, methods, and apparatus
      for extracting water vapor from a gas. Particularly it includes
      methods and devices related to extracting water from atmospheric
      air via a hygroscopic material dispersed within an absorbent sheet
      material of effective form factor for sorption and for
      regeneration.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] There are many materials identified as desiccants and many
      known configurations and systems employing desiccants to dry a
      gas. Systems include those using a solid desiccant and those using
      a liquid desiccant. In the case of systems based upon liquid
      desiccants, many existing concepts increase the exposed surface
      area of desiccant by spraying the desiccant in a mist. Besides the
      mechanism and energy required for such schemes the resulting
      chemical mist might, undesirably, be present in the output gas and
      output water. Solid forms of desiccant avoid these problems but
      generally do so at the cost of a relatively small exposed surface
      area per unit of mass leading to inefficiencies. Solid desiccants
      can also have relatively long regeneration times.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] There is a need for a form of desiccant that provides a
      high ratio of surface area to mass in a convenient to deploy form
      factor. Also needed are systems employing such a material to dry a
      gas, preferably using low-grade energy in an efficient manner.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0005] Deficiencies in previous desiccant and air-to-water systems
      can be solved by a desiccant subsystem that can include a stack of
      spaced-apart thin sorbent sheets of a composite desiccant. The
      composite desiccant can be a sheet of a porous material with small
      pores for retaining moisture and larger pores allowing the flow of
      moist gas within its structure. The composite desiccant material
      is made up of a substrate of the sorbent sheet that contains
      dispersed particles of a hygroscopic chemical.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] To enhance water retention capacity, the stack can be
      mounted perpendicular to the direction of gravity or acceleration.
      This can engender a more even distribution of held water with no
      low spot for water to collect and drip from.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] A system of efficiently extracting water from air can be
      constructed with the desiccant stack attracting and retaining
      moisture in air fed to it and through it by fans. A control system
      can chose to operate the fans when conditions of humidity and the
      remaining capacity of the desiccant stack are conducive to
      efficient charging operation. A control system can further
      initiate a regeneration cycle when the availability of low-grade
      heat energy and the fullness of the desiccant stack are conducive
      to efficient regeneration operation. Further, a control system can
      initiate a condensing mode when the degree of moisture in a
      regeneration chamber is high enough relative to the temperature of
      an available cold source for efficient condensing operation. The
      condensing operation can involve a filter or membrane to
      differentially engender the passage of water molecules to be
      condensed versus other warm gases.<br>

      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      [0033] In conjunction with the included drawings, this detailed
      description is intended to impart an understanding of the
      teachings herein and not to define their metes and bounds.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0034] One aspect of the present invention is a composite
      desiccant material in an effective form factor. Another aspect is
      a desiccant subsystem based upon that composite desiccant
      material, and a third aspect includes systems and methods of
      extracting water from air employing the subsystem.<br>

      <br>
      [0035] The desiccant composition includes a porous support
      material and a hydroscopic absorbent dispersed within the porous
      support material. The porous support material has pores or
      pore-like small random gaps of a wide range of sizes. Small pores
      include pores of about 70 microns to large pores of about 1000
      micrometers. This porous support material can include a material
      such as PVA foam or a non-woven fabric such as rayon. The
      desiccant composition disbursed with the support material includes
      a hygroscopic absorbent such as CaCl.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Another aspect of these teachings is directed to a method
      for producing a desiccant composition comprising the steps of: (a)
      providing a porous support material having a range of pores from
      70 micros to 1000 microns; (b) contacting the porous support
      material with a flowable medium comprising a hygroscopic
      absorbent, for a time sufficient to substantially fill porosity in
      the porous support material and then drying the porous support
      material to remove liquid from the flowable medium and form a
      desiccant composition comprising the absorbent dispersed on the
      porous support. A supporting PVA sheet 10, seen in
      photomicrographs in FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 1C, is a preferred support
      material. That material then has embedded, but not positionally
      captivated, particles of a chemically active desiccant.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Appropriate soaking of the porous support material in a
      liquid solution of a chemical such as CaCl, Ethyl Glycol, and
      Lithium Bromide followed by drying the material can be an
      effective manner of producing such a composite. This is generally
      taught in Type "Salt-in-a-Porous-Matrix" Sorbents in Hydrocarbon
      Processing, by E. A. Buluchevskii. This article is found in the
      Russian Journal of General Chemistry 2007, Vol. 77, pp. 2284-2291.
      Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2007. Other related teachings are seen
      in U.S. Pat. No. 6,559,096, May 6, 2003, of Smith et. al. In
      contrast with these and other "salt in a porous matrix" materials,
      herein is taught a non-captive entrainment of the adsorbent salt
      in the absorbent material. The desiccant salt particles and brine
      can migrate within the absorbent substrate due to the larger pores
      and can be mechanically removed from the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] FIG. 1A is a 400* microphotograph of PVA foam in a dry
      state. The PVA foam used in this example was purchased from Ninbo
      Goldtime Household Necessaries CO LTD, item SP703-1 called PVA
      towel 66*43*0.2 cm, dark gray. The pore structure is seen to
      include both relatively small pores 5 and relatively larger pores
      6. In FIG. 1B the same material is shown damp, but not saturated.
      Generally smaller pores are filled with water, held by surface
      tension while relatively larger pores are open, allowing the
      passage of moist air from the environment. The same material is
      seen in FIG. 1C in a saturated state. Substantially all pores
      contain brine. For size comparison purposes, FIG. 2 shows a human
      hair.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The same PVA foam, after the disbursement of CaCl by
      soaking in a solution and then drying, is seen in a dry state in
      FIG. 3A, and a damp state in FIG. 3B.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] FIG. 3C shows a non-woven rayon fabric in a dry state. It
      has air gaps that effectively act as pores. It has a range of gap
      sizes formed by the random pattern of threads 8. The particular
      material tested and shown in FIG. 3C was purchased from Hefei
      Telijie Sanitary Material Co., Ltd. Their designation is: Nonwoven
      Cleaning Cloth. Material: Dipping nonwoven fabric; Size: 110 cm
      width; Length: 50M; Thickness: Around 3.4 mm; Packing: 50M/Roll;
      G.W.: 69 KGs. Not pictured is another material tested which is:
      TSV-5, purchased from ShopMicrofiber.com.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The amount of fluid retained in the absorbent material
      increases as the desiccant absorbs water. It is possible for the
      amount of fluid to exceed the holding capacity of the absorbent
      material that can result in dripping of the brine out of the
      absorbent. The amount of fluid can be maximized if the absorbent
      is composed in a sheet 12 form as depicted in FIG. 4 and, in use,
      is oriented with its major plane perpendicular to the vector of
      gravity. The sheets are generally flexible and should be held in a
      frame to minimize sagging or the fluid will drip out of the low
      points. For this composite material to provide a high ratio of H2O
      holding capacity to mass, the support material should have
      particular properties including a rapid rate of absorbing H20, a
      high capacity for absorbing H20, a rapid wicking of H20, and a
      rapid drying of absorbed H20. Some materials that have been tested
      include a PVA foam, a loose weave Rayon fabric, a microfiber
      fabric, an unwoven fabric, cellulose foams, and various other
      foams including M11.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Some of these substrate materials as tested by the
      inventor, have been seen to have the following properties: Total
      absorption of liquid water into dry media held in horizontal plane
      ranges from 400% to 1,000% of the weight of the dry 170 media's
      weight. The media can hold more water when oriented in thin sheets
      held on a horizontal plane that ranges from 200% to 700% of the
      amount of water retained when the absorbent sheet is held on the
      vertical plane.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Thinner sheets with wider gaps present more effective
      airflow, but yield lower total absorption capacity at higher labor
      assembly costs. The effective 175 thickness will range from 0.4 mm
      through 12 mm. Testing has shown that thickness over 12 mm will
      not regenerate in effective times and also experience an increased
      incidence of the desiccant collecting in the lower portion of the
      sheet and dripping out even when the sheet is maintained in the
      horizontal plane.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Because the absorbent media is not rigid when desiccant is
      in the fluid state, the airflow rate should be low enough to
      prevent flapping which would fatigue and eventually destroy the
      media. Higher airflows can be tolerated by using thicker media and
      by adding more supports. In general, the maximum airflow effective
      in embodiments will not exceed 30 MPH gas flow across the media
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0045] Chemical Hygroscopic
        Desiccant</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0046] Most testing has been done with CaCl as the prime
      hygroscopic desiccant. Other compounds with hygroscopic properties
      such as glycol might be used with success. A combination of CaCl
      and glycol has been seen to be advantageous. Lithium bromide,
      magnesium chloride, and lithium chloride have also been
      demonstrated as effective desiccants.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0047] Composite Desiccant
        Element</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0048] Soaking the support material in a solution of CaCl and then
      drying the support material can disburse the chemical in the pores
      and structure of the support material. Other methods to produce
      the composite are possible. Since a goal of the composite is to
      maximally expose the surface area of the hygroscopic desiccant to
      any gaseous H2O in its environment, the sheets shown are
      relatively thin. One manner to produce a composite can be to soak
      a mounted sheet or sheets of a suitable support material in a
      ridged framework in a solution of CaCl and water with an equal
      weight of water to CaCl. The maximum CaCl that can be absorbed by
      water is dependent on the temperature of the solution. One way to
      obtain an effective mixture is to create a solution wherein some
      CaCl settles to the bottom at 65 degrees-F., but at 75 degrees-F.
      has all the CaCl in solution. In addition, it can be desirable to
      achieve a ratio in a composite of between 5%-300% CaCl to the
      total of CaCl plus substrate by weight. The total amount of CaCl
      that is recommended varies upon the conditions of operation. In
      general, environments that are more humid will require less CaCl
      to reach the point where they have absorbed all of the water
      possible without excessive dripping.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In dry locations, more CaCl can increase absorption. As
      known to those skilled in the art, and according to Dow Chemical,
      a supplier of industrial CaCl, the trend is that at lower humidity
      CaCl will absorb less than it will at higher humidity. Temperature
      also has an effect on the maximum absorption of CaCl. As a result,
      the CaCl loading density can be adjusted for local conditions to
      improve operations. In less humid locations the CaCl loading
      density might be higher and in sufficiently dry locations CaCl may
      remain in its solid form even though it is absorbing water and the
      process continues to work.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0050] Desiccant Sub-System</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0051] As seen in FIG. 5 in a schematic manner, one way to deploy
      the composite material is as parallel sheets 12 with each sheet
      parallel to the flow direction 16 of a gas. This configuration
      exposes both sides of each sheet to the gas. The spacing and other
      details provided by a supporting structure can be such as to have
      a higher or lower air resistance to the flow. Thinner gaps between
      the sheets can increase total absorption per unit volume but may
      do so at the expense of increased airflow resistance. The gap
      between sheets might range from 2 mm to 40 mm in some embodiments.
      The configuration may also be such that a particular degree of
      turbulence is achieved, affecting the interaction of gaseous H2O
      and the desiccant composite sheet. FIGS. 6 and 7 depict an example
      structure for mounting stacked sheets. In FIG. 6, an end spacer
      20, with significant area occupied by openings 21, is used to
      separate and support the multiple sheets. This might be
      constructed from a corrugated plastic. The back of this stack is
      identical to the front. While holes shown in the spacer are
      circular, they may be any shape. While the spacers are shown on
      the ends there may in fact be multiple spacers placed periodically
      along the length of the sheet to prevent sagging of the supported
      media. There are also one or more similar corrugated strips within
      the stack to provide intermediate supports. The side supporting
      spacers 23 are solid on each of the sides of the stack as seen in
      the side view of FIG. 7. An alternate way to construct the stack
      is by sandwiching a single spacer sheet with teeth extruded on
      both sides between each desiccant sheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In some versions, as seen in the front view of FIG. 8 and
      the plan view of FIG. 9 (the top sheet is removed), one or more
      baffles 24 can be used to create a turbulence-enhancing air path
      between the sheets. Those skilled in the art will recognize many
      alternate structures for supporting the parallel sheets and
      engendering a desired trade-off between pressure drop and a
      desired turbulent interaction. Material thickness of the desiccant
      substrate is predominantly limited by the material's moisture
      holding characteristics when oriented in a horizontal plane.
      Another factor for thickness determination is the rate of
      absorption.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] A thicker sheet might be appropriate for a material with
      faster wicking and absorption. If the material is too thick it may
      then accumulate a saturating degree of fluid in its lower portions
      leaving the upper portions drier and can result in dripping.
      Overly thick sheets would also make inefficient use of the
      desiccant by weight and by volume. In general, the thickness of
      the material is chosen to allow the maximum absorption in a given
      environment consistent with the average 250 charging time. For an
      overnight charging system, a thickness from 2 mm through 10 mm can
      be effective. For a system delivering multiple batches per day, a
      material thickness as thin as 0.5 mm may be more effective. In
      systems for continuous drying of a gas, a sheet thickness of 0.1
      mm to 0.5 mm and a spacing of between [1/2] and 1 times the
      thickness may be advantageous. Sheet spacing in embodiments with
      longer airflow channels may generally have wider gaps to maintain
      a particular flow at a desired low degree of pressure. Shorter
      channel systems can have lower gaps and maintain a comparable
      pressure drop. In practice, a spacing of between 1/64'' and 2''
      would cover many applications. A narrower practical range, taking
      material sag and volume constraints into consideration, can be
      1/16'' to [1/2]''. A smaller gap can be advantageous in allowing
      more sheets and therefore more desiccant mass in a given volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Those skilled in the art will understand that various
      mountings and stiffening schemes are available with different
      tradeoffs. Sheets used in a subsystem may be pre-dried and tested
      for dripping to a desired specification. A system could take
      advantage of that to cease operating in an absorption mode with a
      desired margin before dripping was likely to occur. In some cases,
      it may be advantageous to construct a stack of the substrate
      material and then soak the subsystem. In other cases the composite
      sheets might be created and then assembled into a stack. Systems
      can be manufactured over-saturated with desiccant that is then
      removed by operation on-site to allow for environmental
      differences at various sites. One implementation approach is to
      assemble the subsystem with untreated absorbent media and then
      soak the subsystem in the desiccant solution. The desiccant charge
      would then likely be substantially over-charged. The subsystem can
      then be conditioned in an environment that approximated the
      humidity and temperature 275 expected to occur in a target
      deployment location. This conditioning step allows the desiccant
      charge to absorb the maximum water it is likely to absorb in the
      field and allows excess solution to drip out to be re-used. The
      unit is then dried.<br>
      <br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0055] The H2O holding capacity of the subsystem is affected by
      various factors 280 including the support material, the chemical
      desiccant, the sheet thickness, and the number of sheets. In
      addition, as the amount of H2O nears the capacity of the material,
      the liquid will appear at the surface and may drip. By keeping the
      sheet-stack parallel to the ground, the capacity before dripping
      that occurs is increased. Some mounting arrangements may provide a
      leveling indication and some may provide a leveling adjustment for
      the subsystem while others may provide a leveling indication and
      adjustment at the system level. In alternate inertial
      environments, the mounting orientation could be dynamically
      altered in order to maintain a perpendicular relationship with the
      vector of gravity/acceleration.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Air-to-Water System</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      [0056] A schematic view of an example air-to-water system is shown
      in FIG. 10. Its structure includes a main chamber 100 containing a
      desiccant subsystem 101. It also includes a heat exchanger 102 to
      provide energy in the regeneration phase and a condensing chamber
      103 to harvest water freed during regeneration. There are three
      primary airflow paths (1) ambient in, dried air out 117 (2)
      recirculation hot air for regeneration 115, and (3) recirculation
      of moist air through a condenser 116. Fans engender the flows.
      Flaps (not shown in FIG. 10) associated with each of the three
      airflow patterns, respectively, prevent undesired flow. The system
      shown includes both temperature and moisture sensors in various
      locations.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] An intake fan 105 can direct ambient air into the desiccant
      chamber and an exhaust fan 106 removes the dried air. Temperature
      T1 T2 and moisture M1 M2 sensors allow for measurement of the
      intake and exhaust air respective properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] A source of heat 107 that might be hot water from a solar
      panel, or might be from a low-grade waste heat source is connected
      to the heat exchanger 102 to allow heating of recirculating
      airflow 105 through the desiccant subsystem 101 in the main
      chamber 100. In applications that produce drinking water, the
      metallic components of the heat exchanger 102 can be constructed
      from stainless steel. A pump 108 is shown in the hot water path. A
      regeneration flow fan 109 is in the recirculation airflow path
      that goes through the heat exchanger and the desiccant chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Condensing occurs in a condensing chamber 103 that is
      coupled to the main chamber via two fans in the system of FIG. 10.
      One fan 111 is pulling air from the desiccant chamber while the
      second, exit fan 112, is pulling air through the condensing
      chamber and back into the main chamber and through the desiccant
      subsystem 101. A source of cooling 113 is provided to the
      condensing chamber coupled by a heat exchanger 126 and water is
      produced at a drain outlet 121.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] A control system 200 is shown schematically in FIG. 11. The
      temperature and moisture sensors seen in FIG. 10 provide inputs to
      the control system. Another input is the state of charge 114 of
      the battery 201. The control system's various outputs signal the
      various phases of operation, enabling fans and pumps.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Operation</span><br

      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Air-to-Water System</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0061] A goal of many embodiments of these teachings is to produce
      drinking water from ambient air under a variety of conditions with
      a minimal expenditure of energy. In a typical operation cycle,
      photovoltaic panels 202 charge a bank of batteries 201 during the
      day.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] At night, the system might start out in a quiescent state,
      neither charging, regenerating, nor condensing. From past
      operation, the control system has a stored value representative of
      the extent of H2O held in the desiccant subsystem. The stored
      electrical energy in the battery is used conservatively. The
      control system makes decisions based upon the degree of moisture
      in the ambient air measured by sensor M1, the temperature of the
      ambient air measured by sensor T1, the extent of H20 presently
      held in the desiccant subsystem 101, and the state-of-charge 114
      of the batteries. The intake 105 and exhaust fans 106 are
      energized to further charge the desiccant only when "it is worth
      it". That is, if a modeling of the system by the control logic
      indicates that there will be an adequate addition to the held H20
      by taking in ambient air, the CHARGE signal will be activated.
      This will engage both the intake fan 105 and the exhaust fan 106.
      This mode will stay in operation so long as the control systems
      models, according to predetermined rules, that further operation
      meets a criterion of efficiency. The other flow patterns are
      inactive and blocked by closed flaps.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] When the held H2O in the desiccant subsystem 101 is at the
      maximum or if the ambient conditions are such that no charging or
      an ineffective degree of charging would take place, the charge
      mode ceases. In a system using solar water heating as its
      regeneration energy source, the temperature of the hot water
      source as measured by the sensor T5 will increase as the day goes
      on and the sun rises. To conserve battery power, the control
      system will not initiate regeneration mode until the hot water has
      achieved a temperature level that can efficiently cause
      regeneration of the desiccant. This computation is based on the
      present state of the desiccant chamber. When the criteria are met,
      the control system will energize the REGEN signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In regeneration mode the hot water source pump 108 is
      engaged as well as the fan that engenders the regenerating flow
      pattern 115. That pattern is through the heat exchanger 102 and
      through the desiccant subsystem 101 in a closed-circuit manner. In
      this mode the other patterns of flow are inactive and blocked by
      flaps. The regeneration mode's function is to release held H2O out
      of the desiccant and into the atmosphere of the main chamber. This
      mode is continued as long as the heat provided through the heat
      exchanger is continuing to effectively release additional H2O. One
      parameter involved with this calculation is the humidity or
      moisture content of the atmosphere within the main chamber 100.
      While this may be measured directly, the harsh conditions in this
      system have proven to be destructive to the useful life of many
      conventional sensors. In the system of FIG. 10 and FIG. 11, only a
      temperature sensor T4 is located in the main chamber. In that
      example system, the moisture level within the closed chamber is
      determined by modeling the system, starting with the known state
      of the amount of H2O held in the desiccant and taking into account
      the input ambient air, output air and the degree of heat energy
      injected via the regenerative flow and amount of moisture
      condensed.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The condensing mode is entered when the atmosphere within
      the main chamber 100 is sufficiently saturated as to be
      effectively condensable given the temperature delta between that
      of the main chamber and that of the cold source 113 whose
      temperature is measured by a temperate sensor T6. When the
      criteria are met, the control system will activate the CONDENSE
      signal. If a criteria set according to predetermined rules is met,
      the control system will enter the condensing mode. In this mode,
      energizing the condensing flow fans 111 112 will engender the
      condensing air pattern. Closed flaps prevent the other airflow
      patterns.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] This condensing airflow pattern 116 is a recirculation flow
      through the desiccant subsystem 101 and the condensing chamber
      103. Due to the temperature drop provided by the cold source,
      water condenses and is available to exit the chamber at a drain
      point 121. This mode is continued as long as the moisture level on
      the main chamber and the temperature difference between the main
      chamber and the cold source 113 provide for effective continued
      production of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] FIG. 12 shows a more detailed schematic of the condensing
      chamber 103 and its entrance and exhaust fans of this first
      example system. Air is pulled from one end of the main chamber by
      an entrance fan 111 and pushed back into the other end of the
      desiccant chamber by the exit fan 112. Within the condensing
      chamber 103 the hot moist air first enters a separation area 138
      and then a portion of the moist air passes through a filter 124.
      In this example system it is a HEPA filter. One purpose of the
      filter 124 is to prevent particulate contamination of the water
      being produced. The H2O is condensed in the condensing region 132
      from the air via a heat exchanger 126 connected to a cold source.
      This might be a fluid pumped through a ground loop, ambient air,
      or other source of relative coldness. The condensed water is
      available at a drain point 121.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0068] Alternative Condensing
        Chamber-With Membrane</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0069] FIG. 13 shows a schematic view of an alternative condensing
      chamber 103'. In this version a membrane 130 separates an initial
      separation region 138 from the actual cold condensing region 132'.
      Rather than direct the recirculating air pattern through the
      condensing region itself, the recirculation is done in the
      separation sub-chamber with the path having a sidewall 141
      comprising an H2O permeable membrane 130. The recirculation flow
      116' is parallel with the length of the membrane rather than being
      directed to the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] On the opposite side of the membrane 130 is a sweep region
      133. On the side of the membrane opposite to that abutting
      recirculating flow, two sweep fans 134 135 direct airflow 140 in
      parallel to the membrane. The sweep region is a plenum defined by
      the membrane and a plenum wall 142. H2O molecules will permeate
      the membrane assisted by the turbulent flows on both sides.
      However, the other components of the hot moist air will not
      substantially permeate the membrane. This provides multiple
      benefits. One is that there is a minimum of mass heat transfer
      from the hot side of the membrane to the condensing side of the
      membrane. While it is necessary to cool the H2O water vapor to
      condense it to liquid water, it is desirable that the bulk of the
      recirculating flow 116' not be cooled since it is being fed back
      into the main chamber 100. The main chamber must be kept hot in
      order to keep the H2O in its atmosphere rather than in the
      desiccant.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] A second benefit of the membrane version is that a partial
      vacuum is created as the H2O expands on the sweep region 133 side
      of the membrane. This pressure differential further enhances the
      flow of H2O molecules through the membrane. Several materials can
      be used in the composition of a suitable membrane. One is Nafion.
      An alternate material that has been successfully tested is a
      monolithic urethane material, part number PT1700S by Deerfield
      Urethane. The sweep flow circulates through the sweep region 133
      and back through the actual condensing region 132. There the flow
      is in communication with the cold source via the heat exchanger
      126'.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Method of Operation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0072] FIGS. 14-19 show states, criteria, and steps involved in
      the operation of the system of FIGS. 10-13. In FIG. 14 a state
      diagram illustrates the four major states of the system: Quiescent
      260, Charging 261, Regenerating 263 and Condensing 262.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0073] While in the Quiescent 260
        state:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      (a) Detection of high moisture content in the ambient air with a
      remaining water holding capacity of the desiccant subsystem 101 is
      a condition that will cause a transition 250 to the Charge state
      261.<br>
      (b) Detection of significant held water in the desiccant subsystem
      in conjunction with a sufficient source of low-grade heat is a
      condition that will cause a transition 255 to the Regen state 263.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0076] When in the Charge state
        261:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      (a) Detection of low moisture content in the ambient air OR a low
      remaining water holding capacity of the desiccant subsystem is a
      condition that will cause a transition 251 to the Quiescent state
      260.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0078] When in Regen state 263:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      (a) Detection of insufficient low-grade energy to efficiently
      release moisture from the desiccant subsystem will cause a
      transition 254 to the Quiescent state 260.<br>
      (b) Detection of significant held water in the desiccant subsystem
      in conjunction with a sufficient source of low-grade heat is a
      condition that will cause a transition 252 to the Condense state
      262.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0081] When in Condense state
        262:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      (a) Detection of insufficient moisture in the main chamber 100
      will cause a transition 253 to the Regen state 263.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0083] State Transition</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0084] Various conditions detected by logic and system state
      modeling in the control system 200 cause state transitions. The
      state transition logic is shown in the state table FIG. 15.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The box for the criteria for moving from regeneration to
      condensing mode 299 requires additional explanation. When using
      waste heat or split collectors then rather than measuring light
      sensor for heating conditions this simply measures input of
      heating fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Calculated dew point of humidity in the chamber, Z, is
      based on the calculated dew point, humidity, and temperature of
      the highest 2-hour average humidity as measured in input air
      during prior charge period. This is used to calculate a minimum
      temperature delta between the ambient temperature and the
      condensing dew point. This is used as the minimum condensing
      delta. Minimum condensing Delta is increased by a set constant
      such as 10-degrees F. for each hour regeneration is run, to allow
      for reduced humidity available in desiccant because of water
      reclaimed. The adjustment per hour is tuned for local conditions
      and known over-sizing of desiccant stack. Larger oversized
      desiccant stack will allow a lower increase per hour while smaller
      desiccant stacks will require a higher increase per hour.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0087] Charge Mode</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0088] In FIG. 16 the steps of Charge mode are seen. First, the
      main intake and exhaust airflow fans or blowers are energized and
      engaged S100 S101. Then a loop is entered where the temperature
      sensors and moisture sensors are monitored and the information
      used to continually update a model of the state of the desiccant
      subsystem and the relative humidity of the chambers S102. Within
      this loop, the criteria described above regarding causes of state
      transitions is reevaluated S103. If the conditions are such as to
      cause a transition to the Quiescent state, the main intake and
      exhaust fans are dis-engaged and the Quiescent state is entered
      S104. If no transition is called for by the conditions, the loop
      continues.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0089] Condense Mode</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0090] In FIG. 17 the steps of Condense mode are seen. First the
      condensing entrance 111 and exit fans 112 are engaged S120, and
      the coolant flow pump 135 to cause cold water to flow through the
      heat exchanger 126 is engaged S121. Then a loop is entered where
      the temperature sensors and moisture sensors are monitored and the
      information used to continually update a model of the state of the
      desiccant subsystem and the relative humidity of the chambers
      S122. Within this loop, the criteria described above regarding
      causes of state transitions is reevaluated S123. If conditions
      dictate a transition to the Regen state, condensing entrance and
      exit fans and coolant flow pump are dis-engaged, and the Regen
      state is entered S125. If no transition is called for by the
      conditions, the loop continues.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0091] Quiescent Mode</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0092] In FIG. 18 the steps of Quiescent mode are seen. First the
      all pumps and fans are disengaged S130. Any flaps are closed. Then
      a loop is entered where the temperature sensors and moisture
      sensors are monitored and the information used to continually
      update a model of the state of the desiccant subsystem and the
      relative humidity of the chambers S131. Within this loop the
      criteria described above regarding causes of state transitions is
      reevaluated S132. If the conditions are such as to cause a
      transition to the Charge state, that state is entered S133. If
      conditions dictate a transition to the Regen state, that state is
      entered S134. If no transition is called for by the conditions,
      the loop continues.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0093] Regen Mode</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0094] In FIG. 19 the steps of Regen mode are seen. First, the
      regeneration, recirculation fan 109 is energized and engaged S110.
      In this same step, the pump 108 is engaged. Then a loop is entered
      where the temperature sensors and moisture sensors are monitored
      and the information used to continually update a model of the
      state of the desiccant subsystem and the relative humidity of the
      chambers S112. Within this loop the criteria described above
      regarding causes of state transitions is reevaluated S113. If the
      conditions are such as to cause a transition to the Quiescent
      state, the regeneration fan and hot water pump are dis-engaged and
      the Quiescent state is entered S114. However if conditions dictate
      a transition to the Condense state, the regeneration fan and hot
      water pump are dis-engaged and the Condense state is entered S116.
      If no transition is called for by the conditions, the loop
      continues S115.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Further, More Detailed
        Embodiments</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0095] Although those skilled in the art will understand the
      materials and techniques used in the design and construction of
      systems according to these teachings, two specific implementations
      are described below.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0096] Split System</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0097] The version diagramed in FIG. 20 is a "split system" in
      that the subcomponents of the system may be located other than
      immediately adjacent to each other. Because of this flexibility a
      wide range of physical embodiments are possible by one skilled in
      the field. This specific version gets much of its energy input
      from solar and wind power.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Solar collectors 275, possibly located on a roof, are used
      to create a heated fluid 276 which a circulating pump 277 can
      bring to a heat exchanger 278 in a chamber with the desiccant
      stack 279 in a charging mode. Air is pushed in a charging flow 291
      by the charge blower 290 from an inlet charge port 280, through
      the heat exchanger 278, and then through the stack out to a
      roof-mounted passive exhaust fan 281. A controlled damper 282
      opens this path in a charge mode.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] For regeneration, a fan 283 forces airflow 292 through the
      desiccant stack 279 in a continued loop. As detailed above,
      regeneration continues until a desired set of conditions causes a
      mode transition to a condensing mode. In the condensing mode, the
      regeneration flow path is diverted through a filter 294 into a
      condensing airflow path 284. This condensing airflow is caused by
      the condensing fan 293. The condensed water goes to a drain 285
      and out an outlet 286. The condensation is promoted by a primary
      condenser 287 being cooled by a fan 288. That primary condenser
      provides a flow of a cold fluid to the heat reclaiming condenser
      289.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0100] Small Unit with Membrane</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0101] One compact embodiment using a thermoelectric semiconductor
      310 is shown in simplified two-dimensional form in FIGS. 21, 22,
      and 23. Referencing FIG. 21 its structure includes an outer
      enclosure 314 with several sub-chambers and air conduits 320. The
      major sub component with the enclosure include a desiccant stack
      309 and a membrane 308 that allows water vapor but not other
      molecules of the air to pass. In this example, the heating for
      regeneration and the cooling for condensing are both caused,
      literally, by two-sides of the same semiconductor. When an
      electric current flows through the thermoelectric device 310 the
      by the Peltier effect, one side becomes hot 313 while the opposite
      side becomes cold 312. To achieve the compact design an air
      conduit 320 provides a path from one side of the desiccant stack
      309 to the other side of the stack for the regeneration
      recirculating flow 318. In these two-dimensional views the conduit
      appears to bifurcate the stack into two regions. This is not the
      case. The conduit does not extend across the whole width in the
      third dimension. Therefore, it does not bifurcate the desiccant
      stack nor does it block the condensing pathway 315. The three fans
      shown include one fan for charging airflow 304 at the exhaust port
      322, a second regeneration-recirculating fan 302 and a condensing
      mixing fan 303. A tray 307 at the base of the condensing area 315
      provides for the collection of condensed water that can exit the
      unit out of the water outlet 306.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0102] Small Unit Operation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0103] The charging state is seen in FIG. 21. The charging exhaust
      fan 304 is energized. That pulls external air into the inlet,
      pushing open both the inlet flap 300 and the outlet flap 301. The
      charging flow 317 is shown coming in the inlet, flowing through
      the desiccant stack 309, around the side of the membrane 308 and
      past the condensing area. Finally, the charging air flow exits via
      the exhaust port. Charging leaves the desiccant stack in a
      water-holding state. The heat pipe does not block the exit flow
      since it does not extend to fill the space in the third dimension.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] In FIG. 22, the regeneration flow is diagramed. In this
      recirculation flow 318 the inlet and outlet flaps 300 301 are
      closed since the exhaust fan 304 is not energized. However, the
      recirculating fan 302 is energized. The recirculating flow goes
      through the desiccant stack 309, around the membrane and back up a
      recirculation channel to the air conduit 320. During this mode the
      thermoelectric device 310 is energized to heat the recirculating
      air to pull the stored moisture out of the desiccant stack.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] In FIG. 23, the condensing flow 319 is shown. In this mode
      the only energized fan is the condensing mixing fan 303. Hot,
      moist air is drawn from the area of the desiccant stack 309
      towards one face of the membrane 308 by a partial vacuum initiated
      by the pump 305. The water vapor penetrates the membrane but the
      bulk of the air (and heat) does not. This allows the hot air to
      remain hot to continue regeneration, while the water proceeds to
      the condensing area. As the water vapor emerges from the opposite
      side of the membrane, the partial vacuum is reinforced, further
      enhancing the "pull" of moisture through the membrane and reducing
      the work required by the pump. The hot water vapor first passes
      through an area that provides initial cooling in a passive manner
      via a heat pipe 311. The heat pipe extends to the outside of the
      enclosure 314. Then the partially cooled water vapor is actively
      cooled by the cold side 312 of the thermoelectric device 310. As
      mentioned above, a shelf 307 holds the condensed water until it is
      brought out of the unit by action of the pump 305.<br>
