            <p><b><font size="+1">Filipino Invention Stops Global
                  Warming</font></b></p>
          </center>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A Filipino invention may yet be the
          answer to stop global warming. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Roberto V. Celis, 74, said it took
          him 14 years to develop his invention called "Hydrogasifier"
          using water as supplemental fuel for all kinds of internal
          combustion engines that use gasoline, diesel, natural gas,
          hybrid or bio-fuel, eliminating deadly pollutants from
          spreading into the atmosphere. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"It utilizes the hot exhaust gases
          from the engine to dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen
          gases that are immediately introduced into the combustion
          chamber to completely burn the fuel," Celis said in an
          exclusive interview with the Philippines News Agency in his
          shop in Marikina City. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Celis said that when he perfected
          the development of the "Hydrogasifier" as an anti-pollution
          device, it turned out also as an engine enhancer, increasing
          power of the vehicle and at the same time cutting down fuel
          consumption. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"It was just marvelous and I was
          surprised to this unexpected bonus to my invention which would
          benefit the Filipinos and the whole world," he said. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"Fuel saved from gas or diesel is
          from 30 to 50 percent and that is a lot of savings," he added.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Using the "Hydrogasifier" would
          save the Philippines some US$ 2-billion of fuel annually, he
          said. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Celis said that carbon emission is
          near zero during a series of laboratory tests by the Land
          Transportation Office (LTO) "that makes this device a
          potential carbon eliminator to prevent global warming that's
          threatening man's health." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">To prove his invention works
          perfectly, Celis installed the device to test its
          effectiveness in a Ceres Liner Bus, a Jeep Star Bus, and
          jeepney operated by Ryan Transport Services, all based in
          Bacolod City last March and came up with the following
          results: the 174 horsepower (Hp) of the Ceres Bus increased to
          199 Hp, while emission from 9.6K down to 0.21K, cutting down
          emission by 94 percent; </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Jeep Star Bus from 137Hp to
          144.83 Hp and from 9.9K to 2.29K or emission reduction by 76
          percent; and </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Ryan jeepney from 83 Hp to 87
          Hp and from 9.9K to 0.82K or a reduction by 90 percent of its
          emission. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A Pajero installed with
          "Hydrogasifier" saved fuel by 40 percent in city driving, and
          by as much as 87 percent in highway driving, Celis said. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He said a 1994 Toyoto Corolla car
          using the device saved fuel by 50 percent in highway driving
          and up to 30 percent in city driving. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"It is my humble contribution to
          the world in containing global warming which is threatening
          man's existence," Celis said. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"I do believe that my invention can
          contribute greatly in conserving energy and reduce global
          warming in response to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on Climate
          Change, wherein the World Bank will pay us US$ 20 per ton on
          carbon emission reduction," he said. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The 74-year old Filipino inventor
          said that the "Hydrogasifier" does not only save motor vehicle
          owners with lots of money due to less fuel consumption but
          also complies the Clean Air Act of 2003. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Celis also said that the success of
          his invention will "generate employment for our people and
          earn foreign exchange from exporting the device." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Job generation is one of the main
          concerns of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo before she ends
          her term in 2010. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Celis appealed to the Philippine
          government to extend financial assistance in the filing of
          international patent "for this important invention to
          guarantee the Philippines of exclusivity in manufacturing this
          Filipino technology." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He said his invention can also be
          installed in factories to control pollution. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"The ultimate solution to stop
          global warming is now here in the Philippines," Celis said. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He said that vehicles using the
          device are like trees, which helps lower carbon emission in
          the environment, as these release only 6.5 percent to 7.6
          percent oxygen from the tail pipe to make cities clean and
          healthful. (PNA) </p>

            <p><b>GAS SAVING DEVICE AND METHOD FOR DISSOCIATING WATER</b></p>
          </center>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Technical Field</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The present invention relates to a
          gas saving method and device and more particularly to a method
          for converting water into fuel enhancer for combustion engines
          by dissociating water into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen
          gases by efficiently utilizing the hot exhaust gas of the
          engine for heating the dissociation device. The hydrogen and
          oxygen gases produced are immediately introduced into the
          combustion chamber through the intake manifold of the engine
          to burn and cause efficient combustion of the fuel that
          results in fuel savings, reduce emission, add power and speed
          to the engine and release oxygen from the tail pipe for a
          healthy and friendly environment. The method and device is
          safe to use because storage of hydrogen is not necessary. </p>

          </center>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Background of the Invention</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Although hydrogen is a clean and a
          powerful source of energy, it is a chemically active element
          and not available in the free state in nature in elemental
          gaseous form, it must be produced and stored for utilization
          in engines, but hazardous to the monitoring public when
          carried on board a vehicle in case of accident. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hydrogen can be obtained from
          compounds by breaking chemical bonds but requires a
          substantial amount of energy to accomplish. From hydrocarbons,
          a mixture of methane and steam is heated to a high temperature
          in the presence of catalysts in producing large quantities of
          hydrogen. From water, hydrogen is produced by electrolysis but
          it is a slow process and insufficient to power a vehicle when
          carried on board. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Methods of producing hydrogen are
          specifically exemplified in US Patent&nbsp; # 3,699,718, #
          3,786,138, # 3,816,609, # 3,859,373, # 4,069,303, and #
          4,202,744. These methods include, steam-light hydrocarbon
          reforming, partial oxidation of hydrocarbons and other
          carbonaceous matter and coal gasification process. All the
          above processes require storage of hydrogen to be carried on
          board to be used as fuel for motor vehicles and would create
          great danger to the motoring public. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Liquid water would therefore offer
          a convenient and compact source of hydrogen and oxygen fuel
          for a combustion engine because it is safe to use. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Summary of the Invention</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The invention provides for a gas
          saving device and method for dissociating water into its
          constituents hydrogen and oxygen gases by utilizing the heat
          energy of the hot exhaust gases of an engine between
          temperatures of 710° F and 950° F in an efficient method. The
          method consists of replacing the exhaust pipe directly below
          the exhaust manifold of the engine with an expanded exhaust
          pipe that encases the water dissociation device. This
          dissociation device consists of a long spirally formed
          superheater tubing, preferably stainless steel, with a vast
          area that maximizes contact between the superheater tubing and
          the rapidly passing water. The spirally formed tubing causes
          the high speed passing water to turbulently move in a circular
          manner, expand and exert great pressure on the inner wall of
          the superheater tubing to further absorb more heat between
          710° F and 950° F (Below 710° F condensation occurs). The high
          pressure superheated steam, discharges into a large stainless
          steel cylindrical dissociation chamber, rapidly expands and
          dissociates into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen gases.
          The hydrogen and oxygen gases so produced are immediately
          drawn into the combustion chamber through the intake manifold
          of the engine to burn and causes efficient combustion of the
          fuel that results in fuel savings, add power and&nbsp; speed
          to the engine, reduces emissions, cools the engine, reduces
          engine wear, and releases oxygen to make the environment more
          healthful. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">When the engine stops, the
          spring-loaded valve automatically closes and prevents
          flooding. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Detailed Description</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">With reference to Figure 2 of the
          isometric partially cut-away view of the water dissociation
          device, is seen to include an expanded exhaust pipe 16 adapted
          to be connected to the exhaust manifold of an engine, a spiral
          superheater tubing 7, encases inside said expanded exhaust
          pipe, said exhaust pipe having an exhaust inlet 20, and an
          internal gas outlet 17 at the opposing end, to allow the hot
          exhaust gas from the engine to pass through and heat the
          spiral superheater tubing between 710° F and 950° F; said
          spiral superheater tubing having water supply inlet 6 at one
          end thereof, a dissociation chamber 9 is provided inside said
          expanded exhaust pipe and connected to the opposing end of
          said spiral superheater tubing at 8, said dissociation chamber
          having an outlet that discharges the dissociated hydrogen and
          oxygen gases into the intake manifold through outlet 10.
          Outlet pipe 11 is connected and in fluid communication with
          conduit 13, at outlet coupling 12, through intake manifold
          adapter 15, that is connected to conduit 13, by coupling 14. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">With reference to Figure 1 of the
          cross-sectional view of the water dissociation device flow
          control method of the gas saving device, is seen to include a
          water tank, a transparent dextrose-like tube 2 that is
          anchored and in fluid communication with tank 1. Stainless
          spring-loaded valve 3 which is encases in tube 3a is in fluid
          communication with tube 2 and secured thereto. Valve 3 is
          coupled with gate valve 4 at 4a and in fluid communication
          therewith. Water supply tube 5 is coupled a t 6 with the said
          spiral superheater tubing 7. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">When the engine is started, the
          suction force from the engine causes the water from the supply
          tank to be drawn toward the combustion chamber of the engine.
          This suction force causes the stainless spring-loaded valve 3
          to be actuated to allow the water to flow through said
          spring-loaded valve. The rate of flow of water is regulated by
          gate valve 4. The water passes through the spiral superheater
          tubing at high speed in a circular and turbulent manner making
          the water absorb heater, expand and dissociate into its
          constituent hydrogen and oxygen gases in the dissociation
          chamber. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The dissociated hydrogen and oxygen
          gases are immediately sucked and burned with the fuel in the
          combustion chamber. Since hydrogen burns 7 times faster than
          gasoline and diesel fuels, and releases high amounts of heat
          energy upon combustion, it therefore causes the fuel to burn
          completely to prevent carbon emission, save fuel, add mileage,
          power and speed to the engine.<br>
