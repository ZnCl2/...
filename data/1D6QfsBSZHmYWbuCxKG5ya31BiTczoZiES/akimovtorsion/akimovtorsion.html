      All want to quickly become young. But do not forget, the process
      of rejuvenation, running the programme us the spectra of the
      placenta, the cord blood of <br>
      newborns and children's photo,<br>

      THERE CAN BE NO FASTER AGEING PROCESS.<br>
      <br>
      Although this phenomenon is not linear, and there are exceptions
      ...<br>
      <br>
      So, We've had three patients about 60 and for the 70 years. They
      returned the menstrual cycle after a year of use-matrices by their
      children's photo. A month is a clear marker for the young State of
      the organism.<br>
      <br>
      Another important point: I often write, for example — listening to
      already 10 days, and there is no effect. ». Answer. Our methods
      are not the magic wand magic wand and not apples from children's
      fairy tales-waved, ate and order. Was young and beautiful. No,
      This long work with faith and positive attitude. <br>
      <br>
      Lying on the couch, nothing will. Quick positive effects are.
      Rare, but there are also. In extreme conditions of patients. In
      the final stages of cancer 4th degree. Or a hemorrhage in the
      brain, coupled with paralysis.<br>
      <br>
      Our research and practice of the application of the principles of
      Lingvistiko-wave Genetics are in line with the priority work of
      molecular biology and genetics, Russian Academy of Sciences. See.
      video: Meeting of the Council for science and education,
      20.12.2013.. Moreover, our results in this area substantially
      ahead of all the, that is received in the "classical" Genetics so
      far. No one in the world is not yet able to program stem cells,
      Since the methods used are based on an understanding of genes as a
      purely physical structures. And this is the error. Genes can
      function at a level of physical fields, as the quantum equivalent
      of ourselves. It predicted at the beginning of the last century
      our scientist A.g. Gurvich. We have confirmed this hypothesis and
      use wave genes in practice, treatment, inhibition of aging and
      rejuvenate people.<br>

          <b>Abstract. </b><br>
          Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were exposed to left and right
          torsion field for 30, 60 and 90 minutes. The field was
          generated using the Comfort-7, a device that besides axial and
          radial components of axion field has also an azimuth
          component. After exposure the seeds were evaluated for energy
          and capacity of germination. Comparing the results obtained
          for seeds exposed to left and right torsion field and
          unexposed seeds, the influence of torsion fields improved the
          energy of germination by an overall difference of 36.6% and
          39.33%. For the seeds exposed to left torsion field, the
          higher the time of exposure, the greater results were
          obtained; the energy of germination increased by 14% at 60
          minutes and 28.33% for 90 minutes exposure comparing to the 30
          minutes variant.<br>
          <br>
          <b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
          Torsion field theory is rooted in the discoveries and ideas
          formulated by Einstein's colleague, Eli Cartan, who in 1913
          first used the term torsion force referring to its twisting
          motion, at the same time establishing clearly the momentum
          density spin angular fields generated concept (Akimov A.E.,
          1997). As the electromagnetic field is produced by electric
          charge and the gravitational field by mass, rotation or spin
          of a mass generates torsion field. All these fields have
          effects on long distances. The term torsion may be defined as
          a variable which describes the rotation. Torsion field theory
          supporters scientists confirms that the interaction of spin -
          spin can be transmitted by, or through space like
          electromagnetic waves, except, however, that this does not
          possess energy and mass but only information. There are
          generators of torsion fields, electrical installations, the
          use of which allows us to modify the properties of material
          objects, such as liquids, metals and alloys. Explaining the
          nature of the torsion field, scientists have concluded that
          depending on the direction of rotation the torsion fields can
          be right or left. They have shown also that the right fields
          are beneficial to humans because they improve the fluidity of
          all environments, increase the conductivity of cell membranes
          and by increasing the fluidity they reduce the chance of blood
          clots, there is an improvement of metabolic processes, an
          improvement of human overall homeostasis (www.torser.com). In
          turn, the left fields have deleterious influence on humans.
          What is interesting is that just left torsion fields
          predominate if not all, then most electronic devices around
          us. Starting from this point, the main purpose of the carried
          out research was to check if torsion field action can affect
          the germination of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds.<br>
          <br>
          Arabidopsis thaliana is an annual plant belonging to
          Brassicaceae family and a very common plant used for research
          in plant biology and genetics. The small genome, completely
          sequenced, makes it a model organism and generated a series of
          large scale Agricultura – Stiinta si practica no. 1-
          2(89-90)/2014 Agriculture - Science and Practice projects
          aimed at discovering the functions of the 25.000 genes
          identified in Arabidopsis thaliana (Bevan and Walsh, 2005).<br>
          <br>
          <b>MATERIAL AND METHOD</b><br>
          The research was carried out on Col-0 line Arabidopsis
          thaliana seeds received from the Institute for Plant Biology
          Szeged, Hungary. To generate torsion field, Comfort-7 was
          used, a device that has both axial and radial components of
          the axion field and an azimuth component. The device consists
          of four sections: the power supply, where a variable
          alternating current voltage is applied, two stator sections
          and a pulsed relay section (www.ussdiscovery.com). Spin field
          generator is shown in Fig.1 and consists of a rotating ferrite
          hollow cylinder (1) whose axis of rotation (3) coincides with
          the main axis of symmetry of the cylinder. In the cylinder are
          inserted, in the form of an oblique comb, four permanent
          magnets (2). The cylinder can be in the form of either a flat
          ring or a tube. Seeds were arranged in variants, each variant
          with three replications of 100 seeds.<br>
          <br>
          The variants were exposed to left and right torsion field
          action and another one remained unexposed representing the
          control variant. For each torsion field three exposure times
          were studied, T1 = 30 minutes, T2 = 60 minutes and T3 = 90
          minutes, in order to determine whether the duration of
          exposure to the torsion field action has an influence on seeds
          germination and on the future plant growth. After the
          Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were exposed to the torsion filed
          produced by Comfort-7 generator, they were placed in Linhardt
          type germination dishes to determine the germination capacity
          and energy of germination (Fig. 2).<br>
          <br>
          During the entire germination process conditions of humidity,
          light intensity and temperature were stable and favorable to
          the process, with 30% relative humidity and 23 0 C.<br>
          <br>
          <b>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</b><br>
          The first seeds began to germinate at two days after their
          placing into germination dishes and until the sixth day the
          maximum percentage of seeds were germinated for all&nbsp;
          variants. The energy of germination (%) varied from one
          variant to another based on the Fig. 2 Linhardt type
          germination dish with<br>
          Arabidopsis thaliana seeds (original) <br>

          Using analysis of variance for the processing and
          interpretation of statistical data obtained after germination,
          the following results were drawn relevant:<br>
          To highlight the differences regarding the speed of
          germination, between seeds exposed to the torsion field action
          and witness seeds, comparison of the results of the three
          variants was performed. The influence of torsion field factor
          on the start of seeds germination was one positively
          stimulating. Between variants represented by the seeds that
          were not exposed to torsion field (C1), considered the control
          version, and seeds subjected to the action of left torsion
          field (C2) and right torsion field (C3), there were extremely
          significant difference according to Duncan significance test
          (Table 2).<br>

          <br>
          In the case of left torsion field, exposure time has a direct
          effect on the speed of germination. The difference between the
          first exposure time T1 = 30 minutes considered as witness in
          this comparison, and exposure time T2 = 60 minutes, the
          difference is highly significant. Extremely significant
          difference was observed between T1 and T3 = 90 minutes (Table
          3).<br>

          <b>CONCLUSIONS</b><br>
          The effect of torsion fields proved to be stimulating for the
          germination process of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds and can be
          successfully used in the future to improve this process.<br>
          <br>
          The seeds under the influence of torsion fields, both left and
          right, had an increased energy of germination comparing to the
          unexposed seeds, the improved germination ranged between 29
          and 55% based on time of exposure.<br>
          <br>
          For the seeds exposed to left torsion field, the time of
          exposure was an effective factor to the improvement of
          germination the differences increased along with time exposure
          and they were very significant, according to the results of
          statistical calculations performed.<br>

      <br>
      The Akimov generator using own radiator removes the membrane
      between parallel worlds and opens the portals to the parallel
      worlds. The portal remains active for several days after turning
      off the generator.&nbsp; The portal parameters depend on the
      frequency spectrum supplied to the radiator. If two Akimov
      generators with the same spectra are switched on in various places
      this has to make a teleportation tunnel through which radio waves
      can pass in both directions.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The Akimov torsion generator generates left or right torsion
      field, modulated by various signals. It is possible to use this
      generator in various spheres such as information transfer, room
      cleaning, the changes of metals properties, charging of water and
      others.<br>

      The generator has two connectors. One of them is used for
      operating voltage (12V DC) supplied from power supply or battery.
      The second one is for the signal input from the signal generator
      or mp3 player with the sound recorded. <br>
      <br>
      The Akimov generator begins to receive the signal started about 1
      V range. The sound signal supplied to the circuit of the torsion
      generator amplifies up to the supply voltage and then transfers to
      the radiation source. The radiator is made as a conical condenser
      which is made using a copper conductor, wound in a spiral. This
      construction allows turning of the magnetic field of the coil
      perpendicularly to the magnetic field of the magnet which is
      located in front of the radiator.<br>
      <br>
      There are two switches of the generator.<br>
      <br>
      The first is for switching on and switching on the generator. The
      second one is for changing of the polarity of the torsion field,
      so the generator creates right or left torsion field.<br>
      <br>
      Applications: water charging, influence upon plants, mineral
      products searching, the torsion field connection investigations. <br>
      <br>
      After using the generator it is necessary to make a depolarization
      of the environment where it is located.<br>
      <br>
      A phantom remains for a long time after operating of the generator
      so it is necessary to switch on the device into the opposite
      polarity mode to deactivate the phantom presence.<br>
      <br>
      The supply of the generator must be positive in the center of the
      plug; the negative part of supply must be located on the cabinet
      of the generator.<br>

          BIOFEEDBACK SIGNALS BETWEEN THE OPERATOR, THE PATIENT AND THE

      <br>
      A biofeedback diagnostic system includes a central processing and
      telemetry unit and a triggering sensor. The central processing
      unit in turn includes a situation-generating block for producing a
      series of stimuli and transmitting them in parallel to both a
      patient and an operator of the system via a dual peripheral
      device. The stimuli can be of magnetic, audio, visual, or other
      nature. The triggering sensor is designed to remotely acquire the
      patient's feedback to the transmitted stimuli and send a digital
      signal back to the central unit. Two biofeedback loops are formed:
      between the central unit, the patient, and the triggering sensor;
      and between the central unit, the patient, and the operator, who
      is interpreting the test results without involving the conscious
      reaction of the patient.; The triggering sensor includes a noise
      generator to detect the patient's brainwaves and a detector
      channel equipped with a logoperiodic multi-turn spiral antenna to
      further enhance its sensitivity. To improve the patient's
      intuitive response, an optoelectronic element is placed of the
      patient's forehead and illuminated with a laser light at a
      frequency equal to that of the patient's brainwaves theta-rhythm.
      To isolate the torsion component of the laser light, a cavity
      resonator is employed with a volumetric chamber having a size
      being some multiple of the transmission frequency of about 1.45
      GHz.<br>

        </b><b>STEEL STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS CORRECTION METHOD</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      SUBSTANCE: method involves treating steel melt till solid
      crystallization phase by torsion radiation of spectrum of at least
      three characteristic frequencies. Such method may be used for
      manufacture of cast parts, as well as for production of billets
      which may be used for further conversions. EFFECT: wider range of
      changes in physico-mechanical characteristics and improved
      structure of steel.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to the field of metallurgy, in particular to
      the production of steels (ferrous alloys based on iron with a
      carbon content of not more than 2.14%), as well as alloy steels,
      and can be used for the manufacture of both cast parts and for
      casting blanks for Use in subsequent metallurgical operations.<br>
      <br>
      There are known the possibilities of correcting the structural
      characteristics of various materials by exposing them to torsional
      radiation at the characteristic frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, a method is known for correcting the structural
      characteristics of materials, including metals, including metal
      treatment with torsion radiation at the characteristic frequency.<br>
      <br>
      The method allows to change the properties of metals in order to
      obtain their given physicomechanical characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      In this method, the treatment of chemically pure non-ferrous
      metals, such as, for example, tin or copper, is described as
      examples. The treatment is performed by torsion radiation at one
      separate characteristic frequency. For example, for copper after
      treatment with torsion radiation with frequencies of 6 and 100 Hz,
      the structure of the ingot shows an orderly microporosity, the
      size of which varies with the characteristic frequency of the
      torsion radiation source. It is not known from the indicated
      technical solution about the possibility of changing the
      structural characteristics of steel by the torsion field, as well
      as the possibility of changing the physicomechanical
      characteristics of materials due to the effect of torsion
      radiation with several characteristic frequencies at the same
      time. The design of the device intended for carrying out the
      method, although it is capable of generating torsion radiation
      with several frequencies, but this torsion source serves both for
      the direct determination of the values ??of the characteristic
      frequencies by their search, and for studying the structural
      changes introduced into the materials under the action of the
      torsion field on Identified individual characteristic frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The closest technical solution is a method for correcting the
      structural characteristics of steel, including processing the
      steel melt until the formation of its solid crystallization phase
      by torsion.<br>
      <br>
      In this method, a structural reorganization of the steel taken in
      an amount of up to 200 kg was detected when it was exposed to
      torsion radiation from a torsion generator consuming 10 mW of
      electricity. However, the limitation of this method is the
      insufficiently high range of changes in the physicomechanical
      properties of steel.<br>
      <br>
      The problem solved by the invention is an increase in the range of
      changes in the physico-mechanical properties of steel, and an
      improvement in the structure of steel.<br>
      <br>
      The technical result that can be obtained by carrying out the
      invention is to increase the strength, yield strength, elongation,
      relative contraction, impact toughness by decreasing the relative
      content of ferrite, increasing the dispersity and uniform
      distribution of non-metallic inclusions, reducing the average
      grain size and obtaining equilibrium Forms.<br>
      <br>
      In order to achieve the above-mentioned object with the attainment
      of said technical result, in a known method for correcting the
      structural characteristics of steel, including treating the steel
      melt prior to the formation of its solid torsion-phase
      crystallization phase, the melt processing of the steel is
      performed by torsion radiation with a spectrum of at least three
      Characteristic frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Additional embodiments of the method are possible in which it is
      expedient that: each of said characteristic frequencies be
      suitably selected in one of the intervals: 1 Hz to 20 MHz and / or
      20.1 MHz to 200 MHz and / or 200.1 MHz to 2 GHz And / or 2.1 GHz -
      200 GHz; - at least two of these characteristic frequencies were
      simultaneously selected in one of the intervals: 1 Hz-20 MHz or
      20.1 MHz-200 MHz or 200.1 MHz-2 GHz or 2.1 GHz-200 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the effect of torsion radiation on the melt, which
      simultaneously includes several characteristic frequencies in its
      spectrum, it is possible to form a homogeneous structure and
      certain grain sizes, which results in an improvement in the
      complex of physicomechanical properties (strength, yield stress,
      elongation, relative narrowing, Viscosity) of cast steel parts and
      blanks used for further metallurgical operations.<br>
      <br>
      These advantages, as well as the features of the present
      invention, are explained by the best embodiments of the method for
      various steel grades.<br>
      <br>
      The figure shows the functional diagram of the stand for torsion
      treatment of steel melt.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of the action of external torsion radiation on the
      melt, the spin state of a system of free atoms in the melt
      changes. In this state, atoms experience mutual attraction through
      spin-torsion interactions. Due to this mutual attraction, the
      melt, as a spin system, becomes internally stable. As a result,
      the structure of the casting grains for steel after
      crystallization becomes more uniform, the shape of the grains is
      more balanced, and the non-metallic inclusions are evenly
      distributed throughout the casting volume. Internal stability of
      the ingot after crystallization leads to minimization or complete
      absence of macrodefects (cracks, pores, etc.). All these results
      combine to improve the mechanical properties of the steel, which
      can be illustrated by the examples below.<br>
      <br>
      As studies have shown, in the case of steel processing, the use of
      a mono-frequency in the torsion generator as a signal does not
      lead to significant satisfactory results, since only one of any
      melt components has a change in structure. Under the action of
      mono-frequency or strengthen the influence on the overall
      structure of the ingot of this component, or weaken. In addition,
      in the melt there is a spread in the values ??of the natural
      frequencies of the oscillations of atoms of one chemical element
      or of the same type of molecules of chemical compounds, which is
      associated with an uneven distribution of the energy of thermal
      motion. As a result of the experiments it was established that the
      achievement of a more efficient structure change during torsion
      treatment of a melt is feasible in the case of applying a spectrum
      of certain characteristic frequencies for a torsion generator.<br>
      <br>
      For the experiments, an induction melting unit UPI-0.5-3.0-440
      produced by "Reltec", Ekaterinburg, consisting of an induction
      melting furnace IPP-0.5 and a semiconductor frequency converter
      PVG-3-440.<br>
      <br>
      Technical characteristics of the furnace IPP-0.5: Capacity of the
      furnace 0,5 kg Power of the feeding converter 3 kW Power of the
      furnace 2,7 kW Number of phases of the supply network 1 Number of

      Current frequency of the loop 440 kHz Nominal voltage Power supply
      220 V Rated voltage on the inductor 900 V For each steel grade, 10
      control and prototypes weighing 0.15 kg were manufactured.
      Castings after melting were heat treated (normalization at 920oC
      and tempering). The chemical composition of steels 35 L, 45 L, 20
      GFL and 20 GL is given in Table. 1.<br>
      <br>
      Mechanical tests were carried out on cylindrical samples, carved
      from castings, obtained as a result of experimental and control
      melting. The average values from the results of mechanical tests
      of control and prototypes are given in the tables for each grade
      of steel. In all experiments, the torsion beam device (source) was
      located 1 m from the crucible of the induction furnace. The effect
      of torsion radiation on the melt was carried out with
      predetermined components of the line spectrum of the
      characteristic frequencies prior to the start of casting, and this
      treatment processed the melt. For example, one of the generators
      described in [1] or [2] can be used as a source of torsion
      radiation.<br>

      <br>
      Torsion radiation treatment was carried out in accordance with the
      functional scheme of the stand for torsion treatment of steel melt
      (Fig.1), where: 1 - torsion generator; 2 - radiating antenna of
      the torsion generator; 3 - reference radio frequency generators
      f1, f2, ..., fk; 4 - induction furnace; 5 - high-frequency block
      of induction furnace; 6 - power supply network; 7 - inductor; 8 -
      crucible.<br>
      <br>
      It is clear that, in contrast to the described functional scheme,
      steel melt processing can also be performed by torsion radiation
      from individual torsion generators 1 with its radiating antennas
      2, with the radiation of each torsion generator 1 having its
      reference frequency from its reference oscillator 3, and these
      emissions in The same time is processed by the melt in the
      crucible 8. However, such a functional scheme allows to obtain the
      same technical result, but only complicates the design. In
      addition, functional schemes are possible with the conversion of
      the reference frequency, its multiplication or division, which
      does not affect the essence of the claimed method. A feature of
      the method is the treatment of a steel melt with torsion radiation
      containing simultaneously at least three characteristic
      frequencies from a wide frequency range.<br>
      <br>
      To achieve the required physicomechanical properties of the alloys
      (Fig.1), the torsion radiation with a spectrum consisting
      simultaneously of several characteristic frequencies from the
      torsion generator 1 is applied to the melt in the period before
      the change in its aggregate state. As a result of the action of
      torsion radiation on the melt in the crucible 8, the spin
      structure of the material changes, which leads to changes in the
      material properties shown in Table. 2-5. Characteristic
      frequencies are determined experimentally, for example, by
      examining the entire frequency range and choosing from it those
      characteristic frequencies that best satisfy the stated goal of
      the experiment and the required properties of the steel. When a
      pre-determined optimal spectrum of torsion frequencies is used,
      the spin structure induced in the melt forms a stable system.
      Torsion radiation creates torsion generator 1 and is formed due to
      the supply of radio signals to it at frequencies {fl, f2, ..., fk}
      from the reference generators 3 exciting certain characteristic
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The spectrum of characteristic impact frequencies for various
      materials can theoretically be in a very wide range from 1 Hz to
      200 GHz. The frequency spectrum is a characteristic parameter for
      each steel. For steels of different brands, the corresponding
      components of the characteristic frequencies of the entire
      frequency spectrum are determined, which, according to studies,
      can lie in the intervals: 1 interval: 1 Hz - 20 MHz; 2 interval:
      20.1 MHz - 200 MHz; 3 interval: 200.1 MHz - 2 GHz; 4 interval: 2.1
      GHz - 200 GHz, and in accordance with the specific purpose of
      processing spectral components in some intervals may be absent.<br>
      <br>
      It is a feature of the present invention that torsional radiation
      with certain characteristic frequencies in each individual
      interval mentioned is selected for treating the melt of steel, and
      practice shows that in most cases it is expedient to select a line
      spectrum. In addition, studies have shown that a given correction
      of steel parameters can be obtained when each of said
      characteristic frequencies is suitably selected in one of the
      intervals: 1 Hz to 20 MHz; 20.1 MHz - 200 MHz; 200.1 MHz - 2 GHz;
      2.1 GHz - 200 GHz. Additionally, at least two of these
      characteristic frequencies can be simultaneously selected in one
      of the intervals: 1 Hz-20 MHz or 20.1 MHz-200 MHz or 200.1 MHz-2
      GHz or 2.1 GHz-200 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      Characteristic frequencies for specific chemical compositions of
      steels can lie, for example, on the edges of various frequency
      bands of intervals, in addition, in a number of situations it is
      necessary to form broadband noise rather than narrowband
      characteristic frequencies on specific frequency bands of
      intervals. For each particular impurity composition, the formation
      of the structure at the grain level, for example, their grinding,
      depends on the correct choice of the combination of the exposure
      time and the spectrum of the characteristic frequencies. At the
      same time, the changes in the crystal lattice depend mainly on the
      spectrum of the characteristic frequencies and, to a lesser
      extent, on the time of the action.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, torsion radiation with characteristic frequencies
      of 10.5 Hz, 3 MHz, 50 MHz, 400 MHz, 1.3 GHz, and 20 GHz was used
      to treat the melt of 35 L steel and 45 L steel.<br>
      <br>
      The duration of the torsion action on the melt is determined by
      the requirements for the parameters of the resulting metal and can
      range from 1 millisecond to 1 hour. In this case, the lower bound
      of the exposure time is determined by the minimum required
      specific (per unit volume) spin melt polarization (polarization
      with respect to the classical spin). The maximum time of the
      exposure interval is determined by saturation in the spin
      polarization of the composition of the entire volume of the
      material.<br>
      <br>
      As shown by practical studies, when choosing frequencies from the
      frequency interval of less than 1 Hz, there is no significant
      change in the physico-mechanical properties of the steels. In
      turn, the use of frequencies from an interval above 200 GHz is
      economically impractical.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of the experiments, samples with structural and
      mechanical characteristics were obtained: Experiment 1.<br>
      <br>
      Steel 35 L (see Table. 2).<br>
      Experience 2.<br>
      <br>
      Steel 45 L (see Table. 3).<br>

      Steel 20 HFP (see Table. 4) Experience 4.<br>
      <br>
      Steel 20 GL (see Table. 5).<br>
      <br>
      As a result of the treatment of melts with torsional radiation
      simultaneously with several characteristic frequencies, the
      following main results were obtained: for steel 45, an increase in
      the yield stress st by 10.2%, a time limit of s s of 8.3%, grain
      size decreased by 1 point, cementite from lamellar became
      granular-lamellar; For steel 35 L - experiment 1: an increase in
      the yield stress st by 7.9%, a time limit of ss in 4.8%, the grain
      size decreased by 1 point, cementite from the lamellar became
      granular-lamellar; Experiment 2: an increase in the yield stress
      st by 13.7%, a time limit of s s of 10.6%, the grain size
      decreased by 2 points, the cementite from the lamellar became
      granular-lamellar; For steel 20 HFL, an increase in the yield
      strength of st by 7.4%, a time limit of s of 9.8%. The grain size
      decreased by 1 point, cementite from the lamellar becomes
      granular-lamellar; For steel 20 GL - an increase in the yield
      stress st by 8.7%, the limit of the time resistance s in 9.2%, the
      grain size decreased by 2 points, the cementite from the lamellar
      becomes granular-lamellar; When processing with torsion radiation
      using mono-frequency alone, rather than previously known methods
      for treating chemically pure non-ferrous metals or steels, as
      studies have shown for these steel grades, with some change in the
      structure (in particular, the average grain size), there is no
      appreciable change in the mechanical properties of steels (Table.<br>
      <br>
      From a comparison of control and experimental samples, it can be
      seen that as a result of the application of the torsion radiation
      treatment of the melt, the following changes in the characteristic
      frequencies have occurred: a decrease in the grain size by 1-2
      points; Instead of the lamellar form, granular (globular)
      cementite predominates; The size of globules of cementite is 1-3
      µm; Perlite is located along the boundaries of ferrite grains. In
      addition, the grains become more rounded. Nonmetallic inclusions
      are distributed more evenly, and the dispersity of nonmetallic
      inclusions increases. In the experimental samples, the number of
      nonmetallic inclusions along the grain boundaries averages about
      45%, while in the control samples, about 75%. As a result, the
      yield strength and ultimate strength of the steel increase.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, when tungsten radiation is processed by a melt of steel with
      several characteristic frequencies, the improvement in mechanical
      properties is achieved by reducing the grain sizes to 8-9 points
      (while in the control samples of grain 7-8 points), more
      equilibrium forms of grains, increasing the dispersion and more
      uniform distribution of nonmetallic inclusions.<br>
      <br>
      The most successful way to correct the structural characteristics
      of steel can be used in the metallurgical industry to produce
      steels with given physical and mechanical properties and with the
      improvement of their structure.<br>

        <b>METHOD OF CORRECTION OF MICROSTRUCTURE OF METAL CASTING
          ALLOYS</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      FIELD: metallurgy, more specifically, methods for correction of
      microstructure in production of aluminium-base alloys with high
      mechanical and physical properties. SUBSTANCE: method consists in
      that in course of its melting and/or crystallization, alloy is
      exposed to torsion field with radiation frequency within the range
      from medium to extremely high ones. EFFECT: higher mechanical and
      physical properties of alloy of aluminium-silicon system due to
      reduced sizes of silicon crystals by 10 times. <br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to the creation of alloys with increased
      physical and mechanical properties due to the correction of the
      microstructure of the metal in the melting and crystallization
      process.<br>
      <br>
      There are known methods of changing the microstructure of alloys
      that affect the increase in their physicomechanical properties, by
      modifying various components in the melting process. In
      particular, a method is known for modifying the aluminum-silicon
      system by sodium and strontium eutectic aluminum alloy <br>
      <br>
      However, the use of methods for modifying alloys in metallurgical
      production by other elements creates technological, economic and
      environmental problems.<br>
      <br>
      A method for correcting the structure of the characteristics of
      materials is known [2], which consists in the action of a torsion
      field on the material. <br>
      <br>
      Examples of exposure to this field with a radiation frequency of 6
      and 1000 Hz on copper and tin melts during their crystallization
      have shown the possibility of changing the microstructure of the
      metal and increasing its mechanical properties. Thus, the
      microstructure of copper is obtained by ultradispersed, amorphous,
      and the hardness of tin is increased by 1.5 times.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of the known correction method is the fact that
      under the influence of torsion radiation in the above frequency
      range on the liquid metal, there is an insignificant ordering of
      the nuclear spins of the atoms of the individual components of the
      alloy, which has little effect on the change in the microstructure
      of the alloy and the increase in its physico-mechanical
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      The object of the invention is to increase the physical and
      mechanical properties of metal casting alloys, preferably aluminum
      alloys.<br>
      <br>
      The task is solved due to the fact that the alloy during its
      melting and / or / crystallization is affected by a torsion field
      with a radiation frequency in the ranges from medium to extremely
      high frequencies. These frequency bands are determined from the
      theoretical prerequisites of the greatest influence of torsion
      radiation on the ordering of the atoms of the alloy components due
      to the action of the spin moments of the atomic nuclei with an
      external torsion field and are confirmed experimentally. The
      positive result of the action on the alloy by the torsion field,
      both in the melting and crystallization process, and only during
      melting or crystallization is determined experimentally.<br>
      <br>
      The carried out investigations of the aluminum-based alloy
      additionally showed that after the treatment of the alloy with a
      torsion field, there is a decrease in the electrical resistance of
      the metal.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="ru2107105.JPG" alt="" width="489"
          height="154"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Example. The aluminum-based eutectic alloy with a calculated
      silicon content of 12% by weight was melted in an induction
      furnace at 800 ° C, followed by pouring the metal into a container
      (chill) heated to 300 ° C. Weight of melting: 2 kg. Two ingots
      with a diameter of 50 mm and a height of 115 mm were cast from
      each melting. Ten ingots were cast in total, one of which was
      control and was irradiated with a torsion field with a frequency
      of 100 Hz, the remaining ingots were exposed to a torsion field
      with frequencies in the declared ranges. The effect of the torsion
      field was made with the help of broadband generators similar in
      design to the generator given in the information source [2]. The
      time of action of the torsion field on the alloy during its
      melting and / or crystallization depends on the chemical
      composition of the alloy, the mass of the liquid metal or ingot,
      the duration of crystallization, and the like. In this particular
      example, the exposure time to the alloy in the melting unit was 15
      minutes and during the crystallization process it was 10 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      To determine the physical and mechanical properties of the alloy,
      standard samples were cut from each ingot, tested for strength,
      plasticity, toughness, electrical conductivity, and microstructure
      studies of the alloy. The parameters of the effect on the alloy by
      the torsion field and the result of the tests are given in the
      table.<br>
      <br>
      An analysis of the results of the tests shows that the effect on
      the alloy of the torsion field in the claimed frequency ranges
      makes it possible to substantially increase its physico-mechanical
      characteristics in comparison with the similar effect by 20%, the
      ductility has been increased almost twofold, the impact resistance
      has increased 1.3 times, the specific The electrical resistance
      decreased by 11%. The achieved improvement in physical and
      mechanical properties is due to a decrease in the silicon crystals
      in the microstructure of the aluminum alloy by almost 10 times.<br>
      <br>
      The implementation of the invention opens wide opportunities for
      the production of cast alloys with increased physical and
      mechanical properties without using traditional methods to improve
      the properties of alloys by metallurgical modification.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to a method, apparatus, and system for
      reducing stress in an individual.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Background of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The increasing complexity and population density of our society
      seems to be increasingly conducive to the creation of stress in
      the population. There has appeared, therefore, a growing need to
      identify more effective means of alleviating stress, and as a
      result a variety of new therapies and technologies for dealing
      with stress have surfaced over the past century.<br>
      <br>
      Stress is viewed as the cause of many forms of unhappiness in
      people, such as irritability, depression, anger, emotional
      instability, withdrawal, restlessness, anxiety and frustration,
      and dysfunction in all living beings. The link between stress and
      health is well known. The Journal of Occupational and
      Environmental Medicine observes that health care expenditures are
      nearly 50% greater for workers who report high levels of stress.
      Medical symptoms widely attributed to stress include increased
      heart rate and blood pressure, headache, nausea, indigestion, and
      insomnia. In fact, the onslaught of disease more generally is
      increasingly being related to stress. The American Institute of
      Stress, founded in 1978 by such notables as Linus Pauling, Alvin
      Toffler, Herbert Benson, and numerous other prominent scientists
      and physicians, currently describes stress as "America's No. 1
      health problem." In answer to the question as to how stress can
      cause so many diseases, the Institute states, "many of these
      effects are due to increased sympathetic nervous system activity."<br>
      <br>
      It is well known that stress can be relieved in humans by rest,
      and by resorting to natural environments such as lakes, seashores,
      mountains, gardens, and forests. It is also well known that spas,
      soft lights and certain types of sound or music can relieve
      stress. In some cases light and color have been observed to have
      benefits with respect to both stress alleviation and healing.
      Spectro-Chrome, a colored light therapy introduced in 1920 by
      Dinshah Ghadiali, developed an impressive array of successes in
      healing a wide range of diseases over a thirty year period. Sound
      healing CDs have been produced by Andrew Weil, M.D., founder of
      the Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona,
      and Mitchell Gaynor, M.D., founder and president of Gaynor
      Integrative Oncology in New York City.<br>
      <br>
      A device invented and patented by Barry McNew (U.S. Patent No.
      6,544,165) uses a combination of music and light to accomplish
      stress reduction and healing. An individual lies in a horizontal
      cabinet designed to resonate with sound corresponding to a B minor
      (C flat minor) chord. Successful clinical results for this device
      are described in the Proceedings of the First Interdisciplinary
      International Conference on the Science of Whole Person Healing.
      McNew's device is specifically described as being directed at
      balancing the sympathetic and parasympathetic elements of the
      autonomic nervous system. McNew's international patent
      application, published under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (WO
      2005/058144 &amp; PCT/US2004/042451), describes the use of indicia
      such as involuntary eye or foot movements as references for the
      operator in adjusting sound and light inputs to the device to
      accomplish balancing the environment within the device to achieve
      the desired effect. Destressing is specifically claimed as an
      attribute of the device, with supporting evidence being
      accumulated on numerous subjects using HRV monitoring before and
      after exposure to the device. A typical exposure of an individual
      in the device is described as one hour at a session.<br>
      <br>
      The past two decades have seen an increasing recognition by
      scientists of the existence of a new fundamental field in physics
      beyond the long recognized electrical, magnetic, gravitational,
      and strong and weak nuclear attraction fields, namely, the
      informational field (IF), with characteristics unique as compared
      with the classical fields. An example of an informational field is
      shown in the conservation of twin photons in entanglement
      experiments, where the transfer of information necessary to
      conserve spin can happen without energetic properties.<br>
      <br>
      This more newly recognized field has been described by other names
      as well, such as torsion field, spin field, and informational spin
      field. The seminal work in understanding and demonstrating the
      reality of informational fields was done in the former Soviet
      Union by Russian physicist Anatoly E. Akimov, a coinventor of the
      present invention, and Russian theoretical physicist Gennady I.
      Shipov, both of the International Institute of Theoretical and
      Applied Physics of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences. A
      summary of the theory and numerous technologies created as a
      result of this discovery appears in Dr. Akimov's paper delivered
      in Moscow in 2000, entitled, Horizons of XXI Century Science and
      Technologies. A description of the mathematical basis further
      elaborating and supporting the theory is described in Dr. Shipov's
      book, A Theory of Physical Vacuum-A New Paradigm, published in
      Russian in 1993, and in English in 1998.<br>
      <br>
      In the experimental work with informational spin fields (ISFs),
      ISFs were found to have different properties than known classical
      fields. For example, they do not decrease with distance, as all of
      the other known fields do, according to the inverse square law.
      ISFs have a spatial structure corresponding to axial symmetry.
      Objects with like (left-oriented or right-oriented) spins attract,
      unlike objects with like electrical charges, which repel. ISFs are
      capable of spin-polarizing space, such that even when a source of
      an ISF is removed, the space where the field was tends to retain
      its ISF-influenced state for a period of time.<br>
      <br>
      Informational spin fields have the ability to affect matter under
      certain circumstances, especially in materials undergoing a phase
      change, and tend to influence the alignment of electron, nuclear,
      and atomic spins. This fact was verified by experiments carried
      out in the Soviet Union using the Mossbauer Effect. In this
      effect, the only known interaction with the material under
      investigation is through spin, and the ISF created by devices
      designed by Anatoly Akimov did affect the materials. Thus, it was
      proven that these informational fields relate to spin, which is
      why the term "spin" is being included in the name of these
      informational fields described herein.<br>
      <br>
      It is presently postulated by some scientists that ISFs carry
      information, and can impart that information to matter in the form
      of phase information associated with varying degrees in the
      precession of spins. Experiments by Dr. Akimov and others show
      that ISFs can, under certain circumstances, affect crystal
      structure and molecular structure, and consequently physical
      properties, in materials.<br>
      <br>
      Informational spin fields are known to be generated in numerous
      ways. Statically generated ISFs occur inherently with physical
      geometry. For example, stationary objects, such as spheres, cones,
      cylinders, and tetrahedrons, all generate static ISFs. The
      intensity of static ISFs increases with specific ratios in the
      geometry of the object, such as, for example, the phi ratio of
      approximately 1.618, as well as with the increasing size of the
      object.<br>
      <br>
      Dynamically generated ISFs are produced by bodies with angular
      motion, for example, rotating spheres and nuclear and atomic
      particles. Dynamically generated ISFs are produced by
      electromagnetic radiation as well, such as by light and by
      rotating magnetic fields. An example of an ISF created when
      rotating a magnet about an axis is illustrated in a device
      presently produced in Kazakhstan and marketed internationally by
      Alexander A. Shpilman. Dynamically generated ISFs can also be
      produced by combinations of geometry and changing electromagnetic
      fields. Soviet patent No. 1748662 patenting such a device together
      with its use in modifying the properties of materials was issued
      in 1992 with priority since 1990 to Anatoly Akimov et al.<br>
      <br>
      The existence of biofields surrounding living beings has been
      established by scientists over the past several decades. Valerie
      Hunt, a Professor Emeritus of UCLA, was able use the patterns in
      electromyograph signals to consistently correlate patterns in the
      human biofield observed by individuals who could directly perceive
      them. The results of her 25 years of research and clinical studies
      demonstrating these results were presented in 1989 in her book,
      Infinite Mind. More recently, Konstantin Korotkov, Professor of
      Physics at St. Petersburg State Technical University in Russia,
      introduced a commercial device using a Gas Discharge Visualization
      (GDV) technique (Kirlian method), and is also able to correlate
      parameters measured by that device with those patterns observed by
      individuals who could directly perceive the human biofield. The
      GDV device outputs have successfully correlated with the real time
      introduction of stimulation to human subjects experiencing aromas,
      physical injury, and other stimuli. Biofields themselves appear to
      be informational spin fields, based upon research observations of
      Dr. Anatoly Akimov correlating images of biofields observed by
      individuals who could directly perceive them, with their direct
      perceptions of the outputs of dynamic ISF generators.<br>

      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention mitigates stress in individuals and improves
      the efficiency of stress alleviation afforded by other available
      environments and techniques. The present invention provides a
      device, system, apparatus and method for reducing stress in an
      individual by creating an enhanced informational spin field
      environment substantially surrounding the individual. The term
      "informational spin field" or "ISF," as used herein, refers to a
      field also commonly known as a torsion field.<br>
      <br>
      In embodiments of the present invention, an apparatus for
      destressing is provided that is configured to temporarily
      accommodate an individual, preferably such that the individual can
      assume a resting position. The apparatus is configured with a
      series of elements whose geometrical arrangement corresponds to a
      predetermined pattern. In one example, the apparatus comprises a
      support structure configured to act as a bed and two end
      structures joined to and orthogonal to the bed. In one embodiment
      of the present invention, the end structures each comprise
      multiple layers of electrically insulating material, such as wood.
      In embodiments of the present invention, a pattern of metallic
      tape, such as copper, is laminated between each wood layers
      comprising each end structure. In one embodiment of the present
      invention, the pattern of the copper tape comprises a six-pointed
      star geometry comprised of two superposed equilateral triangles,
      also know as a Star of David. Preferably, the patterns are
      arranged opposite each other such that each apex of a star pattern
      can be connected to a corresponding apex by a conductive member
      that is mutually orthogonal to both end structures. In one
      embodiment of the present invention, each end structure comprises
      a trilayer assemblage of wood layers, in which the middle layer
      includes a metallic tape pattern affixed thereto.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the end members are
      joined to each other by a series of six metallic tubes that are
      substantially orthogonal to each of the end members. Preferably,
      the orthogonal metallic tubes are mutually arranged to each
      interconnect a point of a metallic Star of David that is laminated
      between outer and inner boards of an end structure with a
      corresponding point in a similar structure on the opposite end
      member. The laminated Star of David pattern may be affixed to a
      middle board of trilayer structure, or alternatively may be at the
      interface of an inner and outer board of a bilayer end structure.
      Preferably, six metallic tubes are arranged to interconnect all
      six apices of a metallic Star pattern located in a first end
      structure with a corresponding six apices in a metallic Star
      pattern located in the opposite end structure to the first end
      structure. Accordingly, an individual resting on a bed disposed
      between the end structures lies within a hexagonal prism whose
      long edges parallel to the cylinder axis are defined by the
      metallic pipes.<br>
      <br>
      In embodiments of the present invention, the apparatus for
      destressing further includes a hexagonal projector located in an
      upper portion of the apparatus and configured with a series of six
      cones. Preferably, the hexagonal projector is configured to slide
      in a direction parallel to the bed structure. Preferably, the
      destressing apparatus also includes a ball radiator that includes
      a small metallic sphere that is configured to slide in a direction
      parallel to that of the hexagonal projector.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the above-described elements, a static
      informational spin field environment can be provided in a spatial
      region designed to accommodate individuals of varying size within
      the destressing apparatus. Once substantially inside a region
      corresponding to the hexagonal prism, the static ISF environment
      created by the destressing apparatus efficiently interacts with
      the biofield of the individual, such that a destressing process is
      initiated.<br>
      <br>
      In other embodiments of the present invention, the disclosed
      device, system, apparatus and method provide an informational spin
      field environment substantially surrounding an individual which is
      at least partially derived from one or more dynamically produced
      informational spin fields, wherein electromagnetic components
      associated with producing one or more of such dynamically produced
      informational spin fields have first been substantially separated
      therefrom, such one or more dynamically produced informational
      spin fields being then conducted to the environment substantially
      surrounding the individual. The term "dynamically produced
      informational spin field," as used herein, refers to an ISF that
      is produced at least in part from the time-dependent variation of
      an entity, such as a varying magnetically-induced spin field,
      electromagnetic signal, electromagnetic current, or
      electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      In embodiments of the present invention, an apparatus is
      configured to establish an ISF environment in a region configured
      to accommodate a resting individual, wherein the ISF environment
      comprises a dynamically produced informational spin field
      resulting predominantly or in whole from inputs from a magnetic,
      electric, or electromagnetic source. In other embodiments of the
      present invention, the ISF environment is created by a combination
      of elements configured to generate static ISFs together with
      sources that serve to generate one or more dynamic ISFs, such as
      electromagnetic, magnetic, or electrical signals.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a system for alleviating or
      reducing stress in an individual comprising an informational spin
      field environment substantially surrounding an individual, which
      is at least partially derived from one or more dynamically
      produced informational spin fields, wherein electromagnetic
      components associated with producing one or more of such
      dynamically produced informational spin fields have first been
      substantially blocked from propagating with the informational spin
      field produced therefrom, such one or more dynamically produced
      informational spin fields being then conducted without any
      accompanying electromagnetic field to the environment
      substantially surrounding the individual.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also provides a method for alleviating or
      reducing stress in an individual, comprising providing an
      informational spin field environment substantially surrounding
      such individual, which is at least partially derived from one or
      more dynamically produced informational spin fields, wherein
      electromagnetic components associated with producing one or more
      of such dynamically produced informational spin fields have first
      been substantially separated blocked from propagating with the
      informational spin field produced therefrom, such one or more
      dynamically produced informational spin fields being then
      conducted without any accompanying electromagnetic field to the
      environment substantially surrounding the individual.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the dynamically
      produced informational spin field source utilizes an
      electromagnetic signal to generate an informational spin field,
      wherein the electromagnetic signal itself is substantially
      separated from the informational spin field produced therefrom,
      said informational spin field produced therefrom being then
      conducted to the environment substantially surrounding the
      individual. In one embodiment of the present invention, the
      dynamic informational spin field source utilizes an
      electromagnetic signal derived from a musical sound input to
      generate an informational spin field, wherein the electromagnetic
      signal itself is substantially blocked from propagating with the
      informational spin field produced therefrom, said informational
      spin field produced therefrom being then conducted without any
      accompanying electromagnetic field to the environment
      substantially surrounding the individual.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the dynamic
      informational spin field source utilizes an electrical signal from
      a compact disk (CD) or magnetic tape player to generate an
      informational spin field, wherein the electromagnetic components
      of the electrical signal itself are substantially blocked from
      propagating along with the informational spin field produced
      therefrom, wherein the informational spin field produced therefrom
      is conducted to the environment substantially surrounding the
      individual without accompanying electromagnetic radiation or
      electric signals.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the informational spin
      field environment is at least partially derived from one or more
      light sources wherein the electromagnetic components of the light
      emitted therefrom are substantially blocked from propagating with
      the informational spin field produced by the light, said
      informational spin field being then conducted without accompanying
      light to the environment substantially surrounding the individual.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, means are provided to
      modify and/or adjust the informational spin field environment in
      either composition or intensity or both so as to be made
      harmonious for an individual substantially surrounded by such
      environment. In one embodiment, the informational spin field of
      the present invention is modified and/or adjusted in either
      composition or intensity or both in response to one or more
      autonomic responses of the individual substantially surrounded by
      said informational spin field environment so as to make it
      harmonious for said individual.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the informational spin
      field environment is partially derived from one or more statically
      generated informational spin fields.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, means are provided to
      cause the primary localization of the information spin field
      environment within the vicinity of the individual.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, either music or light
      is additionally provided to the individual directly in order to
      provide an aesthetic benefit.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention offers the potential of improved efficiency
      as compared to means of achieving stress reduction by the
      practices of the prior art. Significantly positive results are
      observable in 15 to 30 minutes exposure to the informational spin
      field environment of the present invention. In a society in which
      the time to deal with one's own needs is frequently scarce, this
      advantage of the present invention is very important. Moreover,
      this feature offers the possibility for commercial employers to
      provide the benefit of such a device to employees in the work
      environment to improve morale and productivity, since the economic
      return in terms of increased worker efficiency does not have to be
      very large to justify perhaps only a 15-minute break exposure to
      the environment of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is
      believed that all destressing environments owe their effects to
      the presence of ISFs. Unlike the case with music and light healing
      environments, in which the inputs to such environments are
      acoustic and electromagnetic, any ISF intensity of such
      environments must be limited to lower levels because of potential
      discomfort or even harm to an individual at high levels of sound
      or light exposure. By virtue of the ability to prevent
      electromagnetic and acoustic signals from propagating in the
      environment surrounding an individual, the present invention
      provides a means to achieve higher ISF levels in the immediate
      physical surroundings of an individual without the need to incur
      high levels of electromagnetic radiation or acoustic signals in
      the same physical surroundings. This facilitates optimizing the
      destressing effect within a minimum of time without introducing
      unwanted or negative side effects of excessive electromagnetic or
      acoustic energy near the individual. Moreover, acoustic or
      electromagnetic components can in themselves create unwanted
      interactions in certain instances. The feature of the present
      invention of minimizing or eliminating any acoustic inputs and
      filtering out electromagnetic components from ISF inputs to the
      environment substantially surrounding the individual permits the
      creation of effects on the individual that are solely positive,
      and therefore adds to the efficiency of achieving the destressing
      result.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike certain therapies, such as spas, hot tubs and saunas, which
      produce relaxation and stress alleviation at the expense of
      creating lethargy, individuals exposed to the informational spin
      field environment of the present invention report feeling
      energized, yet relaxed.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it appears
      that the device, system, apparatus and method of the present
      invention results in an ISF flow that circulates in the
      informational spin field environment substantially surrounding an
      individual. Such flow does not appear to require direct contact
      with the individual substantially within such environment in order
      to occur. For example, although a foot paddle is provided in one
      embodiment of the present invention depicted in FIG. 1, contact of
      the individual with the foot paddle does not appear to be
      required, although the flows appear somewhat more intensive when
      contact of the feet with the paddles is employed, with or without
      socks, as reported by individuals experiencing the environment,
      based on their perceptions.<br>
      <br>
      One aspect of the device, system, apparatus and method of the
      present invention provides means for enhancing an informational
      spin field environment substantially surrounding the individual.
      Biofields themselves appear to be informational spin fields
      surrounding all living beings. The present invention reduces
      stress in an individual by creating an enhanced informational spin
      field environment substantially surrounding the individual. This
      facilitates the process in which an individual changes his or her
      own biofield in a manner that serves to reduce stress.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, in an embodiment of the device, system, apparatus
      and method of the present invention, the dynamic ISF input or
      inputs are provided in a manner in which they are harmonious to
      the individual at the time of the individual's presence
      substantially within the enhanced informational spin field
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 depicts one embodiment of an apparatus in accordance with
      the present invention. In that embodiment, copper tubes and copper
      tape are provided in a geometric configuration that localizes an
      ISF environment substantially surrounding the individual within
      the main support assembly thereof.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2a is a schematic perspective view of a system 400 for
      destressing, in accordance with an embodiment of the present
      invention. System 400 includes a bed 402 that is affixed at each
      end to end members 404 and 406.<br>
      <br>
      As depicted in FIG. 2d, end members 404 and 406 each comprise a
      trilayer structure, 404a, 404b, 404c and 406a, 406b, 406c
      respectively, which preferably comprises a wood-based material.
      Sandwiched between outer layer 404a (or 406a) and inner layer 404c
      (or 406c) is a layer 406b that preferably includes a wood
      substrate to which is affixed a star pattern 408, preferably
      comprising metallic tape such as copper tape (e.g., [1/2] inch
      wide and 0.0015 inches thick, with self-adhesive). Star pattern
      408 comprises a pair of overlapping and oppositely facing
      triangles each approximately equilateral and arranged so that the
      six corners of the overlapping triangles form the points of a
      regular hexagon having equal sides. Such a star pattern is
      commonly referred to as a Star of David pattern. In the example
      shown, each of the six star apices 410 is connected to a
      longitudinal member (tube) 412 (see FIG. 2a) that in turn connects
      that apex with a corresponding apex in the opposite star pattern.
      The longitudinal members are designed to conduct ISF fields and
      can comprise a solid metal, insulator, or other material.
      Longitudinal members 412, also referred to as tubes, may be, for
      example, solid bars, hollow cylinders, or cylinders containing
      solid inserts. Preferably, each tube 412 comprises an outer metal
      tube (not separately shown), such as copper and further includes a
      supporting wooden dowel (not shown) within the metal tube. The
      tubes 412 are arranged to be substantially orthogonal to the
      planes of end members 404 and 406. Thus, tubes 412 are mutually
      arranged in a hexagonal array as viewed along the axis of the
      tubes. This arrangement serves to define a larger hexagonal prism
      space 414, as illustrated in FIG. 2b. The base edges 415 of the
      prism space are defined by connecting adjacent star apices 410 and
      are all identical in length. The length of the prism space is
      equivalent to the physical separation of opposing star surfaces
      whose apices are the points of each prism base. The height and
      relative lateral position of bed 402 is configured such that an
      individual lying on bed 402 is substantially or wholly within the
      space defined by prism space 414, as illustrated in FIG. 2a.<br>
      <br>
      The metallic tubes 412, together with metallic tape patterns 408
      are configured to establish and direct an ISF environment
      particularly within the region defined by prism space 414,
      although ISFs can extend into the region outside of prism space
      414. In one embodiment of the present invention, the metallic tube
      length between opposing star surfaces embedded within members 404
      and 406 is 88 inches.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2c illustrates details of end structure 404, in accordance
      with one embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment of
      the present invention, each of layers 404a, 404b, and 404c have
      the shape of a hexagon, save for protrusion 404d on the top
      portion of 404c. Layer 404c also has an opening that accommodates
      cone structure 404e (discussed further below) that is configured
      to direct ISFs into the foot area of an individual lying on bed
      402. End structure 406 is preferably configured substantially the
      same as end structure 404, except that cone structure 404e is not
      present in end structure 406.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2e illustrates details of a star shaped metallic tape pattern
      408 and collector 416, in accordance with an embodiment of the
      present invention. Star pattern 408 is affixed to panel 404b on a
      surface that is inwardly disposed toward the region where an
      individual lies on bed 402. Collector 416 comprises cone structure
      404e and star plate 418, depicted more clearly in FIG. 2f. Cone
      404e is configured to couple to a foot panel or foot paddles,
      described in more detail with respect to FIGS. 7a and 7b. Cone
      404e is affixed to star plate 418, which in turn is affixed to
      radial pattern 420. As depicted in FIG. 2f, pattern 420 is affixed
      to the side of panel 404b opposite to that which star pattern 408
      is affixed, and preferably comprises metallic tape similar to or
      the same as that used for star pattern 408. Thus, collector 416
      serves to collect ISF fields that are distributed along metallic
      tubes 412 and direct them to cone 404e, which itself is configured
      to couple to foot panels or foot paddles to direct fields into the
      lower extremities of an individual lying on bed 402.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the distance from
      opposite points on hexagonal panels 404a, 404b, and 404c is 42
      inches, the length of a vertical panel side is 22 inches, the
      length of non-vertical panel sides is 21 inches, the distance
      between next nearest neighboring apices in star pattern 408 (i.e.,
      the distance between two vertices of one of the two large
      triangles that make up the star pattern) is 33 inches, and the
      width of panels 404a, 404b, and 404c is 37 inches. The 33''
      alternate point to point dimension of the stars, as well as the
      88'' dimension between opposing star surfaces are preferred
      dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2g illustrates details of collector star plate 418, in
      accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Star
      plate 418 preferably comprises a regular hexagon whose sides each
      define the base of a phi ratio triangle. In one example, the base
      of the phi ratio triangle is 0.92 inches, the height is 0.66
      inches, and the metal thickness is 0.005 inches (e.g., annealed
      copper sheet). Holes (e.g., approximately 1/16 inch in diameter)
      are provided about 0.375 inches from each triangle apex to provide
      openings for a fastener (not shown) to fasten the plate to members
      of radial pattern 420.<br>
      <br>
      As depicted in FIG. 2h, collector 416 is disposed above bed 402
      and in the center of hexagonal prism 414. Also shown in FIG. 2h is
      projector 422 which is configured to project ISFs from a top
      region of apparatus 402 (see also FIG. 2a), as discussed below
      with respect to FIGS. 21a-d. FIG. 2h also shows how the metallic
      tape connects to the six tubes. In one embodiment, the tubes are
      copper tubes, the ends of which are disposed in copper cap sockets
      (e.g., 1 inch copper sweat caps) whose bases are secured (e.g.,
      riveted) to the middle panel (e.g., panel 404b) of the end
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2i depicts details of inner panel 404c in accordance with an
      embodiment of the present invention. As shown, panel 404c is
      configured with six 1.25 inch diameter holes to accommodate metal
      tubes 412. Panel 404c also includes a central hole having a 2.125
      inch diameter that is used to clamp cone structure 404e to star
      plate 418 when panels 404c and 404b are joined together. Panel
      404c also includes a slot to one of the six 1.25 inch diameter
      holes so that a tube 412 can be removed and replaced, to permit
      ingress and egress by an individual.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2j depicts details of an outer panel, which can be outer
      panel 404a or 406a, in accordance with one embodiment of the
      present invention. Preferably, a pattern of four carriage bolt
      holes is provided in a lower portion of panel 404a to allow
      bolting to bed 402, discussed further below with respect to FIG.
      5, while a pattern of two bolt holes is provided in a top portion
      of panel 404c for fastening to a top assembly 424 (see FIG. 2a),
      discussed further below with respect to FIG. 6.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 illustrates details of bed 402, in accordance with one
      embodiment of the present invention. Bed 402 includes feet 402a
      and horizontal member 402b. Bed 402 is supported by cross braces
      402c and long braces 402d. Bed 402 is configured to be flush with
      the inner panels 404c and 406c when assembled into system 400.
      Accordingly, end structures 404 and 406 are supported by feet
      402a, as illustrated in FIG. 2a and 2j. The outer cross braces
      402c bolt to the end structures via the carriage bolt locations
      shown in FIG. 2j. Bed 402 can be made of, for example, birch
      plywood. Although bed 402 is shown as containing legs, as an
      alternative, the bed could be supported by the end members, as
      shown for bed 202 of FIG. 2k.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 illustrates further details of top assembly 424, in
      accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Assembly
      424 includes top surface 424a, cross braces 424b, and side pieces
      424c. In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 22b, side pieces 424c
      each include an aluminum track 424d that acts to guide projector
      422 in a horizontal plane.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 7a illustrates a foot assembly 440 that can be coupled to
      collector 416, in accordance with one embodiment of the present
      invention. Foot assembly 440 comprises a pair of foot paddles 442
      that preferably include a silver sheet on front surface 444. Feet
      can be secured to the paddles with fasteners 446 (e.g., a strap
      with a hook and loop fastener). Cord 448, disposed on the back of
      foot assembly 440, couples paddles 442 to a collector, such as
      collector 416 illustrated above. Referring again to FIG. 2a,
      paddles 442 are configured so that an ISF established along
      metallic tubes 412 can be conducted to the lower extremity region
      of an individual in bed 402.<br>
      <br>
      As illustrated in FIG. 2a, and further in FIG. 21a, system 400
      also includes a hexagonal assembly (projector) 422, which can be
      used to provide an ISF environment inside structure 402. In one
      embodiment of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 21a,
      hexagonal projector 422 is configured with a series of six
      cylindrical cones 422a, preferably mutually arranged so that their
      cone axes all converge upon a point. Preferably, cones 422a are
      phi ratio cones in which the ratio of base to height is about
      1.618. In one embodiment, illustrated in FIG. 2a, the hexagonal
      assembly 422 is configured such that the axes of all cones
      converge at a point (not shown) above bed 402. In embodiments of
      the present invention, discussed further below, hexagonal
      projector 422 is slidable in the longitudinal direction of tubes
      412, such that the convergence point can be positioned above a
      specific region, such as the heart chakra of an individual resting
      on bed 402. The arrangement of cones 422a is such that the base of
      each cone is downwardly disposed (closer to bed 402) with respect
      to the cone apex. Accordingly, any static ISF generated within the
      interior of a cone 422 and projected downwardly toward an
      individual lying below, is a left handed ISF. As illustrated
      further in FIG. 21b, distribution assembly 422b is disposed along
      the central axis of hexagonal projector 422 and comprises a
      hexagonal star plate 422c the same as or similar to collector
      plate 418 of FIG. 2g. Star plate 422c is coupled through wires
      422d to each of the six outer cones 422a. Cylindrical cone 422e is
      clamped to star plate 422c using gasket 422f, which is affixed to
      a main body of projector 422 using a series of three bolt holes.
      Gasket 422f holds cone 422e down, centered on star plate 422c. In
      one embodiment, the main body is made of masonite, gasket 422f is
      birch plywood, and the bolts and nuts are nylon. FIG. 25,
      discussed further below, presents an alternative distribution
      assembly 340a, in accordance with a further embodiment of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      As illustrated in FIG. 21c, hexagonal projector 422 can include a
      side housing 422g and top plate 422h designed to impart an outer
      appearance of a simple hexagonal prism shape to projector 422 when
      assembled.<br>
      <br>
      In one configuration of the present invention illustrated in FIG.
      21d, projector 422 includes a carriage assembly 422i, which
      includes a top plate portion 422j and chassis portion 422k.
      Chassis portion 422k is configured with a set of eight wheels
      422l, which are designed to couple to an aluminum rail provided in
      a top assembly between the two end structures, as described above.
      Accordingly, projector 422 can be suspended from a top assembly
      424 moved in a horizontal direction above bed 402 to position the
      projector as desired. Moreover, the axis of hexagonal projector is
      preferably orthogonal to the axis of tubes 412. Projector 422 is
      thereby configured to project a statically derived ISF into the
      region where an individual is located when the individual is lying
      on bed 402. As discussed further below, cone 422e is configured
      with a wire coupled to its apex that can be used to conduct
      dynamically generated ISFs to projector 422.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment of the present invention, a ball radiator
      structure 450 is also provided in destressing apparatus 400, as
      illustrated in FIG. 22a. Ball radiator device 450 preferably
      includes a cylinder 452 (e.g., PVC tube) that contains a metallic
      sphere such as copper/silver alloy or copper (e.g., [5/8] inch
      diameter copper ball), which is also slidably moveable in a plane
      parallel to that of tube 412, using a top portion 454 (e.g., a
      wooden box made from [1/4] inch birch plywood) provided with a
      cylindrical through hole as shown in FIG. 2a. As shown, cylinder
      452 is pivotally mounted to top portion 454. Accordingly, ball
      radiator 450 can be positioned over and adjusted for an
      individual, for example, focusing the ball radiator 450 on the
      "third eye" chakra in the region of the forehead, as illustrated
      in FIG. 22b. A static ISF generated on the outside of the sphere
      defined by the ball irradiator 450 is a right handed ISF. As
      discussed further below, ball radiator 450 is configured with a
      wire 456 (e.g., 16 gauge multi-strand coiled copper speaker wire)
      that can be used to conduct dynamically generated ISFs to radiator
      450. Wire 456 can be connected through a gold-plated copper butt
      terminal to a wire inside cylinder 452 (e.g., a 10 gauge single
      strand copper wire) that is brazed (e.g., with 72% silver and 28%
      copper alloy braze) to the side of the metallic sphere.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2k is a schematic perspective view of a system 200 for
      destressing, in accordance with another embodiment of the present
      invention. System 200 includes a bed 202 that is affixed at each
      end to end members 204 and 206. In this embodiment, end members
      204 and 206 each comprise a bilayer structure, 204a, 204b, and
      206a, 206b, respectively, which preferably comprises a wood-based
      material.<br>
      <br>
      Sandwiched between each bilayer structure is a star pattern 208,
      preferably comprising conductive tape arranged to form a Star of
      David-type geometry, using a metallic tape such as copper tape.
      Similar to star pattern 408, star pattern 208 comprises apices
      210, as also illustrated in FIG. 4. Each star apex is connected to
      a tube 212 that in turn connects that apex with a corresponding
      apex in the opposite star pattern. Preferably, each tube 212
      comprises an outer metal tube (not separately shown), such as
      copper and further includes a supporting wooden dowel (not shown)
      within the metal tube. The tubes 212 are arranged to be
      substantially orthogonal to the planes of end members 204 and 206.
      Thus, tubes 212 are mutually arranged in a hexagonal array as
      viewed along the axis of the tubes. This arrangement serves to
      define a larger hexagonal prism space 414, as illustrated in FIG.
      2b. The base edges 415 of the prism space are defined by
      connecting adjacent star apices 210. The length of the prism space
      is equivalent to the length of the tubes 212. The height and
      relative lateral position of bed 202 is configured such that an
      individual lying on bed 202 is substantially or wholly within the
      space defined by prism space 414, as illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      The metallic tubes 212, together with metallic tape patterns 208
      are configured to establish and direct an ISF environment
      particularly within the region defined by prism space 414,
      although ISFs can extend into the region outside of prism space
      414.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 illustrates details of an end structure outer panel 204a,
      in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As
      shown, panel 204a comprises a beveled top and flat base.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7b illustrates back and front views of a foot assembly 222
      that is provided over an opposite portion of bed 202 as compared
      to the location of ball radiator 220 (see FIG. 2k), in accordance
      with one embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment of
      the present invention, foot assembly 222 comprises a
      [3/4]''*15''*33'' Luan surface finished plywood foot panel 222a
      supported by two 4''*15'' braces 222b and a 4''*33'' bottom panel
      222c. Copper panels 223 are made of 6''*13.5'' copper sheets,
      where each panel is offset about 1.5 inches from the center of
      panel 222a, where each copper panel is designed to rest against
      the feet of an individual lying on bed 202. In accordance with one
      embodiment of the present invention, illustrated in FIG. 26,
      metallic tubes 212 are coupled to the foot assembly 222 using a
      concentrator 224. Collector 224 preferably is similar to or
      substantially the same as collector 416 and comprises a metal
      having a base that is shaped in a hexagonal star pattern whose
      apices 225 are each coupled to a metallic tube 212 using 16 gauge
      multi-strand copper wire, which is soldered to copper tape located
      between panels, such as panels 204a, 204b. The copper wire is fed
      to the copper tape through holes 204c provided in the panels (see
      FIG. 3). Concentrator 224 also includes a conical structure 226
      whose apex is contacted by a 16 gauge multi-strand wire that feeds
      through holes provided in inner and outer panels 204b, 204a and
      leads to a foot assembly, such as foot assembly 222, shown in FIG.
      7. A copper wire is fed through assembly 222 from front to back
      and is soldered to each of the foot panels 223, as shown. Copper
      foot panels 223 are preferably nailed to plywood foot panel 222a
      using four copper nails placed at the corners of each panel. Thus,
      concentrator 224 is configured to concentrate ISF fields from
      tubes 212 to the apex of cone 226 and to direct the ISF to the
      region of the foot panels 223.<br>
      <br>
      The metallic tubes 212, together with metallic tape patterns 208
      are configured to establish and direct an ISF environment
      particularly within the region defined by prism space 414.<br>
      <br>
      System 200 also includes a hexagonal assembly (projector) 216,
      which can be used to provide an ISF environment inside structure
      202. In one embodiment of the present invention, hexagonal
      assembly 216 is configured with a series of six cylindrical cones
      218, as illustrated further in FIGS. 19 and 20. Preferably,
      projector 216 is configured similarly to projector 422 such that
      the cones are mutually arranged so that their cone axes all
      converge upon a point. Preferably, cones 218 are phi ratio cones
      in which the ratio of base to height is about 1.618. In one
      embodiment, illustrated in FIG. 2a, the hexagonal assembly 216 is
      configured such that the axes of all cones converge at a point
      (not shown) above bed 202. In embodiments of the present
      invention, discussed further below, hexagonal assembly 216 is
      slidable along a tube 212, such that the convergence point can be
      positioned above a specific region of an individual resting on bed
      202, such as the heart chakra region. The arrangement of cones 218
      is such that the base of each cone is downwardly disposed (closer
      to bed 202) with respect to the cone apex.<br>
      <br>
      In an embodiment of the present invention, a ball radiator
      structure 220 is also provided in destressing apparatus 200, as
      further illustrated in FIG. 23. Ball radiator 220 is preferably a
      metallic sphere such as copper silver alloy or copper, which is
      also slidably moveable in a plane parallel to that of tube 212.
      Accordingly, ball radiator 220 can be positioned over an
      individual, such as above the "third eye" chakra in the region of
      the forehead. A static ISF generated on the outside of the sphere
      defined by the ball irradiator 220 is a right handed ISF.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the above-described elements of system 200,
      static ISFs can be distributed and projected within one or more
      areas of a spatial region that accommodates an individual on bed
      202, such that the ISFs interact with the individual to produce a
      destressing effect.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 21 is a schematic illustration that depicts elements of a
      system 230 for destressing in accordance with additional
      embodiments of the present invention. System 230 is designed to
      accommodate an individual in a structure 232 for a period of time
      to facilitate destressing of the individual. In an embodiment of
      the present invention, structure 232 includes bed 402, end members
      404 and 408, and metallic tubes 412 and star patterns 408, as
      shown with respect to FIG. 2a. Alternatively, structure 232
      includes bed 202, end members 204, 206, tubes 212 and star
      patterns 208, arranged substantially as shown and described above
      with respect to FIG. 2k. Structure 230 also preferably includes a
      hexagonal collector, such as collector 224 or 416 that is coupled
      to a foot assembly such as assembly 222 or 440. Thus, structure
      232 is configured to conduct and distribute ISFs within a region
      that accommodates an individual in a reclined position. In a
      preferred embodiment of the present invention, structure 232 is
      horizontally elongated and bed 202 is horizontal such that the
      individual is optimally accommodated in a reclined position on bed
      202. Alternatively however, as one of ordinary skill in the art
      would appreciate, the structure could be adapted for other
      orientations, such as to accommodate an individual who is
      standing.<br>
      <br>
      System 230 includes an electromagnetic source 234 that can be used
      as an input for generating ISF inputs. As discussed in detail
      below, electromagnetic source 234 may include electrical or
      electromagnetic outputs from a music source, such as a CD,
      audiotape, and the like. Alternatively, electromagnetic source 234
      may include an SCR controller or similar device that can control a
      light source, such as a lamp.<br>
      <br>
      Electromagnetic or electrical signals from electrical source 234
      are conducted to dynamic ISF generator 236. ISF generator 236 is
      configured to receive the electromagnetic or electrical input from
      electrical source 234, which can be used as an input to cause ISF
      production by dynamic ISF generator 236. In a preferred
      embodiment, both electromagnetic source 234 and dynamic ISF
      generator 236 are located in a region external to structure 232.<br>
      <br>
      System 230 is also configured such that the electrical or
      electromagnetic signals received from electromagnetic source 234
      are substantially blocked or attenuated from propagating into the
      immediate environment of an individual in structure 232.<br>
      <br>
      An information spin field generated by ISF generator 236 is
      conducted along ISF conductor 238 to ISF projector system 240. ISF
      conductor 238 can comprise, for example, an electrical conductor,
      such as a metal. Alternatively, ISF conductor 238 can comprise an
      insulator material, such as an optical fiber. In embodiments of
      the present invention, system 230 further includes an attenuator
      (or coupler) 242 that acts to conduct ISF into structure 232,
      while preventing electromagnetic or electric signals from
      propagating from ISF generator 236 to ISF projector system 240. In
      other embodiments, however, an attenuator 242 separate from the
      ISF generator 236 need not be included. This is because the ISF
      generator 236 is preferably configured to prevent electromagnetic
      or electric signals from propagating to projector system 240, as
      discussed further below. Thus, electromagnetic or electrical
      signals that are used as inputs to ISF generator 236 or are
      byproducts of ISF generator 236 during its operation, are
      substantially blocked from propagating into areas such as areas A,
      B, and C of structure 232.<br>
      <br>
      As discussed further below, ISF projector system 240 may be
      configured to distribute dynamically created (and statically
      created) ISFs from multiple positions toward the vicinity of the
      individual, or alternatively, may be configured as a relatively
      localized single source that radiates ISF in the vicinity of the
      individual during a destressing session. ISF projector system 240
      may comprise a plurality of separate ISF projectors (as depicted,
      for example as 240a and 240b), that comprise similar or different
      features, and are directed at different regions near an
      individual, as discussed in detail in the discussion to follow.
      For example, an individual ISF projector might include a series of
      identical structures, such as cones that are mutually arranged
      according to a predetermined geometry within the ISF projector.
      Alternatively, an ISF projector system might include two or more
      ISF projectors that differ in structure and materials, and are
      interconnected with different elements, such as different ISF
      generators. The term "ISF projector," as used herein, refers to an
      object or system that provides or directs an ISF or set of ISFs
      within a desired region, for example, in a region of a destressing
      structure than can accommodate an individual. As depicted in FIG.
      2c, projector 240 is located within structure 232, but need not be
      located within such a chamber.<br>
      <br>
      A set of dynamically generated ISFs is provided by projector
      system 240 in a manner that enhances the destressing of an
      individual located within structure 232. Accordingly, the
      individual resting in structure 232 receives the benefit of an ISF
      environment purposively created from sources that can create
      harmonious ISFs without any unwanted or deleterious effects
      associated with the electromagnetic or electric sources associated
      with generation of ISFs themselves. In preferred embodiments of
      the present invention discussed further below, projector system
      240 comprises a ball radiator and hexagonal assembly (each
      discussed previously). Projector system 240 thus may comprise
      components that are configured to project both statically
      generated and dynamically generated ISFs in the region of
      structure 232 surrounding an individual.<br>
      <br>
      As described further below, in some embodiments of the present
      invention, a dynamic ISF generator can be switched from generating
      right handed ISFs to generating left handed ISFs. Additionally, as
      noted above, different elements of system 230, such as the ball
      radiator and hexagonal cone assembly produce either left handed or
      right handed static ISFs. When dynamic ISF generators are
      employed, the ISF environment thus established in the environment
      of the individual in structure 232 results from a combination of
      dynamically generated ISFs as well as statically generated ISFs,
      whose intensity and handedness may differ. In embodiments of the
      present invention in which a source for dynamic ISF generation is
      employed, the intensity of the dynamically derived ISF tends to be
      such that the dynamically derived ISF exercises a dominant effect
      on the ISF environment established in the vicinity of the
      reclining individual, such as regions A, B, and C.<br>
      <br>
      Referring again to FIG. 21, system 230 further includes monitor
      244, which can be used to monitor the response of an individual
      during a destressing session, which can aid in tuning the ISF
      input during a destressing session or adjusting ISF inputs for
      future sessions. This is useful so that the energetic input used
      to generate ISFs can be tailored to the individual to optimize the
      destressing effect for that individual.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2m is a schematic illustration that depicts the
      interconnection of elements of a system 460 for destressing in
      accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Solid
      lines show flow of electromagnetic currents and dashed lines show
      ISF flows. System 460 includes main assembly 462 that contains bed
      464 and hexagonal projector 466 and ball radiator 468 located
      above bed 464. CD player 470 is configured to play, for example
      audio CDs that output an electronic signal to receiver 472, which
      outputs a signal to high voltage amplifier 474. Amplifier 474 in
      turn, outputs a signal to dynamic ISF generator 476, examples of
      which are described further below with respect to FIGS. 8a and 8b.
      ISF generator 476 is connected to fiber coupler 478 that is
      designed to block electric and electromagnetic signals from
      propagating to assembly 462. Fiber coupler 478 is connected to
      distribution box 480, that may include a distributor such as
      distribution assembly 422b depicted in FIG. 21b. Distribution
      assembly is configured to receive ISFs generated by ISF generator
      476 and distribute them within hexagonal projector 466.
      Accordingly, dynamic ISFs produced from inputs derived from CD
      player 470 are projected within assembly 462 by hexagonal
      projector 466. In addition, ball radiator 468 is configured to
      receive ISFs generated by the action of SCR 482 which outputs a
      signal that controls the intensity of light in lamp module 484.
      The light generated in lamp module 484 is collected and blocked
      from leaving the lamp module, as described further with respect to
      FIGS. 18a-18c. ISFs produced by lamp module 484, on the other
      hand, are conducted to ball radiator 468 and projected into
      assembly 462. As described further below with respect to FIG. 27a
      and 27b, the ISF environment created within an assembly, such as
      assembly 462 can be used to facilitate destressing.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention generally depicted in
      FIG. 1 and more particularly in FIG. 27a herein, destressing is
      accomplished by using an electromagnetic signal comprising
      frequency information derived from music as an input to a dynamic
      ISF generator. This is accomplished in that particular embodiment
      by using the output signal from a CD player as input to a high
      voltage amplifier of a type typically employed for powering
      piezoelectric transducers, with the output of the amplifier
      feeding as an input to the dynamic ISF generator. Alternatively,
      either a live music or recorded music source converted to an
      electromagnetic signal provided by an audiotape player, radio,
      computer storage device, television, or similar device can be
      employed. Moreover, other harmonious informational sources, such
      as the sound of ocean waves and wind, can be employed as inputs to
      one or more ISF generators providing input to the environment of
      the present invention in a similar fashion. In the case where
      music is used as the informational basis for the dynamic ISF input
      to the device, system, apparatus, and method of the present
      invention, the music upon which such signal is based can be
      selected as being of a type harmonious to the individual. Examples
      of music used in such an embodiment are shown in Table 1 below.<br>

      While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is
      believed that the above music examples have combinations of tones
      and patterns which create geometric effects which are particularly
      harmonious when employed in the present invention. A relationship
      between music and geometry has been observed by Princeton
      University Theorist and composer Dmitri Tymoczko, among others,
      who published some of his findings to that effect in The journal
      Science in 2006.<br>
      <br>
      As a practical matter in choosing music that has harmonious
      properties desirable for use in connection with the present
      invention, it has been observed that certain individuals have an
      ability to perceive that the music has suitably harmonious
      properties by listening to the music with headphones apart from
      any presence of such individuals in the apparatus of the present
      invention. When they are thus listening and the proper harmonious
      characteristics are present in the music, such individuals
      perceive a feeling of vibration or tingling that pervades their
      whole body that is unique to the types of music that are desirable
      for use as ISF informational sources for use in connection with
      the present invention. This represents a method employed to choose
      music employed in the apparatus of the present invention. All of
      the CD music albums listed in Table 1 were chosen by this means
      and exhibit such characteristics. By contrast, most music, even
      though it may be pleasant to listen to, lacks such a property.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 27a is a schematic illustration that includes a circuit
      diagram of components of a system 270 for destressing, in
      accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The
      circuit arrangement illustrated can be implemented in a physical
      apparatus similar to that depicted in FIG. 1. Solid lines show
      flow of electromagnetic currents and dotted lines show ISF flows.
      In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, a source
      of information, such as a signal from a CD player or from a light
      source, is conducted to an ISF generator, which can comprise a
      cone. The ISF generator then locally generates an ISF, which is
      distributed in the environment of a chamber that can accommodate a
      person.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 27a, an information source
      comprises a CD player 272. The electrical signal from the music
      information played by CD player 272 is conducted over conductive
      wire, such as coaxial leads 274 through a sound amplifier 276 to a
      high power amplifier device 278, which, in one embodiment, is
      configured to produce an output voltage not exceeding 120 volts
      when the gain is at maximum. The output of the high voltage
      amplifier device 278 thus contains information related to the
      music contained in the CD.<br>
      <br>
      A switch 280 regulates conduction of an electromagnetic signal
      from amplifier 278 to ISF generator 282. ISF generator 282 can
      comprise a conical structure, as described further below with
      respect to FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 27a, ISF conductor 284
      comprises a fiber optical coupler 286 (described further below
      with respect to FIG. 16) and multi-strand conductive wire 288.
      ISFs generated from ISF generator 282 are conducted to ISF
      projector 290, which comprises a hexagonal distribution assembly
      340 that may be disposed within main assembly structure 292. A
      series of six projection points 294 are arranged at tips of cones
      arranged in a hexagonal array that is disposed directly over bed
      296. Accordingly, ISFs can be provided in a region of structure
      292 that is designed to accommodate a reclining individual. In
      this manner, the individual is encompassed in an ISF environment
      that is provided by projector 290, which receives the ISF from ISF
      generator 282, which in turn receives an electrical signal based
      on the music played by CD player 272.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the ISF environment that surrounds an individual in
      structure 292 is derived at least in part from the information
      provided by CD player 272. Additionally, as described further
      below, ISF conductor 284 and fiber coupler 286 are configured to
      minimize or eliminate electrical and electromagnetic signals
      derived from the output of CD player 272, such that the individual
      in structure 292 is subject to an ISF environment substantially
      stripped of any electromagnetic or electric signals used to help
      generate the ISF environment. If a metallic material is used to
      form a conductive wire 288, copper or noble metals are preferably
      used to form the wire. In some embodiments, instead of a
      multistrand wire 288, an ISF conductor can comprise an insulator
      such as an optical fiber.<br>
      <br>
      Another source of harmonious informational input for use in
      connection with ISF generators of the present invention is light.
      Such a source can also be provided in the embodiment of the
      present invention depicted in FIG. 1, and detailed in FIGS. 18a-c,
      24, and 27a. FIG. 27a depicts an information source 300 that
      includes an SCR (silicon controlled rectifier) controller 302 and
      lamp module 304. SCR 302 acts as an electrical source that is
      configured to provide a power source to lamp 306 without the AC
      voltage variation from the line supply. Lamp 306, in turn, acts to
      generate radiation that is collected at cone 308. The ISFs
      generated from cone 308 (or combined ISF) are conducted by ISF
      conductor 310 to ISF projector 312, which is a ball radiator in
      the embodiment depicted in FIG. 27a. Ball radiator 312, in turn,
      provides an ISF environment directly in the vicinity of an
      individual reclining on bed 296. Thus, a light source can be used
      to generate a harmonious ISF environment in structure 292. In a
      preferred embodiment of the present invention, ball radiator 312
      and hexagonal assembly 290 act in concert with a hexagonal array
      of metallic tubes (not shown in FIG. 27a, but described above with
      respect to FIG. 2a) to produce an ISF environment that combines
      dynamically produced and statically produced ISFs that interact
      with an individual in structure 292 to produce a destressing
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, means are provided for
      determining that the enhanced ISF environment is harmonious to the
      individual at the time of the individual's presence substantially
      within the enhanced informational spin field environment. Such a
      means is provided in the embodiment of the present invention
      depicted in FIG. 1. It has been observed that an individual who is
      substantially surrounded by the ISF environment of the present
      invention exhibits autonomic responses that can be visibly
      interpreted by an operator. A sensor whose output is directed to a
      computer programmed to interpret visual data, can also be used to
      determine whether the environment is harmonious to the individual
      when present within such ISF environment. Among such autonomic
      responses are various involuntary eye movements, the most common
      example of which is blinking of the eyes at a rate much more rapid
      than normal, which tend to largely cease when the environment is
      fully harmonious. Such autonomic responses described herein are
      similar in kind and character to those reported in the published
      PCT patent application of McNew (WO 2005/058144 and
      PCT/US2004/042451), observed in the combined sound and light
      environment described therein. It has been discovered that the
      phenomenon of such responses are present in the ISF environment of
      the present invention as well, even in the absence of both light
      and sound within such environment, and can be can be employed as a
      means of cueing the adjustment of the ISF environment of the
      present invention with regard to either its intensity,
      informational content, or both, to assure the presence of a
      harmonious ISF environment for the individual within said
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a gain knob
      configured to adjust voltage of the output electromagnetic signal
      from the high voltage amplifier to the ISF generator may be
      adjusted downward from its initial setting to eliminate
      involuntary eye movement on the part of the individual subject if
      such eye movement is being exhibited either at the commencement of
      or during a destressing session. If involuntarily eye movement
      persists, the hexagonal projector may be moved toward the feet of
      the subject, lowering the overall frequency of the ISF within the
      destressing apparatus. If involuntary eye movement still persists,
      this is an indication that the subject has made as much change to
      their ISF as can be comfortably accommodated at the time of the
      session, and the session is then terminated by removing the
      individual from the destressing device.<br>

      <b>Exemplary Implementations of Components of a System for
        Reducing Stress</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the discussion to follow, details of exemplary components of a
      system for destressing are provided. Such components are merely
      exemplary to provide a better understanding of the operation of
      the invention, and should not be considered as limiting the scope
      of the present invention in any way.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ISF Generators</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One embodiment of a dynamic ISF generator of the present invention
      is illustrated in FIG. 8a.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8a illustrates a cross-sectional, top, and bottom view of ISF
      generator 500 that includes cone 502 and an assembly of phosphor
      bronze and Teflon(TM) sheets and a ring magnet. A pair of
      Teflon(TM)/bronze capacitors 506, 508 is concentrically arranged
      such that a ring magnet 504 is concentrically disposed between the
      concentric coiled capacitor plates. When a changing voltage is
      applied to the inner and outer bronze plates 506, 508, the
      magnetic moments within magnet 504 (the electron spin
      polarizations of the ferrite ceramic ring magnet) are changing
      dynamically. This change in spin polarization creates a
      dynamically changing magnetic field. This dynamically changing
      magnetic field generates an ISF. This dynamic ISF couples into the
      static ISF created by the copper cone 502 itself, whose base is
      affixed to the base 510. The dynamic and static ISF are then
      broadcast out of cone 502 and follow a copper wire and optical
      fiber conduction path. In a preferred embodiment of the present
      invention, as illustrated in FIG. 13, the polarity of the ring
      magnet 504 is arranged such that the poles are arranged along the
      axis of the ring and cone, and the north pole is facing up toward
      cone 502. In one embodiment of the present invention, ring magnet
      504 comprises a ferrite ceramic ring type five, with magnetic
      field strength of about 4000 Gauss. As shown in FIG. 8a, cone 502
      is held down by a top square plate and sandwiched between the top
      square plate and bottom square plate by, for example, nylon bolts
      through the top and bottom plates.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention,
      FIG. 8b illustrates a cross-sectional view of another ISF
      generator 320 that includes an assembly of bronze and Teflon(TM)
      sheets and ring magnets. The embodiment depicted in FIG. 8b
      differs from that shown in FIG. 8a primarily in that the magnet
      and capacitors in the former are contained within an enclosure
      330. Similar to ISF generator 500, a pair of Teflon(TM)/bronze
      capacitors 322, 324 is concentrically arranged such that a ring
      magnet 326 is concentrically disposed between the concentric
      capacitor plates. When a changing voltage is applied to the inner
      and outer bronze plates 322, 324, the magnetic moments within
      magnet 326 (the electron spin polarizations of the ferrite ceramic
      ring magnet) are changing dynamically. This change in spin
      polarization creates a dynamically changing magnetic field. This
      dynamically changing magnetic field generates an ISF. This dynamic
      ISF couples into the static ISF created by the copper cone 328
      itself, whose base is affixed to the outside of a housing 330 that
      houses the magnet capacitor assembly. An example of housing 330 is
      shown in FIG. 15.<br>
      <br>
      The dynamic and static ISF are then broadcast out of cone 328 and
      follow a copper wire and optical fiber conduction path. In a
      preferred embodiment of the present invention, the polarity of the
      ring magnet 326 is arranged such that the poles are arranged along
      the axis of the ring and cone, and the north pole is facing up
      toward cone 328. In one embodiment of the present invention, ring
      magnet 326 comprises a ferrite ceramic ring type five, with
      magnetic strength of about 4000 Gauss.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the dynamic ISF field generated by generator 320 or
      500 is a right handed field, which can be controlled by choice of
      polarity of the input signal to generator 320, as illustrated in
      FIG. 9.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 14 illustrates details of capacitors 322 (506), 324 (508)
      according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this
      embodiment, capacitors 322 and 324 each comprise three concentric
      layers of Teflon(TM)/bronze formed from a single continuous
      Teflon(TM)/bronze bilayer. The Teflon(TM) layer is on the outside.
      Each layer of the bronze sheet is preferably isolated from the
      previous and next layer. In one embodiment, the Teflon(TM) and
      bronze layers of a single layer of the capacitor are each about
      0.005 inches thick. A wire (e.g., 16 gauge 8 inch multi-strand
      copper speaker wire) is soldered to the inner layer of capacitor
      322 and the outside layer of capacitor 324.<br>
      <br>
      Referring again to FIGS. 8a and 8b, the width of capacitors 506
      (322) and 508 (324) along the axis of the capacitors and cone is
      about twice the thickness of the magnet 504 (326).<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 illustrates details of a copper cone structure, which can
      represent, for example, cone 502 of ISF generator 500. An
      exemplary base diameter is about 60 mm while the height is about
      37.1 mm. In one embodiment of the present invention six similarly
      shaped copper cones are used to form the hexagonal projector
      described above, as well as cones in a fiber coupler and lamp
      assembly described below. In the latter cases, an exemplary base
      diameter is about 101.6 mm and height is about 62.8 mm. Finally, a
      similar cone structure having diameter of about 63 mm and height
      of about 39.0 mm is used for a collector assembly connected to a
      foot assembly described above as well for a distributor assembly
      connected to the hexagonal projector described previously.
      Preferably, all such cones are 99.99% oxygen free copper cones.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 11 and 12 illustrate bottom and top mounts 520 and 522
      (e.g., square plates) that are used to fasten cone 502 of FIG. 8a
      to the underlying magnet/capacitor assembly. Similarly, respective
      bottom and top mounts 333 and 331 are used to fasten cone 328 to
      housing 330, as illustrated in FIG. 8b.<br>
      <br>
      Once assembled, ISF generators depicted in FIGS. 8a and 8b are
      configured to produce ISFs that can be conducted from the apex of
      the respective cone element to an ISF projector, without
      conducting substantial electromagnetic radiation therewith. For
      example, the cones are not electrically coupled through an
      electrical conductor to the magnet/capacitor assembly. Thus, the
      ISF generators themselves act as filters preventing
      electromagnetic radiation from propagating along a path between
      ISF generator and ISF projector. However, as mentioned above, a
      decoupler can be provided in the path between an ISF generator and
      ISF projector to ensure that little or no electromagnetic
      radiation propagates between the ISF generator and ISF projector.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 27b illustrates a wiring diagram for a system used to supply
      a signal derived from a music player to an ISF generator such as
      shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 8a and 8b. In one configuration
      of the invention, high voltage amplifier 510, which contains DC
      offset control 512 and DC polarity control 514, is contained
      within main enclosure 516 of the high voltage amplifier.
      Potentiometer 518 is used for gain control but DC polarity and
      offset is preset and generally not varied by an operator of high
      voltage amplifier 510, which is used to control inputs to an ISF
      generator 500. Enclosure 516 is preferably provided with a
      plurality of vent holes to allow cooling during operation of the
      high voltage amplifier. FIG. 27b also shows receiver 276 and 12V
      transformer 517a, 6V transformer 517b, and 3V transformer 517c,
      dual instrumentation amplifier 519, each coupled to the receiver
      276 and console 516 as shown.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the electromagnetic
      signal inputs coming from the high voltage amplifier are based
      upon the original musical input from a CD or other music player,
      as illustrated in FIG. 27a. These signal inputs are attached to
      the capacitors, and therefore are the source of the changing
      voltage on the capacitors, which in turn causes the magnetic field
      to dynamically change in a magnet of an ISF generator, such as
      magnet 326. Alternatively, high voltage signals in the form of
      single frequencies, such as from a signal generator, can also be
      used in the ISF generator of the present invention. The ISF
      generator itself is useful in various embodiments of the present
      invention. There is no limit to the frequency of the input, so any
      signal from a frequency generator from small fractions of a Hertz
      to Gigahertz frequencies have been shown to work for generating
      ISFs. Frequencies in the visible light range have also shown to
      work in the ISF generator of the present invention. Thus, there
      appears to be no limitation with respect to potential frequency
      inputs and resulting ISF outputs.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 18a-c illustrate further details of lamp module 304
      discussed above with respect to FIG. 27a. As previously noted,
      lamp 306 can receive input from an SCR controller 302 to rectify
      the alternating current input, and, if desired, control operation
      of lamp 306. In one embodiment, an SCR controller is utilized as a
      dimmer to lamp 306, which comprises a 40-watt incandescent light
      bulb to allow simultaneous variation in both the frequency output
      range (and therefore informational output) and intensity of the
      light from the bulb. In the presently preferred embodiment of the
      present invention, the dimmer switch is employed as a rectifier
      and is set to its maximum output level, without further
      adjustments. A hexagonal reflector 310, illustrated in more detail
      in FIG. 18b, is provided to surround lamp 306 and to generate a
      static ISF in addition to the dynamic ISF produced by the light
      from lamp 306 itself. Hexagonal reflector preferably comprises a
      support structure to which inwardly facing mirrored surfaces are
      joined on the interior of faces of a hollow prism structure shown.
      Reflector 310 includes six steeply inclined trapezoid mirrors 310a
      and one horizontal hexagonal mirror 310b provided with a central
      hole As illustrated in FIG. 18c, reflector 310 may be joined to or
      rest on a base 311, which forms a base of module 304. As
      illustrated, an enclosure 313 is joined to the inwardly-facing
      side of base 311. Enclosure 313 is configured to allow light to
      impinge on cone 308 only on the inside surface of cone 308. The
      combined static and dynamically generated ISF is collected into
      cone 308, which also restricts the visible light from being
      emitted from module 304. In one embodiment of the present
      invention, the ISF created in module 304 is conducted through a
      single strand copper wire that is brazed into the tip of cone 308
      using a 72% silver/28% copper alloy. The ISF is conducted to a
      copper ball radiator (shown in FIG. 23 and discussed further
      below). In the embodiment of the present invention depicted in
      FIG. 1, a multicolored 40-watt light bulb called "The Amazing
      Rainbow Light," available from Special F/X Lighting Inc.,
      Hurricane, Utah 84737, is used as the light source, providing
      particular variations in the ISF output of the light ISF generator
      as the SCR input to the bulb is adjusted.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ISF Conductors</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      ISF conductors useful in the present invention include metals,
      such as copper, silver, gold, and other noble metals, but
      preferably should not be (although can be) base metals, such as
      tin or lead due to their potential distortion of an ISF during
      conduction. Glass can also be employed as an effective ISF
      conductor. In one embodiment, 12-gauge multi-strand copper speaker
      wire can be employed to conduct the ISF from the ISF generators to
      and from the fiber coupler assembly 286, and from there to the
      hexagonal projector 290 (see FIG. 27a), as well as from the lamp
      ISF generator assembly to the ball radiator (element 312 of FIG.
      27a). The same type of wire can be used to connect the copper tape
      from its junctions with the copper tubes with the distribution
      assembly shown in FIG. 21a, and from the distribution assembly to
      the copper panels of the footplate assemblies shown in FIGS. 7a
      and 7b. If solder is employed at any point in the ISF conductance
      means, copper, silver, gold, or other noble metal alloys are
      preferred, preferably (although not necessarily) free of base
      metals such as, for example, lead or tin. In one embodiment of the
      present invention, machined copper and copper sheet can be
      variously used for cones in the ISF conductance path, as depicted
      generally in FIG. 10. Copper tubes and copper tape employed in
      embodiments of the present invention and described above are also
      part of an ISF conductance path, although the latter elements are
      not connected directly to dynamic ISF generators. In embodiments
      of the present invention, optical fiber, such as, for example,
      quartz or other glass, or (less desirably) acrylic fiber can be
      used as ISF conductor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Attenuators</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, a fiber coupler
      assembly is provided, as shown in more detail in FIGS. 16 and 27a.
      FIG. 16 illustrates a side view of fiber coupler 286, in
      accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The fiber
      coupler acts to transmit ISFs, which are being conducted to a
      projector, while blocking the transmission of electrical or
      electromagnetic signals. The fiber coupler also acts to couple
      ISFs into and out of the cones along conductor 288. In FIG. 16, a
      pair of couplers 286a, 286b is separated by takeup spool 287. In
      one embodiment of the present invention, couplers 286a and 286b
      comprise double cones having a phi ratio geometries. The effect of
      fiber coupler 286 is to transition the ISF conductance from copper
      wire to optical fiber and back to copper wire between an ISF
      generator (see element 282 of FIG. 27a) and an ISF projector (see
      the hexagonal projector 290 of FIG. 27a). The purpose of this
      transition is to provide a positive filter blocking any
      electromagnetic elements' ability to flow through the ISF circuit.
      Light cannot be conducted through the copper conductors and
      electricity and magnetism cannot be conducted through the optical
      fiber conductors. Only ISFs, therefore, are conducted from the ISF
      generator to an ISF projector such as the hexagonal projector 290
      of FIG. 27a. As illustrated in FIG. 16, a metallic wire leads from
      an ISF generator (FIG. 27a, element 282) into coupler 286a. Any
      electrical signal entering into coupler 286a is prevented from
      flowing further due to the insulating nature of optical fiber 289,
      which is preferably glass or an insulating polymer. Although
      optical fiber 289 can transmit electromagnetic radiation such as
      light, any light entering coupler 286b is prevented from further
      propagation, because the light does not propagate along metallic
      wire 286c leading from 286b to a projector. Thus, any ISF
      generated by an ISF generator and leaving coupler 286 is conducted
      toward a projector without the presence of an accompanying
      electromagnetic signal or electrical potential.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 16, each coupler 286a, 286b
      comprises a pair of opposed cone structures joined at the base to
      a common mount. Preferably, the bases of each pair of cones are
      mutually aligned with each other as viewed down the axis of the
      cone. Cones 286d are preferably copper cones, while cones 286e can
      comprise an insulator such as polyester, as shown in FIG. 17. In
      one embodiment of the present invention, a plywood box (not shown)
      is placed around coupler 286, with the interior of the box painted
      flat black.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, cones 286e are polyester and have glass fiber
      wound 11 turns at a 6 mm pitch as represented in FIG. 16. The
      direction of the turns is clockwise on the input side, when viewed
      from the cone's apex and wound counterclockwise, again viewed from
      the apex of the cone, on the output side. The cones of FIG. 16 can
      be mounted to plywood such that the copper and fiber wound cones
      are aligned with each other. The input and output pairs of cones
      are mounted on a common base for convenience. The fiber is, for
      example, 50 micron optical fiber. The takeup spool is, for
      example, a vertical, hollow, plastic spool, 1[1/2] inches in
      diameter and 1[1/2] inches high, taking up excess of five meter
      long optical quality glass fiber. The wire 286c can be 10 gauge 4
      inch single strand copper wire brazed using 72% silver and 28%
      copper alloy, with approximately [1/4] inch of the wire extending
      into the cone.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ISF Projectors</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the ISF output from at
      least one ISF generator is conducted into the ISF environment of
      the present invention substantially surrounding the individual by
      means of one or more arrays of copper cones arranged in a
      hexagonal projector. As discussed above, in one preferred
      embodiment illustrated in FIG. 21a, an ISF projector 422
      (hexagonal assembly) comprises six conical radiators 422a that are
      employed in a hexagonal array focused upon the vicinity of the
      center of the heart chakra (approximately the center of the
      breastbone) of the individual within the ISF environment of the
      present invention. Cones 422a are preferably objects having hollow
      geometries, such as, for example, hollow cones having a base to
      height ratio of phi, approximately 1.618.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 20b illustrates an example of a copper or phosphor bronze
      cone 422a, arranged in accordance with one embodiment of the
      present invention. Cone 422a comprises an approximately 0.005''
      thick sheet that is formed into an approximately 61.8*100 mm cone
      having an approximately 2 mm hole at the apex that accommodates a
      wire, such as a solid 10 gauge wire, such as copper wire. A length
      of about 5 mm of copper wire is inserted into the hole and brazed
      with a low melting point material, such as copper/silver 72%/28%
      eutectic alloy at an end 423. The joining can be performed using
      for example a silver/copper alloy described above, which is
      applied at the end of the wire, after which the wire is soldered
      to the cone 422a, and the 2 mm hole is sealed. The unbrazed end of
      copper wire can then be joined to another device, such as a
      distributor.<br>
      <br>
      The arrangement of cones 422a is such that their bases are facing
      downwardly when the assembly is affixed in a structure, such as
      structure 400. As described above, the axes of the cones all
      preferably converge upon a point below the array that can serve to
      project dynamically created and statically created ISFs in a
      region in the vicinity of the heart chakra of an individual lying
      in structure 400, as illustrated in FIG. 2a.<br>
      <br>
      ISF projector 422 can also include a distribution assembly 422b
      (340), an embodiment of which is illustrated in FIGS. 21a and 27a.
      In the embodiment of the present invention depicted in FIG. 27a,
      distribution assembly 340 is connected to conductor 284 and
      receives a dynamically generated ISF from generator 282. As
      further illustrated in FIG. 21b, distribution assembly 422b
      comprises a metallic star shaped base 422c affixed to a metallic
      cone, in which the apices of the star point to the points of the
      hexagonal top plate. Conductor 284 is coupled to the apex of cone
      422e. Attached to each point of star shaped base 422c are wires
      422d that each lead to an individual cone 422a, depicted in FIG.
      21a. Accordingly, the dynamic ISF received from ISF generator 282
      is distributed to each cone on assembly 340.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention depicted in more detail
      in FIG. 24, a hexagonal projector 216 is configured to slide in a
      horizontal direction along tube 212, which is an uppermost tube of
      an array of tubes connecting end members 206 within structure 200.
      Accordingly, the position of hexagonal assembly 216 can be
      adjusted according to an individual's size, so that it can be
      maintained over the heart chakra or other area of individuals of
      varying height. The centers of bases of cones 218 are located on a
      common plane that is about 27.0'' above bed 202.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 23 illustrates details of a ball radiator ISF projector 312,
      according to one embodiment of the present invention. Ball
      radiator 312 comprises a copper ball 314 located at the end of a
      multi-strand wire 316. In one embodiment, the diameter of the
      copper ball 314 is about [5/8] inch. As discussed previously, ball
      radiator 312 is connected to an ISF source that employs a light
      source. Ball radiator 312 is mechanically coupled to hollow tube
      318 so that the position of copper ball 314 can move along a
      horizontal direction when hollow tube 318, which is configured to
      slide along copper tube 212, is moved. Thus, ball radiator 312 can
      be adjusted to remain in the same relative position with respect
      to the head of individuals of varying height.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Individual Monitoring Equipment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, a video camera is
      provided to furnish observational input of the individual to an
      operator (via a monitor) or to a computer, for manual or automated
      employment, respectively, in adjusting the ISF inputs to the
      environment to achieve harmony and therefore maximize stress
      alleviation for the individual substantially within the ISF
      environment. If no visible light is present within the
      environment, either a passive infrared-sensitive video camera of
      sufficient resolution or an IR video camera and an IR light
      positioned, for example, as shown in FIGS. 2a and 2k, may be
      provided for such purpose. Also located in structure 200 (400) are
      IR light source 215 (427) and IR camera 217 (425). Light source
      215 can provide sufficient illumination inside structure 200 so
      that IR detector can detect images of objects within structure
      200, including details of an individual reclining in structure
      200. IR light source 215 is configured to produce radiation of
      frequency and intensity to cause minimal disturbance to an
      individual in structure 200. Accordingly, the individual can be
      observed during exposure to the ambient ISF environment without
      undue disturbance. In other embodiments of the present invention,
      other sensors may alternatively be substituted for a video camera
      as aids in adjusting the ISF inputs to the ISF environment of the
      present invention to assure that it is harmonious for the
      individual.<br>
      <br>
      Monitoring of individuals, such as observation of eye movements is
      helpful in ascertaining an appropriate duration of destressing
      session. When a dynamically created ISF is provided to an
      individual, a destressing process may begin to take place over a
      short period of time, for example ten to twenty minutes. The
      destressing may be associated with reconfiguring of the
      individual's own biofield, such that the individual experiences
      conscious sensations, such as a feeling of relaxation. Autonomic
      responses such as involuntary eye movement are believed to be an
      indication that the adjustment taking place in response to the ISF
      is no longer comfortable. As discussed above, this may be due to
      an inharmonious ISF environment usually because the intensity of
      the ISF is too high. However, such autonomic responses observed
      after a period of time may indicate that the individual is no
      longer able to accommodate further biofield readjustment
      comfortably during that session. Thus, a residence time of
      individuals in the destressing system can be adjusted according to
      observed indicators, such as involuntary eye movement. The
      intensity of the ISF projected toward an individual can be lowered
      by adjusting a high voltage electromagnetic signal input to a
      dynamic ISF generator.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Other Hardware</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, an audio speaker or
      set of speakers is provided that is coupled to a music source,
      such as source 272 in FIG. 27. The audio speaker receives an
      electrical signal from an amplifier and, at the option of the
      individual subject, can project audible music into the environment
      of such individual located in system 200. The music corresponds to
      the same electrical input sent to an ISF generator, such as
      generator 282, which electrical signal is then blocked from
      propagating toward the individual along the ISF conduction path.
      The electrical input into the speaker or set of speakers is
      transformed into sound by transducers in the speakers.
      Accordingly, very little, if any, electrical or electromagnetic
      energy is transmitted from the speakers toward the individual.
      Preferably, the set of speakers is located outside of the region
      containing the individual and the ISF projectors.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention offers potential of improved efficiency as
      compared to means of achieving stress reduction by practices of
      the prior art. Significantly positive results are observable in a
      15 to 30 minute exposure to the informational spin filed
      environment of the present invention. Individuals experiencing the
      ISF environment of the present invention typically report feeling
      a sense of stress reduction, revitalization and wellness. In
      addition, they often report subsequent healings apparently as a
      result of being destressed.<br>
      <br>
      While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is
      believed that consciousness effects facilitated by the environment
      created within the apparatus of the present invention precipitate
      the destressing results experienced by individuals spending one or
      more sessions therein. The following is a non-binding explanation
      of how and why this is believed to occur.<br>
      <br>
      The human biofield is an ISF whose information content is
      comprised of ideas or thought forms derived from both the waking
      (or rational) and subconscious levels of consciousness or
      awareness. Information inputs to this field from the rational
      level occur continually as thought and emotion occurs within that
      level of consciousness, creating content that tends to be
      transient, except to the extent adopted by the subconscious as
      part of its evolving self-identity and belief systems. Information
      inputs to the biofield from the subconscious level tend to be more
      long term in their tenure in the field, representing fundamental
      attitudes and convictions adopted by the subconscious concerning
      the individual's self-identity and worldview. Stress in an
      individual occurs as a result of: a) negative experiences which
      are not resolved and are adopted as part of an individual's
      self-identity as beliefs of having been somehow injured, and b)
      the exposure of an individual to fears and ideas of limitation
      about themselves which they do not reject but to which they have
      come to believe themselves to be subject, and accept as part of
      their self-identity. Such adopted negative aspects of identity
      (stress) are then reflected on an extended basis in the ISF that
      is the biofield of the individual as disharmonious information
      content.<br>
      <br>
      The biofield is the medium by which the consciousness of an
      individual communicates with and directs the cellular and
      biophysical activity that creates and maintains the individual's
      physical presence. When disharmonious information content (stress)
      appears in the biofield on other than a transient basis, it
      becomes part of the instructions that direct the creation and
      maintenance of the individual's physical body, and becomes
      manifested as physical disharmony in the form of disease and
      dysfunction. Disease and dysfunction can be seen, therefore, as
      the efforts of one level of consciousness (the subconscious)
      trying (by means of physically manifested disharmony) to get the
      attention of another level of consciousness (the waking, or
      rational, level), to get it to recognize and resolve (heal, or
      discharge) a corruption of the harmony of the individual's
      self-identity.<br>
      <br>
      When one enters the very powerful and harmonious ISF existing
      within the environment of the present invention, the subconscious
      of the individual becomes instantly aware of that field, as well
      as its greater degree of harmony as compared with the field that
      the individual has himself or herself created. This awareness
      causes a response in the individual in which the level of their
      subconscious then connects with the level of their superconscious
      (the highest level of their awareness, which is omniscient), in
      order to try to understand what is occurring. During that
      connection, the subconscious becomes aware of the specific
      elements of disharmony that it has adopted into the biofield which
      it has created, and begins to eliminate those disharmonies issue
      by issue, resulting in the de-stressing of the individual. As
      stress disappears from the field of the individual over a series
      of destressing sessions, they naturally progressively resume a
      more harmonious physical and mental state, as their innate
      self-healing mechanisms operate unimpeded by accumulated stress.<br>
      <br>
      Various therapies involving the direct use of light, color and
      sound on individuals have found a need to vary the frequency
      inputs specifically to needs of the individual at the particular
      time of treatment in order to be effective or beneficial. While
      indeed it is possible to input frequencies of information tailored
      to address the current needs of a specific individual using the
      present invention, it is believed to be unnecessary. In the
      preferred embodiment of the present invention, only the intensity
      of the field is typically being adjusted, so as not to overwhelm
      the individual and so as to be of sufficient intensity to
      facilitate the consciousness connections above described. The
      music and light frequency inputs chosen are universal. (For
      example, any of the music sources listed in Table 1 can accomplish
      the facilitating environment of the present invention.) A key
      aspect of this modality of the present invention is that the need
      to choose or structure specific individualized informational
      inputs is absent: the informational changes necessary to destress
      the individual are coming directly from within themselves from
      their highest level of consciousness, which is omniscient and
      therefore incapable of harming them by introducing inappropriate
      inputs. Essentially, the present invention creates a facilitating
      environment where the individual is progressively "remembering"
      their perfect state devoid of the accumulation of disharmonious
      experiences and limitations, progressively jettisoning aspects of
      self-image that do not fit harmoniously. This is often one of the
      goals of meditators, namely to silence their lower levels of
      awareness and connect with their highest levels of awareness to
      become more aware of harmony. Indeed, it has been observed by
      individuals experienced in regular meditation that being in the
      environment of the present invention is "like meditating with the
      static removed," and that following even a single session in the
      harmonious ISF environment of the present invention that achieving
      meditative states thereafter seems easier than before.<br>
      <br>
      There are numerous modalities for healing that operate by
      introducing various types of informational intervention and/or
      programming of the individual. These inevitably require
      receptivity and willingness to accept such informational changes
      on the part of the recipient. Some of these modalities operate at
      the level of the subconscious and some directly at the level of
      the human biofield, to eliminate or otherwise compensate for
      informational influences that have their origins in stress. These
      include hypnotherapy, acupuncture, qigong, pranic healing, Reiki,
      and homeopathy. All of these rely to some degree on the skill of
      the practitioner in either diagnosis, treatment or both, and in
      certain circumstances may present various potentials for either
      ineffectiveness or perceived harm to the individual if the
      informational inputs are inappropriate to the need.<br>
      <br>
      A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a method
      for achieving destressing of an individual without any necessity
      for diagnosis or treatment by a practitioner. Such method
      comprises placing an individual in an environment into which both
      statically derived and dynamically derived ISF elements are
      present, from which the electromagnetic components have been
      removed from at least one such dynamic ISF element.<br>
      <br>
      One example of such a preferred embodiment can be accomplished in
      the apparatus described above. An individual lies on the mattress
      of the bed for typically a 20 minute session, during which time a
      dynamic ISF derived from a musical source with appropriate
      harmonious characteristics (such as, for example, one of those
      illustrated in Table 1) is provided in addition to one or more
      static ISFs. Such dynamic source is adjusted downward in intensity
      if necessary to assure that no involuntary eye movement is being
      exhibited by the individual within the apparatus. The subject will
      often afterward report perceptions of tingling or other sensations
      in the body, and perhaps colors and/or visions observed mentally.
      Upon emerging from the session feelings of renewal and
      revitalization are commonly reported. Subsequent observations of
      later healings are often reported as well, believed to be the
      result of destressing. Occasionally increased abilities are later
      reported to be manifesting, such as the ability to perceive ISFs
      visually as colors, spontaneous receiving of correct but
      previously unknown information, premonitions, and increased
      awareness.<br>
      <br>
      A characteristic of the ISF that is the human biofield is that it
      has both right handed and left handed elements, and circulates
      within and surrounding an individual's physical body.
      Disharmonious information contained in the biofield manifests as
      blockages in the normal flow of the ISF. The science of
      acupuncture is directed at the intervention at acupoints to
      attempt to unblock such flow blockages. Disharmonious information
      contained in the biofield also manifests as imbalance in the
      parasympathetic and sympathetic elements of the autonomic nervous
      system. In connection with the present invention, it is postulated
      that the progressive abandonment of negative elements of
      self-identity by the subconscious as a result of connecting with
      the superconscious in the ISF environment of the present invention
      appears to result in the removal of blockages to the ISF flow of
      the individual's biofield. The ISF of the present invention is
      itself observed (by those who can either feel them or perceive
      them visually) to circulate more or less along the longitudinal
      axis of the hexagonal prism space, radially out at the bulkhead at
      one end, and back along the copper tubes to the other bulkhead,
      then radially inward and then back through the middle of the prism
      space along its longitudinal axis. This circulation appears to
      occur despite no means being deliberately introduced to cause such
      circulating flow. The ISF flow has been observed to vary in
      direction (from head to feet of the individual, or vice versa)
      with different individuals, but has been perceived to be
      harmonious.<br>
      <br>
      The destressing device of the present invention is preferably
      located in a quiet setting. A typical procedure for conducting a
      destressing session in the apparatus of the present invention is
      as follows:<br>
      <br>
      The operator turns on power to the main electronic console,
      including the lamp ISF generator assembly, CD player, infrared
      camera, video monitor, and infrared light (if needed-ambient room
      lighting may be sufficient to not require the IR light for the
      camera). A CD music recording such as one of the albums described
      in FIG. 1 is placed in the CD player. The client individual
      removes shoes, metal, jewelry and eyeglasses to the extent
      feasible. The removable copper tube (entrance tube) on the side of
      the destressing device is removed by the operator, and the
      hexagonal projector is slid to the far left extreme of its travel
      within the hexagonal prism space of the destressing device. The
      ball radiator assembly is slid to the extreme right of its travel
      within the space. The client individual then enters the prism
      space, lying on their back with their head to the right, their
      feet to the left, and their arms at their sides with their body
      substantially aligned in the direction of the axis of the prism
      space. One or more pillows and/or a blanket may be provided for
      the comfort of the individual. The ball radiator is then slid to
      the left and positioned so that the copper ball is above the
      vicinity of the "third eye" chakra (the middle of the forehead
      region an inch or so above the eyebrows) of the individual. The
      hexagonal projector is slid to the right and positioned such that
      its center is above the vicinity of the heart chakra
      (approximately the middle of the breastbone) of the individual.
      The two foot paddles are strapped to the bottoms of the
      individual's feet using the Nylon(R) hook and loop straps attached
      to them. The entrance tube is then replaced into the destressing
      device.<br>
      <br>
      The individual is offered the choice of hearing the music from
      which the ISF will be derived or not. If the individual elects to
      hear it, a switch is enabled which will route the electromagnetic
      audio signal from the CD player to small speakers located in the
      upper right quadrant of the destressing device, above the prism
      space, in addition to the signal still being conducted to the ISF
      generator. (An adjustable volume control for the speakers is
      located on the right bulkhead of the destressing unit at the edge
      of the prism space within reach of the individual.) The operator
      then pushes the "play" button of the CD player, activating its
      electromagnetic audio signal output. The "gain" knob which
      controls the ISF strength of the output of the hexagonal projector
      is set by the operator at a value of "3" as marked by its dial.
      The switch at the panel of the electronic console which activates
      the high voltage amplifier (main "field switch") is then turned on
      by the operator, empowering the ISF generator and its output which
      feeds the fiber coupler and hexagonal projector.<br>
      <br>
      The operator then looks at the video monitor screen to determine
      whether the ISF field strength within the destressing device is
      too strong for the individual within, an affirmative indication
      being demonstrated by involuntary eye movement of the individual,
      such as rapid blinking of the eyes. If such eye movement is
      observed, the operator promptly reduces the gain until the
      individual's involuntary eye movement response is eliminated. If
      the involuntary eye movement persists regardless of the gain
      setting being at its minimum, the session is promptly ended by
      flipping off the field switch, detaching the foot paddles, sliding
      the hexagonal projector and ball radiator back to their extreme
      positions, removing the entrance tube, and assisting the
      individual's egress from the prism space, and then replacing the
      entrance tube in the destressing unit. (While the entrance tube is
      removed from its normal registry with the geometry of the prism
      space, the ISF within the prism space is less coherent. A property
      of ISFs is that they increasingly condition space to their
      informational properties as a function of time; therefore the
      entrance tube is stored in its regular geometric position in order
      so as not to condition the prism space somewhat incoherently.) The
      typical explanation for a prompt termination to the destressing
      session would be that the individual is still processing physical
      change fallout from a recent improvement to their biofield, and
      therefore is subconsciously signaling the need for more time to
      elapse before attempting more improvement to their field so as to
      not overwhelm their body with the activity of physical change.<br>
      <br>
      Normal time scheduled between destressing sessions would be at
      least a week; however, critically ill individuals tend to process
      change faster and are often scheduled at four day intervals.
      Assuming no involuntary eye movement is observed and therefore
      that the session is not terminated immediately, the operator then
      promptly mentally asks for the protection of the individual from
      any outside negative mental influence, mentally sends
      unconditional love to the individual, and mentally expresses
      gratitude for what is occurring in the session. The individual
      will typically remain within the destressing unit for a total of
      twenty minutes in a single session, with the operator checking the
      monitor for involuntary eye movement every five minutes or so to
      determine whether the session should be terminated sooner than
      twenty minutes, in which case at the end of the session the
      termination procedure is as previously described. The operator
      asks for any perceptions of the individual during the session
      (sensations, experiences, observations). If several sessions occur
      over a few weeks with no perceptions reported by the individual as
      occurring during the sessions and no subsequent benefits are being
      noticed in wellbeing or capabilities, the gain setting will be
      progressively increased by the operator from session to session in
      0.5 increments until effects are beginning to be perceived by the
      individual. Following a session, the operator advises the
      individual to drink plenty of water for at least the four days
      following the session in order to allow detoxing and bodily repair
      processes that tend to follow as a result of destressing to
      operate unimpeded by lack of hydration.<br>

      <b>Parts Specifications and Assembly Instructions for an Exemplary
        Destressing System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The discussion to follow makes reference to tables and figures
      that provide descriptions of exemplary components (e.g.,
      electronic parts), materials, and assembly details associated with
      manufacturing an embodiment of the present invention. The
      discussion is presented within the context of the embodiment of
      FIG. 2k, and the referenced "main assembly" refers to the system
      generally depicted in FIG. 2k. The ISF generator described below
      corresponds to the embodiment depicted in FIG. 8b, while the ball
      radiator corresponds to the embodiment depicted in FIG. 23.
      Notably, many of the steps listed below for construction of the
      main assembly depicted in FIG. 2k can be employed for construction
      of the system depicted in FIG. 2a. Similarly, the ISF generator
      depicted in FIG. 8a can be constructed according to many of the
      steps listed below, with the understanding that the latter
      embodiment does not employ an aluminum housing to contain the
      magnet/capacitor assembly. In addition, apparatus that include
      combinations of the components described above are within the
      scope of this invention. For example, a main assembly constructed
      according to the steps below could incorporate an ISF generator
      built in accordance with the embodiment disclosed in FIG. 8a and a
      ball radiator disclosed in FIG. 22a. Thus, notwithstanding the
      discussion below with respect to the embodiment of FIG. 2k, one of
      ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that similar assembly
      methods could be applied to other embodiments.<br>

      <b>Exemplary Methods for Building the Assemblies</b><br>
      <br>
      The discussion below provides exemplary methods for assembling
      components of a system for destressing in accordance with
      embodiments of the present invention. To aid in understanding,
      reference is made to the Figures.<br>
      <br>
      1. Magnet and Cone ISF Generator<br>
      <br>
      To construct an ISF generator, reference is made to FIGS. 8b, 9,
      10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the following
      exemplary steps are performed:<br>
      <br>
      1. As illustrated in FIG. 14 and FIG. 8b, cut the Bronze and
      Teflon(TM) sheets so that they are 2 times the width of the magnet
      and can be wound 3 times around the magnet. One set is for the
      outside of the magnet, the other for the inside. Then, layer the
      bronze and Teflon(TM) sheets such that the Teflon(TM) is layer
      between the bronze and also insulates the bronze from the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      2. FIG. 9 illustrates connecting of wires to the outer capacitor,
      which is done by cutting back the Teflon(TM) sheet on the outside
      of this capacitor and exposing a small area of bronze sheet. To
      connect to the inner capacitor, the same technique applies, but in
      addition a small v shaped cut needs to be made on the outer
      capacitor since, as seen in the ISF assembly drawing, there is no
      room between the top of the capacitors and the ISF housing (part
      12 in FIG. 15). A one MegaOhm resistor is placed across the
      inputs. An input voltage of up to 150 V can be supplied, where a
      positive bias produces a right handed ISF and negative bias
      produces a left handed ISF.<br>
      <br>
      3. A bulk head BNC connector is mounted to the side wall of the
      aluminum housing (FIG. 15). The aluminum housing can be sheet
      metal or purchased from an electronic supply catalog. A SPST
      toggle switch is mounted next to the BNC connector.<br>
      <br>
      4. A 1 Mega Ohm resistor is soldered across the inputs to the ISF
      generator, typically in between input connector and the wire
      soldered to the inner and outer capacitors.<br>
      <br>
      5. The outside diameter of the ring magnet should match the
      diameter of the copper cone above, as illustrated in FIG. 8b. In
      FIG. 13, exemplary magnet dimensions include a 8.4 mm thickness, a
      60 mm inner diameter design to couple to a 60 mm cone and a 29 mm
      inner diameter.<br>
      <br>
      6. A Teflon(TM) sheet is inserted between the top of the
      capacitors and the ISF housing as well as between the bottom of
      the capacitors and the aluminum plate underneath.<br>
      <br>
      7. As illustrated in FIGS. 8b, 11, and 12 a copper cone 328 is
      mounted to the top of the ISF housing with the top and bottom
      Teflon(TM) mounts, 331 and 333, respectively. In one embodiment,
      the cone is about 37 mm*60 mm. Teflon(TM) screws are used to
      attach mounts 331, 333 to the ISF housing (see FIG. 8). Bottom
      mount 333 is each a 2 mm thick 84 mm*84 mm square gasket having a
      56 mm diameter circular hole in the center and four 1.6 mm
      diameter through holes for fasteners spaced 70 mm apart. Top mount
      331 has similar dimensions as bottom mount 333, except that the
      gasket thickness is 6 mm and the circular hole is beveled at a 51
      degree angle, such that the diameter decreases from 60 mm at the
      bottom of gasket 331 to 48 mm at the top of gasket 331.<br>
      <br>
      8. As illustrated in FIG. 10, copper cone 328 can comprise a 1-2
      mm thick sheet of 99.99% oxygen free copper formed into a cone
      whose base diameter is 60 mm, and having a tapped hole configured
      to accommodate a 1.5 mm or 1/16'' thread screw.<br>
      <br>
      9. Either a copper or bronze screw, or solder, can be used to
      attach a wire to the top of the copper ISF cone 328.<br>
      <br>
      10. A switch can be inserted on either the + or - input lines so
      that the ISF can be switched off independent of the other
      equipment (see FIG. 8).<br>
      <br>
      11. An aluminum base 325 is used to mount the magnet 326. The
      aluminum base 325 is supported by four Teflon(TM) standoffs
      located in the corners. A fiber or Teflon(TM) washer is used to
      center the magnet 329. The distance between the aluminum base and
      top of the housing 330 is twice the thickness of magnet 326.<br>
      <br>
      2. Fiber Coupler<br>
      <br>
      To construct a fiber coupler (also termed coupler), reference is
      made to FIGS. 16, 17, 20.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the following
      exemplary steps are performed:<br>
      <br>
      1. Provide an appropriate length of fiber: A 10M long strand of
      fiber is preferably used.<br>
      <br>
      2. After using the specification in FIG. 17 to create the
      insulator cones, wind 9 turns in an 8 mm pitch spiral, starting at
      0.188'' from the base of the original cone. This offset from the
      base of the cone is due to the fiber board which is glued to the
      base of the cone for mounting and strength. Insulator cone 291
      comprises a 62.8 mm*101.6 mm cone as shown.<br>
      <br>
      3. Direction of windings: In Assembly 06 drawing (FIG. 16), the
      input is on the left and the output is on the right. The
      directions of the windings, when looking down on the apex of the
      input fiber cone is clockwise and it is counter clockwise on the
      output cone.<br>
      <br>
      4. Two 61.8*100 mm copper cones of 0.005'' thick copper are built.
      As illustrated in FIG. 16, the two copper cones are each mounted
      so that the axis of the two input and the two output cones are
      aligned. The distance between the base of the input copper cone
      and the input fiber cone is 3/16''. There is no requirement for
      the distance between the pair of input and the output cones 286a,
      286b. In this drawing they are set 8'' apart for convenience and
      the extra fiber is wound around a small spool 287 that is disposed
      between cone pairs 286a, 286b. The takeup spool 287 is a vertical
      hollow insulator tube having a 1.5'' diameter and height, and
      having four turns of fiber in the example shown in FIG. 16.<br>
      <br>
      5. The cones are mounted on a polymer foam board, such as a
      5''*5'' board.<br>
      <br>
      3. Distribution Box<br>
      <br>
      To construct a distribution box, reference is made to FIG. 25.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the following
      exemplary steps are performed:<br>
      <br>
      1. Using an annealed copper sheet of about 0.005'' thickness cut
      out a hexagon pattern having an inner hexagon portion of about
      1.84'' distance between opposed sides, with triangular tips
      extending 0.66'' outwardly from each hexagonal side, as shown in
      Part 16-01 of FIG. 25. The pyramid shapes that extend from the
      periphery are not separate but are integral to the whole base
      plate 342.<br>
      <br>
      2. Cut a piece out of the annealed copper sheet so that a cone 344
      having the dimensions shown in Part 16-02 of FIG. 25 can be made.
      Use solder along the outside seam to form the cone, which has
      dimensions of about 1'' in height and 1.62'' in diameter.<br>
      <br>
      3. Mount the cone 344 in the center of the base 342, as shown in
      the bottom left of FIG. 25, and use solder to tack down the edges
      of cone 344 in 6 places.<br>
      <br>
      4. Soldered an input wire to the tip of the cone 344 in the manner
      shown in Part 06 (FIG. 20).<br>
      <br>
      5. Solder 6 output wires to the tips of the hexagon pattern.<br>
      <br>
      6. Mount the distribution assembly 340a in a suitable non-metal
      housing.<br>
      <br>
      4. Hexagonal Projector<br>
      <br>
      To construct a hexagonal projector, reference is made to FIGS. 19,
      20, and 21a, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the following
      exemplary steps are performed:<br>
      <br>
      1. Cut part 15-02 to 07 from polymer foam board (see FIG. 19).<br>
      <br>
      2. Cut part 15-01 from the same material (see FIG. 19).<br>
      <br>
      3. Assemble these pieces as shown in FIG. 19. Hot glue or any
      other bonding material can be used to affix parts 15-01 to 15-07
      together. Once assembled, the face of every piece forms a 30
      degree angle with respect to the bottom plane, as shown in FIG.
      20a.<br>
      <br>
      4. Once parts 15-01 to 15-07 are assembled, two slots are cut on
      opposite tips of the hexagon assembly, as shown in the bottom left
      of FIG. 19.<br>
      <br>
      5. Assemble 6 copper cones 218 (the term "copper cones 218" also
      is meant to include phosphor bronze cones, unless otherwise
      indicated) in the manner shown in the drawing for Part 06 (FIG.
      20a). Use solder on the outside seam of the cones.<br>
      <br>
      6. Mount the wires in the manner shown in FIG. 20.<br>
      <br>
      7. Mount the 6 cones 218 in the center of the six faces of the
      hexagon structure 216.<br>
      <br>
      5. Lamp Assembly<br>
      <br>
      To construct a lamp assembly, reference is made to FIGS. 18b.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the following
      exemplary steps are performed:<br>
      <br>
      1. Cut 6 pieces of mirrored glass according to the specifications
      for parts 14-02 to 14-07 (FIG. 18b).<br>
      <br>
      2. Cut a piece in the shape of element 310b (FIG. 18b).<br>
      <br>
      3. Core drill a 1.125'' hole into element 310b (FIG. 18b).<br>
      <br>
      4. Assemble parts to form reflector structure 310 (FIG. 18).
      Mirrored surfaces of the mirrored glass face toward the inside the
      resulting structure 310. Any manner of techniques can be used to
      assemble these pieces but nothing should touch the inside surfaces
      of this assembly 310. Copper foil tape can be used on the outside
      surfaces to hold the assembly together and then a wooden box can
      be made to secure the whole assembly.<br>
      <br>
      5. Build a copper cone 218 as specified in Par 17-02 of FIG. 10.<br>

      <br>
      7. Attach a wire 316, preferably 16 gauge multi-strand wire, with
      copper ball 314, to the wooden dowel 319 with wire ties.<br>
      <br>
      7. Main Assembly<br>
      <br>
      To construct a main assembly, reference is made to FIGS. 2k, 3, 4,
      5, 6, 7b, 2, 24 and 26, respectively. Further detailed description
      of respective parts is also provided below.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the following
      exemplary steps are performed:<br>
      <br>
      1. Cut 6 1'' diameter copper piping 212 to 88'' in length, as
      illustrated in FIG. 2a.<br>
      <br>
      2. Use copper foil tape to outline the pattern 208, as shown in
      FIG. 4. The hole diameter for a pattern of hexagonal through holes
      cut through an inner end member (204b of FIG. 4) is preferably
      about 1.125.'' Copper foil tape is preferably folded at its ends
      that form the star apices, such that the foil tape is folded into
      the 1.125'' diameter holes, in order to endure good contact with
      copper tubes 212 when the end of the tubes are placed into the
      holes. The junctions 204d of copper tape are preferably solder
      together, as illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      3. On an inner panel 204b for the bottom, solder 6 16 gauge wires
      to the tips 210 of the hexagon pattern.<br>
      <br>
      4. Sandwich the inner and outer panels together, as illustrated in
      FIG. 2a. As illustrated in FIG. 3, make sure that an outer panel
      204a having 6 wire feedthrough holes (204c, in the example shown
      in FIG. 3), is joined together with an inner panel (see panel
      204b, FIG. 4) that has six wires soldered to the apices 210 copper
      foil hexagon pattern. The configuration described in steps 3-5 can
      be applied to both end members 204 and 206.<br>
      <br>
      5. As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, a 0.188'' diameter feed
      through hole is also provided in the center of the hexagonal
      patterns in panel 204a and 204b only, which provides for a wire
      connection to a foot panel.<br>
      <br>
      6. Mount a bed 402 (see FIG. 5) to one of the panels 204, 206
      using carriage bolts. Bed 402 preferably comprises a [3/4] Luaun
      Surface finished plywood board, about 33''*86.5.'' The plywood
      board is supported by a series of three wood cross braces 402c
      about 1.5''*9.5''*19.75'' illustrated in FIG. 5. In addition, two
      10''*86.5'' lengthwise braces 402d are used to support bed 202.
      The braces can be secured to bed 402 by 1.25'' deck screws spaced
      at 6'' intervals. In the embodiment of the present invention
      illustrated in FIG. 4, each end member has a height of about
      53.64.'' The bottom side dimension is about 39.17'' and the top
      portion is beveled so that its width is about 13.188'' and the
      side edges have a height of about 46.64.'' The bed is mounted
      about 17.50'' above the bottom of board 204, which is above the
      line described by a pair of lower holes 210 that are 12.625''
      above the lower surface of the end member.<br>
      <br>
      7. Then the six copper tubes 212 are inserted into a first inside
      panel 204b or 206b. The outer four tubes are located 3'' from the
      front and back edges of the end member. The pair of upper holes is
      located 32.375'' above the lower surface of the end member, while
      the topmost hole is located 41.25'' above the lower surface.
      Accordingly, the center wire feedthrough is located about 2''
      above the bed 202. As illustrated in FIG. 4, a slot 204e is
      provided on panel 204b so that one copper tube 212 disposed to the
      outside of panel 204b can be removed, thus promoting easy entry
      and egress to bed 402. Using the second of the inner-outer panels
      206b, 204b align the 6 copper tubes 212 with the holes in the
      second panel, and mount the bed 202 using the appropriate carriage
      bolts.<br>
      <br>
      8. Prepare a top assembly 424 comprising a top panel 424a about
      12.75''*87.5'' as shown in FIG. 6. Support the top assembly using
      two 1.5''*3.5''*12.75'' cross braces 424b and two
      0.75''*3.5''*86.5'' face strips 424cc, the latter preferably made
      from 0.75'' Luaun Surface Finished Plywood. Mount the top assembly
      424 (see FIG. 6) to the support comprising bed 402 (also shown as
      202 in FIG. 2k) and end panels 204, 206, and fasten assembly 424
      in place using 0.375'' diameter carriage bolt holes provided in
      end members 204, 206, as illustrated in FIGS. 2k and 3.<br>
      <br>
      9. As illustrated in FIGS. 24 and 26, place the hexagon assembly
      216 on the top copper tube 212, making sure that the copper tube
      212 fits well inside the two notches 216a (see FIG. 19) cut into
      the two ends of this assembly. In one embodiment, the hexagonal
      assembly support structure 216b comprises a set of 0.188'' thick
      polymer foam board pieces. The notches 216a are formed by cutting
      adjacent portions from abutting pieces of the hexagonal assembly
      to form 3.5''*1.125'' notches, as illustrated in FIG. 19. Use a
      suitable material to build a box 219 between the top of the
      hexagon assembly and the bottom of the top assembly 424, as
      illustrated in FIGS. 24 and 26. A Teflon(TM) sheet is then
      inserted between this box structure 219 and the Top assembly to
      reduce friction. The box structure 219 acts to keep assembly 216
      parallel to bed 402. The hexagon assembly 216 can be enclosed with
      a suitable housing. Once complete, this hexagon assembly 216
      should slide back and forth along the top copper tube 212 with
      ease, but the hexagon assembly 216 must remain parallel with the
      bed 402. Make sure that the center of the cones 218 in the hexagon
      assembly are about 27'' above the bed 402.<br>
      <br>
      10. As illustrated in FIG. 23, a slot is cut in PVC tubing 318 to
      fit around the copper tubing 212. The ball radiator 312 is mounted
      by snapping the slotted PVC 318 over the top copper tube 212
      between the hexagon assembly and the headboard.<br>
      <br>
      11. Mount the IR camera 217 on the top assembly as shown in FIGS.
      2k and 24. The IR camera is adjusted so that the head of an
      individual lying on foam mattress 203 is viewable on a monitor.<br>
      <br>
      12. Mount the IR light source 215 with a suitable gooseneck mount
      as shown in FIGS. 2a and 24. The angle of light source 215 is
      adjusted to illuminate the head of an individual lying on mattress
      203.<br>
      <br>

      276 using a standard phono jack cable 274.<br>
      <br>
      2. Take a standard coax cable with BNC connectors that can be
      bought at any electronics store and cut one of the ends off. Take
      16-gauge speaker wire and solder it to the core wire and another
      wire to the shielding. Connect the core wire to the positive
      speaker terminal and the shield wire to the negative speaker
      terminal (either right or left channel). Connect the other end
      with the BNC connector and attach it to the male BNC input
      connector on the front panel of the high voltage amplifier 278.<br>
      <br>
      3. Take a length of coax wire with BNC connectors that is long
      enough to go from the high voltage amplifier 278 to the ISF
      generator 282, which is placed close to the main assembly. Cut one
      of the BNC connectors off and attach banana plugs to the positive
      and negative wires and insert the banana plugs into the positive
      and negative output terminals on the front panel of the high
      voltage amplifier 278. Take the other BNC connector and connect it
      to the female BNC connector on the ISF generator 282.<br>
      <br>
      4. Connect the switch 280 on the ISF generator terminal between
      the negative end of the bulk head BNC connector and the outside
      bronze/Teflon(TM) capacitor 324 (FIG. 8b). Make sure that the
      positive input of the bulk head BNC connector is connected to the
      inner bronze/Teflon(TM) capacitor. Use appropriate solder to make
      both connections.<br>
      <br>
      5. Referring again to FIG. 8b, take a 16 gauge multi-strand wire
      and connect it to the tip of the copper cone 328 on the ISF
      generator. This can be done by either soldering the wire to the
      tip of the cone 328 or by solder a ring connector to the wire and
      using the appropriate screw to tighten the ring connector to the
      tip of the cone. The other end of this wire is connected to the
      input of the fiber coupler assembly 286 (FIG. 27a). It is possible
      to use a male and female connector in the wire between the ISF
      generator and the fiber coupler, but any connector used must not
      have lead based solder. Copper connectors with no solder are
      preferable, but nickel plated connectors will also work. It can be
      seen from FIG. 16 that the input and output wire of the fiber
      coupler 286 are attached to the tip of the copper cones in the
      manner shown in FIG. 16.<br>
      <br>
      6. Referring again to FIG. 27a, use the same 16 gauge wire to make
      a connection from the output of the fiber coupler 286 to the input
      of the distribution assembly 340. The input wire of the
      distribution assembly is connected to the tip of the cone in this
      assembly. Again, wire attachment is done in the same manner as
      shown in the drawing for FIG. 16. The 6 output wires are soldered
      to the 6 tips of the base of the distribution assembly. Each of
      these 6 wires is connected to one of the cones on the hexagon
      projector 290, as depicted in FIG. 27a.<br>
      <br>
      7. The connections for the lamp assembly 304 are made as follows.
      A 110V power supply cord is connected to the lamp socket base.
      This cord is then plugged into the output of the SCR dimmer
      control.<br>
      <br>
      8. Referring again to FIG. 2k, the video output plug from the IR
      camera 217 is connected to video input of any TV purchase for this
      device. The IR camera as specified comes with a separate
      transformer for DC power.<br>
      <br>
      10. Setting Up and Optimizing the Electronics<br>
      <br>
      Below is an exemplary set of steps for setting up and optimizing
      the electronic components of a destressing system, according to
      one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      1. Insert a CD into the CD player 272.<br>
      <br>
      2. Use an oscilloscope to measure the speaker output of the sound
      amplifier 276. Adjust the volume control until the speaker output
      has a median value of 5 V peak-to-peak and should not exceed 10 V
      peak-to-peak during any portion of the music.<br>
      <br>
      3. Before turning on the high voltage (HV) amplifier 278, turn the
      gain to minimum. Hook up the ISF generator 282 to the HV amplifier
      278. Make sure the switch 280 on the ISF generator is off. Use an
      oscilloscope to measure the output of the HV amplifier. Set the
      Bias Polarity to positive. Adjust the Bias offset so that there is
      a positive 150 V bias. Now turn up the gain and make sure that at
      no point during does the signal go below zero volts DC. If this
      does happen, the more Bias offset needs to be applied. Once the
      bias set, turn the gain back down and this part of the electronics
      is ready.<br>
      <br>
      4. Plug the IR camera supply into a power strip. Once this is
      turned on, turn the IR light 215 on and the system is ready to be
      optimize to the person in the resting in the device.<br>
      <br>
      5. Plug the SCR into the same power strip as the IR camera. As
      power switch on the front panel of the SCR is used to turn it on.<br>
      <br>
