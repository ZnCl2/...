      <div align="center"><big><b>Graphene's love affair with water</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Graphene has proven itself as a wonder material with a vast range
      of unique properties. Among the least-known marvels of graphene is
      its strange love affair with water.<br>
      <br>
      Graphene is hydrophobic - it repels water - but narrow capillaries
      made from graphene vigorously suck in water allowing its rapid
      permeation, if the water layer is only one atom thick - that is,
      as thin as graphene itself.<br>
      <br>
      This bizarre property has attracted intense academic and
      industrial interest with intent to develop new water filtration
      and desalination technologies.<br>
      <br>
      One-atom-wide graphene capillaries can now be made easily and
      cheaply by piling layers of graphene oxide - a derivative of
      graphene - on top of each other. The resulting multilayer stacks
      (laminates) have a structure similar to nacre (mother of pearl),
      which makes them also mechanically strong.<br>
      <br>
      Two years ago, University of Manchester researchers discovered
      that thin membranes made from such laminates were impermeable to
      all gases and vapours, except for water. This means that even
      helium, the hardest gas to block off, cannot pass through the
      membranes whereas water vapour went through with no resistance.<br>
      <br>
      Now the same team led by Dr Rahul Nair and Prof Andre Geim has
      tested how good the graphene membranes are as filters for liquid
      water. The results appear in the latest issue (Feb 14, 2014) of
      Science.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers report that, if immersed in water, the laminates
      become slightly swollen but still allow ultrafast flow of not one
      but two monolayers of water.<br>
      <br>
      Small salts with a size of less than nine Angstroms can flow along
      but larger ions or molecules are blocked. Ten Angstroms is
      equivalent to a billionth of a metre.<br>
      <br>
      The graphene filters have an astonishingly accurate mesh that
      allows them to distinguish between atomic species that are only a
      few percent different in size.<br>
      <br>
      On top of this ultraprecise separation, it is also ultrafast.
      Those ions that can go through do so with such a speed as if the
      graphene membranes were an ordinary coffee filter.<br>
      <br>
      The latter effect is due to a property that the Manchester
      scientists call "ion sponging". Their graphene capillaries suck up
      small ions as powerful hoovers leading to internal concentrations
      that can be hundreds of times higher than in external salty
      solutions.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Nair said: "The water filtration is as fast and as precise as
      one could possibly hope for such narrow capillaries. Now we want
      to control the graphene mesh size and reduce it below nine
      Angstroms to filter out even the smallest salts like in seawater.
      Our work shows that it is possible."<br>
      <br>
      Dr Irina Grigorieva, a co-author of the study, added: "Our
      ultimate goal is to make a filter device that allows a glass of
      drinkable water made from seawater after a few minutes of hand
      pumping. We are not there yet but this is no longer science
      fiction".<br>

          <b>Separation of Water Using a Membrane</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      This invention relates to uses of graphene oxide, and in
      particular graphene oxide on a porous support, and a membrane
      comprising these materials. This invention also relates to methods
      of dehydration, which include vapour phase separation and
      pervaporation. Pervaporation is a method of separating mixtures of
      liquids using a membrane. Pervaporation consists of two basic
      steps: permeation of the permeate through the membrane and
      evaporation of the permeate from the other side of the membrane.
      Pervaporation is a mild which can be used to separate components
      which would not survive the comparatively harsh conditions needed
      for distillation (high temp, and/or low pressure).<br>
      <br>
      [0001] This invention relates to uses of graphene oxide, and in
      particular graphene oxide on a porous support, and a membrane
      comprising these materials. This invention also relates to methods
      of dehydration, which include vapour phase separation and
      pervaporation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Separation of water from other substances is of great
      utility in a wide variety of contexts.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The separation of water vapour from other gases can be
      achieved using hydrophilic membranes, which allow water to pass
      through but not the gas which is being purified.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] ‘Raw’ natural gas contains a number of impurities,
      including water vapour which must be removed before it can be
      used. Likewise, naturally occurring helium gas often contains
      water vapour which must be removed for many applications. Crude
      oil also frequently needs to be dehydrated as part of the refining
      process.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Water vapour can interfere with gas phase detector systems
      and pre-separation of water from the gaseous mixture can improve
      the sensitivity and longevity of such systems. The removal of
      water vapour from these and other gaseous systems may be
      advantageous and is an aim of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Many industries use the removal of water as a way of
      concentrating mixtures. Thus, the food industry will concentrate
      fruit juices, sugar, and milk (e.g. before cheese production) and
      many other industries (e.g. the galvanic industry) will
      concentrate their waste products in order to reduce the cost of
      transport and/or disposal.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Pervaporation is a method of separating mixtures of liquids
      using a membrane. Pervaporation consists of two basic steps:
      permeation of the permeate through the membrane and evaporation of
      the permeate from the other side of the membrane. Pervaporation is
      a mild process. Thus, it can be used to separate components which
      would not survive the comparatively harsh conditions needed for
      distillation (high temp, and/or low pressure). It is a low-energy
      alternative to distillation.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Pervaporation can be used to remove trace quantities of an
      impurity from a liquid. For example, hydrophilic membranes can be
      used to remove water from organic solvents, and can provide the
      solvent in a higher purity than conventional means. One particular
      use is to purify compounds which form azeotropic mixtures with
      water, such as ethanol and isopropanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Hydrophilic membranes can be used for the removal of water
      from fermentation broths or from condensation reactions such as
      esterification.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The currently most preferred hydrophillic membranes for
      pervaporation are zeolites such as those based on zeolite A. These
      materials have a number of drawbacks. As zeolites are
      polycrystalline, their formation into a stable membrane can be
      problematic. Zeolites dissolve in relatively weakly acidic
      conditions (below about pH 4) and this can limit the possible
      applications. It is also hard to find an effective support for
      such membranes.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Polymeric membranes are also widely used, but they are
      generally less-selective.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Graphene is believed to be impermeable to all gases and
      liquids. Submicrometer thick membranes made from graphene oxide
      are impermeable to most liquids, vapours and gases, including
      helium. However, an academic study has shown that, surprisingly,
      graphene oxide membranes which are effectively composed of
      graphene oxide having a thickness around 1 μm are permeable to
      water even though they are impermeable to helium. These graphene
      oxide sheets allow unimpeaded permeation of water (10&lt;10
      &gt;times faster than He) (Nair et al. Science, 2012, 335,
      442-444). The paper does not, however, disclose any workable
      membranes made from graphene oxide sheets nor does it disclose any
      practical applications of this material as a membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The present invention aims to provide a means for
      dehydration (i.e. the separation of water or water vapour from a
      system) which is effective at a wider range of conditions than
      existing technologies. The system from which water is to be
      separated may be a mixture of gases or it may be a mixture of one
      or more liquids contaminated by water (e.g. a fuel system).<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The present invention also aims to provide a means for
      dehydration which is as selective or more selective than existing
      technologies.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The present invention also aims to provide a means for
      dehydration which uses a material that is cheaper and/or easier to
      prepare in bulk than the materials of existing technologies.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The present invention also aims to provide a means for
      dehydration which is more efficient, in terms of yield or in terms
      of energy input than existing technologies.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The present invention also aims to provide a means for
      dehydration which is durable and has good longevity. This allows
      the material to be reused and/or recycled. This is particularly
      relevant for industrial uses.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The present invention satisfies some or all of the above
      aims.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] We have found that sheets of graphene oxide, when combined
      with a porous support, can be used to selectively separate water
      or water vapour from fluid systems such as a gas, a liquid or
      mixtures of gases and liquids.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><br>
      <br>
      [0020] In a first aspect of the present invention is provided the
      use of a graphene oxide membrane for the dehydration of a product,
      wherein the graphene oxide membrane comprises a layer of graphene
      oxide on a porous support.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Dehydration comprises the separation of water from a
      product.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In an embodiment, the separation is by pervaporation.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In an alternative embodiment, the separation is by gas or
      vapour phase separation.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In an embodiment, the use is in a detector system. The
      species being detected may be water or it may be the dehydrated
      liquid or gas. In this case, it may be that, were it present,
      water would interfere in the detection of the dehydrated liquid or
      gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In an alternative embodiment, the use is in gas drying. In
      an alternative embodiment, the use is in gas humidification.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In an embodiment, the use is in a concentration step.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In an embodiment, the use is a continuous process.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In a second aspect of the present invention is provided a
      method of separating water from a product, the method comprising:<br>
      <br>
      [0029] contacting the mixture of water and product with a first
      surface of a graphene oxide membrane, wherein the graphene oxide
      membrane comprises a layer of graphene oxide on a porous support;<br>
      <br>
      [0030] removing the water from a second surface of the graphene
      oxide membrane.<br>
      <br>
      The graphene oxide is provided on a porous support. This means
      that the graphene oxide is physically supported by the porous
      support, but does not impose any limitation on the position of the
      porous support relative to the position of the layer of graphene
      oxide. Thus, the porous support may be provided on one side of the
      layer of graphene oxide, this being the “top” or “bottom” side, or
      indeed there may be more than one porous support associated with
      the layer of graphene oxide, in which case the porous supports may
      be disposed on different sides of the layer of graphene oxide or
      they may be on the same side.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In an embodiment, the method of separating is a method of
      separating by pervaporation.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In an embodiment, the method of separating is a method of
      separating by gas or vapour phase separation.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In an embodiment, the method is continuous.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] One effect of removing water from a product is that the
      product necessarily becomes more concentrated. This could be the
      purpose of the use or method of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that
      the water passes through the layer of graphene oxide due to
      capillary action or other surface forces between individual water
      molecules and the graphene oxide. This unusual permeation property
      is due to the unique structure of GO membrane. The speed of water
      molecules inside graphene oxide membranes is high due to the low
      frictional graphitic structure of the membrane. It is believed
      that this mechanism is not available to other compounds. It is not
      necessary to pressurise the system i.e. the product which is to be
      dehydrated in order to effect dehydration as the water is able to
      pass selectively through the membrane. Separation may however be
      effected under the influence of pressure and/or the application of
      a vacuum. The water which is recovered from the “far” side of the
      membrane after the water has passed through the membrane and been
      released from the second surface of the membrane can be removed
      using a variety of methods or it can simply be left or allowed to
      evaporate. Active removal of the separated water is not essential
      to the functioning of the membrane in the dehydration process,
      i.e. in many cases no specific action is required.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In a third aspect of the present invention, there is
      provided, a composite semi-permeable membrane in the form of a
      laminar structure comprising at least a layer of graphene oxide
      and a layer of porous support.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The term “semi-permeable” refers to the fact that the
      composite graphene oxide membrane is impermeable to all gases and
      liquids but it can selectively allow permeation of water whilst
      being impermeable to gases, such as helium, and other vapours and
      liquids. Thus, in this case the membrane is exclusively pervious
      to water and water vapour. It also refers to the fact that
      composite membrane as a whole can, in some embodiments, allow
      selective passage of a limited number of other materials such as
      ethanol, ethanol and propanol, and similar small polar molecules
      but remains impermeable to other gases and liquids.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] We have found that the nature of the porous support on to
      which the graphene oxide is deposited is important to the overall
      performance of the graphene oxide membrane composite structure and
      its ability to allow permeation. In other words, the porous
      support can modulate the ability of the overall graphene oxide
      membrane to allow selective permeation of liquid or vapour such as
      water. However, other small polar molecules may permeate through
      the membrane or may be prevented entirely by the membrane. In this
      respect the term “small polar molecules” specifically excludes
      water. The graphene oxide membrane according to the invention will
      always allow the permeation of water and the membrane materials
      thus govern the extent to which other small polar molecules such
      as C1-4 alcohols and the like will permeate or be excluded.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In an embodiment, the porous support is an inorganic
      material. Thus, the porous support (e.g. membrane) may comprise a
      ceramic. Preferably, the support is alumina, zeolite, or silica.
      In one embodiment, the support is alumina. Zeolite A can also be
      used. Ceramic pervaporation membranes have also been produced in
      which the active layer is amorphous titania or silica produced by
      a sol-gel process.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In an alternate embodiment, the support is a polymeric
      material. Preferably it is PTFE, PVDF or Cyclopore™ polycarbonate.
      In an embodiment, the porous support (e.g. membrane) may comprise
      a polymer. In an embodiment, the polymer may comprise a synthetic
      polymer. Historically, commercial pervaporatino membranes were
      generally based on poly(vinyl alcohol and more recently,
      polyimides have been used. These can be used in the invention.
      Alternatively, the polymer may comprise a natural polymer or
      modified natural polymer. Thus, the polymer may comprise a polymer
      based on cellulose.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In another embodiment, the porous support (e.g. membrane)
      may comprise a carbon monolith.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In an embodiment, the graphene oxide layer has a thickness
      of no more than a few tens of μm, and ideally is less than about
      100 μm. Preferably, it has a thickness of 50 μm or less, more
      preferably of 10 μm or less, and yet more preferably is less 5 μm.
      In some cases it is preferably is less than about 1 μm thick. For
      most membrane applications, the active layer is made as thin as
      possible (less than 1 micrometre) to increase the flux.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In an embodiment, the porous support has a surface
      roughness which is the same as or smoother than as PTFE.
      Preferably, the surface roughness is less than that of PTFE i.e.
      it is smoother.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Preferably, the porous support is as smooth as Anodisc
      alumina. Normally, one might think of PTFE as smooth and alumina
      as rough. However, the reference to alumina here refers
      specifically to the very special case of “Anopore”™ alumina.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In an embodiment, the choice of the porous support is
      determined by the relative smoothness of its surface and the
      identity of the material which is intended to be allowed to
      permeate or to be stopped by the membrane structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] We can also modify the permeability of GO and hence of the
      membrane as a whole by modifying not only surface roughness but
      also other parameters (eg. GO flake structure. For example, if
      flat GO is replaced by corrugated or crumpled GO it is possible to
      control the pore size. This will allow passage of other small
      molecules also through GO membranes. This provides a means to
      alter the selectivity of permeation of the GO coating and
      consequently also the membrane as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In an embodiment, the porous support layer has a thickness
      of no more than a few tens of μm, and ideally is less than about
      100 μm. Preferably, it has a thickness of 50 μm or less, more
      preferably of 10 μm or less, and yet more preferably is less 5 μm.
      In some cases it may be less than about 1 μm thick though
      preferably it is more than about 1 μm.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] For ceramic pervaporation membranes, the support may be
      rather thick (e.g., tubular structures of 7 mm internal diameter,
      10 mm outside diameter, i.e. thickness 3 mm) in order to achieve
      sufficient mechanical strength. However, polymeric membranes are
      generally much thinner (e.g., for hydrophilic polyethersulfone
      membranes, the thicknesses are in the range 90-180 micrometres for
      some applications, whilst thicknesses in the range 110-150
      micrometres are quoted for other applications. Also, a polymeric
      support may be “asymmetric”, with a large pore size substructure
      and smaller pores at one surface. Thin polymeric supports may also
      be further supported on, e.g., a fabric.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In an embodiment, the ratio of the thicknesses of the
      graphene oxide layer to porous support layer is in the range from
      10:1 to 1:10. Usually, the thickness of the graphene oxide layer
      is less than the thickness of the porous support layer. The ratio
      is ideally from 1:1 to 1:10, and preferably is from 1:2 to 1:10.
      However, in some applications the ratios may be reversed, with the
      preference being for a thicker graphene oxide layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In an alternative embodiment, the porous support layer is
      considerably thicker i.e. from 10 to 1000 times thicker than the
      graphene oxide layer. In this embodiment, the above quoted ratios
      for the relative thicknesses of the graphene oxide layer and the
      porous support layer do not apply. This is because the graphene
      oxide layer must usually have a thickness of no more than 100 μm.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In an embodiment, the porous support is no more hydrophobic
      than PTFE, and preferably it is more hydrophilic than PTFE. In
      this respect, Anopore™ alumina is better as a support than a
      polymeric material such as PTFE is. The choice of porous support
      will thus depend on the hydrophilicity of the material used as the
      support in a graphene oxide membrane composite structure and the
      identity of the material which is intended to be allowed to
      permeate. The skilled person has a wide variety of more
      hydrophilic polymers than PTFE which are available for use in the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Hydrophilicity is a well understood term and the
      hydrophilicity of a material is easily determined by conventional
      methods. For example, hydrophilicity may be quantified in terms
      of, e.g., water contact angle or surface energy. For commercial
      materials such information is directly available from suppliers.
      Typical quoted values of water contact angle are: PTFE 123 deg;
      PVDF 111 deg; polycarbonate 70 deg., polyethersulfone 54 deg. The
      measurement of this angle can be performed using a Kruss drop
      analyser which is widely used the fields of both chemistry and
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The effects of smoothness and hydrophilicity can be
      additive in some cases, or they may act independently; this is
      substrate dependent. However, the above-described general
      principles still apply in terms of the separate, or combined,
      effects of increasing smoothness and increasing hydrophilicity on
      permeation. Without wishing to be bound by theory, we consider
      that the smoothness of the substrate is more important for GO
      coating than hydrophilicity is. This may be because graphene
      always tries to follow the structure of the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In some cases the effect of substrate hydrophobicity on GO
      coating quality can be reduced significantly in importance
      relative to the surface smoothness effects by using GO dispersions
      in other polar solvents (eg. methanol, ethanol, NMP, DMF,
      chloroform, etc)<br>
      <br>
      [0055] We are thus able to produce a membrane whose permeation
      characteristics can be tailored to allow passage of water and/or
      to allow passage of or exclude the passage of other small polar
      solvents such as methanol, ethanol and propanol whilst remaining
      completely impermeable to other fluids such as gases and liquids.
      In this respect, the term “small polar molecules” specifically
      excludes water.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The graphene oxide membrane according to the invention will
      always allow the permeation of water and the membrane materials
      thus govern the extent to which other small polar molecules such
      as C1-4 alcohols and the like will permeate the membrane or be
      excluded by the membrane whilst allowing water to pass through.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In some embodiments, it is possible to produce a membrane
      which is able to separate molecules of identical weight such as
      different isomers of the same compounds. For example, we have
      found higher flux for 1-propanol than 2-propanol and thus it may
      be possible to use the membrane either to separate completely
      isomers such as these from one another, or to enrich a mixture of
      the isomers in one particular isomer. Thus for example, a linear
      isomer may be separated from a branched isomer.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In one embodiment, methanol and ethanol are small polar
      molecules which are of particular interest in terms of the ability
      to allow under certain circumstances selective transmission
      through the membrane. In an alternative embodiment, denial of
      passage through the membrane structure of small polar molecules
      such as these in their entirety is desirable.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] We can also tailor the nature of the GO coating itself.
      This is a useful feature of the invention. Thus the permeability
      of the GO membrane can also be modified by modifying the GO
      coating itself to alter the spacing between the GO sheets.
      Permeation is purely dependent on the interlayer distance between
      graphene oxide sheets. We can tailor the interlayer distance by
      inserting (intercalating) GO with other atoms/molecules. If the
      interlayer distance is less than 0.7 nm (fully dried state) it
      completely blocks everything including water. In the wet
      conditions interlayer distance can be vary up to 1.3 nm depending
      on the hydration level.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In the fully wet conditions, molecular permeation through
      GO is depends on the solubility of that molecule in water and the
      size of the molecule. If the size of the molecule is less than the
      size of the capillary diameter then it permeatse with water;
      otherwise it will get physically blocked by the capillary.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Membranes of this type will have a number of uses in
      diverse applications in gas drying and liquid drying. The
      membranes of the third aspect can be used in the uses and methods
      described respectively in the first and second aspects of the
      invention above.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The following embodiments may also apply to any of the
      first second and third aspects of the invention referred to above.
      These individual embodiments may also be combined with one or more
      other embodiments in any combination.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The porous support may comprise a layer of porous membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The product may comprise one or more compounds. In an
      embodiment, at least some of the product is in the form of a gas
      or a vapour. Thus, it may be that the product is substantially in
      the form of a gas or vapour. Or, it may be that the product is
      substantially in the form of a liquid. In an embodiment, at least
      one compound of the product is entirely in the form of a gas or a
      vapour. In an embodiment, the product is entirely in the form of a
      gas or a vapour.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In an embodiment, at least some of the water to be
      separated is in the form of water vapour. Thus, it may be that the
      water is substantially in the form of a gas or vapour. Or, it may
      be that the water is substantially in the form of a liquid. In an
      embodiment, the water is entirely in the form of a gas or a
      vapour.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In a specific embodiment, the product and the water are
      entirely in the form of a gas or a vapour.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In another specific embodiment, the product and the water
      are substantially in the form of a liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In embodiments in which the layer of graphene oxide is
      supported on a layer of porous membrane, the graphene oxide
      membrane on a porous support is a composite material. The material
      will comprise one or more layers of graphene oxide and one or more
      layers of porous membrane in the form of a laminate or thin layer
      composite. It will have two surfaces, a first surface which is in
      contact with the product/water mixture and into which the water
      (and, in some embodiments, product) will enter the composite
      material and a second surface from which the water (and, in some
      embodiments, product) will exit the composite material.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Each surface may be the outer surface of a graphene oxide
      layer or a porous membrane layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In an embodiment, the first surface of the composite
      material is the outer surface of a graphene oxide layer and the
      second surface is the outer surface of a porous membrane layer. In
      an alternative embodiment, the first surface is the outer surface
      of a porous membrane layer and the second surface is the outer
      surface of a graphene oxide layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In some embodiments, the or each graphene oxide layer is
      sandwiched between two layers of porous membrane. Thus, in another
      embodiment, both surfaces of the composite material are the outer
      surfaces of a porous membrane layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In some alternative embodiments, the or each porous
      membrane layer is sandwiched between two layers of graphene oxide.
      Thus, in another embodiment, both surfaces of the composite
      material are the outer surfaces of graphene oxide layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In its simplest form, the graphene oxide membrane comprises
      only a layer of graphene oxide and a layer of a porous membrane.
      However, the laminate structure, when composed of three or more
      layers may be symmetrical in the case of alternative layers of
      graphene oxide and porous membrane as described above or it may
      have any arrangement of different layers of graphene oxide and
      porous membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Throughout this specification, the term ‘layer’ when
      applied to graphene oxide, refers to a layer which may itself
      comprise any number of individual molecular layers of graphene
      oxide. Thus, the ‘layer’ referred to in this specification is not
      necessarily a single molecular layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Thus, in an embodiment, the or each graphene oxide layer is
      between 100 nm and 10 μm thick. In an embodiment, the composite
      material comprises a single graphene oxide layer. In another
      embodiment, the composite material comprises a single graphene
      oxide layer between 100 nm and 10 μm thick. This thickness of
      material represents the optimum balance between porosity and
      selectivity.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The porous support should be porous enough not to interfere
      with water transport but have small enough pores that graphene
      oxide platelets cannot enter the pores. Thus, the porous support
      must be water permeable. In an embodiment, the pore size must be
      less than 1 μm. In an embodiment, the support has a uniform
      pore-structure. Examples of porous membranes with a uniform pore
      structure are electrochemically manufactured alumina membranes
      (e.g. those with the trade names: Anopore™, Anodisc™).<br>
      <br>
      [0077] In an embodiment, the composite material may comprise two
      or more layers of porous membrane. In this embodiment, the two or
      more layers may comprise different materials. ‘Different
      materials’ are meant to include materials with the same chemical
      composition but differing forms or differing structures, e.g.
      differing pore sizes. Of course, ‘different materials’ also
      includes materials with different chemical compositions. The two
      or more layers may comprise two layers with different pore sizes<br>
      <br>
      [0078] In an alternative embodiment, the two or more layers may
      comprise the same material.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The porous support may be in the form of a flat sheet, a
      hollow fibre, a tube or a monolith structure. The graphene oxide
      layer may thus be presented as a coating on one or both of the
      surfaces of porous support.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] In embodiments of the invention, the product is a mixture
      of chemical entities which contains, or is suspected to contain,
      at least one target compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In a more specific embodiment, the product is a gaseous
      mixture of chemical entities which contains, or is suspected to
      contain, at least one target compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] In an embodiment, the at least one target compound is
      harmful. In a further embodiment, the at least one target compound
      is harmful to the environment. In an alternative embodiment, the
      at least one target compound is harmful to animals, and in
      particular humans. The at least one target compound may be toxic.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] In an embodiment, the product is natural gas. In an
      alternative embodiment, the product is helium. In yet another
      alternative, the product is crude oil.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] In an embodiment, the product is a fermentation broth or
      has been extracted from a fermentation broth.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] In an embodiment, the fermentation broth has a pH less than
      about 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] The product may comprise an alcohol, e.g. a C1-C15 alcohol
      and more particularly a C1-C6 alcohol. Thus, the product may
      comprise ethanol. The product may also comprise methanol. The
      product may also comprise butanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The product may comprise one or more alkanes, e.g. one or
      more C1-C15 alkanes. The product may comprise one or more C1-C10
      alkanes.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The product may also comprise one or more organic molecules
      selected from acetone; acetaldehyde; acetic acid; formic acid;
      propanoic acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In an alternative embodiment, the product is a complex
      mixture of compounds. In such cases the purpose of the use or
      method of the invention may simply be the concentration of the
      product. Thus, the product may be selected from: a food stuff
      (e.g. fruit juice, sugar, milk) or an industrial product or waste
      stream, (e.g. those arising from the galvanic industry).<br>
      <br>
      [0090] In an embodiment, a vacuum or sweep gas is applied to the
      second surface of the graphene oxide membrane to remove the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In an embodiment, the water is allowed to evaporate and no
      specific action is taken to remove the water.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0098] This invention relates to the separation of water from
      other chemical entities. In the context of this application,
      ‘separation’ can be understood to mean that the proportion of the
      product mixture which is water is lower after the separation than
      it was before the separation. In some cases, water will be
      substantially or even entirely removed from the product. In other
      cases, water will be partially removed from the product. The water
      which has been separated will, in some cases, be substantially or
      entirely pure (i.e. free of the product). In other cases, the
      water will contain some product.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The invention relates to the separation of water from one
      or more products. The term ‘product’ may mean any chemical
      species. In an embodiment, a product may be any gas, e.g. an
      elemental gas. A product may be an organic molecule. Thus, a
      product may be any species which is a gas at standard temperatures
      and pressures, e.g. H2, N2, O2, methane, ethane, ethene, ethyne,
      ethylene oxide, propane, butane, He, Ar, Ne, CO2, CO H2S, SO2,
      NOx, etc. A product may be a liquid at standard temperatures and
      pressure such as pentane, hexane, decane, ethanol, methanol,
      propanol, acetone, butanol etc. The water may be separated from
      any single product, or a mixture of any two, three or four
      products or a complex mixture of many products.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] In some embodiments, at least some of any one or more
      products are in the form of a gas or a vapour. In other words, a
      product may be partially in a gas or vapour form and partially in
      a liquid form. It may be that all of the products are partially in
      the gas or vapour form and partially in a liquid form. It may also
      be that one or more products are entirely in the gas or vapour
      form and one or more other products are partially in the gas or
      vapour form and partially in a liquid form. Thus, if at least some
      of the water is in the form of water vapour, then that means that
      the water is partially in the liquid phase and partially in the
      form of water vapour. It is within the scope of this invention
      that any product or water may be present in the gas or vapour
      phase, the liquid phase and the solid phase. Likewise, it is
      within the scope of this invention that any product may be
      partially present in the solid phase and partially present in the
      gas or vapour phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] It is within the scope of this invention that the water and
      one or more products are in the liquid phase and are in contact
      with the porous membrane and/or the graphene oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] Support materials with pore size in the range 0.1 to 10
      micrometers are commonly referred to as microfiltration membranes.
      Membrane materials with pore size in the range 0.001 to 0.1
      micrometers are commonly referred to as ultrafiltration membranes.
      However, porous structures having a pore size in the range 100 nm
      (0.1 micrometers) to 500 nm are also effective in the membranes of
      the present invention and we have used membranes in the range of
      150 nm to 300 nm e.g. 200 nm to demonstrate impermeability even at
      larger pore sizes (see examples).<br>
      <br>
      [0103] The porous membrane may comprise a synthetic polymer.
      Examples of synthetic polymers include: polysulfones (e.g., PALL
      HT Tuffryn®); polyethersulfones (e.g., PALL Supor®, Millipore
      Express®, Sartorius PES); polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF; e.g.,
      PALL FP Vericel™, Millipore Durapore®); polypropylene (e.g., PALL
      GH Polypro); acrylic polymers (e.g., PALL Versapor®); polyamide
      (Nylon) (e.g, PALL Nylaflo™, Sartorius NY); and
      polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; e.g. Millipore Omnipore™).<br>
      <br>
      [0104] The porous membrane may comprise a natural polymer or
      modified natural polymer. Examples of natural polymer and modified
      natural polymer polymers include: cellulose esters (e.g.,
      Millipore MF-Millipore™); cellulose nitrate (e.g., Sartorius CN);
      cellulose acetate (e.g., Sartorius CA); and regenerated cellulose
      (e.g., Sartorius RC).<br>
      <br>
      [0105] The porous membrane may comprise a carbon monolith. An
      example of a suitable monolith would be those prepared by
      carbonization of polymerized high internal phase emulsions (see D.
      Wang, N. L. Smith and P. M. Budd, Polymer Int., 2005, 54,
      297-303).<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The porous membrane may comprise an inorganic material.
      Examples of appropriate inorganic materials include: Aluminium
      oxide (Al2O3, Alumina; e.g., Anodisk; Anopore™); Metal
      oxide/ceramic (e.g., Veolia Water Solutions CeraMem®); Silicon
      carbide (SiC; e.g., Veolia Water Solutions CeraMem®); Zirconium
      oxide; Silicon dioxide; Titanium dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] The graphene oxide for use in this application can be made
      by any means known in the art. In a preferred method, graphite
      oxide can be prepared from natural graphite flakes by treating
      them with potassium permanganate and sodium nitrate in
      concentrated sulphuric acid. This method is called Hummers method.
      Another method is the Brodie method, which involves adding
      potassium chlorate (KClO3) to a slurry of graphite in fuming
      nitric acid. For a review see, Dreyer et al. The chemistry of
      graphene oxide, Chem. Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 228-240.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Individual graphene oxide (GO) sheets can then be
      exfoliated by dissolving graphite oxide in water with the help of
      ultrasound, and bulk residues can then be removed by
      centrifugation.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] The preparation of graphene oxide supported on a porous
      membrane can be achieved using filtration, spray coating, casting
      or dip coating techniques. For large scale production of supported
      graphene based membranes or sheets it is preferred to use spray
      coating techniques. One benefit of spray coating is that spraying
      GO solution in water on to the porous support material at an
      elevated temperature produces a large uniform GO film.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] Previously, graphene had been believed to be impermeable to
      all gases and liquids but in the present application we
      demonstrate that, surprisingly, a composite structure made from
      graphene oxide provided on a porous support can selectively allow
      permeation of water whilst being impermeable to gases, such as
      helium, and other vapours and liquids. However, we have also found
      that the properties of the graphene oxide composite as a whole can
      be modulated so as to allow selective passage of a limited number
      of other materials by changing the porous support.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] We have found that the nature of the porous support on to
      which the graphene oxide is deposited is important to the overall
      performance of the graphene oxide membrane composite structure and
      its ability to allow permeation. In other words, the porous
      support can modulate the ability of the overall graphene oxide
      membrane to allow selective permeation of liquid or vapour such as
      water. However, other small polar molecules may permeate through
      the membrane or may be prevented entirely by the membrane. In this
      respect the term “small polar molecules” specifically excludes
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] The graphene oxide membrane according to the invention will
      always allow the permeation of water and the membrane materials
      thus govern the extent to which other small polar molecules such
      as C1-4 alcohols and the like will permeate or be excluded.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] One factor governing the permeation is the smoothness of
      the surface of the porous support. A smooth porous support such as
      alumina is better at resisting transmission of a small polar
      molecule such as propanol than a rougher porous support such as
      PTFE or PVDF (polyvinyldifluoride) is when used with graphene
      oxide in a graphene oxide membrane composite. Thus the choice of
      the porous support will be determined in part by the relative
      smoothness of its surface and the identity of the material which
      is intended to be allowed to permeate or to be stopped by the
      membrane structure. Ideally, the support should have a surface
      roughness which is the same as or less than that of PTFE.
      Preferably, the surface roughness is less than that of PTFE.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] Another important factor is the hydrophilicity of the
      porous support. A more hydrophilic support performs better in
      allowing selective permeation of small polar molecules such as
      propanol when used in combination with graphene oxide than a less
      hydrophilic support does. In this respect, alumina is better as a
      support than a polymeric material such as PTFE is if preventing
      permeation of small polar molecules to a higher degree or totally
      is the intention. The choice of porous support will thus depend on
      the hydrophilicity of the material used as the support in a
      graphene oxide membrane composite structure and the identity of
      the material which is intended to be allowed to permeate. Ideally,
      the support should be no more hydrophobic than PTFE, and
      preferably it is more hydrophilic than PTFE.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] We are thus able to produce a membrane whose permeation
      characteristics can be tailored to allow the passage of water and,
      in some circumstances, other small polar solvents such as
      methanol, ethanol and propanol whilst remaining completely
      impermeable to other fluids such as gases and liquids.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Methanol and ethanol are small polar molecules which are of
      particular interest in terms of the ability to allow under certain
      circumstances selective transmission through the membrane. In
      other cases, denial of passage through the membrane structure of
      small polar molecules such as these in their entirety is
      desirable.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] Membranes of this type will have a number of uses in
      applications for gas drying and liquid drying.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0118] Experimental Setup</b><br>
      <br>
      [0119] Metal containers for permeation experiments were fabricated
      from an aluminum alloy and sealed by using two O rings. For
      gravimetric measurements, the containers were specially designed
      to minimize their mass. The weight loss was monitored by using a
      computer-controlled precision balance (ADAM Equipment Ltd;
      accuracy 1 mg). All the gravimetric experiments were carried out
      in an argon atmosphere in a glove box with a negligible water
      pressure (&lt;10&lt;−3 &gt;mbar). If the containers were sealed
      with submicron GO membranes, no weight loss could be detected for
      any liquid other than water. For the case of an open aperture,
      evaporation rates for other liquids were higher than for water
      (for example, 1.3, 6.0 and 8.3 mg/h/mm&lt;2 &gt;for ethanol,
      hexane and acetone at room temperature (T) respectively).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><br>
      <br>
      [0120] This example relates to the permeation properties of GO.
      The studied GO membranes were prepared as follows: We employed
      Hummer's method to obtain graphite oxide that was dispersed in
      water by sonication to make a stable suspension of GO
      crystallites. We then used this suspension to produce laminates by
      spray- or spin-coating. Scanning electron microscopy and x-ray
      analysis reveal that such GO films have a pronounced layered
      structure and consist of crystals with typical sizes L of a few
      micrometers, which are separated by a typical distance d of ̃10
      {acute over (Å)}. For the Example 1 permeation experiments, Cu
      foils of several centimeters in diameter were uniformly covered
      with the GO laminates. Then, we chemically etched Cu to produce
      apertures of diameter D 1 cm fully covered by freestanding GO
      films. Finally, a metal container was sealed by using the Cu
      disks. We studied membranes with thicknesses h from 0.1 to 10 μm.
      Even submicrometer-thick membranes were strong enough to withstand
      a differential pressure ΔP up to 100 mbar.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] As an initial test, we filled the containers with various
      gases under a small overpressure (&lt;100 mbar) and recorded its
      changes over a period of several days. We observed no noticeable
      reduction in ΔP for any tested gas including He, H2, N2, and Ar.
      This allowed an estimate for the upper limit on their permeation
      rates Pr as ≈10&lt;−11 &gt;g/cm&lt;2&gt;·s·bar, which is close to
      the value reported for micron-sized “balloons” made from
      continuous graphene monolayers.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] We used mass spectrometry and found no detectable
      permeation of He. The accuracy was limited only by digital noise
      of our He spectrometer and a slightly fluctuating background,
      which yielded Pr&lt;10&lt;−12 &gt;g/cm&lt;2&gt;·s·bar. Using
      hydrogen mass spectrometry, no permeation was found either, albeit
      the accuracy was three orders of magnitude lower than for He, due
      to a larger background. A 12-μm thick film of polyethylene
      terephthalate (PET) was used as a reference barrier and exhibited
      a He leakage rate 1000 times higher than our detection limit (FIG.
      1) yielding PET's bulk permeability πHe=Pr·h≈10&lt;−11
      &gt;mm·g/com&lt;2&gt;·s·bar, in agreement with literature values.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] To evaluate the permeation barrier for liquid substances,
      we employed weight-loss measurements. FIG. 2 shows examples for
      evaporation rates from a metal container with an aperture covered
      by a 1-μm-thick GO membrane. No weight loss could be detected with
      accuracy of &lt;1 mg for ethanol, hexane, acetone, decane, and
      propanol in the measurements lasting several days. This sets an
      upper limit for their π as ≈10&lt;−11 &gt;mm·g/cm&lt;2&gt;·s·bar.
      We observed a huge weight loss if the container was filled with
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] Moreover, the evaporation rate was practically the same as
      as through an open aperture i.e. in the absence of the GO film;
      (h≈1 μm; aperture's area≈1 cm&lt;2&gt;).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><br>
      <br>
      [0125] This example relates to the permeation properties of GO on
      a permeable membrane. A 500 nm thick GO layer supported on an
      Anopore membrane (20 mm diameter) was prepared by vacuum
      filtration of graphene oxide solution in water through the alumina
      membrane. The pore size of the Anopore alumina membrane was 200
      nm. The permeability of water, ethanol and methanol through the
      membrane was determined by measuring the weight loss from a metal
      container sealed with the GO/membrane composite. A comparative
      experiment was also performed to determine the permeability of
      water through an Anopore membrane. The measurements were carried
      out at room temperature and zero humidity.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] FIG. 3 shows the evaporation rates. As can be seen, the
      evaporation rate through the GO on Anopore composite and the
      reference Anopore membrane are practically the same. On the other
      hand the GO on Anopore composite is completely impermeable to the
      methanol and ethanol vapours.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><br>
      <br>
      [0127] This example shows 2-propanol permeation through supported
      GO membranes.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] To enhance the mechanical stability of GO membranes, we
      have deposited graphene oxide on different polymer/ceramic porous
      support and studied their influence on the graphene oxide's
      membrane property. We have used anodisc alumina,
      Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and
      Cyclopore Polycarbonate (PC) support. We measured the vapour
      permeation of 2-propanol (2-propanol leak test) at room
      temperature and room humidity to study the influence of support
      membrane on property of graphene oxide membrane. Table 1 below
      shows the 2-propanol leak test performed for GO on different
      support membranes. The porosity of all the support membranes was
      identical and for each was 200 nm so that a direct comparison
      could be made. The table demonstrates that the support material
      has an effect on graphene oxides membrane properties. The best
      substrate found so far is the Anodisc alumina membrane. Graphene
      oxide on Anodisc alumina shows the same property as that of a free
      standing graphene oxide (impermeable to propanol).<br>

      [0129] It can also be seen that the propanol vapour barrier for GO
      on cyclopore Polycarbonate (PC) membranes were found better than
      that of PTFE and PVDF. Four micron thick GO coating on PC
      membranes increase the propanol barrier nearly 30 times compared
      to five and seven times improvement for PTFE and PVDF membranes.
      Table 1 also shows smoothness of different GO coating on different
      support obtained by microscopic or visual inception. In general
      very smooth hydrophilic substrates are found to be a better
      candidate for GO support material.<br>

      [0136] A separation factor above one corresponds to the membrane

      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] There are a number of uses for the composite membranes of
      the invention having these characteristics e.g. detector devices,
      the pervaporation of fermentation broths, concentration of liquids
      (e.g. fruit juices), liquid drying (e.g. of hydrocarbon based
      fuels), gas drying, gas humidification.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] Even though the atomic structure and chemical composition
      of graphene oxide and graphite oxide membranes are same, the
      membrane properties are very different. For example, bulk graphite
      oxide membranes (Boehm et al. Journal of Chimie Physique 58, 141
      (1961)) allow water and other polar solvents (eg. ethanol) to
      permeate but it is completely impermeable to all other gases.
      Graphene oxide on the other hand is completely impermeable to all
      gases and liquid (including polar solvents) except water. This
      unique property of graphene oxide membranes is due to its perfect
      layered structure. Permeation of polar solvents through graphite
      oxide membranes can be originated from the difference in their
      layered structure. FIG. 5 below shows schematic view of the
      graphene oxide and graphite oxide layered structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] FIG. 5 shows a schematic view of the layered structure of
      graphene oxide (A) and graphite oxide (B) membranes<br>
      <br>
      [0140] Graphite oxide membranes are consists of micrometer size
      thick perfectly staked graphite oxide flakes (defined by the
      starting graphite flakes used for oxidation, after oxidation it
      gets expanded due to the attached functional groups) and can be
      considered as a polycrystalline material. Exfoliation of graphite
      oxide in water into individual graphene oxide was achieved by the
      sonication technique followed by centrifugation at 10000 rpm to
      remove few layers and thick flakes. Graphene oxide membranes were
      formed by restacking of these single layer graphene oxides by a
      number of different techniques such as spin coating, spray
      coating, road coating and vacuum filtration.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] Graphene oxide membranes according to the invention consist
      of overlapped layers of randomly oriented single layer graphene
      oxide sheets with smaller dimensions (due to sonication). These
      membranes can be considered as a centimetre size single crystal
      (grain) formed by parallel graphene oxide sheets. Due to this
      difference in layered structure, the atomic structure of the
      capillary entrance of graphene oxide and graphite oxide membranes
      are different. For membranes the edge functional groups are
      located over the functionalised regions of another graphene oxide
      sheet while in graphite oxide membranes mostly edges are aligned
      over another graphene oxide edge. These differences unexpectedly
      may influence the membrane properties of graphene oxide membranes
      as compared to those of graphite oxide...<br>

      This invention relates to methods of purifying water using
      graphene oxide laminates which are formed from stacks of
      individual graphene oxide flakes which may be predominantly
      monolayer thick. The graphene oxide laminates may act as membranes
      which exclude large solutes i.e. with a hydration radius above
      about 4.5 AA or they may act as sorbents to absorb solutes having
      a hydration radius less than about 4.7 AA.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] This invention relates to methods of purifying water using
      graphene oxide laminates which are formed from stacks of
      individual graphene oxide flakes which may be predominantly
      monolayer thick. The graphene oxide laminates may act as membranes
      or they may act as sorbents.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The removal of solutes from water finds application in many
      fields.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] This may take the form of the purification of water for
      drinking or for watering crops or it may take the form of the
      purification of waste waters from industry to prevent
      environmental damage. Examples of applications for water
      purification include: the removal of salt from sea water for
      drinking water or for use in industry; the purification of
      brackish water; the removal of radioactive ions from water which
      has been involved in nuclear enrichment, nuclear power generation
      or nuclear clean-up (e.g. that involved in the decommissioning of
      former nuclear power stations or following nuclear incidents); the
      removal of environmentally hazardous substances (e.g. halogenated
      organic compounds, heavy metals, chlorates and perchlorates) from
      industrial waste waters before they enter the water system; and
      the removal of biological pathogens (e.g. viruses, bacteria,
      parasites, etc) from contaminated or suspect drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In many industrial contexts (e.g. the nuclear industry) it
      is often desirable to separate dangerous or otherwise undesired
      solutes from valuable (e.g. rare metals) solutes in industrial
      waste waters in order that the valuable solutes can be recovered
      and reused or sold.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Graphene is believed to be impermeable to all gases and
      liquids. Membranes made from graphene oxide are impermeable to
      most liquids, vapours and gases, including helium. However, an
      academic study has shown that, surprisingly, graphene oxide
      membranes which are effectively composed of graphene oxide having
      a thickness around 1 μηι are permeable to water even though they
      are impermeable to helium. These graphene oxide sheets allow
      unimpeaded permeation of water (10&lt;10&gt;times faster than He)
      (Nair et al. Science, 2012, 335, 442-444). Such GO laminates are
      particularly attractive as potential filtration or separation
      media because they are easy to fabricate, mechanically robust and
      offer no principal obstacles towards industrial scale production.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Zhao et al (Environ. Sci. Technol., 201 1 , 45,
      10454-10462) and WO2012/170086 describe sorbents which comprise
      few layer graphene oxide used as a dispersion.<br>
      <br>
      However, these sorbents are non selective with small ions, complex
      ions and organic dye molecules being removed from solution at the
      same time. We believe that the lack of selectivity arises because
      large solutes adsorb onto the surfaces of the graphene oxide
      flakes at the same time as small solutes absorbing into the
      nanocapillaries between the graphene oxide layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] CN 101973620 describes the use of a monolayer graphene
      oxide sheet as an adsorbent of heavy metal ions. Again, such
      sheets are expected to be non-selective, with both large and small
      solutes being adsorbed, because the interaction is solely a
      surface effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Sun et al (Selective Ion Penetration of Graphene Oxide
      Membranes; ACS Nano 7, 428 (2013)) describes the selective ion
      penetration of graphene oxide membranes in which the graphene
      oxide is formed by oxidation of wormlike graphite. The membranes
      are freestanding in the sense that they are not associated with a
      support material. The resultant graphene oxide contains more
      oxygen functional groups than graphene oxide prepared from natural
      graphite and laminates formed from this material have a wrinkled
      surface topography. Such membranes differ from those of the
      present invention because they do not show fast ion permeation of
      small ions and also demonstrate a selectivity which is
      substantially unrelated to size<br>
      <br>
      [0009] This study found that sodium salts permeated quickly
      through GO membranes, whereas heavy metal salts permeated much
      more slowly. Copper sulphate and organic contaminants, such as
      rhodamine B are blocked entirely because of their strong
      interactions with GO membranes. According to this study, ionic or
      molecular permeation through GO is mainly controlled by the
      interaction between ions or molecules with the functional groups
      present in the GO sheets. The authors comment that the selectivity
      of the GO membranes cannot be explained solely by ionic-radius
      based theories. They measured the electrical conductivities of
      different permeate solutions and used this value to compare the
      permeation rates of different salts. The potential applied to
      measure the conductivities can affect ion permeation through
      membranes.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Other publications (Y. Han, Z. Xu, C. Gao. Adv. Fund.

      Chem. Comm. 49, 5963 (2013)) have reported filtration properties
      of GO laminates and, although results varied widely due to
      different fabrication and measurement procedures, they reported
      appealing characteristics including large water fluxes and notable
      rejection rates for certain salts.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, large organic molecules were also found to pass
      through such GO filters.<br>
      <br>
      The latter observation is disappointing and would considerably
      limit interest in GO laminates as molecular sieves. In this
      respect, we note that the emphasis of these studies was on high
      water rates that could be comparable to or exceed the rates used
      for industrial desalination. Accordingly, a high water pressure
      was applied and the GO membranes were intentionally prepared as
      thin as possible, 10-50 nm thick. It may be that such thin stacks
      contained holes and cracks (some may appear after applying
      pressure), through which large organic molecules could penetrate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><br>
      <br>
      [0011] In accordance with a first aspect of the invention there is
      provided a method of reducing the amount of one or more solutes in
      an aqueous mixture to produce a liquid depleted in said solutes;
      the method comprising:<br>
      <br>
      (a) contacting a first face of a graphene oxide laminate membrane
      with the aqueous mixture comprising the one or more solutes;<br>
      <br>
      (b) recovering the liquid from or downstream from a second face of
      the membrane;<br>
      <br>
      wherein the graphene oxide laminate membrane has a thickness
      greater than about 100 nm and wherein the graphene oxide flakes of
      which the laminate is comprised have an average oxygen:carbon
      weight ratio in the range of from 0.2:1.0 to 0.5: 1.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Thus, in a second aspect, there is provided a fluid
      filtration device comprising a graphene oxide laminate membrane
      having a thickness greater than about 100 nm and wherein the
      graphene oxide flakes from which the laminate is comprised have an
      average oxygen:carbon weight ratio in the range of from 0.2:1.0 to
      0.5: 1.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The term "solute" applies to both ions and counter-ions,
      and to uncharged molecular species present in the solution. Once
      dissolved in aqueous media a salt forms a solute comprising
      hydrated ions and counter-ions. The uncharged molecular species
      can be referred to as "non-ionic species". Examples of non-ionic
      species are small organic molecules such as aliphatic or aromatic
      hydrocarbons (e.g. toluene, benzene, hexane, etc), alcohols (e.g.
      methanol, ethanol, propanol, glycerol, etc), carbohydrates (e.g.
      sugars such as sucrose), and amino acids and peptides. The
      non-ionic species may or may not hydrogen bond with water. As will
      be readily apparent to the person skilled in the art, the term
      'solute' does not encompass solid substances which are not
      dissolved in the aqueous mixture. Particulate matter will not pass
      through the membranes of the invention even if the particulate is
      comprised of ions with small radii.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The term "hydration radius" refers to the effective radius
      of the molecule when solvated in aqueous media.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The reduction of the amount one or more selected solutes in
      the solution which is treated with the GO membrane of the present
      invention may entail entire removal of the or each selected
      solute. Alternatively, the reduction may not entail complete
      removal of a particular solute but simply a lowering of its
      concentration. The reduction may result in an altered ratio of the
      concentration of one or more solutes relative to the concentration
      of one or more other solutes. The inventors have found that
      solutes with a hydration radius of less than about 4.5 A pass very
      quickly through a graphene oxide laminate whereas solutes with a
      hydration radius greater than about 4.7 A do not pass through at
      all. Thus it may be that the purified aqueous solution contains
      substantially no solute having a hydration radius of greater than
      about 4.7 A<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In cases in which salt is formed from one ion having a
      hydration radius of larger than about 4.5 A and a counter-ion with
      a hydration radius of less than about 4.5 A, neither ion will pass
      through the membrane of the invention because of the electrostatic
      attraction between the ions. Thus, for example, in the case
      KsFe(CN)6, neither the Fe(CN)6&lt;3"&gt;nor the K&lt;+&gt;pass
      through the membrane even though the hydration radius of
      K&lt;+&gt;is less than 4.5 A.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] No electrical potential needs to be applied to the
      membrane. Thus, it may be that solutes of a size i.e. hydration
      radius of less than about 4.5 A may pass through on account of
      diffusion. It is also possible to achieve the same effect by the
      application of pressure to the solute.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The size exclusion limit of the membrane is about 4.5 A;
      however, this exclusion limit may vary between about 4.5 A and
      about 4.7 A. In the region around sizes between about 4.5 A and
      about 4.7 A the degree of transmission decreases by orders of
      magnitude and consequently the perceived value of the size
      exclusion limit depends on the amount of transmission of solute
      that is acceptable for a particular application.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Thus, the one or more solutes the amount of which are
      reduced in the method of the invention may have a hydration radius
      greater than about 4.5 A. It follows that the purified liquid may
      contain a reduced amount of any solutes having a hydration radius
      of greater than about 4.5 A. In an embodiment, the or each solute
      has a radius of hydration greater than 4.7 A. It may be that the
      or each solute has a radius of hydration greater than 4.8 A, e.g.
      the or each solute has a radius of hydration greater than 4.9 A,
      or greater than 5.0 A.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The flakes of graphene oxide which are stacked to form the
      laminate of the invention are usually monolayer graphene oxide.
      However, it is possible to use flakes of graphene oxide containing
      from 2 to 10 atomic layers of carbon in each flake. These
      multilayer flakes are frequently referred to as "few-layer"
      flakes. Thus the membrane may be made entirely from monolayer
      graphene oxide flakes, from a mixture of monolayer and few-layer
      flakes, or from entirely few-layer flakes. Ideally, the flakes are
      entirely or predominantly, i.e. more than 75%w/w, monolayer
      graphene oxide. [0021] The graphene oxide laminate used in the
      method of the invention has the overall shape of a sheet-like
      material through which the solute may pass when the laminate is
      wet with an aqueous or aqueous-based mixture optionally containing
      one or more additional solvents (which may be miscible or
      immiscible with water). The solute may only pass provided it is of
      sufficiently small size. Thus the aqueous solution contacts one
      face or side of the membrane and purified solution is recovered
      from the other face or side of the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In an embodiment, the method is a method of selectively
      reducing the amount of a first set of one or more solutes in an
      aqueous mixture without significantly reducing the amount of a
      second set of one or more solutes in the aqueous mixture to
      produce a liquid depleted in said first set of solutes but not
      depleted in said second set of solutes, wherein the or each solute
      of the first set has a radius of hydration greater than about 4.5
      A and the or each solute of the second set has a radius of
      hydration less than about 4.5 A. It may be that the or each solute
      of the second set has a radius of hydration less than about 4.5 A,
      e.g. the or each solute of the second set has a radius of
      hydration less than about 4.4 A. It may be that the or each solute
      of the first set has a radius of hydration greater than about<br>
      <br>
      4.7 A, e.g. the or each solute of the first set has a radius of
      hydration greater than about<br>
      <br>
      4.8 A or optionally greater than about 5.0 A.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In an embodiment, the method is continuous. Thus, steps (a)
      and (b) may be carried out simultaneously or substantially
      simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] It may be that the aqueous mixture is permitted to pass
      though the membrane through diffusion and / or it may be that a
      pressure is applied.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Preferably, no electrical potential is applied across the
      membrane. In principle, an electrical potential could be applied.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The graphene oxide laminate membrane is optionally
      supported on a porous material. This can provide structural
      integrity. In other words, the graphene oxide flakes may
      themselves form a layer e.g. a laminate which itself is associated
      with a porous support such as a porous membrane to form a further
      laminate structure. In this embodiment, the resulting structure is
      a laminate of graphene flakes mounted on the porous support. In
      one illustrative example, the graphene oxide laminate membrane may
      be sandwiched between layers of a porous material.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In an embodiment, the graphene oxide flakes of which the
      laminate is comprised have an average oxygen:carbon weight ratio
      in the range of from 0.25: 1.0 to 0.45:1.0. Preferably, the flakes
      have an average oxygen:carbon weight ratio in the range of from
      0.3:1.0 to 0.4:1.0. [0028] In an embodiment, the GO flakes which
      form the membrane have been prepared by the oxidation of natural
      graphite.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The method may involve a plurality of graphene oxide
      laminate membranes. Thus, the filtration device may comprise a
      plurality of graphene oxide laminate membranes. These may be
      arranged in parallel (to increase the flux capacity of the
      process/device) or in series (where a reduction in the amount of
      one or more solute is achieved by a single laminate membrane but
      that reduction is less than desired).<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The fluid filtration device may be a filter or it may be a
      removable and replaceable filter unit for a filtration apparatus.
      The filtration device may be a filtration apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In accordance with a third aspect of the invention there is
      provided a method of reducing the amount of one or more solutes in
      an aqueous mixture to produce a liquid depleted in said solutes;
      the method comprising:<br>
      <br>
      (a) contacting the aqueous mixture with a sorbent comprising a
      graphene oxide laminate membrane; and<br>
      <br>
      (b) separating the sorbent from the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The invention also relates to sorbents which can be used in
      this method and which are described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Thus, in a fourth aspect, there is provided a sorbent
      comprising a graphene oxide laminate membrane which is optionally
      supported on a porous material. The porous material can provide
      structural integrity.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The flakes of graphene oxide which are stacked to form the
      laminate of the invention are usually monolayer graphene oxide.
      However, it is possible to use flakes of graphene oxide containing
      from 2 to 10 atomic layers of carbon in each flake. These
      multilayer flakes are frequently referred to as "few-layer"
      flakes. Thus the membrane may be made entirely from monolayer
      graphene oxide flakes, from a mixture of monolayer and few-layer
      flakes, or from entirely few-layer flakes. Ideally, the flakes are
      entirely or predominantly, i.e. more than 75%w/w, monolayer
      graphene oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The inventors have found that solutes or ions with a radius
      of less than about 4.5 A absorb very quickly into a graphene oxide
      laminate i.e. the sorbent material to form localised (within the
      laminate) high concentration solutions of the solute(s) in
      question.<br>
      <br>
      The majority of the surfaces (belonging to individual graphene
      oxide flakes) with which the solutes interact are internal to the
      graphene oxide laminate in the sense of being within the
      capillaries of the laminate of the graphene flakes. Migration of
      the solutes into the sorbent leads to a concentration within the
      GO laminate which can be an order of magnitude or greater higher
      than the concentration on the outside i.e. in the aqueous mixture
      or the purified liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] This means that substantially no solutes with a hydrated
      radius larger than about 4.5 A can adsorb onto the surface of the
      flakes. This makes the sorbents of the invention very selective in
      separating solutes by size. The absorption properties of the
      membrane are observed with solutes with a hydration radius of less
      than about 4.5 A; however, this exclusion limit may vary between
      about 4.5 A and about 4.7 A. In the region around sizes between
      about 4.5 A and about 4.7 A the degree of transmission decreases
      by orders of magnitude and consequently the perceived value of the
      size exclusion limit depends on the amount of transmission of
      solute that is acceptable for a particular application.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In an embodiment, the graphene oxide flakes of which the
      laminate is comprised have an oxygen:carbon weight ratio in the
      range 0.2 to 0.5, e.g. in the range 0.25 to 0.45. Preferably, the
      flakes have an oxygen:carbon weight ratio in the range 0.3 to 0.4.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] It may be that the graphene oxide laminate membrane is
      formed from graphene oxide which has been prepared by the
      oxidation of natural graphite.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The sorbents of the invention are also easier to handle
      than the graphene oxide dispersions of the prior art. It is
      difficult to separate completely a dispersed fine solid from a
      liquid, whereas the membranes of the invention form larger units
      which can be more easily filtered out.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Thus, the one or more solutes the amount of which are
      reduced in the method of the invention may have a hydration radius
      less than about 4.5 A. It follows that the purified liquid may
      contain a reduced amount of any solutes having a hydration radius
      of less than about 4.5 A. In an embodiment, the or each solute has
      a radius of hydration less than about 4.5 A. It may be that the or
      each solute has a radius of hydration less than about 4.4 A, e.g.
      the or each solute has a radius of hydration less than about 4.25
      A.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In an embodiment, the method further comprises removing the
      one or more solutes from the sorbent. This may be achieved using
      an acid wash or alternatively by placing the sorbent in deionised
      water for an appropriate period of time. Where, the one or more
      solutes are removed by placing the sorbent in deionised water,
      that water may be at a temperature from about 25 °C to about 70
      °C. Thus, the sorbent can be regenerated and reused and the
      absorbed solutes can be recovered or substantially recovered.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In an embodiment, the method is a method of selectively
      reducing the amount of a first set of one or more solutes in an
      aqueous mixture without significantly reducing the amount of a
      second set of one or more solutes in the aqueous mixture to
      produce a liquid depleted in said first set of solutes but not
      depleted in said second set of solutes, wherein the or each solute
      of the first set has a radius of hydration less than about 4.5 A
      and the or each solute of the second set has a radius of hydration
      greater than about 4.7 A. It may be that the or each solute of the
      first set has a radius of hydration less than about 4.4 A e.g. the
      or each solute of the first set has a radius of hydration less
      than about 4.25 A. It may be that the or each solute of the second
      set has a radius of hydration greater than about 4.8 A, e.g. the
      or each solute of the second set has a radius of hydration greater
      than about 5.0 A.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] It may be that that the aqueous mixture is not acidic. Thus
      the aqueous mixture may be either neutral or alkaline. It may be
      that the aqueous mixture has a pH from about 5 to about 13, e.g.
      from about 6 to about 12 or from about 7 to about 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The method may comprise the step of: increasing the pH of
      the first aqueous mixture to obtain a modified aqueous mixture. It
      is this modified aqueous mixture which is modified with the
      sorbent in step a) described above. Increasing the pH may be
      achieved by adding a base, e.g. an aqueous alkaline solution, to
      the first aqueous mixture. Suitable alkaline solutions include:
      ammonium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium
      carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The inventors have surprisingly found that the
      effectiveness of graphene oxide laminates as sorbents increases
      with pH.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The graphene oxide laminate membrane may is optionally
      supported on a porous material to provide structural integrity,
      e.g. a flexible porous support. The porous material may be a
      porous polymer support, e.g. a flexible porous polymer support.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Preferably, the graphene oxide laminate membrane has a
      thickness greater than about 100 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In an illustrative embodiment, the sorbent comprises a
      composite of the graphene oxide laminate membrane on a flexible
      porous support in the form of a roll, a ball, a sheet or a folded
      sheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The following paragraphs may apply to the membranes of any
      of the first, second, third and fourth aspects of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In an embodiment, the graphene oxide laminate membrane has
      a thickness greater than about 100 nm, e.g. greater than about 500
      nm, e.g. a thickness between about 500 nm and about 100 μηι. The
      graphene oxide laminate membrane may have a thickness up to about
      50 μηι. The graphene oxide laminate membrane may have a thickness
      greater than about 1 μηι, e.g. a thickness between 1 μηι and 15
      μηι. Thus, the graphene oxide laminate membrane may have a
      thickness of about 5 μηι. [0051] The graphene oxide laminates used
      in the invention may comprise a cross-linking agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] A cross linking agent is a substance which bonds with GO
      flakes in the laminate. The cross linking agent may form hydrogen
      bonds with GO flakes or it may form covalent bonds with GO flakes.
      Examples include diamines (e.g. ethyl diamine, propyl diamine,
      phenylene diamine), polyallylamines and imidazole. Without wishing
      to be bound by theory, it is believed that these are examples of
      crosslinking agents which form hydrogen bonds with GO flakes.
      Other examples include borate ions and polyetherimides formed from
      capping the GO with polydopamine. Examples of appropriate cross
      linking systems can be found in Tian et al, (Adv. Mater. 2013, 25,
      2980-2983), An et al (Adv. Mater. 2011 , 23, 3842-3846), Hung et
      al (Cross-linking with Diamine monomers to Prepare Composite
      Graphene Oxide- Framework Membranes with Varying d-Spacing;
      Chemistry of Materials, 2014) and Park et al (Graphene Oxide
      Sheets Chemically Cross-Linked by polyallylamine; J. Phys. Chem.
      C; 2009)<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The GO laminate may comprise a polymer. The polymer may be
      interspersed throughout the membrane. It may occupy the spaces
      between graphene oxide flakes, thus providing interlayer
      crosslinking. The polymer may be PVA (see for example Li et al
      Adv. Mater. 2012, 24, 3426-3431). It has been found that GO
      laminates comprising interspersed polymer exhibit improved
      adhesiveness to certain substrates (e.g. metals) than GO membranes
      which do not comprise a polymer. Other polymers which could be
      used in this manner include poly(4-styrenesulfonate), Nafion,
      carboxymethyl cellulose, Chitosan, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,
      polyaniline etc. It may be that the polymer is water soluble.
      Where the GO laminate comprises a polymer, that polymer (e.g. PVA)
      may be present in an amount from about 0.1 to about 50 wt%, e.g.
      from about 5 to about 45 wt%. Thus, the GO laminate may comprise
      from about 20 to about 40 wt% polymer.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, it may be that the polymer is not water soluble.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] It may be that the GO laminate does not comprise a polymer.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The GO laminate may comprise other inorganic materials,
      e.g. other two dimensional materials, such as graphene, reduced
      graphene oxide, hBN, mica. The presence of mica, for example can
      slightly improve the mechanical properties of the GO laminate.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The membrane may be a graphene oxide membrane comprising
      only flakes of graphene oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In an embodiment, the porous support is an inorganic
      material. Thus, the porous support (e.g. membrane) may comprise a
      ceramic. Preferably, the support is alumina, zeolite, or silica.
      In one embodiment, the support is alumina. Zeolite A can also be
      used. Ceramic membranes have also been produced in which the
      active layer is amorphous titania or silica produced by a sol-gel
      process.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In an alternate embodiment, the support is a polymeric
      material. Thus, the porous support may thus be a porous polymer
      support, e.g. a flexible porous polymer support. Preferably it is
      PTFE, PVDF or Cyclopore™ polycarbonate. In an embodiment, the
      porous support (e.g. membrane) may comprise a polymer. In an
      embodiment, the polymer may comprise a synthetic polymer. These
      can be used in the invention.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the polymer may comprise a natural polymer or
      modified natural polymer. Thus, the polymer may comprise a polymer
      based on cellulose.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In another embodiment, the porous support (e.g. membrane)
      may comprise a carbon monolith.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In an embodiment, the porous support layer has a thickness
      of no more than a few tens of μηι, and ideally is less than about
      100 μηι. Preferably, it has a thickness of 50 μηι or less, more
      preferably of 10 μηι or less, and yet more preferably is less 5
      μηι. In some cases it may be less than about 1 μηι thick though
      preferably it is more than about 1 μηι.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Preferably, the thickness of the entire membrane (i.e. the
      graphene oxide laminate and the support) is from about 1 μηι to
      about 200 μηι, e.g. from about 5 μηι to about 50.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The porous support should be porous enough not to interfere
      with water transport but have small enough pores that graphene
      oxide platelets cannot enter the pores. Thus, the porous support
      must be water permeable. In an embodiment, the pore size must be
      less than 1 μηι. In an embodiment, the support has a uniform
      pore-structure. Examples of porous membranes with a uniform pore

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0076] The present invention involves the use of graphene oxide
      laminate membranes. The graphene oxide laminates and laminate
      membranes of the invention comprise stacks of individual graphene
      oxide flakes, in which the flakes are predominantly monolayer
      graphene oxide. Although the flakes are predominantly monolayer
      graphene oxide, it is within the scope of this invention that some
      of the graphene oxide is present as two- or few-layer graphene
      oxide. Thus, it may be that at least 75% by weight of the graphene
      oxide is in the form of monolayer graphene oxide flakes, or it may
      be that at least 85% by weight of the graphene oxide is in the
      form of monolayer graphene oxide flakes (e.g. at least 95 %, for
      example at least 99% by weight of the graphene oxide is in the
      form of monolayer graphene oxide flakes) with the remainder made
      up of two- or few- layer graphene oxide. Without wishing to be
      bound by theory, it is believed that water and solutes pass
      through capillary-like pathways formed between the graphene oxide
      flakes by diffusion and that the specific structure of the
      graphene oxide laminate membranes leads to the remarkable
      selectivity observed as well as the remarkable speed at which the
      ions permeate the laminate structure. [0077] In one illustrative
      example, the graphene oxide laminate membranes are made of
      impermeable functionalized graphene sheets that have a typical
      size L «1 μηι and the interlayer separation, d, sufficient to
      accommodate a mobile layer of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The solutes to be removed from aqueous mixtures in the
      methods of the present invention may be defined in terms of their
      hydrated radius. Below are the hydrated radii of some exemplary
      ions and molecules.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Table 1</b><br>
      &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="281513021-imgf000014_0001" /&gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The hydrated radii of many species are available in the
      literature. However, for some species the hydrated radii may not
      be available. The radii of many species are described in terms of
      their Stokes radius and typically this information will be
      available where the hydrated radius is not. For example, of the
      above species, there exist no literature values for the hydrated
      radius of propanol, sucrose, glycerol and PTS&lt;4"&gt;. The
      hydrated radii of these species which are provided in the table
      above have been estimated using their Stokes/crystal radii. To
      this end, the hydrated radii for a selection of species in which
      this value was known can be plotted as a function of the Stokes
      radii for those species and this yields a simple linear
      dependence. Hydrated radii for propanol, sucrose, glycerol and
      PTS&lt;4"&gt;were then estimated using the linear dependence and
      the known Stokes radii of those species. [0080] There are a number
      of methods described in the literature for the calculation of
      hydration radii. Examples are provided in 'Determination of the
      effective hydrodynamic radii of small molecules by viscometry';
      Schultz and Soloman; The Journal of General Physiology; 44; 1
      189-1199 (1963); and 'Phenomenological Theory of Ion Solvation';
      E. R. Nightingale. J. Phys. Chem. 63, 1381 (1959).<br>
      <br>
      [0081] The term 'aqueous mixture' refers to any mixture of
      substances which comprises at least 10% water by weight. It may
      comprise at least 50% water by weight and preferably comprises at
      least 80% water by weight, e.g. at least 90% water by weight. The
      mixture may be a solution, a suspension, an emulsion or a mixture
      thereof. Typically the aqueous mixture will be an aqueous solution
      in which one or more solutes are dissolved in water. This does not
      exclude the possibility that there might be particulate matter,
      droplets or micelles suspended in the solution. Of course, it is
      expected that the particulate matter will not pass through the
      membranes of the invention even if it is comprised of ions with
      small radii.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Particularly preferred solutes for removing from water in
      the first aspect of the invention include hydrocarbons and oils,
      biological material, dyes, organic compounds (including
      halogenated organic compounds) and complex ions.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Particularly preferred solutes for removing from water in
      the second aspect of the invention include NaCI, heavy metals,
      ethanol, chlorates and perchlorates, and radioactive elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The graphene oxide for use in this application can be made
      by any means known in the art. In a preferred method, graphite
      oxide can be prepared from graphite flakes (e.g. natural graphite
      flakes) by treating them with potassium permanganate and sodium
      nitrate in concentrated sulphuric acid. This method is called
      Hummers method. Another method is the Brodie method, which
      involves adding potassium chlorate (KCIO3) to a slurry of graphite
      in fuming nitric acid. For a review see, Dreyer et al. The
      chemistry of graphene oxide, Chem. Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 228-240.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Individual graphene oxide (GO) sheets can then be
      exfoliated by dissolving graphite oxide in water or other polar
      solvents with the help of ultrasound, and bulk residues can then
      be removed by centrifugation and optionally a dialysis step to
      remove additional salts.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In a specific embodiment, the graphene oxide of which the
      graphene oxide laminate membranes of the invention are comprised
      is not formed from wormlike graphite. Worm-like graphite is
      graphite that has been treated with concentrated sulphuric acid
      and hydrogen peroxide at 1000C to convert graphite into an
      expanded "worm-like" graphite. When this worm-like graphite
      undergoes an oxidation reaction it exhibits a higher increase the
      oxidation rate and efficiency (due to a higher surface area
      available in expanded graphite as compared to pristine graphite)
      and the resultant graphene oxide contains more oxygen functional
      groups than graphene oxide prepared from natural graphite.
      Laminate membranes formed from such highly functionalized graphene
      oxide can be shown to have a wrinkled surface topography and
      lamellar structure (Sun et al,; Selective Ion Penetration of
      Graphene Oxide Membranes; ACS Nano 7, 428 (2013) which differs
      from the layered structure observed in laminate membranes formed
      from graphene oxide prepared from natural graphite. Such membranes
      do not show fast ion permeation of small ions and a selectivity
      which is substantially unrelated to size (being due rather to
      interactions between solutes and the graphene oxide functional
      groups) compared to laminate membranes formed from graphene oxide
      prepared from natural graphite.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Without wishing to be bound by theory, individual GO
      crystallites formed from non-worm like graphite (e.g. natural or
      pristine graphite) may have two types of regions: functionalized
      (oxidized) and pristine. The former regions may act as spacers
      that keep adjacent crystallites apart and the pristine graphene
      regions may form the capillaries which afford the membranes their
      unique properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The preparation of graphene oxide supported on a porous
      membrane can be achieved using filtration, spray coating, casting,
      dip coating techniques, road coating, inject printing, or any
      other thin film coating techniques<br>
      <br>
      [0089] For large scale production of supported graphene based
      membranes or sheets it is preferred to use spray coating, road
      coating or inject printing techniques. One benefit of spray
      coating is that spraying GO solution in water on to the porous
      support material at an elevated temperature produces a large
      uniform GO film.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Graphite oxide consists of micrometer thick stacked
      graphite oxide flakes (defined by the starting graphite flakes
      used for oxidation, after oxidation it gets expanded due to the
      attached functional groups) and can be considered as a
      polycrystalline material.<br>
      <br>
      Exfoliation of graphite oxide in water into individual graphene
      oxide flakes was achieved by the sonication technique followed by
      centrifugation at 10000 rpm to remove few layers and thick flakes.
      Graphene oxide laminates were formed by restacking of these single
      or few layer graphene oxides by a number of different techniques
      such as spin coating, spray coating, road coating and vacuum
      filtration.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Graphene oxide membranes according to the invention consist
      of overlapped layers of randomly oriented single layer graphene
      oxide sheets with smaller dimensions (due to sonication). These
      membranes can be considered as a centimetre size single crystals
      (grains) formed by parallel graphene oxide sheets. Due to this
      difference in layered structure, the atomic structure of the
      capillary structure of graphene oxide membranes and graphite oxide
      are different. For graphene oxide membranes the edge functional
      groups are located over the non-functionalised regions of another
      graphene oxide sheet while in graphite oxide mostly edges are
      aligned over another graphite oxide edge. These differences
      unexpectedly may influence the permeability properties of graphene
      oxide membranes as compared to those of graphite oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] We have studied GO laminates that were prepared from GO
      suspensions by using vacuum filtration as described in Example 1.
      The resulting membranes were checked for their continuity by using
      a helium leak detector before and after filtration experiments,
      which proved that the membranes were vacuum-tight in the dry
      state. Figure 1 shows schematics of our experiments. The feed and
      permeate compartments were initially filled with different liquids
      (same or different height) including water, glycerol, toluene,
      ethanol, benzene and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). No permeation
      could be detected over a period of many weeks by monitoring liquid
      levels and using chemical analysis. The situation principally
      changed if both compartments were filled with water solutions. In
      this case, permeation through the same vacuum-tight membrane can
      readily be observed as rapid changes in liquid levels (several mm
      per day). The direction of flow is given by osmotic pressure. For
      example, a level of a one molar (1 M) sucrose solution in the feed
      compartment rises whereas it falls in the permeate compartment
      filled with deionized water. For a membrane with a thickness h of
      1 μηι, we find osmotic water flow rates of «0.2 L
      nr&lt;2&gt;h&lt;"1&gt;, and the speed increases with increasing
      the molar concentration C. Because a 1 M sucrose solution
      corresponds to an osmotic pressure of «25 bar at room temperature
      (van't Hoff factor is 1 in this case), the flow rates agree with
      the evaporation rates of «10 L nr&lt;2&gt;h&lt;"1&gt;reported for
      similar GO membranes (Nair et al. Science, 2012, 335, 442-444), in
      which case the permeation was driven by a capillary pressure of
      the order of 1 ,000 bars. Note that hydrostatic pressures in these
      experiments never exceeded 10&lt;"2&gt;bar and, therefore, could
      be neglected.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] After establishing that GO membranes connect the feed and
      permeate containers with respect to transport of water molecules,
      we have investigated the possibility that dissolved ions and
      molecules can simultaneously diffuse through capillaries. To this
      end, we have filled the feed container with various solutions and
      studied if any of the solutes appears on the other side of GO
      membranes, that is, in the permeate container filled with
      deionized water (Fig. 1 B). As a quick test, ion transport can be
      probed by monitoring electrical conductivity of water in the
      permeate container (Fig. 4). We have found that for some salts
      (for example, KCI) the conductivity increases with time but
      remains unaffected for others (for example, K3[Fe(CN)6]) over many
      days of measurements. This suggests that only certain ions may
      diffuse through GO laminates. Note that ions are not dragged by
      the osmosis-driven water flow but move in the opposite direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] To quantify permeation rates for diffusing solutes and test
      those that do not lead to an increase in conductivity (sucrose,
      glycerol and so on), we have employed various analytical
      techniques. Depending on a solute, we have used ion
      chromatography, inductively coupled plasma optical emission
      spectrometry, total organic carbon analysis and optical absorption
      spectroscopy. As an example, Figure 1C shows our results for MgC
      which were obtained by using ion chromatography and inductively
      coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry for Mg&lt;2+&gt;and
      CI&lt;"&gt;, respectively. One can see that<br>
      <br>
      concentrations of Mg&lt;2+&gt;and CI&lt;"&gt;in the permeate
      container increase linearly with time, as expected. Slopes of such
      curves yield permeation rates. The inset of Fig. 1 C illustrates
      that the observed rates depend linearly on C in the feed
      container. Note that cations and anions move through membranes in
      stoichiometric amounts so that charge neutrality within each of
      the containers is preserved. Otherwise, an electric field would
      build up across the membrane, slowing fast ions until the
      neutrality is reached. In Fig. 1 C, permeation of one
      Mg&lt;2+&gt;ion is accompanied by two ions of chloride, and the
      neutrality condition is satisfied.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Figure 2 summarizes our results obtained for different
      ionic and molecular solutions. The small species permeate with
      approximately the same speed whereas large ions and organic
      molecules exhibit no detectable permeation. The effective volume
      occupied by an ion in water is characterized by its hydrated
      radius. If plotted as a function of this parameter, our data are
      well described by a single-valued function with a sharp cutoff at
      «4.5Α (Fig. 2). Species larger than this are sieved out. This
      behavior corresponds to a physical size of the mesh of «9Α. Fig. 2
      also shows that permeation rates do not exhibit any notable
      dependence on ion charge and triply charged ions such as
      As04&lt;3"&gt;permeate with approximately the same rate as
      singly-charged Na&lt;+&gt;or CI&lt;"&gt;. Finally, to prove the
      essential role of water for ion permeation through GO laminates,
      we dissolved KCI and CuS04in DMSO, the polar nature of which
      allows solubility of these salts. No permeation has been detected,
      proving that the special affinity of GO laminates to water is
      important.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] To explain the observed sieving properties, it is possible
      to employ the model previously suggested to account for unimpeded
      evaporation of water through GO membranes (Nair ef al. Science,
      2012, 335, 442-444). Individual GO crystallites may have two types
      of regions: functionalized (oxidized) and pristine. The former
      regions may act as spacers that keep adjacent crystallites apart.
      It may be that, in a hydrated state, the spacers help water to
      intercalate between GO sheets, whereas the pristine regions
      provide a network of capillaries that allow nearly frictionless
      flow of a layer of correlated water. The earlier experiments using
      GO laminates in air with a typical d «10 A have been explained by
      assuming one monolayer of moving water. For GO laminates soaked in
      water, d increases to «13+1 A, which allows two or three
      monolayers. Taking into account the effective thickness of
      graphene of 3.4 A (interlayer distance in graphite), this yields a
      pore size of «9-10 A, in agreement with the mesh size found
      experimentally.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] To support this model, molecular dynamics simulations (MDS)
      can be used. The setup is shown in Fig. 3A where a graphene
      capillary separates feed and permeate reservoirs, and its width is
      varied between 7 and 13 A to account for the possibility of one,
      two or three monolayers of water. It is found that the narrowest
      MDS capillaries become filled with a monolayer of ice as described
      previously and do not allow inside even such small ions as
      Na&lt;+&gt;and CI&lt;"&gt;. However, for two and three monolayers
      expected in the fully hydrated state, ions enter the capillaries
      and diffuse into the permeate reservoir. Their permeation rates
      are found approximately the same for all small ions and show
      little dependence on ionic charge (Fig. 3B). Larger species
      (toluene and octanol) cannot permeate even through capillaries
      containing three monolayers of water (Fig. 6). Large solutes have
      been modelled as atomic clusters of different size and it is found
      that the capillaries accommodating 2 and 3 water monolayers
      rejects clusters with the radius larger than «4.7 and 5.8 A,
      respectively. This probably indicates that the ion permeation
      through GO laminates is limited by regions containing two
      monolayers of water. The experimental and theory results in Figs 2
      &amp; 3B show good agreement.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Regarding the absolute value of ion permeation rates found
      experimentally, it is possible to estimate that, for laminates
      with h «5 μηι and L «1 μηι, the effective length of graphene
      capillaries is Lxh/d «5 mm and they occupy d/L «0.1 % of the
      surface area of the GO membrane. For a typical diffusion
      coefficient of ions in water («10&lt;-5&gt;cm&lt;2&gt;/s), the
      expected diffusion rate for a 1 M solution through GO membrane is
      «10&lt;"3&gt;mg/h/cm&lt;2&gt;, that is, thousands of times smaller
      than the rates observed experimentally. Moreover, this estimate
      neglects the fact that functionalized regions narrow the effective
      water column. To appreciate how fast the observed permeation is,
      we have used the standard coffee filter paper and found the same
      diffusion rates for the paper of 1 mm in thickness (the diffusion
      barrier is equivalent to a couple of mm of pure water). Such fast
      transport of small ions cannot be explained by the confinement,
      which increases the diffusion coefficient by 50%, reflecting the
      change from bulk to two-dimensional water. Furthermore,
      functionalized regions (modeled as graphene with randomly attached
      epoxy groups) do not enhance diffusion but rather suppress it as
      expected because of the broken translational symmetry.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] To understand the ultrafast ion permeation, it should be
      recalled that graphene and GO powders exhibit a high adsorption
      efficiency with respect to many salts. Despite being very densely
      stacked, GO laminates are surprisingly found to retain this
      property for salts with small hydrated radii. Experiments show
      that permeating salts are adsorbed in amounts reaching as much as
      25% of membranes' initial weight (Fig. 5). The large intake
      implies highly concentrated solutions inside graphene capillaries
      (close to the saturation). MDS simulations confirm that small ions
      prefer to reside inside capillaries (Fig. 7). The affinity of
      salts to graphene capillaries indicates an energy gain with
      respect to the bulk water, and this translates into a
      capillary-like pressure that acts on ions within a water medium,
      rather than on water molecules in the standard capillary physics.
      Therefore, in addition to the normal diffusion, there is a large
      capillary force, sucking small ions inside the membranes and
      facilitating their permeation. Our MDS provide an estimate for
      this ionic pressure as «50 bars. The membranes would therefore be
      expected to form efficient sorbents for appropriate solutes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1. Fabrication and characterization of GO membranes and
        Experimental Set-up</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00100] Graphite oxide was prepared by exposing millimeter size
      flakes of natural graphite to concentrated sulfuric acid, sodium
      nitrate and potassium permanganate (Hummers' method). Then,
      graphite oxide was exfoliated into monolayer flakes by sonication
      in water, which was followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm to
      remove remaining few-layer crystals. GO membranes were prepared by
      vacuum filtration of the resulting GO suspension through Anodisc
      alumina membranes with a pore size of 0.2 μηι. By changing the
      volume of the filtered GO solution, it was possible to accurately
      control the thickness h of the resulting membranes, making them
      from 1 to more than 10 μηι thick. For consistency, all the
      membranes described in this report were chosen to be 5 μηι in
      thickness, unless a dependence on 7 was specifically investigated.<br>
      <br>
      [00101] GO laminates were usually left on top of the Anodiscs that
      served as a support to improve mechanical stability. In addition,
      influence of this porous support on permeation properties of GO
      was checked and they were found to be similar to those of free
      standing membranes.<br>
      <br>
      [00102] The permeation experiments were performed using a U-shaped
      device shown in Fig. 1 of the main text. It consisted of two
      tubular compartments fabricated either from glass or copper tubes
      (inner diameters of 25 mm), which were separated by the studied GO
      membranes. The membranes were glued to a Cu foil with an opening
      of 1 cm in diameter (see Fig. 1 of the main text). The copper foil
      was clamped between two O-rings, which provided a vacuum-tight
      seal between the two compartments. In a typical experiment, one of
      the compartments was filled (referred to as feed) with a salt or
      molecular solution up to a height of approximately 20 cm (0.1 L
      volume). The other (permeate) compartment was filled with
      deionized water to the same level. Note that the hydrostatic
      pressure due to level changes played no role in these experiments
      where the permeation was driven by large concentration gradients.
      Magnetic stirring was used in both feed and permeate compartments
      to avoid possible concentration gradients near the membranes
      (concentration polarization effect).<br>
      <br>
      [00103] The GO membranes including their entire assembly with the
      O-rings were thoroughly tested for any possible cracks and holes.
      In the first control experiment, GO membranes were substituted
      with a thin Cu foil glued to the Cu foil with all the other steps
      remaining the same. Using a highly concentrated salt solution in
      the feed compartment, we could not detect any permeation. In the
      second experiment, we used reduced GO, which makes the GO membrane
      water impermeable. Again, no salt permeation could be detected,
      which proves the absence of holes in the original GO membrane.
      Finally and most conclusively, we used a helium-leak detector. No
      holes could be detected in our GO membranes both before and after
      permeation measurements<br>
      <br>
      [00104] Although graphite oxide is known to be soluble in water,
      the vacuum-filtered GO laminates were found to be highly stable in
      water, and it was practically impossible to re- disperse them
      without extensive sonication. No degradation or damage of
      membranes was noticed in these filtration experiments lasting for
      many weeks. To quantify the solubility of GO laminates, we
      accurately measured their weight and thickness before and after
      immersing in water for two weeks. No weight or thickness loss
      could be detected within our accuracy of &lt;0.5%.<br>
      <br>
      [00105] Membranes were thoroughly tested for any possible cracks
      or holes by using a helium-leak detector as described in Nair et
      al. Science, 2012, 335, 442-444. To check the laminar structure of
      our GO membranes, we performed X-ray diffraction measurements,
      which yielded the interlayer separation d of 9-10 A at a relative
      humidity of 50±10%.<br>
      <br>
      [00106] PVA-GO laminate samples were prepared by blending water
      solutions of GO and PVA using a magnetic stirrer. The
      concentrations were chosen such that a weight percentage of GO in
      the final laminates of 60-80% was achieved, after water was
      removed by evaporation. We used vacuum filtration, drop casting
      and rod coating techniques to produce free standing PVA-GO
      membranes and PVA-GO coated substrates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2. Monitoring ion diffusion by electrical measurements</b><br>
      <br>
      [00107] For a quick qualitative test of ion permeation through GO
      membranes, the setup shown in Fig. 4 was used. The feed and
      permeate compartments were separated by GO membranes. We used the
      same assembly as described above but instead of Cu foil GO were
      glued to a glass slide with 2 mm hole and the liquid cell was
      small and made entirely from Teflon. The feed compartment was
      initially filled with a few ml_ of a concentrated salt solution,
      and the permeate compartment contained a similar volume of
      deionized water. The typical feed solution was approximately a
      million times more electrically conducting than deionized water at
      room temperature. Therefore, if ions diffuse through the membrane,
      this results in an increase in conductivity of water at the
      permeate side.<br>
      <br>
      Permeation of salts in concentrations at a sub-μΜ level can be
      detected in this manner. Resistance of permeate solution was
      monitored by using a Keithley source meter and platinum wires as
      electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [00108] Figure 4 shows examples of our measurements for the case
      of NaCI and potassium ferricyanide K3[Fe(CN)6] . The observed
      decreasing resistivity as a function of time indicates that NaCI
      permeates through the membrane. Similar behavior is observed for
      CuS04, KCI and other tested salts with small ions (see the main
      text). On the other hand, no noticeable changes in conductivity of
      deionized water can be detected for a potassium ferricyanide
      solution during measurements lasting for many days (Fig. 4).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3. Quantitative analysis of ion and molecular
        permeation</b><br>
      <br>
      [00109] The above electrical measurements qualitatively show that
      small ions can permeate through our GO membranes whereas large
      ions such as [Fe(CN)6]&lt;3"&gt;cannot. The technique is not
      applicable for molecular solutes because they exhibit little
      electrical conductivity. To gain quantitative information about
      the exact amount of permeating ions as well as to probe permeation
      of molecular solutes, chemical analysis of water at the permeate
      side was carried out. Samples were taken at regular intervals from
      a few hours to a few days and, in some cases, after several weeks.
      Due to different solubility of different solutes, different feed
      concentrations were used. They varied from 0.01 to 2 M, depending
      on a solute. For each salt, measurements were performed at several
      different feed concentrations to ensure that we worked in the
      linear response regime where the permeation rate was proportional
      to the feed concentration (Fig. 1C) and there was no sign of the
      concentration polarization effect.<br>
      <br>
      [00110] The ion chromatography (IC) and the inductively coupled
      plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) are the standard
      techniques used to analyze the presence of chemical species in
      solutions. The IC for anionic species was employed, and the
      ICP-OES for cations. The measurement techniques provided us with
      values for ion concentrations in the permeate water. Using the
      known volume of the permeate (-0.1 L) the number of ions diffused
      into the permeate compartments were calculated. For certain salts
      (those with low solubility), the obtained permeate solutions were
      first concentrated by evaporation to improve the measurement
      accuracy. Furthermore, the results of the chemical analysis were
      crosschecked by weighing a dry material left after evaporation of
      water in the permeate compartment. This also allowed the
      calculation of the amounts of the salt permeated through the GO
      membranes. The weight and chemical analyses were found in good
      quantitative agreement.<br>
      <br>
      [00111] To detect organic solutes such as glycerol, sucrose and
      propanol, the total organic carbon (TOC) analysis was employed. No
      traces of glycerol and sucrose could be found in the permeate
      samples after several weeks, but propanol could permeate, although
      at a rate much lower than small ions as shown in Fig. 2. The
      detection limit of the TOC was about 50 μg/L, and this put an
      upper limit on permeation of the solutes that could not be
      detected. The corresponding limiting values are shown by arrows in
      Fig. 2. The above techniques were calibrated using several known
      concentrations of the studied solutes, and the detection limits
      were identified by decreasing the concentration of the standard
      solution until the measured signal became five times the baseline
      noise.<br>
      <br>
      [00112] The optical absorption spectroscopy is widely used to
      detect solutes with absorption lines in the visible spectrum. This
      technique was employed for large ions such as [Fe(CN)6]&lt;3"&gt;,
      [Ru(bipy)3]&lt;2+&gt;of Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(ll) dichloride
      ([Ru(bipy)3]Cl2) and PTS&lt;4"&gt;of pyrenetetrasulfonic acid
      tetrasodium salt (Na4PTS). It was not possible to detect any
      signatures of [Fe(CN)6]&lt;3"&gt;, [Ru(bipy)3]&lt;2+&gt;and
      PTS&lt;4"&gt;on the permeate side, even after many weeks of
      running the analysis. The absorption spectra were taken with air
      as a background reference. The detection limit was estimated by
      measuring a reference solution and gradually decreasing its
      concentration by a factor of 2-3 until the optical absorption
      peaks completely disappeared. The penultimate concentration was
      chosen as the corresponding detection limits in Fig. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [00113] An experiment was performed in which a mixture of 0.5M
      NaCI and 0.01 M tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(ll) dichloride
      ([Ru(bipy)3]Cl2) was tested. It was found that only sodium
      chloride diffused through the membrane and [Ru(bipy)3]Cl2 was
      blocked by the membrane. This indicates that the presence of small
      ions don't open up the channels enough to allow larger ions to
      permeate. However, the presence of [Ru(bipy)3]Cl2 decreases the
      NaCI permeation rate through the membrane by a factor of ten.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5. Salt absorption by GO laminate membranes</b><br>
      <br>
      [00114] To test the adsorbing efficiency of GO laminates with
      respect to salts, the following experiments were carried out. GO
      laminate membranes were accurately weighed and placed in a
      solution with salt's concentration C (we used MgC , KCI and
      K3[Fe(CN)6]). After several hours, the laminates were taken out,
      rinsed with deionized water and dried. An intake of the salts was
      then measured. Fig. 5 shows that for salt that cannot permeate
      through GO laminates, there is no increase in weight. On the other
      hand, for the salts that fit inside GO capillaries, a massive
      intake was observed that reaches up to 25% in weight (Fig. 5). The
      intake rapidly saturates at relatively small C of «0.1 M. Further
      analysis shows that more than a half of this intake is a dry salt
      with the rest being additional bound water.<br>
      <br>
      [00115] The mass intake in Figure 5A can be due to both dry salt
      and extra water accumulated inside the capillaries in the presence
      of the salt. It was possible to separate the contributions by
      using the following two approaches. For the first one, a GO
      laminate was dried out in zero humidity of a glove box for one
      week and accurately weighted. Then, the laminate sample was
      exposed to a 1 M MgC solution and dried again in zero humidity for
      a week. A mass intake of 13±2% was found, that is, smaller than
      that in Fig. 5A. The latter result was confirmed by using a
      chemical approach. A sample of the same GO laminate exposed to a 1
      M MgC1⁄2 solution was dissolved in a mixture of nitric, sulphuric
      and perchloric acids at 300°C, which effectively turned carbon
      into CO2 (chemical burning of graphene). After this, ICP-OES (iCap
      6300) was employed to measure the amount of Mg in the resulting
      solution. We found 3-3.2% of Mg in weight, which translates into
      «13% mass intake of MgC from a 1 M solution, in agreement with the
      above result based on weighing. This percentage means that more
      than a half of the intake in Fig. 5A was due to the dry salt with
      the rest being additional bound water.<br>
      <br>
      [00116] This experiment was repeated at high and low pH. pH of the
      salt solution was adjusted by adding either dilute hydrochloric
      acid or ammonium hydroxide solutions as appropriate. The amount of
      salt absorbed into the GO membranes were measured after treating
      (immersing) the GO membranes in one molar salt solution with
      different pH for 24hour. The weight uptake was measured by using
      the gravimetric methods.<br>
      <br>
      [00117] The table below shows the results for MgC .<br>
      pJH Mass intake (wt%)<br>
      2 7.1 %<br>
      6 12.6%<br>
      11 18.2%<br>
      <br>
      [00118] As can be seen, the sorption capability of the membrane
      increases with pH. A similar trend was observed for NaCI. [00119]
      The large salt intake proves that the permeating solutes
      accumulate inside GO capillaries, leading to highly concentrated
      internal solutions. Using the measured amount of adsorbed salts
      and the known amount of water in fully hydrated GO laminates, we
      estimate that concentrations of the internal solutions reach
      several molar, that is, can exceed external C by a factor of 10 or
      more. This "salt sponge" effect is in qualitative agreement with
      the strong adsorption properties reported previously for graphene
      and GO powders.<br>
      <br>
      [00120] The accumulation of salts inside GO capillaries means that
      there is a significant energy gain when ions move inside
      capillaries from the bulk solution. Our MDS confirm this effect
      and indicate that the energy gain is mostly due to interaction of
      ions with graphene walls. The ion sponging is reminiscent of the
      standard capillary effects where molecules can gain energy by
      moving inside confined regions. In this case, water plays a role
      of a continuous medium in which the capillary-like pressure acts
      on ions, sucking them inside capillaries from the bulk water.<br>
      <br>
      [00121] This data shows that GO laminates can be effective as
      sorbents, particularly at high pH. The physical and chemical
      structures of the laminates, and particularly their capillary
      structures, are not altered when supported on, for example, a
      porous support. The size of the capillaries and the distribution
      of chemical functionalisation across the flakes and through the
      capillary network remains substantially the same. It is expected
      therefore that supported laminates are effective sorbents. For
      most practical applications, it is expected that the laminates
      would be supported on a porous support as indicated elsewhere in
      this specification. However, for some applications it may be
      advantageous to have an unsupported laminate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 6. X-ray analysis of GO laminates</b><br>
      <br>
      [00122] The GO laminates were also examined using X-ray
      diffraction. Figure 5B shows the diffraction peak for GO at a
      relative humidity of «50%. It corresponds to the interlayer
      separation d «8Α. For GO laminates immersed in water, the peak is
      shifted to d «13Α. It is interesting to note that the peak in
      water has not become notably broader. This means that the layered
      structure of GO laminates is preserved in the fully immersed
      state, and the additional water is adsorbed as an extra layer with
      a rather uniform thickness of «5Α.<br>
      <br>
      Taking into account that d for reduced GO is «4A, a free space of
      9±1A exists between graphene sheets and it is available for
      transport of water. The latter value is in good agreement with the
      permeation cut-off observed experimentally and in the MD
      simulations. We have also measured the volume of taken-in water by
      weighing. GO laminates exposed to nearly 100% humidity exhibited a
      water intake that was equal to approximately hxS where S is the
      laminate area and h its thickness. This is the volume of graphene
      capillaries, which is used to estimate diffusion through the
      equivalent water column (see the main text).<br>
      <br>
      [00123] When the GO laminates were soaked in NaCI or KCI solutions
      and then dried out at the same 50±10% humidity as above, d
      increased from 8 to 9 A (see Fig. 5B). This increase in the
      interlayer spacing is consistent with the fact that a significant
      amount of salts is trapped within graphene capillaries. On the
      other hand, d for GO inside a concentrated salt solution was found
      to be similar to that for GO in clean water. The latter
      observation is attributed to the fact that d is determined by the
      number of intercalating layers of water whereas ions are moving
      inside this water layer, in agreement with the MD simulations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 7. Molecular dynamics simulations</b><br>
      <br>
      [00124] Our basic modeling setup consisted of two equal water
      reservoirs connected by a capillary formed by parallel graphene
      sheets as shown in Fig. 3A. Sizes of the reservoirs and
      capillaries varied in different modeling experiments. To analyze
      the salt-sponge effect and study ion diffusion in the confined
      geometry, we used reservoirs with a height of 51.2 A, a length of
      50 A and a depth of 49.2 A, which were connected by a 30 A long
      capillary. A slightly smaller setup was used to assess sieving
      properties of graphene capillaries. It consisted of the reservoirs
      with a height of 23.6 A, a length of 50 A and a depth of 30.1 A,
      which were connected by a 20 A long capillary. For both setups, we
      varied the capillary width d from 7 to 13 A (d is the distance
      between the centers of the graphene sheets). When the same
      property was modeled, both setups yielded similar behavior.
      Periodic boundary conditions were applied in the Z direction, that
      is, along the capillary depth. Ions or molecules were added until
      the desired molar concentrations were reached. Water was modeled
      by using the simple point charge model. Sodium and chlorine ions
      were modeled by using the parameters from E. S. David, X. D. Liem.

      Chem. Phys. 115, 3732 (2001); magnesium and copper anions with the
      OPLS-AA parameters. Intermolecular interactions were described by
      the 12-6 Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential together with a Coulomb
      potential. Parameters for water/graphene interactions were
      reported in C. Ailan, W. A. Steele. J. Chem. Phys. 92, 3858 (1990)
      and T. Werder, J. H. Walther, R. L. Jaffe, T. Halicioglu, P.
      Koumoutsakos. J. Phys. Chem. B 107, 1345 (2003).<br>
      <br>
      [00125] The system was initially equilibrated at 300 K with a
      coupling time of 0.1 ps&lt;_1&gt;for 500 ps . In the modeling of
      sieving properties, our typical simulation runs were 100 ns long
      and obtained in the isobaric ensemble at the atmospheric pressure
      where the simulation box was allowed to change only in the X and Y
      direction with a pressure coupling time of 1 ps&lt;-1&gt;and a
      compressibility of 4.5x10&lt;"5&gt;bar&lt;1&gt;. The cutoff
      distance for nonbonding interactions was set up at 10 A, and the
      particle mesh Ewald summations method was used to model the
      system's electrostatics. During simulations, all the graphene
      atoms were held in fixed positions whereas other bonds were
      treated as flexible. A time step of 1 fs was employed.<br>
      <br>
      [00126] To model sieving properties of graphene, the GROMACS
      software was used. At the beginning of each simulation run, water
      molecules rapidly filled the graphene capillary forming one, two
      or three layer structures, depending on d. Then after a certain
      period of time, which depended on a solute in the feed reservoir,
      ions/molecules started enter the capillary and eventually reached
      the pure water reservoir for all the modeled solutes, except for
      toluene and octanol. The found permeation rates are shown in Fig.
      3B. We have also noticed that cations and anions move through the
      capillary together and without noticeably changing their hydration
      shells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 8. Theoretical analysis of permeation for large
        molecules</b><br>
      <br>
      [00127] In the case of organic molecules (for example, propanol)
      simulations showed that they entered the graphene capillary but
      then rapidly formed clusters that resided inside the capillary for
      a long time. The cluster formation is probably due to confinement.
      On the other hand, the long residence times can be attributed to
      van der Waals forces between the alcohol molecules and graphene.
      Toluene molecules exhibited even stronger interaction with
      graphene (due to π-π staking). In simulations, toluene molecules
      entered the channel but never left it being adsorbed to graphene
      walls (Fig. 6). This adsorption is likely to be responsible for
      the experimentally undetectable level of toluene permeation.
      Therefore, despite the experimental data suggesting a rather
      simple sieving behavior that can be explained just by the physical
      size effect, we believe that van der Waals interactions between
      solutes and graphene may also play a role in limiting permeation
      for those molecules and ions that have sizes close to the cutoff
      radius.<br>
      <br>
      [00128] To better understand the observed sieving effect with its
      sharp physical cutoff, the following analysis was performed. An
      artificial cluster was modeled as a truncated icosahedron and
      placed in the middle of the capillary as shown in the inset of
      Fig. 3B. The size of the cluster was varied by changing the
      distance between the constituent 60 atoms, and the interaction
      energy between the cluster and the graphene capillary was
      calculated. The energy was computed as the sum of interactions
      between all the atoms involved which were modeled with a 12-6 LJ
      potential. Positive and negative values of the calculated energy
      indicate whether the presence of the cluster in the capillary is
      energetically favorable or not, respectively. The minimum radius
      for which the spherical cluster was allowed into the graphene
      capillary obviously depended on the capillary size. For
      capillaries that allowed two monolayers of waters (d = 9A) this
      radius was found to be 4.7 A. For wider capillaries containing
      three water monolayers (d = 13A), the radius was 5.8A. These
      values are shown in Fig. 3B as the blue bars.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 9. Simulations of the ion sponge effect</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00129] In this case, a relatively long capillary (482 A) was
      employed such that its volume was comparable to that of the
      reservoirs (see Fig. 7A). The capillary width was varied between 9
      and 11 A, which corresponds to 2 and 3 monolayers of water. MDS
      were carried out in a canonical ensemble using LAMMPS. The
      temperature was set at 300 K by using the Nose-Hoover thermostat.
      The equations of motion were integrated using a velocity- Verlet
      scheme with a time step of 1.0 fs. The snapshots obtained in these
      simulations (an example is shown in Fig. 7A) were processed by
      Atomeye.<br>
      <br>
      [00130] During the simulations, we counted the number of ions
      inside the capillary as a function of time (Fig. 7B). If the
      initial concentration C of NaCI was taken constant over the entire
      system (for example, C =1 M for the black curve in Fig. 7B), we
      found that the salt moved from the reservoirs into the capillary,
      that is, ions were attracted to the confined region. Then, we used
      smaller initial C inside the two reservoirs (0.1 and 0.5 M) while
      keeping the same C =1 M inside the capillary. Despite the large
      concentration gradient, the salt still moved into the capillary
      rather than exited it (see Fig. 7B).<br>
      <br>
      [00131] In the next MDS experiment, a low concentration of NaCI
      was kept in the two reservoirs (C =0.1 M) and gradually increased
      C inside the graphene capillary up to 3 M. For C =2 M inside it,
      an influx of NaCI from the reservoirs was still observed. The salt
      started leaving the capillary only if C inside approached ~3 M.
      This allows an estimate of the equilibrium concentration of NaCI
      inside the graphene capillary as 2-3M, in good agreement with the
      experiments discussed in section #5. The concentration gradient
      corresponds to a capillary-like pressure of «50 bars, which acts
      on salt ions against the osmotic pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [00132] We have also assessed whether functionalized GO regions
      can play any major role in the salt sponge effect and, more
      generally, in molecular permeation through GO laminates. To this
      end, we used the same MDS setups as described above but added
      hydroxyl and epoxy groups to both walls of graphene capillaries.
      The epoxy group was modeled by binding an oxygen atom to two
      carbon atoms of graphene and the hydroxyl group (OH) by its oxygen
      bonded to a carbon atom. For simplicity, oxygen atoms were fixed
      in their positions whereas the O-H bond was treated as flexible.
      Fig. 4C shows an example of the latter simulations. Both ion and
      water dynamics inside GO capillaries is found to be extremely
      slow. Accordingly, we expect that the sponge effect should be
      weaker for functionalized capillary regions compared to pristine
      ones. In addition, the case where only regions near the entrances
      of the graphene capillary were covered with hydroxyl and epoxy
      groups was simulated (Fig. 7C). These simulations again showed
      slow water and ion dynamics, similar to the case of GO
      capillaries.<br>

      This invention relates to methods of purifying water using forward

      [0001] This invention relates to methods of purifying water using
      forward osmosis, with a graphene oxide laminate acting as a
      semi-permeable membrane. The laminate is formed from stacks of
      individual graphene oxide flakes which may be predominantly
      monolayer thick. The methods of the invention find particular
      application in the desalination of salt water.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The removal of solutes from water finds application in many
      fields.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] This may take the form of the purification of water for
      drinking or for watering crops or it may take the form of the
      purification of waste waters from industry to prevent
      environmental damage. Examples of applications for water
      purification include: the removal of salt from sea water for
      drinking water or for use in industry; the purification of
      brackish water; the removal of radioactive ions from water which
      has been involved in nuclear enrichment, nuclear power generation
      or nuclear clean-up (e.g. that involved in the decommissioning of
      former nuclear power stations or following nuclear incidents); the
      removal of environmentally hazardous substances (e.g. halogenated
      organic compounds, heavy metals, chlorates and perchlorates) from
      industrial waste waters before they enter the water system; and
      the removal of biological pathogens (e.g. viruses, bacteria,
      parasites, etc) from contaminated or suspect drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In many industrial contexts (e.g. the nuclear industry) it
      is often desirable to separate dangerous or otherwise undesired
      solutes from valuable (e.g. rare metal) solutes in industrial
      waste waters in order that the valuable solutes can be recovered
      and reused or sold.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Forward osmosis (FO) is an emerging membrane technologies
      which has recently found use in low energy desalination process
      and in brackish water filtration. In FO impure water and a highly
      concentrated solution of a salt (known as the draw solution (DS))
      are separated by a semi-permeable membrane, water moves from the
      saline water to the concentrated DS due to the osmotic gradient.
      Hence in FO the driving force is the differential osmotic pressure
      between feed and DS rather than applied hydraulic pressure as in
      reverse osmosis. One of the key challenges remaining in this
      technology is developing a suitable DS that can generate a high
      osmotic pressure to produce higher water flux while being easy to
      re-concentrate and recover at a lower energy cost.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Graphene is believed to be impermeable to all gases and
      liquids. Membranes made from graphene oxide (GO) are impermeable
      to most liquids, vapours and gases, including helium. However, an
      academic study has shown that, surprisingly, graphene oxide
      membranes which are composed of graphene oxide having a thickness
      around 1 μηι supported on porous alumina are permeable to water
      even though they are impermeable to helium. These graphene oxide
      sheets allow unimpeaded permeation of water (10&lt;10&gt;times
      faster than He) (Nair et al. Science, 2012, 335, 442-444). Such GO
      laminates are particularly attractive as potential filtration or
      separation media because they are easy to fabricate, mechanically
      robust and offer no principal obstacles towards industrial scale
      production.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] In accordance with a first aspect of the invention there is
      provided a method of reducing the amount of one or more solutes in
      an aqueous mixture to produce a liquid depleted in said solutes;
      the method comprising the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      a) contacting the aqueous mixture with a first face of a membrane
      which comprises graphene oxide; and<br>
      <br>
      b) contacting a second face of the membrane with at least one draw
      solute.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The membrane may be a graphene oxide membrane comprising
      only flakes of graphene oxide which may be bound together due to
      van der Waals forces or the like, or it may comprise graphene
      oxide flakes which are bound together by chemical or physical
      means such as with a polymer or adhesive. Alternatively, the
      membrane may comprise flakes of graphene oxide which are supported
      on a porous material to provide structural integrity. The flakes
      may be bound to one another and to the support due to van der
      Waals forces or the like, or by physical or chemical means.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In the membrane which comprises graphene oxide, the
      graphene oxide itself is preferably in the form of a laminate
      membrane. This is the case irrespective of whether or not a porous
      material is present to provide additional support.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The term "solute" applies to both ions and counter-ions,
      and to uncharged molecular species present in the solution. Once
      dissolved in aqueous media a salt forms a solute comprising
      hydrated ions and counter-ions. The uncharged molecular species
      can be referred to as "non-ionic species". Examples of non-ionic
      species are small organic molecules such as aliphatic or aromatic
      hydrocarbons (eg toluene, benzene, hexane, etc), alcohols (eg
      methanol, ethanol, propanol, glycerol, etc), carbohydrates (eg
      sugars such as sucrose), and amino acids and peptides. The
      non-ionic species may or may not hydrogen bond with water. As will
      be readily apparent to the person skilled in the art, the term
      'solute' does not encompass solid substances which are not
      dissolved in the aqueous mixture. Particulate matter will not pass
      through the membranes of the invention even if the particulate is
      comprised of ions with small radii.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The term "draw solute" refers to ionic or non-ionic species
      which are readily soluble in water. The draw solute may be in the
      form of an aqueous solution with a concentration which is
      sufficient to exert an osmotic effect on an aqueous mixture
      present on the other side of the membrane of the invention.
      Alternatively, the draw solute may be in the form of a solid which
      rapidly forms an aqueous solution during the practising of the
      method of the invention, thus generating an aqueous solution with
      a concentration which is sufficient to exert an osmotic effect on
      an aqueous mixture present on the other side of the membrane of
      the invention. The osmotic effect results in the transport of
      water through the membrane from the aqueous mixture into the draw
      solute.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Solutes i.e. ionic and non-ionic species present in the
      aqueous mixture having a hydration radius of greater than about
      4.7 A are not transported through the membrane. Solutes having a
      hydration radius smaller than about 4.5 A may pass through the
      membrane but only to a limited extent. In this way, the
      concentration of such solutes of less than about 4.5 A hydration
      radius may be reduced in the resulting draw solute solution
      relative to the concentration of the same solutes in the original
      aqueous mixture. The reduction is typically in the range of about
      10-90%, e.g. the range of about 30-80% or the range of about
      50-70%.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The term "hydration radius" refers to the effective radius
      of the molecule when solvated in aqueous media.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The reduction of the amount of one or more selected solutes
      in the solution which is treated with the GO membranes used in the
      methods of present invention may entail entire removal of the or
      each selected solute. Alternatively, the reduction may not entail
      complete removal of a particular solute but simply a lowering of
      its concentration. The reduction may result in an altered ratio of
      the concentration of one or more solutes relative to the
      concentration of one or more other solutes. The inventors have
      found that solutes with a hydration radius of less than about 4.5
      A pass very quickly through a graphene oxide laminate whereas
      solutes with a hydration radius greater than about 4.7 A do not
      pass through at all. The inventors have found that under forward
      osmosis conditions even the concentrations of the solutes with a
      hydration radius of less than about 4.5 A are lower in the product
      aqueous mixture, i.e. the 'purified' liquid, than they were in the
      original aqueous mixture which contained those solutes. It is
      thought that this is due to the osmotic effect of the draw solute.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In cases in which a salt is formed from one ion having a
      hydration radius of larger than about 4.7 A and a counter-ion with
      a hydration radius of less than about 4.7 A, neither ion will pass
      through the membrane of the invention because of the electrostatic
      attraction between the ions. Thus, for example, in the case
      KsFe(CN)6, neither the Fe(CN)6&lt;3"&gt;nor the K&lt;+&gt;pass
      through the membrane even though the hydration radius of
      K&lt;+&gt;is less than 4.7 A.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The size exclusion limit of the membrane is about 4.7 A;
      however, this exclusion limit may vary between about 4.5 A and
      about 4.7 A. In the region around sizes between about 4.5 A and
      about 4.7 A the degree of transmission decreases by orders of
      magnitude and consequently the perceived value of the size
      exclusion limit depends on the amount of transmission of solute
      that is acceptable for a particular application.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The flakes of graphene oxide which are stacked to form the
      laminates which may be used in the methods of the invention are
      usually monolayer graphene oxide. However, it is possible to use
      flakes of graphene oxide containing from 2 to 10 atomic layers of
      carbon in each flake. These multilayer flakes are frequently
      referred to as "few-layer" flakes. Thus the membrane may be made
      entirely from monolayer graphene oxide flakes, from a mixture of
      monolayer and few-layer flakes, or from entirely few-layer flakes.
      Ideally, the flakes are entirely or predominantly, i.e. more than
      75% w/w, monolayer graphene oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The method may further comprise the step (c) recovering the
      purified aqueous liquid from or downstream from the second face of
      the membrane. That purified liquid will typically be a solution of
      the draw solute, but will typically contain substantially no other
      solute having a hydration radius of greater than about 4.7 A. The
      purified aqueous mixture may also contain a reduced amount of one
      or more solutes with a hydration radius less than about 4.5 A
      relative to the original aqueous mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In one embodiment, the draw solute may have a hydration
      radius greater than 4.7 A. Thus the draw solute may be one or more
      carbohydrate, e.g. sucrose, fructose, glucose or a mixture
      thereof. A draw solute having a lower hydration radius than 4.7 A
      may also be used provided that the osmotic pressure in the draw
      solute is sufficient to ensure forward osmosis occurs and to
      prevent any unwanted escape of draw solute through the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The method may comprise the step (d) separating the draw
      solute from the purified aqueous liquid, for example, by the
      evaporation/condensation of water.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the purified aqueous solution comprising the draw
      solute may be the desired product.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The step of separating the draw solute from the purified
      aqueous liquid may comprise (e) contacting a first face of a size
      exclusion (e,g. a second graphene oxide laminate) membrane with
      the purified aqueous liquid containing the draw solute;<br>
      <br>
      (f) recovering the purified aqueous liquid containing a
      substantially reduced amount of the (e.g. substantially no) draw
      solute, from or downstream from a second face of the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] It may be that the draw solute includes one or more
      consumable carbohydrates (e.g. sucrose, glucose, fructose) and the
      method of the invention is a method of producing drinking water.
      In this case, the purified aqueous mixture comprising the draw
      solute will be drinkable as a sugary solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] It may be that the method of the invention comprises the
      iterative repetition of steps (a) and (b) (and optionally steps
      (c) and/or (d)). This may be needed in the case where a single
      iteration of steps (a) and (b) only provides a reduction in the
      concentration of a solute with a hydration radius less than about
      4.5 A, but a greater reduction is required. The method may be
      repeated until the concentration of the solute is reduced to the
      required level. This may be the case in the desalination of water
      for drinking, where a reduced concentration of salt is acceptable.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The method may also be part of a larger separation process
      involving other conventional separation steps (before and / or
      after the graphene oxide separation step(s)) designed to remove
      other contaminants.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The method may involve a plurality of graphene oxide
      laminate membranes. Said plurality of membranes may be used in
      parallel (to increase the total water flux of the process) or in
      series (to provide an iterative purification process).<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In a preferred embodiment, the method is a method of
      desalination. Thus, the solutes the concentrations of which are
      reduced in the methods of the invention may include NaCI.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In an embodiment, the method is continuous.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In accordance with a second aspect of the invention is
      provided the use of a graphene oxide laminate membrane in the
      purification of water by forward osmosis.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In accordance with a third aspect of the invention there is
      provided a forward osmosis membrane comprising graphene oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The membrane may be a graphene oxide membrane comprising
      only flakes graphene oxide which may be bound together due to van
      der Waals forces or the like, or it may comprise graphene oxide
      flakes which are bound together by chemical or physical means such
      as with a polymer or adhesive. Alternatively, the membrane may
      comprise flakes of graphene oxide which are supported on a porous
      material to provide structural integrity. The flakes may be bound
      to one another and to the support due to van der Waals forces or
      the like, or by physical or chemical means.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In the membrane which comprises graphene oxide, the
      graphene oxide itself may in one embodiment be in the form of a
      laminate. This is the case irrespective of whether or not a porous
      material is present to provide additional support.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The graphene oxide membrane may be in the form of a
      container which is able to retain a draw solute or it may form
      part of an interchangeable element which itself is part of a
      container for draw solute.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The following embodiments can apply to the first, second or
      third aspects of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The graphene oxide laminates used in the invention may
      comprise a cross-linking agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] A cross linking agent is a substance which bonds with GO
      flakes in the laminate. The cross linking agent may form hydrogen
      bonds with GO flakes or it may form covalent bonds with GO flakes.
      Examples include diamines (e.g. ethyl diamine, propyl diamine,
      phenylene diamine), polyallylamines and imidazole. Without wishing
      to be bound by theory, it is believed that these are examples of
      crosslinking agents which form hydrogen bonds with GO flakes.
      Other examples include borate ions and polyetherimides formed from
      capping the GO with polydopamine. Examples of appropriate cross
      linking systems can be found in Tian et al, {Adv. Mater. 2013, 25,
      2980-2983), An et al {Adv. Mater. 2011 , 23, 3842-3846), Hung et
      al (Cross-linking with Diamine monomers to Prepare Composite
      Graphene Oxide- Framework Membranes with Varying d-Spacing;
      Chemistry of Materials, 2014) and Park et al (Graphene Oxide
      Sheets Chemically Cross-Linked by polyallylamine; J. Phys. Chem.
      C; 2009)<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The GO laminate may comprise a polymer. The polymer may be
      interspersed throughout the membrane. It may occupy the spaces
      between graphene oxide flakes, thus providing interlayer
      crosslinking. The polymer may be PVA (see for example Li et al
      Adv. Mater. 2012, 24, 3426-3431). It has been found that GO
      laminates comprising interspersed polymer exhibit improved
      adhesiveness to certain substrates (e.g. metals) than GO membranes
      which do not comprise a polymer. Other polymers which could be
      used in this manner include poly(4-styrenesulfonate), Nafion,
      carboxymethyl cellulose, Chitosan, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,
      polyaniline etc. It may be that the polymer is water soluble.
      Where the GO laminate comprises a polymer, that polymer (e.g. PVA)
      may be present in an amount from about 0.1 to about 50 wt%, e.g.
      from about 5 to about 45 wt%. Thus, the GO laminate may comprise
      from about 20 to about 40 wt% polymer.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, it may be that the polymer is not water soluble.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] It may be that the GO laminate does not comprise a polymer.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The GO laminate may comprise other inorganic materials,
      e.g. other two dimensional materials, such as graphene, reduced
      graphene oxide, hBN, mica. The presence of mica, for example can
      slightly improve the mechanical properties of the GO laminate.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The membrane may be a graphene oxide membrane comprising
      only flakes of graphene oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Preferably, the graphene oxide laminate membrane is
      supported on a porous material. This can improve structural
      integrity. In other words, the graphene oxide flakes may
      themselves form a layer e.g. a laminate which itself is associated
      with a porous support such as a porous membrane to form a further
      laminate structure. In this embodiment, the resulting structure is
      a laminate of graphene flakes mounted on the porous support. In a
      further illustrative example, the graphene oxide laminate membrane
      may be sandwiched between layers of a porous material.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Thus, the graphene oxide laminate membrane may be comprised
      in a composite with a porous support, e.g. a flexible porous
      support.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In an embodiment, the graphene oxide laminate membrane has
      a thickness greater than about 100 nm, e.g. greater than about 500
      nm, e.g. a thickness between about 500 nm and about 100 μηι. The
      graphene oxide laminate membrane may have a thickness up to about
      50 μηι. The graphene oxide laminate membrane may have a thickness
      greater than about 1 μηι, e.g. a thickness between 1 μηι and 15
      μηι. Thus, the graphene oxide laminate membrane may have a
      thickness of about 5 μηι.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In an embodiment, the graphene oxide flakes of which the
      membrane is comprised have an average oxygen:carbon weight ratio
      in the range 0.2: 1.0 to 0.5: 1.0, e.g. in the range 0.25: 1.0 to
      0.45: 1.0. Preferably, the flakes have an average oxygen:carbon
      weight ratio in the range 0.3:1.0 to 0.4:1.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] It may be that the graphene oxide laminate membrane is
      formed from graphene oxide which has been prepared by the
      oxidation of natural graphite.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In an embodiment, the porous support is an inorganic
      material. Thus, the porous support (e.g. membrane) may comprise a
      ceramic. Preferably, the support is alumina, zeolite, or silica.
      In one embodiment, the support is alumina. Zeolite A can also be
      used. Ceramic membranes have also been produced in which the
      active layer is amorphous titania or silica produced by a sol-gel
      process.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In an alternate embodiment, the support is a polymeric
      material. Thus, the porous support may thus be a porous polymer
      support, e.g. a flexible porous polymer Preferably it is PTFE,
      PVDF or Cyclopore™ polycarbonate. In an embodiment, the porous
      support (e.g. membrane) may comprise a polymer. In an embodiment,
      the polymer may comprise a synthetic polymer. These can be used in
      the invention. Alternatively, the polymer may comprise a natural
      polymer or modified natural polymer. Thus, the polymer may
      comprise a polymer based on cellulose.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In another embodiment, the porous support (e.g. membrane)
      may comprise a carbon monolith.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In an embodiment, the porous support layer has a thickness
      of no more than a few tens of μηι, and ideally is less than about
      100 μηι. Preferably, it has a thickness of 50 μηι or less, more
      preferably of 10 μηι or less, and yet more preferably is less 5
      μηι. In some cases it may be less than about 1 μηι thick though
      preferably it is more than about 1 μηι.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Preferably, the thickness of the entire membrane (i.e. the
      graphene oxide laminate and the support) is from about 1 μηι to
      about 200 μηι, e.g. from about 5 μηι to about 50.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The porous support should be porous enough not to interfere
      with water transport but have small enough pores that graphene
      oxide platelets cannot enter the pores. Thus, the porous support
      must be water permeable. In an embodiment, the pore size must be
      less than 1 μηι. In an embodiment, the support has a uniform pore-
      structure. Examples of porous membranes with a uniform pore
      structure are electrochemically manufactured alumina membranes
      (e.g. those with the trade names: Anopore™, Anodisc™).<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0058] The present invention involves the use of a graphene oxide
      laminate membrane. Typically, these are made of impermeable
      functionalized graphene sheets that have a typical size L «1 μηι
      and the interlayer separation, d, sufficient to accommodate a
      mobile layer of water. The graphene oxide laminates and laminate
      membranes of the invention comprise stacks of individual graphene
      oxide flakes, in which the flakes are predominantly monolayer
      graphene oxide. Although the flakes are predominantly monolayer
      graphene oxide, it is within the scope of this invention that some
      of the graphene oxide is present as two- or few-layer graphene
      oxide. Thus, it may be that at least 75% by weight of the graphene
      oxide is in the form of monolayer graphene oxide flakes, or it may
      be that at least 85% by weight of the graphene oxide is in the
      form of monolayer graphene oxide flakes (e.g. at least 95 %, for
      example at least 99% by weight of the graphene oxide is in the
      form of monolayer graphene oxide flakes) with the remainder made
      up of two- or few- layer graphene oxide. Without wishing to be
      bound by theory, it is believed that water and solutes pass
      through pathways formed between the graphene oxide flakes by
      capillary action and that the specific structure of the graphene
      oxide laminate membranes leads to the remarkable selectivity
      observed as well as the remarkable speed at which the ions
      permeate the laminate structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The solutes to be removed from aqueous mixtures in the
      methods of the present invention may be defined in terms of their
      hydrated radius. Likewise, the draw solutes used in the methods of
      the present invention may be defined in terms of their hydrated
      radius. Below are the hydrated radii of some exemplary solutes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0060] Table 1</b><br>
      &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="281513025-imgf000011_0001" /&gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The hydrated radii of many species are available in the
      literature. However, for some species the hydrated radii may not
      be available. The radii of many species are described in terms of
      their Stokes radius and typically this information will be
      available where the hydrated radius is not. For example, of the
      above species, there exist no literature values for the hydrated
      radius of propanol, sucrose, glycerol and PTS&lt;4"&gt;. The
      hydrated radii of these species which are provided in the table
      above have been estimated using their Stokes/crystal radii. To
      this end, the hydrated radii for a selection of species in which
      this value was known can be plotted as a function of the Stokes
      radii for those species and this yields a simple linear
      dependence. Hydrated radii for propanol, sucrose, glycerol and
      PTS&lt;4"&gt;were then estimated using the linear dependence and
      the known Stokes radii of those species.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] There are a number of methods described in the literature
      for the calculation of hydration radii. Examples are provided in
      'Determination of the effective hydrodynamic radii of small
      molecules by viscometry'; Schultz and Soloman; The Journal of
      General Physiology; 44; 1 189-1199 (1963); and 'Phenomenological
      Theory of Ion Solvation'; E. R. Nightingale. J. Phys. Chem. 63,
      1381 (1959).<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The term 'aqueous mixture' refers to any mixture of
      substances which comprises at least 10% water by weight. It may
      comprise at least 50% water by weight and preferably comprises at
      least 80% water by weight, e.g. at least 90% water by weight. The
      mixture may be a solution, a suspension, an emulsion or a mixture
      thereof. Typically the aqueous mixture will be an aqueous solution
      in which one or more solutes are dissolved in water. This does not
      exclude the possibility that there might be particulate matter,
      droplets or micelles suspended in the solution. Of course, it is
      expected that the particulate matter will not pass through the
      membranes of the invention even if it is comprised of ions with
      small radii.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The graphene oxide for use in this application can be made
      by any means known in the art. In a preferred method, graphite
      oxide can be prepared from graphite flakes (e.g. natural graphite
      flakes) by treating them with potassium permanganate and sodium
      nitrate in concentrated sulphuric acid. This method is called
      Hummers method. Another method is the Brodie method, which
      involves adding potassium chlorate (KCIO3) to a slurry of graphite
      in fuming nitric acid. For a review see, Dreyer et al. The
      chemistry of graphene oxide, Chem. Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 228-240.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Individual graphene oxide (GO) sheets can then be
      exfoliated by dissolving graphite oxide in water or other polar
      solvents with the help of ultrasound, and bulk residues can then
      be removed by centrifugation and optionally a dialysis step to
      remove additional salts.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In a specific embodiment, the graphene oxide of which the
      graphene oxide laminate membranes of the invention are comprised
      is not formed from wormlike graphite. Worm-like graphite is
      graphite that has been treated with concentrated sulphuric acid
      and hydrogen peroxide at 1000C to convert graphite into an
      expanded "worm-like" graphite. When this worm-like graphite
      undergoes an oxidation reaction it exhibits a higher increase the
      oxidation rate and efficiency (due to a higher surface area
      available in expanded graphite as compared to pristine graphite)
      and the resultant graphene oxide contains more oxygen functional
      groups than graphene oxide prepared from natural graphite.
      Laminate membranes formed from such highly functionalized graphene
      oxide can be shown to have a wrinkled surface topography and
      lamellar structure (Sun et al,; Selective Ion Penetration of
      Graphene Oxide Membranes; ACS Nano 7, 428 (2013) which differs
      from the layered structure observed in laminate membranes formed
      from graphene oxide prepared from natural graphite. Such membranes
      do not show fast ion permeation of small ions and a selectivity
      which is substantially unrelated to size (being due rather to
      interactions between solutes and the graphene oxide functional
      groups) compared to laminate membranes formed from graphene oxide
      prepared from natural graphite.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Without wishing to be bound by theory, individual GO
      crystallites formed from non-worm like graphite (e.g. natural or
      pristine graphite) may have two types of regions: functionalized
      (oxidized) and pristine. The former regions may act as spacers
      that keep adjacent crystallites apart and the pristine graphene
      regions may form the capillaries which afford the membranes their
      unique properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The preparation of graphene oxide supported on a porous
      membrane can be achieved using filtration, spray coating, casting,
      dip coating techniques, road coating, inject printing, or any
      other thin film coating techniques<br>
      <br>
      [0069] For large scale production of supported graphene based
      membranes or sheets it is preferred to use spray coating, road
      coating or inject printing techniques. One benefit of spray
      coating is that spraying GO solution in water on to the porous
      support material at an elevated temperature produces a large
      uniform GO film.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Graphite oxide consists of micrometer thick stacked
      graphite oxide flakes (defined by the starting graphite flakes
      used for oxidation, after oxidation it gets expanded due to the
      attached functional groups) and can be considered as a
      polycrystalline material.<br>
      <br>
      Exfoliation of graphite oxide in water into individual graphene
      oxide flakes was achieved by the sonication technique followed by
      centrifugation at 10000 rpm to remove few layers and thick flakes.
      Graphene oxide laminates were formed by restacking of these single
      or few layer graphene oxides by a number of different techniques
      such as spin coating, spray coating, road coating and vacuum
      filtration.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Graphene oxide membranes according to the invention consist
      of overlapped layers of randomly oriented single layer graphene
      oxide sheets with smaller dimensions (due to sonication). These
      membranes can be considered as a centimetre size single crystals
      (grains) formed by parallel graphene oxide sheets. Due to this
      difference in layered structure, the atomic structure of the
      capillary structure of graphene oxide membranes and graphite oxide
      are different. It is believed that for graphene oxide membranes
      the edge functional groups are located over the non-functionalised
      regions of another graphene oxide sheet while in graphite oxide
      mostly edges are aligned over another graphite oxide edge. These
      differences unexpectedly may influence the permeability properties
      of graphene oxide membranes as compared to those of graphite
      oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] We have studied GO laminates that were prepared from GO
      suspensions by using vacuum filtration as described in Example 1.
      The resulting membranes were checked for their continuity by using
      a helium leak detector before and after filtration experiments,
      which proved that the membranes were vacuum-tight in the dry
      state. Figure 1 shows schematics of our experiments. The feed and
      permeate compartments were initially filled with different liquids
      (same or different height) including water, glycerol, toluene,
      ethanol, benzene and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). No permeation
      could be detected over a period of many weeks by monitoring liquid
      levels and using chemical analysis. The situation principally
      changed if both compartments were filled with water solutions. In
      this case, permeation through the same vacuum-tight membrane can
      readily be observed as rapid changes in liquid levels (several mm
      per day). The direction of flow is given by osmotic pressure. For
      example, a level of a one molar (1 M) sucrose solution in the feed
      compartment rises whereas it falls in the permeate compartment
      filled with deionized water. For a membrane with a thickness h of
      1 μηι, we find osmotic water flow rates of «0.2 L
      nr&lt;2&gt;h&lt;"1&gt;, and the speed increases with increasing
      the molar concentration C. Because a 1 M sucrose solution
      corresponds to an osmotic pressure of «25 bar at room temperature
      (van't Hoff factor is 1 in this case), the flow rates agree with
      the evaporation rates of «10 L nr&lt;2&gt;h&lt;"1&gt;reported for
      similar GO membranes (Nair et al. Science, 2012, 335, 442-444), in
      which case the permeation was driven by a capillary pressure of
      the order of 1 ,000 bars. Note that hydrostatic pressures in these
      experiments never exceeded 10&lt;"2&gt;bar and, therefore, could
      be neglected.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] After establishing that GO membranes connect the feed and
      permeate containers with respect to transport of water molecules,
      we have investigated the possibility that dissolved ions and
      molecules can simultaneously diffuse through capillaries. To this
      end, we have filled the feed container with various solutions and
      studied if any of the solutes appears on the other side of GO
      membranes, that is, in the permeate container filled with
      deionized water (Fig. 1 B). As a quick test, ion transport can be
      probed by monitoring electrical conductivity of water in the
      permeate container (Fig. 4). We have found that for some salts
      (for example, KCI) the conductivity increases with time but
      remains unaffected for others (for example, K3[Fe(CN)6]) over many
      days of measurements. This suggests that only certain ions may
      diffuse through GO laminates. Note that ions are not dragged by
      the osmosis-driven water flow but move in the opposite direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] To quantify permeation rates for diffusing solutes and test
      those that do not lead to an increase in conductivity (sucrose,
      glycerol and so on), we have employed various analytical
      techniques. Depending on a solute, we have used ion
      chromatography, inductively coupled plasma optical emission
      spectrometry, total organic carbon analysis and optical absorption
      spectroscopy. As an example, Figure 1 C shows our results for MgC
      which were obtained by using ion chromatography and inductively
      coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry for Mg&lt;2+&gt;and
      CI&lt;"&gt;, respectively. One can see that concentrations of
      Mg&lt;2+&gt;and CI&lt;"&gt;in the permeate container increase
      linearly with time, as expected. Slopes of such curves yield
      permeation rates. The inset of Fig. 1 C illustrates that the
      observed rates depend linearly on C in the feed container. Note
      that cations and anions move through membranes in stoichiometric
      amounts so that charge neutrality within each of the containers is
      preserved. Otherwise, an electric field would build up across the
      membrane, slowing fast ions until the neutrality is reached. In
      Fig. 1 C, permeation of one Mg&lt;2+&gt;ion is accompanied by two
      ions of chloride, and the neutrality condition is satisfied.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Figure 2 summarizes our results obtained for different
      ionic and molecular solutions. The small species permeate with
      approximately the same speed whereas large ions and organic
      molecules exhibit no detectable permeation. The effective volume
      occupied by an ion in water is characterized by its hydrated
      radius. If plotted as a function of this parameter, our data are
      well described by a single-valued function with a sharp cutoff at
      «4.5Α (Fig. 2). Species larger than this are sieved out. This
      behavior corresponds to a physical size of the mesh of «9Α. Fig. 2
      also shows that permeation rates do not exhibit any notable
      dependence on ion charge and triply charged ions such as
      As04&lt;3"&gt;permeate with approximately the same rate as
      singly-charged Na&lt;+&gt;or CI&lt;"&gt;. Finally, to prove the
      essential role of water for ion permeation through GO laminates,
      we dissolved KCI and CuS04in DMSO, the polar nature of which
      allows solubility of these salts. No permeation has been detected,
      proving that the special affinity of GO laminates to water is
      important. [0076] To explain the observed sieving properties, it
      is possible to employ the model previously suggested to account
      for unimpeded evaporation of water through GO membranes (Nair ef
      al. Science, 2012, 335, 442-444). Individual GO crystallites may
      have two types of regions: functionalized (oxidized) and pristine.
      The former regions may act as spacers that keep adjacent
      crystallites apart. It may be that, in a hydrated state, the
      spacers help water to intercalate between GO sheets, whereas the
      pristine regions provide a network of capillaries that allow
      nearly frictionless flow of a layer of correlated water. The
      earlier experiments using GO laminates in air with a typical d «10
      A have been explained by assuming one monolayer of moving water.
      For GO laminates soaked in water, d increases to «13+1 A, which
      allows two or three monolayers. Taking into account the effective
      thickness of graphene of 3.4 A (interlayer distance in graphite),
      this yields a pore size of «9-10 A, in agreement with the mesh
      size found experimentally.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] To support this model, molecular dynamics simulations (MDS)
      can be used. The setup is shown in Fig. 3A where a graphene
      capillary separates feed and permeate reservoirs, and its width is
      varied between 7 and 13 A to account for the possibility of one,
      two or three monolayers of water. It is found that the narrowest
      MDS capillaries become filled with a monolayer of ice as described
      previously and do not allow inside even such small ions as
      Na&lt;+&gt;and CI&lt;"&gt;. However, for two and three monolayers
      expected in the fully hydrated state, ions enter the capillaries
      and diffuse into the permeate reservoir. Their permeation rates
      are found approximately the same for all small ions and show
      little dependence on ionic charge (Fig. 3B). Larger species
      (toluene and octanol) cannot permeate even through capillaries
      containing three monolayers of water (Fig. 6). Large solutes have
      been modelled as atomic clusters of different size and it is found
      that the capillaries accommodating 2 and 3 water monolayers
      rejects clusters with the radius larger than «4.7 and 5.8 A,
      respectively. This probably indicates that the ion permeation
      through GO laminates is limited by regions containing two
      monolayers of water. The experimental and theory results in Figs 2
      &amp; 3B show good agreement.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Regarding the absolute value of ion permeation rates found
      experimentally, it is possible to estimate that, for laminates
      with h «5 μηι and L «1 μηι, the effective length of graphene
      capillaries is Lxh/d «5 mm and they occupy d/L «0.1 % of the
      surface area of the GO membrane. For a typical diffusion
      coefficient of ions in water («10&lt;-5&gt;cm&lt;2&gt;/s), the
      expected diffusion rate for a 1 M solution through GO membrane is
      «10&lt;"3&gt;mg/h/cm&lt;2&gt;, that is, thousands of times smaller
      than the rates observed experimentally. Moreover, this estimate
      neglects the fact that functionalized regions narrow the effective
      water column. To appreciate how fast the observed permeation is,
      we have used the standard coffee filter paper and found the same
      diffusion rates for the paper of 1 mm in thickness (the diffusion
      barrier is equivalent to a couple of mm of pure water). Such fast
      transport of small ions cannot be explained by the confinement,
      which increases the diffusion coefficient by 50%, reflecting the
      change from bulk to two-dimensional water. Furthermore,
      functionalized regions (modeled as graphene with randomly attached
      epoxy groups) do not enhance diffusion but rather suppress it as
      expected because of the broken translational symmetry.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] To understand the ultrafast ion permeation, it should be
      recalled that graphene and GO powders exhibit a high adsorption
      efficiency with respect to many salts. Despite being very densely
      stacked, GO laminates are surprisingly found to retain this
      property for salts with small hydrated radii. Experiments show
      that permeating salts are adsorbed in amounts reaching as much as
      25% of membranes' initial weight (Fig. 5). The large intake
      implies highly concentrated solutions inside graphene capillaries
      (close to the saturation). MDS simulations confirm that small ions
      prefer to reside inside capillaries (Fig. 7). The affinity of
      salts to graphene capillaries indicates an energy gain with
      respect to the bulk water, and this translates into a
      capillary-like pressure that acts on ions within a water medium,
      rather than on water molecules in the standard capillary physics.
      Therefore, in addition to the normal diffusion, there is a large
      capillary force, sucking small ions inside the membranes and
      facilitating their permeation. Our MDS provide an estimate for
      this ionic pressure as «50 bars. The membranes would therefore be
      expected to form efficient sorbents for appropriate solutes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1. Fabrication and characterization of GO membranes and
        Experimental Set-up</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0080] Graphite oxide was prepared by exposing millimeter size
      flakes of natural graphite to concentrated sulfuric acid, sodium
      nitrate and potassium permanganate (Hummers' method). Then,
      graphite oxide was exfoliated into monolayer flakes by sonication
      in water, which was followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm to
      remove remaining few-layer crystals. GO membranes were prepared by
      vacuum filtration of the resulting GO suspension through Anodisc
      alumina membranes with a pore size of 0.2 μηι. By changing the
      volume of the filtered GO solution, it was possible to accurately
      control the thickness h of the resulting membranes, making them
      from 1 to more than 10 μηι thick. For consistency, all the
      membranes described in this report were chosen to be 5 μηι in
      thickness, unless a dependence on 7 was specifically investigated.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] GO laminates were usually left on top of the Anodiscs that
      served as a support to improve mechanical stability. In addition,
      influence of this porous support on permeation properties of GO
      was checked and they were found to be similar to those of free
      standing membranes. [0082] The permeation experiments were
      performed using a U-shaped device shown in Fig. 1 of the main
      text. It consisted of two tubular compartments fabricated either
      from glass or copper tubes (inner diameters of 25 mm), which were
      separated by the studied GO membranes. The membranes were glued to
      a Cu foil with an opening of 1 cm in diameter (see Fig. 1 of the
      main text). The copper foil was clamped between two O-rings, which
      provided a vacuum-tight seal between the two compartments. In a
      typical experiment, one of the compartments was filled (referred
      to as feed) with a salt or molecular solution up to a height of
      approximately 20 cm (0.1 L volume). The other (permeate)
      compartment was filled with deionized water to the same level.
      Note that the hydrostatic pressure due to level changes played no
      role in these experiments where the permeation was driven by large
      concentration gradients. Magnetic stirring was used in both feed
      and permeate compartments to avoid possible concentration
      gradients near the membranes (concentration polarization effect).<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The GO membranes including their entire assembly with the
      O-rings were thoroughly tested for any possible cracks and holes.
      In the first control experiment, GO membranes were substituted
      with a thin Cu foil glued to the Cu foil with all the other steps
      remaining the same. Using a highly concentrated salt solution in
      the feed compartment, we could not detect any permeation. In the
      second experiment, we used reduced GO, which makes the GO membrane
      water impermeable. Again, no salt permeation could be detected,
      which proves the absence of holes in the original GO membrane.
      Finally and most conclusively, we used a helium-leak detector. No
      holes could be detected in our GO membranes both before and after
      permeation measurements<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Although graphite oxide is known to be soluble in water,
      the vacuum-filtered GO laminates were found to be highly stable in
      water, and it was practically impossible to re- disperse them
      without extensive sonication. No degradation or damage of
      membranes was noticed in these filtration experiments lasting for
      many weeks. To quantify the solubility of GO laminates, we
      accurately measured their weight and thickness before and after
      immersing in water for two weeks. No weight or thickness loss
      could be detected within our accuracy of &lt;0.5%.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Membranes were thoroughly tested for any possible cracks or
      holes by using a helium-leak detector as described in Nair et al.
      Science, 2012, 335, 442-444. To check the laminar structure of our
      GO membranes, we performed X-ray diffraction measurements, which
      yielded the interlayer separation d of 9-10 A at a relative
      humidity of 50±10%.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] PVA-GO laminate samples were prepared by blending water
      solutions of GO and PVA using a magnetic stirrer. The
      concentrations were chosen such that a weight percentage of GO in
      the final laminates of 60-80% was achieved, after water was
      removed by evaporation. We used vacuum filtration, drop casting
      and rod coating techniques to produce free standing PVA-GO
      membranes and PVA-GO coated substrates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2. Monitoring ion diffusion by electrical measurements</b><br>
      <br>
      [0087] For a quick qualitative test of ion permeation through GO
      membranes, the setup shown in Fig. 4 was used. The feed and
      permeate compartments were separated by GO membranes. We used the
      same assembly as described above but instead of Cu foil GO were
      glued to a glass slide with 2 mm hole and the liquid cell was
      small and made entirely from Teflon. The feed compartment was
      initially filled with a few mL of a concentrated salt solution,
      and the permeate compartment contained a similar volume of
      deionized water. The typical feed solution was approximately a
      million times more electrically conducting than deionized water at
      room temperature. Therefore, if ions diffuse through the membrane,
      this results in an increase in conductivity of water at the
      permeate side.<br>
      <br>
      Permeation of salts in concentrations at a sub-μΜ level can be
      detected in this manner. Resistance of permeate solution was
      monitored by using a Keithley source meter and platinum wires as
      electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Figure 4 shows examples of our measurements for the case of
      NaCI and potassium ferricyanide K3[Fe(CN)6] . The observed
      decreasing resistivity as a function of time indicates that NaCI
      permeates through the membrane. Similar behavior is observed for
      CuS04, KCI and other tested salts with small ions (see the main
      text). On the other hand, no noticeable changes in conductivity of
      deionized water can be detected for a potassium ferricyanide
      solution during measurements lasting for many days (Fig. 4).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3. Quantitative analysis of ion and molecular
        permeation</b><br>
      <br>
      [0089] The above electrical measurements qualitatively show that
      small ions can permeate through our GO membranes whereas large
      ions such as [Fe(CN)6]&lt;3"&gt;cannot. The technique is not
      applicable for molecular solutes because they exhibit little
      electrical conductivity. To gain quantitative information about
      the exact amount of permeating ions as well as to probe permeation
      of molecular solutes, chemical analysis of water at the permeate
      side was carried out. Samples were taken at regular intervals from
      a few hours to a few days and, in some cases, after several weeks.
      Due to different solubility of different solutes, different feed
      concentrations were used. They varied from 0.01 to 2 M, depending
      on a solute. For each salt, measurements were performed at several
      different feed concentrations to ensure that we worked in the
      linear response regime where the permeation rate was proportional
      to the feed concentration (Fig. 1C) and there was no sign of the
      concentration polarization effect. [0090] The ion chromatography
      (IC) and the inductively coupled plasma optical emission
      spectrometry (ICP-OES) are the standard techniques used to analyze
      the presence of chemical species in solutions. The IC for anionic
      species was employed, and the ICP-OES for cations. The measurement
      techniques provided us with values for ion concentrations in the
      permeate water. Using the known volume of the permeate (-0.1 L)
      the number of ions diffused into the permeate compartments were
      calculated. For certain salts (those with low solubility), the
      obtained permeate solutions were first concentrated by evaporation
      to improve the measurement accuracy. Furthermore, the results of
      the chemical analysis were crosschecked by weighing a dry material
      left after evaporation of water in the permeate compartment. This
      also allowed the calculation of the amounts of the salt permeated
      through the GO membranes. The weight and chemical analyses were
      found in good quantitative agreement.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] To detect organic solutes such as glycerol, sucrose and
      propanol, the total organic carbon (TOC) analysis was employed. No
      traces of glycerol and sucrose could be found in the permeate
      samples after several weeks, but propanol could permeate, although
      at a rate much lower than small ions as shown in Fig. 2. The
      detection limit of the TOC was about 50 μg/L, and this put an
      upper limit on permeation of the solutes that could not be
      detected. The corresponding limiting values are shown by arrows in
      Fig. 2. The above techniques were calibrated using several known
      concentrations of the studied solutes, and the detection limits
      were identified by decreasing the concentration of the standard
      solution until the measured signal became five times the baseline
      noise.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The optical absorption spectroscopy is widely used to
      detect solutes with absorption lines in the visible spectrum. This
      technique was employed for large ions such as [Fe(CN)6]&lt;3"&gt;,
      [Ru(bipy)3]&lt;2+&gt;of Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(ll) dichloride
      ([Ru(bipy)3]Cl2) and PTS&lt;4"&gt;of pyrenetetrasulfonic acid
      tetrasodium salt (Na4PTS). It was not possible to detect any
      signatures of [Fe(CN)6]&lt;3"&gt;, [Ru(bipy)3]&lt;2+&gt;and
      PTS&lt;4"&gt;on the permeate side, even after many weeks of
      running the analysis. The absorption spectra were taken with air
      as a background reference. The detection limit was estimated by
      measuring a reference solution and gradually decreasing its
      concentration by a factor of 2-3 until the optical absorption
      peaks completely disappeared. The penultimate concentration was
      chosen as the corresponding detection limits in Fig. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] An experiment was performed in which a mixture of 0.5M NaCI
      and 0.01 M tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(ll) dichloride
      ([Ru(bipy)3]Cl2) was tested. It was found that only sodium
      chloride diffused through the membrane and [Ru(bipy)3]Cl2 was
      blocked by the membrane. This indicates that the presence of small
      ions don't open up the channels enough to allow larger ions to
      permeate. However, the presence of [Ru(bipy)3]Cl2 decreases the
      NaCI permeation rate through the membrane by a factor of ten.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4. Molecular dynamics simulations</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0094] Our basic modeling setup consisted of two equal water
      reservoirs connected by a capillary formed by parallel graphene
      sheets as shown in Fig. 3A. Sizes of the reservoirs and
      capillaries varied in different modeling experiments. To analyze
      the salt-sponge effect and study ion diffusion in the confined
      geometry, we used reservoirs with a height of 51.2 A, a length of
      50 A and a depth of 49.2 A, which were connected by a 30 A long
      capillary. A slightly smaller setup was used to assess sieving
      properties of graphene capillaries. It consisted of the reservoirs
      with a height of 23.6 A, a length of 50 A and a depth of 30.1 A,
      which were connected by a 20 A long capillary. For both setups, we
      varied the capillary width d from 7 to 13 A (d is the distance
      between the centers of the graphene sheets). When the same
      property was modeled, both setups yielded similar behavior.
      Periodic boundary conditions were applied in the Z direction, that
      is, along the capillary depth. Ions or molecules were added until
      the desired molar concentrations were reached. Water was modeled
      by using the simple point charge model. Sodium and chlorine ions
      were modeled by using the parameters from E. S. David, X. D. Liem.
      J. Chem. Phys. 100, 3757 (1994) and S. Chowdhuri, A. Chandra. J.
      Chem. Phys. 115, 3732 (2001); magnesium and copper anions with the
      OPLS-AA parameters. Intermolecular interactions were described by
      the 12-6 Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential together with a Coulomb
      potential. Parameters for water/graphene interactions were
      reported in C. Ailan, W. A. Steele. J. Chem. Phys. 92, 3858 (1990)
      and T. Werder, J. H. Walther, R. L. Jaffe, T. Halicioglu, P.
      Koumoutsakos. J. Phys. Chem. B 107, 1345 (2003).<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The system was initially equilibrated at 300 K with a
      coupling time of 0.1 ps&lt;"1&gt;for 500 ps . In the modeling of
      sieving properties, our typical simulation runs were 100 ns long
      and obtained in the isobaric ensemble at the atmospheric pressure
      where the simulation box was allowed to change only in the X and Y
      direction with a pressure coupling time of 1 ps&lt;-1&gt;and a
      compressibility of 4.5* 10&lt;"5&gt;bar&lt;1&gt;. The cutoff
      distance for nonbonding interactions was set up at 10 A, and the
      particle mesh Ewald summations method was used to model the
      system's electrostatics. During simulations, all the graphene
      atoms were held in fixed positions whereas other bonds were
      treated as flexible. A time step of 1 fs was employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] To model sieving properties of graphene, the GROMACS
      software was used. At the beginning of each simulation run, water
      molecules rapidly filled the graphene capillary forming one, two
      or three layer structures, depending on d. Then after a certain
      period of time, which depended on a solute in the feed reservoir,
      ions/molecules started enter the capillary and eventually reached
      the pure water reservoir for all the modeled solutes, except for
      toluene and octanol. The found permeation rates are shown in Fig.
      3B. We have also noticed that cations and anions move through the
      capillary together and without noticeably changing their hydration
      shells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5. Theoretical analysis of permeation for large
        molecules</b><br>
      <br>
      [0097] In the case of organic molecules (for example, propanol)
      simulations showed that they entered the graphene capillary but
      then rapidly formed clusters that resided inside the capillary for
      a long time. The cluster formation is probably due to confinement.
      On the other hand, the long residence times can be attributed to
      van der Waals forces between the alcohol molecules and graphene.
      Toluene molecules exhibited even stronger interaction with
      graphene (due to π-π staking). In simulations, toluene molecules
      entered the channel but never left it being adsorbed to graphene
      walls. This adsorption is likely to be responsible for the
      experimentally undetectable level of toluene permeation.
      Therefore, despite the experimental data suggesting a rather
      simple sieving behavior that can be explained just by the physical
      size effect, we believe that van der Waals interactions between
      solutes and graphene may also play a role in limiting permeation
      for those molecules and ions that have sizes close to the cutoff
      radius.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] To better understand the observed sieving effect with its
      sharp physical cutoff, the following analysis was performed. An
      artificial cluster was modeled as a truncated icosahedron and
      placed in the middle of the capillary as shown in the inset of
      Fig. 3B. The size of the cluster was varied by changing the
      distance between the constituent 60 atoms, and the interaction
      energy between the cluster and the graphene capillary was
      calculated. The energy was computed as the sum of interactions
      between all the atoms involved which were modeled with a 12-6 LJ
      potential. Positive and negative values of the calculated energy
      indicate whether the presence of the cluster in the capillary is
      energetically favorable or not, respectively. The minimum radius
      for which the spherical cluster was allowed into the graphene
      capillary obviously depended on the capillary size. For
      capillaries that allowed two monolayers of waters (d = 9A) this
      radius was found to be 4.7 A. For wider capillaries containing
      three water monolayers (d = 13A), the radius was 5.8A. These
      values are shown in Fig. 3B as the blue bars.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 6. Forward Osmosis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0099] One of the advantages of using GO membrane for forward
      osmosis (FO) is that we can use any molecule or salt higher than
      4.7 A radius as a draw solute. This techniques was used to
      estimate the salt rejection capability of GO membranes and also to
      establish the feasibility of using GO for FO applications.<br>
      <br>
      [00100] In our FO experiment one side of a tube was filled with
      concentrated solution of large molecules such as glycerol or
      sucrose (DS) while other side was filed with dilute solution of
      NaCI. In such conditions, glycerol and sucrose being larger in
      size are completely impermeable to the membrane demonstrated an
      ideal situation of forward osmosis. Because of the differential
      osmotic pressure between glucose and NaCI water from the NaCI side
      flowed towards glucose side. The water flux rate was measured by
      measuring the increase in height of the liquid column. Some NaCI
      also diffuses with water and we estimated the amount of NaCI on
      the other side by ion chromatography. Salt rejection was
      calculated using the equation 1-Cp/Cf where Cp is the
      concentration of NaCI in transmitted water and Cf is the
      concentration of NaCI in feed side. This analysis yields 62% salt
      rejection for the GO membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [00101] The dependency of the water flux rate in these FO
      conditions with the thickness of the membrane has also been
      studied. Figure 5 shows the dependence of water flux rate on
      thickness of the membrane for a differential osmotic pressure of ~
      100 atm. Our typical micron thick membranes yield 1 L/h-m2 water
      flux. The observed water flux is comparable to the conventional FO
      membranes.<br>
      <br>
      [00102] Water flux rate through GO membrane in FO condition with
      different concentration gradients between feed and drain solution
      has also been studied. Fig. 6 shows water flux through a five
      micron thick membrane for different concentration gradients. This
      study shows that water flux rate increases initially with
      increasing concentration gradient and for very high (~ &gt; 7 M)
      concentration gradients the water flux decreases. Even at high
      concentrations, however, there is still a reasonable water flux.<br>
