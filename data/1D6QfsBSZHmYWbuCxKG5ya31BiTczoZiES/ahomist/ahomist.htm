          <b>OVERVIEW</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>A Scientific Explanation</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          "...Secondly, our steam is not generated directly from an
          external heat source; rather it is produced by hyper-sonic
          high impact molecular collisions which take place in our
          impact chambers which are located at the point of energy
          need.&nbsp; This method of producing super-heated dry steam
          eliminates both the energy needed for the boiling of the water
          and the energy lost during the transportation of the steam.<br>
          WHERE DOES THE ENERGY COME FROM?...<br>
          <br>
          "Our water jet pump was originally designed to cut aluminum or
          other metals at up to 40,000 psi. To avoid destruction of our
          Impact Chamber, we limited our operation to no more than
          30,000 psi. Next we use 4 Ford Diesel Piezo Injectors with our
          choice of Ford Atomizers, in this example they all have 6
          orifices.<br>
          <br>
          "In our display, all 4 Piezo Injectors have an identical
          cycle, each opens for 3 mil seconds 15 times a second as
          scheduled.&nbsp; This will convert 2 lbs of water a minute to
          super-heated steam as needed.<br>
          <br>
          "Our test pump uses a 10 H.P. motor, and at 30,000 psi, is
          limited to 120 lbs. of water an hour, using 7.5 KW hr.&nbsp;
          In south Florida this costs $0.82 an hour which gives us a
          cost of super-heated steam at $0.00683 per pound of water.<br>
          <br>
          "Each injection in this test is 0.285 ml x 4 injectors x 15
          times per second, resulting in a total of 60 injections per
          second which is 3600 injections per minute creating 2 lbs of
          super-heated steam.<br>
          <br>
          "The simple physics behind our new Technology is that we
          convert liquid water into super-heated steam mechanically. WE
          DON’T BOIL THE WATER.<br>
          <br>
          "Using U.S. Government charts that measure the Specific
          Kinetic energy (J/kg):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have performed
          hundreds of tests with many different size atomizers and as
          many different velocities. We quickly learned it was a waste
          of time using lower pressure injections (under 10,000 psi). At
          first, using lower pressure injections, at 7,000 psi we
          measured 810 meters/second velocity, and our impact had only
          320,000 J/kg, and our molecules just bounced about with no
          intermolecular separation upon Impact.<br>
          <br>
          "Next using another atomizer and double the pressure (15,000
          psi) we reached a super-sonic speed of 1,700 meters per
          second. You will note that our mechanical advantage DID NOT
          DOUBLE to 640,000J/kg.&nbsp; Instead, it increased 4 fold, to
          1,400,000 J/kg.<br>
          <br>
          "This mechanical advantage comes from the fact that the energy
          needed to increase the velocity is linear and to double the
          velocity you double the energy. However, the specific kinetic
          energy derived from the Impact of the water clusters is
          increased exponentially. One needs only to look at the
          projectile speed charts to understand the effect of speed upon
          the specific energy upon impact.<br>
          <br>
          "With 30,000 psi our velocity exceeds 3,000 meters per second,
          or 3.7 times our original test at 810 meters/second. The
          Impact heat at 810 meters/second is 320,000 J/Kg. The result
          at 3,000 meters/second is 4,500,000 (J/kg).&nbsp; The
          Mechanical Advantage is simple math.&nbsp;&nbsp; You would
          expect the result to be 3.7 times or 1,185,185 (J/kg) if the
          increase was linear.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, exponentially, our
          Impact heat increased 14 times. 320,000 x 14 =
          4,480,000&nbsp;&nbsp; Speed to impact energy ratios are
          available in most physics books.<br>
          <br>
          "In conclusion, at an incredibly low cost of $0.00683 for
          converting each pound of water into steam, our MIST system is
          far less expensive that natural gas or nuclear power, and is
          the least expensive and environmental friendly energy creating
          system in history.<br>
          <br>
          "The energy we must apply in order for our 10 HP pump to
          produce the required pressure to process 120 lbs. of water per
          hour is&nbsp; 7.46 Kw which is 124.3 watts per minute to pump
          2 lbs. 0f water at 30,000 psi and a velocity of 3,000
          m/s.&nbsp; This gives us and output of 1139 watts using only
          124.3 watts of energy.&nbsp; The rest of the energy comes from
          the energy contained within the bonding of the molecules of
          water..."<br>

            Richard Aho says:<br>
            <br>
            "I agree, but nobody cares. It is well known from tests
            around the planet, that you have two ways to liberate the
            hydrogen bond energy, discharged in the form of water
            kinetic energy. After the discovery of hydrogen bond energy
            liberation in water turbines in 1923 by American chemist
            Gilbert Lewis, the chemistry establishment simply failed to
            explore the effects it has on chemistry experiments.<br>
            <br>
            " The Anomalous Fragmentation of Water Clusters at UltraFast
            Impacts" This paper shows that at very high velocity impacts
            the cluster will fragment completely into neutral molecules
            and one hydronium ion. This happens at 1,500 ms. Quite easy
            to do using modfified Ford diesel Injectors. However nobody
            believes this liberated engery is related to the latent heat
            of water. Nobody understands how I can mechanically change
            liquid water into super-heated steam by impact heating. With
            out boiling the water, upon contact we experience a water
            arc explosion, termed the cluster electric effect (CEE)
            during the short time of surface contact which is on the
            order of a few picoseconds.<br>
            <br>
            "History of Water Arc Explosions.&nbsp; First noticed at
            Harvard in 1907 by Trowbridge, second World War Frungel
            (1948) published his results, freely admited that he was
            unable to explain the phenomenon. In 1969 US Bureau of mines
            noticed the output energy was 156% of the input. But was
            treated as an error. In the mid-1980's at MIT It was shown
            the discharge of 3.6 KJ of stored capacitor energy would
            create pressures in excess of 20,000 atm ( 286,000 psi) in
            7ml of water.<br>
            <br>
            "Water Arc Explosions have been harnessed for energy, by
            Mist ( Molecular Impact Energy) But this is not acceptable
            because it violates energy conversation, the American
            chemistry establishment refuses to accept, that Impact
            heating at 1.7 Km second can discharge energy from hydrogen
            bonds.<br>
            <br>
            "We are running a 113 cubic engine by liberating the energy
            in water arc explosions, other tests we generate
            super-heated steam using about 500 btu a lb, but nobody
            accepts our results, because using current education we
            violate energy conversation. Nobody cares enough, to see if
            an unknown energy source comes into play.<br>

          <b> </b><br>
          Apparatus for generating steam, the apparatus including a
          source of liquid water, an injector in flow communication with
          the source of water for injecting liquid water from the source

          water undergoes a virtually instantaneous phase transition

          of the water with the contact surface, thereby generating
          steam.<br>
          <br>
          <b>FIELD</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0001] The present disclosure relates to steam generation.
          More particularly, the disclosure relates to methods and
          apparatus for generating steam by injecting small amounts of
          water at high speed into an impact chamber.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0002] Conventional attempts to heat water to provide steam
          require substantial heat and energy requirements, especially
          for the production of superheated steam. For example,
          superheated steam boilers typically further heat steam that
          has already been vaporized from water. High temperature steam
          is essential for use in modern power generation and other
          steam driven applications. The process of heating steam in
          superheat boilers is an energy intensive thermodynamic process
          heavily dependent on fossil fuel. Given the background
          scenario of diminishing energy supplies and environmental air
          quality considerations, more energy efficient steam generation
          processes are desired.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] In accordance with the present disclosure, steam,
          including superheated steam, may be produced in a process by
          which liquid water is substantially instantaneously converted
          to a gas state using apparatus configured to transform
          multiple, sequential injections of water into gas. It has been
          discovered that steam and superheated steam can be generated
          using the apparatus, with much lower heat and energy
          requirements as compared to conventional methods and
          apparatus.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0004] The above and other needs are met by an apparatus for
          generating steam. In one aspect, the apparatus includes a
          source of liquid water, an injector in flow communication with
          the source of water for injecting liquid water from the source
          of water at a pressure of at least about 10,000 psia, and an
          impact chamber having a contact surface onto which the
          injected water is contacted.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] Upon impact of the injected water with the contact
          surface of the impact chamber, the injected water undergoes a
          virtually instantaneous phase transition from the liquid state
          to a gaseous state following the contact of the water with the
          contact surface, thereby generating steam. In an alternative
          embodiment, superheated steam is produced.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] In yet another aspect of the disclosure, there is
          provide a method for generating steam. The method includes the
          steps of providing a source of liquid water; providing an
          injector in flow communication with the source of water;
          providing an impact chamber having a contact surface; and
          using the injector to inject liquid water from the source of
          water at a pressure of at least about 10,000 psia into the
          impact chamber for contact with the contact surface.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] Upon impact of the injected water with the contact
          surface of the impact chamber, the injected water undergoes a
          virtually instantaneous phase transition from the liquid state
          to a gaseous state following the contact of the water with the
          contact surface, thereby generating steam.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>

          <b> </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0012] With initial reference to FIG. 1, the disclosure
          relates in one aspect to a steam generation apparatus 10
          configured to act upon introduced water so that the water
          undergoes a virtually instantaneous phase transition from the
          liquid state to the gaseous state following the collision of
          an atomized water jet with a hard surface, thereby generating
          steam. The gas is thereafter expanded and maintained at a
          temperature of at least about 299[deg.] F., and may be routed
          thereafter for use. For example, the steam may be used for
          cleaning purposes, to run a turbine for generating
          electricity, and for various uses for which steam is typically
          used.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] It has been discovered that the apparatus is able to
          generate steam, as well as superheated steam, using
          substantially less energy than is conventionally required to
          generate steam and superheated steam.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] The apparatus 10 includes, as major components, an
          injector 12 having an atomizer 14, an impact chamber 16, and
          an expansion chamber 18.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] The injector 12 is configured to introduce discrete
          pulses of water, each pulse having a volume of from about 0.1
          to about 0.5 ml, at a pressure of from about 10,000 psia to
          about 29,000 psia, to inject the water at a speed in the
          hypersonic speed range, of between about 1,710 m/s and 3,415
          m/s. The injector 12 is computer controlled to continuously
          inject the discrete injections of water to continuously
          generate steam.<br>
          <br>
          [0016] The water is introduced via a supply line 20 and the
          water can be at any temperature that the water is in the
          liquid state at the introduced pressure. For example, the
          injector 12 may be a hydraulic pressure fuel injector, having
          a pump 22 for pressuring oil within a conduit 24. The atomizer
          14 is configured to provide the desired volume pulses of water
          at the desired pressure, to yield the desired velocity. The
          atomizer 14 may have multiple orifices, with the diameter of
          each orifice ranging from about 0.005 inches to about 0.010
          inches. For example, the atomizer 14 may have seven orifices,
          with each orifice having a diameter of 0.007 inches. By
          injecting the desired volume of water at a desired hypersonic
          speed, it has been discovered that steam and superheated steam
          may be generated with low energy input. In this regard, higher
          injection velocities result in higher temperatures within the
          impact chamber 16.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] The impact chamber 16 is located to receive water
          ejected from the injector 12 via the atomizer 14 and is
          configured to expand in dimension away from the atomizer 14,
          and is preferably configured as an inverted funnel. The impact
          chamber 16 preferably has a volume of from about 2 ml to about
          10 ml. The chamber 16 includes an impact surface 26 onto which
          the atomized water jet from the atomizer 14 collides. It has
          been discovered that by injecting pulses of water as
          described, the water undergoes a virtually instantaneous phase
          transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state
          following the collision of the atomized water jet with the
          surface 26. The impact chamber 16 is made of stainless steel,
          with the impact surface 26 preferably being polished. The
          perimeter of the impact surface 26 is advantageously
          insulated. However, it has been observed that it is not
          necessary to provide auxiliary heating to the impact chamber
          16, as the continuous generation of steam results in
          maintenance of the impact chamber 16 at high temperatures
          associated with steam.<br>
          <br>
          [0018] The expansion chamber 18 is positioned to receive the
          steam generated within the impact chamber 16, and to route it
          for subsequent use. The steam is routed to the expansion
          chamber 18 as by one or more conduits or ports 28 that extend
          between the impact chamber 16 and the expansion chamber 18.
          The expansion chamber 18 includes one or more heaters 30, such
          as electric heaters, to maintain the expansion chamber 18 at a
          temperature of from about 299[deg.] F. to about 1200[deg.] F.
          so as to maintain the steam therein at the desired state, with
          the expansion chamber 18 also preferably being insulated to
          reduce heat losses. The steam may be routed from the expansion
          chamber 18 for use as by use of a conduit 32. The expansion
          chamber 18 has a volume larger than the impact chamber 16,
          preferably from about 20 to about 40 ml.<br>
          <br>
          [0019] In this regard, it has been observed that the
          temperature generated from impacting water in the impact
          chamber 16 as described yields a temperature within the impact
          chamber 16 of at least about 800[deg.] F., such that
          superheated steam is generated. In this regards, temperatures
          of about 2,000[deg.] F. have been observed in the impact
          chamber 16. However, if non-superheated steam is the desired
          end product to be provided from the expansion chamber 18, then
          it is only necessary to maintain the expansion chamber 18 at a
          temperature of about 299[deg.] F. However, if superheated
          steam is desired to be obtained from the expansion chamber 18,
          then the expansion chamber 18 should be maintained at higher
          temperatures, such as above about 800[deg.] F.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] In accordance with another embodiment, and with
          reference to FIG. 2, there is shown an apparatus 40 for
          generating superheated steam. The apparatus 40 has multiple
          injectors 42, each of the injectors 42 having an associated
          atomizer 44, an impact chamber 46, and an expansion chamber
          48. The injectors 42 are preferably piezoelectric injectors.
          The atomizers 44, impact chambers 46, and the expansion
          chambers 48 preferably substantially correspond to the
          previously described atomizer 14, impact chamber 46, and
          expansion chamber 18. Water is introduced to the injectors 42
          as by a supply conduit 50. A stabilizer mount 52 may be
          provided to position the injectors 42. Also, as piezoelectric
          injectors may be disadvantageously affected by the heat of the
          superheated steam generated by the apparatus 40, the atomizers
          44 and the associated impact chambers 46 are preferably spaced
          from the injectors 42 as by conduits 54. The steam is routed
          to the expansion chambers 48 as by conduits or ports 58 that
          extend between the impact chambers 46 and the expansion
          chambers 48. The expansion chambers 48 include heaters 60,
          such as electric heaters, to maintain the expansion chambers
          48 at a temperature of about 299[deg.] F. to about 1200[deg.]
          F. so as to maintain the steam therein at the desired state.
          The expansion chambers 48 may be interconnected as by conduits
          62, it being understood that one or more flow paths, such as
          conduit 64, may be provided to route the steam from the
          expansion chambers 48 for use.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] With reference to FIG. 3, there is shown a graph of
          pressure as a function of time for a test operation of the
          apparatus of FIG. 1 to generate steam. The atomizer 14 had
          seven orifices, with each orifice having a diameter of 0.007
          inches. The injector 12 was operated to supply 10 pulses of
          0.3 ml of water each, one after the other into the impact
          chamber 16, at a pressure of 15,000 psia. Each pulse required
          8 milliseconds. The expansion chamber 18 was equipped with a
          strain gauge operational to 425[deg.] F., with 1 my on the
          gauge equal to 4 psia of pressure.<br>
          <br>
          [0022] In conducting the test operation, the water introduced
          into the injector 12 was maintained at a temperature of from
          about 190[deg.] F. to about 210[deg.] F. However, it has been
          subsequently discovered that the water does not need to be
          heated and may be provided at lower temperatures. In addition,
          in conducting the test operation, the impact chamber 16 was
          initially heated to a temperature of 405[deg.] F., however, it
          has been subsequently discovered that it is not necessary to
          supply any initial heating to the impact chamber 16, but that
          it is advantageous to provide heating to the expansion chamber
          18 to maintain the steam routed thereto at the desired state.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] With reference to the graph of FIG. 3, it will be seen
          that after the injections the strain gauge had a reading of
          225 millivolts, which corresponds to approximately 900 psia,
          it being understood that water in an environment of 900 psia
          corresponds to steam at a temperature of 531.98[deg.] F.
          Accordingly, it has been discovered that steam can be very
          quickly produced. Furthermore, such steam may be maintained at
          the desired temperature, provided it is contained in an
          adiabatic vessel.<br>
