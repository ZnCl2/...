      The thermostat was first used by Cadillac in 1914. The technology
      has essentially gone unchanged for almost 100 years (shown on
      left).<br>
      <br>
      Our Digital Rotary Control Valve (DRCV on right) and Digital
      Engine Thermal Management (DETM) replace the old style of
      thermostat.<br>
      <br>
      With our system, engine temperatures are maintained at optimal
      levels and engine performance is significantly improved. <br>
      <br>
      MileageMatrix has developed and engineered a technology which
      utilizes wasted heat in a process which pre-treats the fuel (for
      both gasoline and diesel engines) prior to ignition.<br>
      <br>
      The product, Phas5Fuel, is available for any internal combustion
      engine, OEM and after-market.<br>
      <br>
      The results produce greater fuel efficiency and lowered emissions.<br>

            bold;">New Digital Rotary Control Valve to Boost Fuel
            Economy, Reduce Emissions</span><br style="font-weight:
            bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Traditional “analog” thermostat temperature-control systems for
      vehicles will soon be a technology of the past if inventor Tom
      Hollis has his way. Switching to digital can manage critical fluid
      systems in a way that significantly improves fuel economy, reduces
      emissions and engine, driveline wear to help extend the life of
      fluids critical in the operation of engine components.<br>
      <br>
      “When you think of the sophisticated systems in a vehicle today,
      it comes as a surprise that we still use analog systems to control
      the interaction of the engine with the radiator system,” said
      Hollis, director of Advanced Research -- MileageMatrix, Inc.
      “After all, those fluids protect the vehicle’s most important
      operating systems – the engine and driveline – and running them
      too high or too low simply wastes energy.”<br>
      <br>
      The Digital Rotary Control Valve (DRCV) will provide a “true”
      powertrain thermal management system that, after mapping, will
      always allow the engine/transmission to function at their "known"
      optimum operating temperatures, under all driving conditions. The
      computer-regulated system monitors temperatures at several
      under-hood locations and controls the single DRCV to maintain
      optimum engine and transmission temperatures, throughout all
      engine load conditions and extreme ambient temperature ranges. It
      is nominated for an International Plastics Design Competition
      People's Choice Award, which will be announced at the NPE in
      Chicago later this month.<br>
      <br>
      Developed by Hollis and manufactured by the Minco Group, which
      includes All Service Plastic Molding, for MileageMatrix Inc., the
      component relies on DuPont™ Zytel® HTN PPA resins for the valve
      body, tube and diverter. The materials’ resistance to continuous
      exposure to hot long-life coolant up to 130°C, and retention of
      properties with moisture proved optimal for this application.<br>
      <br>
      “We had to be very sensitive to expansion and contraction because
      all surfaces are always ‘wet’ and we needed a ‘fluid bearing’ to
      prevent sticking,” said Hollis. “Zytel® HTN PPA performed well in
      these conditions, allowing us to take advantage of the lightweight
      nature of plastics and overall cost advantage over metals.”<br>
      <br>
      Critical to the components’ success is its ability to provide
      precision temperature function between engine/transmission and
      radiator. “Every BTU that exits through the radiator, provides
      ZERO heat energy value,” said Hollis.<br>
      <br>
      Results from an initial, three-year test program shows <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">fuel economy can improve 8 percent</span>
      during the winter, and Hollis said they expect <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">year-round fuel economy improvements
        greater than 5 percent</span>. The component is currently being
      tested to rigorous OEM specifications.<br>
      <br>
      “The key to improving fuel economy and reducing emissions is
      getting the engine/transmission fluid temperatures up to optimum
      operating temperatures fast and maintaining known optimum
      temperatures,” said Hollis. “Current analog thermostat systems
      serve the industry well, but this type of digital system can not
      only meet current cold-start test standards, mostly conducted at
      23°C, but they can also optimize performance at a very wide range
      of ambient temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Current analog thermostat systems are optimized to meet mandated
      U.S. EPA cold-start test procedures, which are conducted at a
      warm. But not many of us reside year around in this optimum
      environment.”<br>
      <br>
      Hollis also noted that engine oil temperature is always maintained
      well above the “dew” point, greatly extending the oil-change
      interval as moisture quickly evaporates. This could result in <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">reduced oil use and fewer used oil
        filters</span> for disposal.<br>
      <br>
      Digital technology for this component was developed several years
      ago, but the benefits – improved fuel economy and <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">reduced C02 emissions</span> – were
      not as valued as they are in today’s market. “We used the time to
      optimize the performance and ensure this technology is adaptable
      to all IC engines and is ideal for hybrid engines, which function
      better within specific, optimized temperature ranges,” said
      Hollis. “In short, this technology’s time has arrived.”<br>

        Inventor:&nbsp; HOLLIS THOMAS J <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A valve
        includes a body having an interior and defining at least one
        inlet passageway and discharge passageway. The valve also
        includes a flow diverter disposed within the body between the
        inlet and discharge passageways to receive a fluid from the
        inlet passageway in an inlet direction. The diverter is adapted
        to discharge the fluid to at least one discharge passageway in a
        direction that differs from the inlet direction. The diverter is
        rotatable to vary the discharge direction. According to one
        embodiment, the discharge direction is substantially
        perpendicular to the inlet direction.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span> <br>
        <br>
        [0001] The present invention relates generally to valves and,
        more particularly to a valve having a rotatable flow diverter
        for directing flow of a fluid through the valve. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </span><br>
        <br>
        [0002] Conventional engine coolant systems for automobile
        engines incorporate thermostats having expansion elements for
        controlling flow of an engine coolant to a radiator of the
        coolant system. The thermostat expansion element is adapted to
        shift from a closed condition to an opened condition when the
        coolant temperature reaches an operating temperature range for
        controlling flow of the coolant between a bypass line and the
        radiator. In the closed condition, the thermostat is adapted to
        direct all of the coolant to the bypass line. This enables the
        coolant to warm up more quickly. When the coolant has been
        warmed to the temperature range, the thermostat opens allowing
        coolant to be directed to the radiator via the radiator line. <br>
        <br>
        [0003] Engine coolant systems also include electronically
        controlled valves for directing coolant between an inlet to the
        valve and two or more outlets from the valve. For example, one
        known valve directs flow from an inlet line to one or more of
        three outlets respectively connected to a radiator line, a
        bypass line and a heating line. The valve directs the flow of
        the engine coolant to the outlets depending on a rotational
        position of a disc-like blocking element located within the
        interior of a valve body. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </span><br>
        <br>
        [0004] According to one aspect of the present invention, a valve
        comprises a body having an interior defining an inlet passageway
        and at least two discharge passageways. The valve also comprises
        a flow diverter having an interior and disposed within the
        interior of the body between the inlet passageway and the
        discharge passageways. The flow diverter is adapted to receive a
        flow of a fluid within the interior of the flow diverter from
        the inlet passageway in an inlet direction. The flow diverter is
        adapted to discharge at least a portion of the flow into one of
        the discharge passageways from the interior of the flow diverter
        in a discharge direction that is different from the inlet
        direction. The flow diverter is rotatable with respect to the
        body about a central axis of the flow diverter to vary the
        discharge direction for the at least a portion of the flow of
        the fluid. The valve also comprises a motor coupled to the flow
        diverter for drivingly rotating the flow diverter with respect
        to the body. <br>
        <br>
        [0005] According to one embodiment of the invention, the body
        includes a main junction having a substantially cylindrical wall
        defining an interior located between the inlet passageway and
        the discharge passageways. The flow diverter includes a
        substantially cylindrical wall rotatably received within the
        interior of the main junction of the body. The body of the valve
        includes a flange located at an end of the main junction and a
        closure plate received by a recessed shoulder defined by the
        flange to enclose the flow diverter within the interior of the
        main junction of the body. <br>
        <br>
        [0006] According to one embodiment, the valve includes a first
        discharge passageway and a second discharge passageway and the
        flow diverter is rotatable between first and second flow
        positions. The passageways and the flow diverter are arranged
        such that the flow diverter directs substantially all of the
        fluid from the interior of the flow diverter into the first
        passageway when the flow diverter is in the first flow position
        and directs substantially all of the fluid from the interior of
        the flow diverter into the second passageway when the flow
        diverter is in the second flow position. The flow diverter
        includes a substantially cylindrical wall and defines a
        discharge opening extending around approximately one-half of a
        circumference of the cylindrical wall. The flow diverter is
        rotatable through an angle of approximately 150 degrees between
        the first and second flow positions. <br>
        <br>
        [0007] According to another aspect of the invention, a valve
        comprises a body having an interior defining an inlet passageway
        and at least two discharge passageways. The valve also comprises
        a flow diverter defining an interior and disposed within the
        interior of the body between the inlet passageway and the
        discharge passageways. The flow diverter is adapted to receive a
        flow of a fluid within the interior of the flow diverter from
        the inlet passageway in an inlet direction. The flow diverter is
        adapted to discharge at least a portion of the flow of the fluid
        into one of the discharge passageways from the interior of the
        flow diverter in a discharge direction that is substantially
        perpendicular to the inlet direction. The flow diverter is
        rotatable with respect to the body about an axis of rotation of
        the flow diverter to vary the discharge direction for the at
        least a portion of the flow of the fluid. <br>
        <br>
        [0008] According to another aspect of the invention, a valve
        comprises a body defining an interior having at least one inlet
        passageway and at least discharge passageway and a
        flow-controlling diverter disposed within the interior of the
        body between the at least one inlet passageway and the at least
        one discharge passageway. The diverter is adapted to receive a
        flow of fluid within the interior of the diverter from at least
        one of the inlet passageways in an inlet direction. The diverter
        is adapted to discharge the fluid from the interior of the
        diverter to at least one of the discharge passages in a
        discharge direction substantially perpendicular to the inlet
        direction. <br>

        <br>
        [0028] Referring to the drawings, where like numerals identify
        like elements, there is illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 a valve 10
        according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The valve
        10 includes a body 12 defining an interior for receiving a
        fluid, such as a coolant for an engine of an automobile for
        example. The body 12 includes an inlet 14 defining an inlet
        passageway and first and second outlets 16, 18 defining outlet
        passageways. The body 12 also includes a main junction 20 to
        which each of the inlet 14 and the first and second outlets 16,
        18 is connected such that an interior defined by the main
        junction 20 communicates in common fashion with each interiors
        of each of the inlet 14 and the outlets 16, 18. As shown, the
        inlet 14 and the outlets 16, 18 of the depicted valve body 12
        are tubular in form defining substantially cylindrical
        interiors. The interior of the main junction 20 is also
        substantially cylindrical. <br>
        <br>
        [0029] The valve 10 includes a flow diverter 22 located within
        the interior of the main junction 20 of the body 12 between the
        inlet 14 and the outlets 16, 18. The flow diverter 22 includes a
        tubular side wall 24 defining an interior. The outer surface of
        the side wall 24 of flow diverter 22 is substantially
        cylindrical to provide for sliding receipt of the flow diverter
        22 within the interior of the main junction 20 of valve body 12.
        The sliding receipt of the flow diverter 22 in this manner
        provides for rotation of the flow diverter 22 with respect to
        the valve body 12 about a central axis of the flow diverter 22.
        <br>
        <br>
        [0030] The valve 10 includes a motor 26 having an output shaft
        28 engaging the flow diverter 22 for drivingly rotating the flow
        diverter 22 with respect to the valve body 12. In the
        illustrated embodiment, the flow diverter 22 includes an end
        wall 30 connected to the side wall 24 of the flow diverter 22 at
        one end of the side wall 24. The flow diverter 22 also includes
        a socket 32 on the end wall 30 extending from a surface of the
        end wall 30 opposite the interior of the flow diverter 22. As
        shown in FIG. 1, the socket 32 is adapted to receive an end
        portion of the motor output shaft 28. To facilitate engagement,
        and transfer of torque, between the motor 26 and the flow
        diverter 22, the socket 32 and the end portion of the output
        shaft 28 can include flattened surfaces (e.g., a hex-head,
        non-circular, triangular or flat configurations). <br>
        <br>
        [0031] Referring to FIG. 2, the first and second outlets 16, 18
        are spaced apart from each other on the main junction 20 such
        that an angle, .theta..sub.A, defined between central axes of
        the outlets 16, 18 is equal to approximately 150 degrees. The
        inlet 14 of the illustrated valve 10 is spaced between the
        outlets 16, 18 on the main junction 20 such that angles,
        .theta..sub.B and .theta..sub.C, defined between the inlet 14
        and the first and second outlets 16, 18, respectively, are each
        equal to approximately 105 degrees. An opening 34 is defined in
        the side wall 24 of the flow diverter 22 extending around
        approximately one-half (i.e., 180 degrees) of the circumference
        of the tubular side wall 24. The opening 34 is located along the
        length of the side wall 24 of the flow diverter 22 to position
        the opening 34 adjacent the location of the inlet 14 and the
        outlets 16, 18 on the main junction 20. <br>
        <br>
        [0032] Arranged in this manner, the opening 34 in the flow
        diverter 22 is adapted to provide communication between the
        inlet 14 and either one of the first and second outlets 16, 18
        as follows. The flow diverter 22 is shown in FIG. 2 in a first
        flow position. In the first flow position, the flow diverter 22
        is oriented rotationally with respect to the valve body 12 such
        that the opening 34 provides communication between the first
        outlet 16 and the interior of the flow diverter 22. As shown,
        the opening 34 in the first flow position also provides
        communication between the inlet 14 and the interior of the flow
        diverter 22. As a result, a flow of a fluid directed into the
        interior of valve body 12 will be directed in the first flow
        position into the first outlet 16 via the interior of the flow
        diverter 22 as illustrated by the flow arrow in FIG. 2. As
        shown, the tubular side wall 24 of flow diverter 22 functions to
        close the second outlet 18 from the interior of the main
        junction 20 in the first flow position, thereby preventing fluid
        from being directed into the second outlet 18. Those skilled in
        the art will readily understand that a counter-clockwise
        rotation of the flow diverter 22 (from the point of view shown
        in FIG. 2) by an angle equal to approximately .theta..sub.A
        (e.g., approximately 150 degrees) will position the flow
        diverter 22 in a second flow position in which the fluid is
        directed from the inlet 14 into the second outlet 18. In a
        similar manner as the second outlet 18 in the first flow
        position, the flow diverter 22 will function to close the first
        outlet 16 from the interior of the main junction 20 in the
        second flow position such that flow of the fluid into the first
        outlet 16 is prevented. <br>
        <br>
        [0033] The motor 26 is preferably adapted to provide two-way
        travel of the flow diverter 22 between the first and second flow
        positions. According to a presently preferred embodiment, the
        motor 26 is a stepper motor and the valve 10 includes travel
        stops (not shown) for limiting the rotational travel of the flow
        diverter 22 between the first and second flow positions. Such a
        construction provides for the use of a simple torque-limited
        stepper motor for driving the flow diverter 22. The valve of the
        present invention is not limited to stepper motor and could
        include other types of motive force (e.g., DC motor, solenoid,
        hydraulic, or mechanical force) for driving the flow diverter.
        The use of a DC motor or a hydraulic or mechanical force for
        driving the flow diverter would be desirable for higher capacity
        valves (e.g., valves having capacity greater than approximately
        200 gallons per minute). <br>
        <br>
        [0034] The valve 10 includes a mounting plate 36 at one end of
        the main junction 20 of the valve body 12. The mounting plate 36
        is adapted to receive fasteners 38 for securing the valve body
        12 to a housing of the motor 26. The valve 10 also includes an
        annular flange 40 located at an end of the main junction 20 of
        valve body 12 opposite the mounting plate 36. As shown in FIG.
        1, the flange 40 defines a recessed shoulder on an inner surface
        for receiving a closure plate 42 to enclose the flow diverter 22
        within the interior of the main junction 20. The flange 40 and
        the closure plate 42 facilitate placement of the flow diverter
        22 into the interior of the valve body 12 during assembly of the
        valve 10. <br>
        <br>
        [0035] For smaller capacity valves (e.g., capacity less than
        approximately 150 gals/minute), all components of the flow
        diverter and valve body can molded from a thermoplastic material
        (e.g., glass-filled nylon). This includes valves on most
        passenger cars having operating temperatures ranging between
        approximately 40 degrees Centigrade and approximately 130
        degrees Centigrade. For valves used in HD diesel engines and for
        larger capacity valves, the flow diverter and valve body would
        both preferably be made from a metal (e.g., aluminum). The use
        of similar materials (e.g., all plastic or all metal) for the
        flow diverter and the valve body, desirably provides more
        uniform thermal expansion to help prevent sticking between the
        flow diverter and the valve body. The aluminum of the flow
        diverter 22 can be coated with a polytetrafluoroethylene
        material (e.g., Teflon.RTM.) to facilitate relative rotation
        between the flow diverter 22 and the valve body 12. The
        inclusion of a coating of polytetrafluorethylene on the diverter
        22 would also help prevent sludge build-up on the diverter 22.
        For valves having a valve body made from a thermoplastic
        material, the closure plate 42 of valve body 12 is preferably
        secured to the flange 40 using a thermoplastic welding process
        (e.g., spin welding). It should be understood, however, that the
        present invention is not limited to any particular material such
        as aluminum or thermoplastics and that other materials (e.g.,
        magnesium) could be used. Also, although preferred, it is not
        required that a similar material be used to form both the flow
        diverter and the valve body. It is conceived that the use of
        mixed materials could have application in special circumstances.
        <br>
        <br>
        [0036] As shown in FIG. 1, the main junction 20 of valve body 12
        and the flow diverter 22 are preferably dimensioned such that a
        controlled gap 44 is defined between the closure plate 42 and an
        end of the flow diverter 22. <br>
        <br>
        [0037] The flow diverter 22 of valve 10 includes apertures 45
        defined in the end wall 30 of the flow diverter 22. The
        apertures 45 in end wall 30 allow some of the fluid directed
        into the interior of the flow diverter 22 to pass through the
        end wall 30 into a space provided between the end wall 30 and
        the mounting plate 36. The receipt of fluid via apertures 45
        serves to prevent a pressure imbalance that could otherwise
        develop on opposite sides of the end wall 30. <br>
        <br>
        [0038] Although the flow diverter 22 has been described above as
        directing flow to either the first outlet 16 or the second
        outlet 18, it should be understood that the flow diverter 22
        could be adapted to provide a position in which a flow of a
        fluid is split between the first and second outlets 16, 18. <br>
        <br>
        [0039] In the above-described valve 10 the flow of fluid is
        directed into the interior of the flow diverter 22, and
        discharged from the interior of the flow diverter 22, through
        the opening 34 in the side wall 24. Thus, the fluid is directed
        in lateral directions (i.e., perpendicular to the central axis
        of the flow diverter 22) for both inlet and discharge. Referring
        to FIGS. 3 through 5, there is illustrated a valve 46 according
        to a second exemplary embodiment of the invention having a flow
        diverter 48 in which the fluid is turned 90 degrees, either
        axially to laterally with respect to the flow diverter 48, or
        alternatively laterally to axially, between the inlet and
        discharge of fluid. <br>
        <br>
        [0040] The valve 46 includes a body 50 defining an interior and
        including an inlet 52 and first and second outlets 54, 56 that,
        similar to the inlets and outlets of valve 10 are substantially
        cylindrical. The valve body 50 also includes a substantially
        cylindrical main junction 58 located between the inlet 52 and
        the outlets 54, 56. The outlets 54, 56 extend laterally from the
        main junction 58 and are located on opposite sides of the main
        junction 58 of the illustrated valve 46. The inlet 52 is located
        at an end of the main junction 58 and is oriented such that a
        central axis of the inlet 52 is substantially parallel to, and
        aligned with, a central axis of the main junction 58. Although
        the valve 46 is shown and described as including inlet 46 and
        outlets 54, 56, the present invention is not so limited. It
        should be understood that the direction of flow could be
        reversed such that flow enters the valve 46 from a pair of
        "inlets" (e.g., elements 54, 56) for discharge via a single
        "outlet" (e.g., element 46). <br>
        <br>
        [0041] The flow diverter 48, similar to the flow diverter 22 of
        valve 10, includes a tubular side wall 60 defining an interior
        and having an outer surface slidingly received by the main
        junction 58 for relative rotation between the flow diverter 48
        and the valve body 50. Also similar to flow diverter 22 of valve
        10, the flow diverter 48 includes an end wall 62 and a socket 64
        engagingly receiving an output shaft 68 of a motor 66 for driven
        rotation of the flow diverter 48 by the motor 66. The socket 64
        on flow diverter 48 extends inwardly with respect to the flow
        diverter 48, in contrast to the socket 32 of flow diverter 22
        which extends in an outward direction from the end wall 30 of
        flow diverter 22. The valve 46 includes a mounting plate 70 at
        an end of the main junction 58 of valve body 50 receiving
        fasteners 72 to secure the valve body 50 to the motor 66. The
        valve 46 includes a bushing 74 received in an opening defined in
        the mounting plate 70 for rotatably supporting the output shaft
        68 of motor 66. Also, in some applications a simple radial
        O-ring shaft seal (not shown) can be utilized. According to a
        presently preferred embodiment, the motor 66 is a stepper motor.
        As shown, the motor 66 can include dual motor leads 75 to
        provide protection against failure of the motor in the event
        that one of the leads becomes inoperative. Preferably,
        separation is provided between the leads 75 to limit the risk
        that an event causing severance of one of the motor leads 75
        result in severance of both motor leads 75. It is also
        contemplated that in the event of a relatively high motor torque
        (e.g., a torque above a design range for motor 66) the valve 46
        could be adapted to send an alert signal for service identifying
        a failure mode. <br>
        <br>
        [0042] Similar to valve 10, the valve 46 includes a flange 76
        located at an end of the main junction 58 opposite the mounting
        plate 70 and defining a recessed shoulder on an inner surface of
        the flange 76. The flange 76 on the main junction 58 is adapted
        to receive a flange 78 located at an end of the inlet 52 for
        connecting the inlet 52 to the main junction 58. The inlet 52 is
        preferably secured to the main junction 58 by welding the
        flanges 76, 78 to each other. According to one preferred
        embodiment, the valve body 50 is made from a thermoplastic
        material (e.g., glass-filled nylon) and the inlet 52 is secured
        to the main junction 58 using a thermoplastic welding process
        (e.g., spin welding). <br>
        <br>
        [0043] The connection of the inlet 52 at the end of the main
        junction 58 in the above-described manner results in fluid being
        directed into the interior of the flow diverter 48 in an axial
        direction with respect to the flow diverter 48 through an open
        end 80 of the flow diverter 48. As shown in FIG. 3, at least one
        opening 82 is defined in the side wall 60 of the flow diverter
        48 for discharging fluid to one of the outlets 54, 56 depending
        on the angular orientation of the flow diverter 48 with respect
        to the valve body 50. Preferably, the flow diverter 48 includes
        an opening on each of opposite sides of the side wall 60. As
        described below in greater detail, the use of a pair of openings
        in this manner limits the amount of rotation necessary to move
        the flow diverter 48 between first and second flow positions for
        respectively directing the flow to the first and second outlets
        54, 56 of valve 46. As shown in the drawings and described below
        in greater detail in the description of FIGS. 6 and 7, the
        openings 82 are not circular in shape. Instead, the
        configuration of the openings 82 has been empirically developed
        to provide desired flow characteristics (e.g., to transition
        flow during initial opening of the valve to prevent "gulps" of
        cold coolant from entering an engine). The use of separate
        discharge openings also allows for differing configurations for
        the openings, as also described below, for more precise flow
        control (e.g., a first configuration for a radiator outlet
        versus a by-pass outlet). <br>
        <br>
        [0044] The flow diverter 48 also includes apertures 84 defined
        in the end wall 62 of the flow diverter 48. The apertures 84 in
        end wall 62 allow some of the fluid directed into the interior
        of the flow diverter 48 via the inlet 52 to pass through the end
        wall 62 into a space 86 provided between the end wall 62 and the
        mounting plate 70. The receipt of fluid within the space 86 via
        apertures 84 serves to prevent a pressure imbalance that could
        otherwise develop on opposite sides of the end wall 62. <br>
        <br>
        [0045] As illustrated in FIG. 4, the rotary valve 46 is
        configured such that the flow diverter 48, and the main junction
        58 of body 50 in which the flow diverter 48 is housed, have
        substantially uniform wall thickness about the valve body 50.
        Uniformity in wall thickness in this manner facilitates
        precision molding of both mating components of the valve 46 to
        control all close tolerances features including roundness. Such
        precision facilitates dimensional stability under all operating
        conditions for the valve 46. <br>
        <br>
        [0046] Referring to FIG. 5, the flanges 76, 78 of the valve body
        50 of rotary valve 46 are adapted to receive fasteners 112
        (e.g., nut and bolt connectors) in aligned openings for securing
        the inlet of the valve body 50 to the main junction 58. As shown
        in FIG. 5, the valve 46 preferably includes an O-ring face seal
        between the flanges 76, 78. As also shown in FIG. 5, a taper is
        preferably provided on the inner surface of the main junction 58
        adjacent the flanges 76, 78 to facilitate assembly of the
        diverter 48 with the O-ring component. <br>
        <br>
        [0047] The interior volume provided by the construction of the
        flow diverter 48 provides an ideal transition between the
        axially inlet flow of fluid to the radially discharged flow (or
        alternately, between a radially inlet flow and an axially
        discharged flow in a reversed flow application of the valve 46).
        Also, the rounded configuration of the rotary valve 46 of the
        present invention allows the valve to operate freely regardless
        of pressure differentials between various components of a fluid
        control system (e.g., between radiator, engine, by-pass, etc. of
        an engine coolant system) and without the need for extra torque
        or special balancing passageways as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Publ.
        2006/0005789. The construction of the valve also provides space
        saving efficiencies for reduced package size. <br>
        <br>
        [0048] Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, a portion of the side wall 60
        of flow diverter 48 of valve 46 is shown. The portion of the
        substantially cylindrical side wall 60 has been illustrated in
        FIGS. 6 and 7 in a flat layout form to facilitate description.
        The flow diverter 48 is respectively shown in full open and full
        closed positions in FIGS. 6 and 7. The inner diameter of the
        associated outlet 56 is shown in dotted line in FIGS. 6 and 7 to
        illustrate the relative positions between the opening 82 in the
        figures to illustrate the relative positions between the opening
        82 and the outlet 56 in the full open and full closed flow
        positions. As described above, the flow diverter 48 preferably
        includes a second opening (not shown) on an opposite side of the
        flow diverter 48. As understood by one skilled in the art, the
        inclusion of two openings in this manner limits the amount of
        rotation necessary to move the flow diverter between first and
        second flow positions in which fluid is directed to the first
        and second outlets 54, 56, respectively. <br>
        <br>
        [0049] The opening 82 in the flow diverter side wall 60 includes
        a rounded end 116 at one end of the opening 82. As shown, the
        rounded end 116 has a radius that is substantially equal to that
        of the inner surface of the associated outlet 56. In this
        manner, the opening 82 is configured such that no portion of the
        flow diverter side wall 60 will block the outlet 56 in the full
        open position shown in FIG. 6 (i.e., there is complete
        communication between the interior of the flow diverter 48 and
        the interior of the outlet 56). The opening 82 is
        non-symmetrical including an opposite end 118 that is not
        circular in configuration. Instead, as shown, the edge of the
        flow diverter side wall 60 defining the opening 82 returns
        inwardly with respect to the opening 82 at the second end 118
        such that a portion of the side wall 60 forms a tongue-like
        formation 120 projecting inwardly into the opening 82 at the
        second end 118. As should be understood by one skilled in the
        art, the inclusion of the tongue-like projection 120 at the
        second end 118 of opening 82 provides for controlled transition
        in the flow of fluid being directed from the flow diverter 48 to
        the associated outlet 56 as the flow diverter 48 is moved from
        the full open position towards the full closed position (i.e.,
        downwardly in the point of view of FIG. 6). In addition to
        limiting necessary rotation between the first and second flow
        positions, the inclusion of separate openings on opposite sides
        of the flow diverter 48 allows for customization of the
        flow-controlling projection defined at the second end of the
        opening (e.g., differently configured projection for a radiator
        outlet of an automotive coolant system compared to that for a
        by-pass outlet). <br>
        <br>
        [0050] The flow diverter 48 also defines a substantially
        circular O-ring groove 122 in an outer surface of the side wall
        60 adapted for receiving an O-ring seal (not shown). As shown in
        FIG. 7, the groove 122 is located with respect to the opening 82
        to position the groove 122 in a substantially concentric
        relationship with the associated outlet 56 in the full closed
        condition to provide a closure seal between the diverter 48 and
        the outlet 56. It should be understood that the O-ring feature
        could be included on any of the various embodiments of the
        rotary valve of the present invention. <br>
        <br>
        [0051] Referring to FIG. 8, there is shown a valve 124 according
        to a third exemplary embodiment of the invention. The valve 124
        is adapted for relatively larger flow capacity compared to the
        valve 46. The valve 124 includes a body 126 including and inlet
        128 connected to a main junction 130 at an end of the main
        junction 130. The body 126 also includes a pair of outlets 132,
        133 connected in transverse manner to the main junction 130
        similar to the outlets 54, 56 of valve 46 for example. In a
        similar manner as valve 46, the inlet 128 and the main junction
        130 respectively include flanges 134, 136 adapted for receiving
        fasteners 138 (e.g., nut and bolt connectors) for securing the
        inlet 128 to the main junction 130. <br>
        <br>
        [0052] The valve 124 includes a flow diverter 140 rotatably
        received within an interior of the main junction 130. The flow
        diverter 140 includes a substantially cylindrical side wall 142
        and an end wall 144 defining a socket 146 for receiving an
        output shaft 150 of a drive motor 148. It should be understood
        that the flow diverter 140 includes openings (not shown) in the
        side wall 142 of the flow diverter as described above to provide
        for respectively opening and closing the outlets of the valve
        124 to fluid from the interior of the diverter 140. To
        facilitate rotatable support of the flow diverter 140 within the
        valve body 126, the valve 124 includes a pair of watertight
        bearings 152 located at opposite ends of the flow diverter 140
        within housing portions of the main junction 130. An
        intermediate area of the valve 124 located between the bearings
        152 is sized to minimize friction. According to a presently
        preferred embodiment, the valve body 126 and the flow diverter
        140 are both made from aluminum. The flow diverter 140 can be
        coated with polytetrafluoroethylene to further limit friction
        between the flow diverter 140 and the valve body 126. <br>
        <br>
        [0053] As shown in FIG. 8, the valve 124 includes an O-ring seal
        located between the outer surface of the flow diverter 140 and
        the interior of the main junction 130 adjacent the outlet 132 to
        provide a seal between the outer surface of the flow diverter
        140 and the interior of the main junction 130. <br>
        <br>
        [0054] Similar to the above-described valves 10, 46, the valve
        124 includes a mounting plate at an end of the main junction 130
        receiving fasteners to secure the valve body 126 to the motor
        148 of valve 124. As discussed above, the flow diverter of each
        of the valves 10, 46, 124 also includes an end wall defining a
        socket engagingly receiving the output shaft of the motor. In
        addition to facilitating valve assembly, these construction
        features also facilitate subsequent access to interior
        components of the valves, thereby promoting serviceability of
        the valves (e.g., for repair or replacement of an interior
        component of the valve). This serviceability feature is
        particularly desirable in valves such as the higher capacity
        valve 124 providing ready access for servicing interior
        components of the valve 124 such as the watertight bearings 152.
        Regarding the desired serviceability feature, certain large
        capacity valves (e.g., capacity greater than approximately 400
        gals/minute) are expected to incorporate preventive maintenance
        provisions due to the initial high purchase cost. <br>
        <br>
        [0055] Each of valves 46, 124, described above, includes a
        single inlet and a plurality of outlets adapted for receiving a
        fluid from the inlet via an intermediately located flow
        diverter. The present invention, however, is not so limited.
        Referring to FIGS. 9 and 10, there is shown a valve 154
        according to a fourth exemplary embodiment of the invention. The
        valve 154 includes a body 156 including a substantially
        cylindrical main junction 158 and a flow diverter 160 rotatably
        received within an interior of the main junction 158 in the
        above described manner and having openings 162 in a side wall of
        the flow diverter. The valve body 156 of valve 154 includes an
        outlet 164 located at an end of the main junction 158 in an
        axially aligned manner similar to the inlet 52 of valve 46 for
        example. However, instead of directing fluid into the flow
        diverter 160, the outlet 164 receives fluid from the flow
        diverter 160 as indicated by the flow arrow in FIG. 9. The valve
        154 includes a motor 166 to which the main junction 158 of body
        156 is secured in the above-described manner for valves 46, 124.
        <br>
        <br>
        [0056] The valve body 156 includes first, second and third
        inlets 168, 170, 172 each connected to the main junction 158 in
        transverse fashion for directing a fluid into the interior of
        the flow diverter 160 through the openings 162 of the diverter
        160. The inlets 168, 170, 172 are spaced about the main junction
        158 such that angles, .theta..sub.D, .theta..sub.E,
        .theta..sub.F, are respectively defined between the first and
        third inlets 168, 172, between the first and second inlets 168,
        170 and between the second and third inlets 170, 172. The
        angles, .theta..sub.D, .theta..sub.E, .theta..sub.F, are
        respectively equal to approximately 100 degrees, 130 degrees,
        and 130 degrees, respectively, in the depicted embodiment. <br>
        <br>
        [0057] According to one embodiment, the valve 154 could be
        adapted to direct coolant fluid in an automotive engine and the
        inlets 168, 170, 172 could respectively receive coolant fluid
        from an engine bypass line, from the radiator, and from the
        transmission (or engine oil pan) to direct the coolant fluid to
        a coolant pump via the outlet 164. This valve concept is
        illustrated in the layout drawing of FIG. 18. The bypass line
        168 and the radiator inlet line 170 maintain the same open and
        close features as explained above for valve 46 of FIGS. 3
        through 5. However, the transmission line 172 is designed to
        always remain opened. This allows for the cooling of the
        transmission fluid during hot conditions and the heating of the
        transmission fluid during cold conditions. <br>
        <br>
        [0058] Referring to FIG. 11, there is shown a valve 176
        according to a fifth exemplary embodiment of the invention.
        Similar to valve 154, the valve 176 includes a body 178 having a
        single outlet 180 connected to an end of a main junction 182 in
        an axially aligned manner and a flow diverter 184 rotatably
        received in an interior of the main junction 182. The main
        junction 182 is secured to a motor 186 at an end of the main
        junction 182 opposite the outlet 180. <br>
        <br>
        [0059] The valve body 178 includes a plurality of inlets
        arranged in two groups of inlets each including three inlets.
        The inlets of the first group include first, second and third
        inlets 188, 190, 192 and the inlets of the second group include
        fourth, fifth and sixth inlets 194, 196, 198. The first group of
        inlets 188, 190, 192 is spaced about the main junction 182 at a
        first axial location of the main junction 182 and the second
        group of inlets 194, 196, 198 is spaced about the main junction
        182 at a second axial location of the main junction 182. In the
        above-described manner, the flow diverter 184 of valve 176
        includes openings, such as opening 200 for inlet 190, for
        directing fluid into the interior of the flow diverter 184 from
        the inlets. As shown, the opening 200 includes a
        flow-controlling tongue 202. In an automotive application, the
        inlets 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 198 could respectively be
        arranged to receive a coolant fluid from transmission, radiator,
        bypass line, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), charge air cooler
        (CAC), and rear axle. <br>
        <br>
        [0060] Referring to FIG. 12, there is shown a valve 228
        according to a sixth exemplary embodiment of the invention. The
        valve 228 includes a body 230 having a main junction 232 and an
        inlet 234 secured to an end of the main junction 232 in an
        axially aligned manner. The main junction 232 is secured to a
        motor 236 at an end of the main junction 232 opposite the inlet
        234. A flow diverter 238 is rotatably received in an interior of
        the main junction 232 and includes an end wall 239 defining a
        socket formation 240 engagingly receiving an output shaft 242 of
        motor 236 for drivingly rotating the flow diverter 238. The
        valve body 230 also includes outlets, such as outlet 244,
        extending transversely from the main junction 232. The flow
        diverter 238 includes a side wall 246 having openings, such as
        opening 248, for directing fluid to one of the outlets, such as
        outlet 244, from the inlet 234 via an interior of the flow
        diverter 238. The flow diverter 238 also includes apertures 250
        defined by the end wall 239 to provide for balanced pressure on
        opposite sides of the end wall 239. As discussed with respect to
        some of the other embodiments, this embodiment also includes the
        taper in the main junction 232 to facilitate assembly, as well
        as the O-ring component. Although these features are optional,
        they are preferred. <br>
        <br>
        [0061] Referring to FIGS. 13 and 14, a portion of the outer
        surface of the flow diverter 238 is shown in flat layout in full
        open and full closed positions, respectively. Similar to valve
        46, the opening 248 in flow diverter 238 of valve 228 includes a
        rounded first end 252 having a radius substantially matching
        that of the outlet 244 and an opposite second end 254 forming a
        flow controlling tongue 256. Also similar to valve 46, the flow
        diverter 238 of valve 228 defines a circular groove 258 for
        receiving an annular O-ring for creating a seal between the flow
        diverter 238 and the outlet 244 when the flow diverter is moved
        to the full closed position for outlet 244 shown in FIG. 14. The
        valve body 230 also includes a reinforcing web 260 extending
        across an interior of the outlet 244 adjacent the flow diverter
        238. The web 260 provides reinforcing support for an O-ring
        located at the intersection between the outlet 244 and the main
        junction 232. This support prevents sagging of the O-ring that
        might otherwise occur when the O-ring is heated. For relatively
        larger flow capacity valves (e.g., capacity greater than
        approximately 200 gals/minute) additional webs may be desired,
        for example two webs arranged in an inverted V-shaped
        configuration as shown in broken line in FIGS. 13 and 14. <br>
        <br>
        [0062] Referring to the schematic illustration of FIG. 15, there
        is shown an engine coolant system 262 incorporating the rotary
        valve 46 of FIGS. 3 through 5. As illustrated by the flow
        arrows, engine coolant fluid is directed to the valve 46 in
        system 262 from a radiator 264 via line 266 and from a bypass
        line 268. The coolant fluid is outlet from the valve 46 to
        engine 270 via a water pump 272. <br>
        <br>
        [0063] Referring to the schematic illustration of FIG. 16, there
        is shown another engine coolant system 274 incorporating the
        valve 46 of FIGS. 3 through 5. As shown, system 274 is arranged
        such that engine coolant fluid is directed from the engine 270
        to the valve 46 via the water pump 272. Depending on the
        rotational position of the valve 46, the engine coolant is
        outlet from the valve 46 either to the radiator 264 via line 276
        or returned to the engine 270 via bypass line 278. <br>
        <br>
        [0064] Referring to FIG. 17, there is illustrated an engine
        coolant system 280 incorporating the valve 154 of FIGS. 9 and
        10. The system 280 is arranged such that engine coolant is inlet
        to the valve 154 from radiator 282 via line 284, from the engine
        286 via radiator bypass line 288, or from transmission 290 via
        line 292. The engine coolant fluid is outlet from the valve 154
        to a water pump 294 via line 296. From the water pump 294, the
        engine coolant is respectively directed to the engine 286 and
        the transmission 290 via lines 298, 300. <br>
        <br>
        [0065] The inlet to the valve 154 of system 280 from the
        transmission 290 preferably always remains opened. This
        arrangement allows bypass flow to heat the transmission 290
        during cold weather conditions and to direct colder radiator
        flow during relatively hot conditions. As should be understood,
        the engine coolant could alternatively be directed to another
        feature of an automobile rather than the transmission 290. <br>
        <br>
        [0066] Referring to FIG. 18, there is shown a portion of an
        engine coolant system 302 including an integral rotary valve 304
        and electronic water pump 306. The electronic water pump 306 is
        described in greater detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,499,442, which is
        incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The rotary
        valve 304, like rotary valve 154 of FIGS. 9 and 10, includes
        inlets 308, 310, 312 directing a fluid to a flow diverter 314
        rotatably received in an interior of a main junction 316. A
        motor 318 includes a housing secured to one end of the main
        junction 316. The valve 304 lacks the outlet pipe that was
        included in the valve 154 of FIGS. 9 and 10. Instead, a housing
        320 of the electronic water pump 306 is secured directly to the
        main junction 316 of the valve 304 opposite the motor 318. <br>
        <br>
        [0067] Referring to FIG. 19, there is illustrated a coolant
        system 322 for an automobile engine incorporating the integral
        valve 304 and water pump 306 assembly of FIG. 18. The coolant is
        directed into the valve 304 in system 322 from radiator 324 via
        line 326, from the engine 328 via a radiator bypass line 330,
        and from an oil pan 332 via line 334. The fluid is output from
        the valve 304 to the integral water pump 306 and, from there, is
        directed to the engine 328 via line 336 and to the oil pan 332
        via line 338. In terms of the coolant flow distribution, the
        system 322 is arranged substantially similar to the system 280
        shown in FIG. 17, except that the coolant is directed from the
        water pump 306 to the oil pan 332 instead of the transmission of
        the automobile. It should be understood that the coolant line
        could conceivably be directed to any suitable component of the
        automobile for conditioning by the coolant system. As was the
        case for the valve inlet from the transmission of system 280,
        the valve inlet from the oil pan 332 in system 322 is preferably
        maintained in an opened condition. Some small engines, such as
        hybrid engines, might incorporate a Y connection to combine both
        transmission and oil pan cooling in a single electronic-water
        pump and electronic control valve. <br>
