      <p>The debate surrounding alternative energy sources has not died
        down but is becoming more burning with every passing day. This
        article partly (and maybe directly) discusses the material
        published in issue No 3 of the “Alternativnaya Energetika I
        Ekologiya” (“Alternative Energy and Ecology”) magazine in 2005,
        an article entitled “A new generation of damless hydroelectric
        stations based on hydro-energy units” . </p>
      <p><b>Background</b> </p>
      <p>A group of engineers has constructed a hydraulic turbine to
        receive energy from a free flow of water (a free flow hydraulic
        unit). However, when its capacity was measured it was
        established that it generated more energy than it was designed
        for. It is well-known that a flow of&nbsp; water has kinetic
        energy that can be extracted (which is what free-flow turbines
        do). However, it is impossible to extract all of its kinetic
        energy. In order to do this, the flow should be stopped
        completely and then it would cease to be a flow. That is why the
        velocity of water flow at the exit from a working unit of
        turbine is slower than its flow at the entrance – it is
        precisely this difference that defines the efficiency of any
        facility. When the velocity at entrance is 1 m/s and at the exit
        it is 0.5 m/s we can extract 75% of kinetic energy from the
        flow. </p>
      <p><b>(Ein&nbsp; - Eout ) / Ein&nbsp; = (Vin <sup>2</sup> – Vout
          <sup>2</sup> )&nbsp; /&nbsp; Vin <sup>2</sup></b> </p>
      <p>(existing free-flow turbines have an even lower figure) </p>
      <p>As we have already mentioned, this facility produced even a
        greater amount of energy than the total kinetic energy of the
        flow. </p>
      <p>Where does this additional energy received from the facility
        come? </p>
      <p>Does the flow of water have kinetic energy only? </p>
      <p>(Here we do not consider the internal (thermal) energy of water
        or the energy of the intermolecular and interatomic bonds of
        water as a&nbsp; substance.) </p>
      <p>Let us try to answer these questions. </p>
      <p>Let us take one cubic metre of water (with dimensions of 1m *
        1m * 1m) flowing with a velocity of 1 m/s. </p>
      <p>There is no doubt about its kinetic energy, which is: </p>
      <p><b>Ek = m * V <sup>2&nbsp;</sup> / 2&nbsp; =&nbsp; 1000(kg) *
          1(m/s) <sup>2</sup>&nbsp; /&nbsp; 2&nbsp; = 500 (Joule )</b>
      </p>
      <p>However, there is also pressure by the top layers of water on
        the bottom ones (potential energy). If we let this cube of water
        spread, then we can extract it. Considering that the gravity
        centre of the cube is at the middle of its height, that is h =
        0.5 m, it is equal to: </p>
      <p><b>Ep = m* g * h&nbsp; =&nbsp; 1000(kg)&nbsp; *&nbsp; 9.8 (m/s<sup>2</sup>)
          *&nbsp; 0.5(m)&nbsp; =&nbsp; 4900 (Joule )</b> </p>
      <p>This means that the potential energy of this cubic metre of
        water is up by almost 10 times on its kinetic energy. It is easy
        to calculate that, at a speed of 0.5m/sec, this difference will
        amount to almost 40 times! </p>
      <p>In other words, we can see that – in addition to the kinetic
        energy – the flow also has potential energy whose magnitude
        depends on the flow’s depth. But its exergy (that is the
        recoverable energy which is able to actually work) is equal to
        zero at regular conditions. After all, any volume of water is
        surrounded by water with the same characteristics (depth, speed,
        temperature). This can also be related to the air. We know that
        the air surrounding us has a significant amount of energy
        because the air has non-zero pressure and temperature. But for
        the same reason mentioned previously, its exergy is equal to
        zero and it is, therefore, useless from the energy viewpoint
        (later we will see that it is not useless all the time).
        (Brodyanskiy V.M “Exergic analysis. Energy: the problem of
        quality” “Nauka i Zhizn” (“Science and Life”) #3, 1982) </p>
      <p>Now let us imagine that we are extracting part of kinetic
        energy from a cubic metre of water, which is flowing within a
        current, and use it to “move aside” the cubic metre of water
        that follows it (downstream). That is we will speed up the
        downstream cubic metre of water by slowing down the upstream
        volume of water. As a result, a level difference arises between
        them and potential energy emerges in the difference between
        these levels, which can be extracted from the current. The
        following question arises: will the amount of the extracted
        potential energy be more, less or equal to the energy used to
        speed up the second cubic metre of water – or, in other words,
        the energy expended to increase its kinetic energy? </p>
      <p>Let us resort to mathematics. </p>
      <p>As an example, we will consider a machine that is shown as a
        diagram on Picture 1, which makes it possible to speed up the
        outflowing stream of water by extracting part of the inflowing
        stream’s energy - that is, a machine with positive feedback
        between the energies of the inflowing and outflowing streams. By
        the way, a machine that works on this very principle has been
        invented. It is this machine that our story started with. </p>

      <p><b>Explanations for Fig. 1:</b> </p>
      <p><b>1 </b>- Working parts of the inflowing stream of water; </p>
      <p><b>2 </b>- Working parts of the outflowing stream of water; </p>
      <p><b>3 </b>- Working parts ensuring positive feedback between
        the inflowing and outflowing streams of water; </p>
      <p><b>4 </b>- Mark showing the level of the inflowing stream of
        water; </p>
      <p><b>5 </b>- Mark showing the level of the outflowing stream of
        water; </p>
      <p><b>6 </b>- Channel bed </p>
      <p><b>H1 </b>– Actual depth of the inflowing stream of water </p>
      <p><b>H2 </b>– Depth of the outflowing stream of water </p>
      <p><b>V1 </b>– Velocity of the inflowing stream of water </p>
      <p><b>V2 </b>– Velocity of the outflowing stream of water </p>
      <p><b>h </b>– Drop between the levels of the inflowing and
        outflowing streams of water </p>
      <p>The device works based on the following principle: </p>
      <p>The working parts of the inflowing stream <b>1</b> extract
        part of the kinetic energy from the stream and transmit it -
        with the help of the positive feedback <b>3</b> - to the
        working parts of the outflowing stream <b>2</b>, which give the
        outflowing stream additional acceleration. </p>
      <p>Because the amount of water entering the device is equal to the
        amount of outflowing water, and the speed of the outflowing
        stream is higher than that of the inflowing stream, then
        the&nbsp; sectional&nbsp; area of the outflowing stream will be
        less than that of the inflowing stream. </p>
      <p>Therefore, its depth <b>H2</b> will be less than the depth of
        the inflowing stream <b>H1</b> by the value <b>h</b>. As a
        result of this, potential energy appears between the different
        levels of the inflowing and outflowing streams. </p>
      <p>The device’s energy balance is as follows: </p>
      <p><b>E = Ep1 + Ek1 – Ek2</b> </p>
      <p>The total output of energy from the device is equal to the
        potential energy of the difference between the marks plus the
        kinetic energy of the inflowing stream and minus the kinetic
        energy of the outflowing stream.&nbsp; After omitting all the
        computations, we have: </p>
      <p><img src="image005.gif"></p>
      <p>or </p>
      <p><img src="image006.gif"></p>
      <p>where <b>M</b> is the weight of the water entering the device
        in a unit of time, which is equal to the density of water
        multiplied by the active area of the inflowing stream and
        multiplied by its velocity. </p>
      <p>Then the most interesting aspect occurs. It can be seen that
        the left side of the equation, which is in brackets, will
        increase in a linear fashion when it depends on <b>h</b> or in
        a hyperbola when it depends on <b>V2</b>, whereas the right
        part will decrease, and in a parabola at that. Which side will
        gain the upper hand? </p>
      <p>Let us plot a graph showing energy’s dependence on the drop
        between the levels <b>h</b>. The graph will be plotted to show
        the various levels of the inflowing stream’s velocity <b>V1</b>
        after designating it as a constant. </p>
      <center><img src="image008.jpg"></center>
      <p>It is a paradox! The graph showing the energy’s dependence on
        the drop between the levels <b>h</b> has an extremum. On the
        rising branch of the graph, the energy balance will be positive
        (the power factor &gt; 1), i.e. the extracted potential energy
        will be mostly expended as kinetic energy on speeding up the
        outflowing stream, and the device will self-accelerate until it
        reaches the maximum. </p>
      <p>The energy produced by the device at this point will be several
        times the kinetic energy of the inflowing stream - and under
        certain conditions, tens and even hundreds of times! </p>
      <p>The speed of the outflowing stream will be significantly higher
        (2 to 3 times as higher at times) than the speed of the
        inflowing stream. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the
        outflowing stream is 4 to 9 times the kinetic energy of the
        inflowing stream. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the graphs show that that not everything appears
        to be quite right with the inflowing speed. It also has an
        extremum. To see this better, let us plot a 3D diagram. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="image010.jpg"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Isn’t it beautiful?! </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="image012.jpg"></p>
      </center>
      <p>This is the dependence on the outflowing speed. </p>
      <p>However paradoxical this may seem at first glance, but the
        diagrams show there is an optimal speed for the inflowing
        stream. When it is exceeded, the device’s power capacity will
        sharply fall. This is due to the fact that a significant amount
        of energy needs to be spent on speeding up a stream that is
        flowing fast already. </p>
      <p>Therefore, it can be seen that the device can create a column
        of water for itself and is able to extract the potential energy
        from an object (from a stream of water in this case) without the
        expenditure of external energy. </p>
      <p>Does this not remind you of something? People who are
        knowledgeable about physics will immediately exclaim: “Why, this
        is Maxwell’s demon!” Indeed! The much-discussed Maxwell’s demon
        that has thus far been elusive. Many people will say that
        Maxwell proposed his “demon” for thermodynamics, and here you
        are dealing with hydrodynamics. Yes, but this does not change
        the essence of the matter – we can extract from an object (in
        this case, a flow of liquid) the potential energy that cannot be
        extracted in normal conditions. And we can extract it without
        spending anything (without even building a dam!) at that. It is
        true that not all of the potential energy can be extracted.
        Firstly, the depth of the outflowing stream is not equal to
        zero. Secondly, part of the potential energy extracted
        transforms into additional kinetic energy splashed out with this
        flow. This energy is actually even greater than the kinetic
        energy of the inflowing stream. However, this is the reward we
        should give the “demon” so that it agrees to work for us.&nbsp;
        As you see, the “demon” also “wants to eat”. </p>
      <p>The question may arise: “How does the outflowing stream, which
        has a shallower depth, interact with the water flow around it,
        which has a normal constant depth?” Here we have to recall that
        the velocity of the outflowing stream is higher than that of the
        surrounding medium and this creates what is called in hydraulics
        “hydraulic jump”, which equalises the discrepancy between the
        kinetic and potential energies of the two flows. This “jump” is
        in essence surf, a vortex in the flow. </p>
      <p>The conclusions to be drawn from what has been outlined above
        cannot be overestimated. In nature there exists a process which
        makes it possible to extract energy which it was impossible to
        extract in the past from any object - and this process has been
        discovered! <b>This is the principle of positive feedback that
          makes it possible to transfer energy between different flows
          of energy sources</b>. There is the possibility of extracting
        free, environmentally-pure energy from the environment, which
        was predicted by the great Scottish physicist James Maxwell back
        in 1871 in the form of a jokey demon. Maybe it was precisely
        because of this that it was always regarded as nothing more than
        a joke by the great scientist. Or is it reality indeed? </p>
      <p>It is not quite clear yet how it works with thermodynamics and
        aerodynamics, but because this process exists in hydrodynamics
        it should also exist in any other branch of physics. There are
        some developments in thermodynamics and aerodynamics already.
        Even if this process is not found for them in the near future
        and it drags on for decades, then at least applying its
        hydrodynamic interpretation is already promising mankind huge
        dividends in the form of free energy and an uncontaminated
        atmosphere </p>
      <p>In the next article, we will discuss what seems as the utopian
        idea (possibility) of using this principle of extracting energy
        on cars, and a hypothetical engine for them. </p>
