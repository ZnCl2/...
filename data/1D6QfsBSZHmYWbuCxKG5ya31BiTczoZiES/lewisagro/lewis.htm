      A BATTLE is raging beneath the bobbing heads of Ian Linklater's
      wheat crop in the red, loamy soils of Gol Gol.<br>
      <br>
      In this break-your-heart farming land near the Murray River, north
      of Mildura, the enemies are drought, nutrient depletion, salt and
      rising farming costs.<br>
      <br>
      The battle's unlikely heroes are Mr Linklater and his
      400-horsepower, oxygen-sucking, diesel-guzzling, carbon-spewing
      tractor.<br>
      <br>
      International debate rages over the cost and plausibility of
      reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power stations
      by pumping carbon underground.<br>
      <br>
      But Mr Linklater is literally ploughing ahead, injecting his
      tractor's fossil fuel exhaust fumes directly into the ground,
      where they enhance the biochemical interaction between plants and
      soil microbes. And it seems his home-grown version of carbon
      sequestration, introduced in 2007, is getting results, with this
      year's crop, aided by better rainfall, his best since 2001.<br>
      <br>
      "It might not seem that emissions from one tractor could do a lot,
      but per hectare it emits 1100 kilos of carbon," Mr Linklater says.<br>
      <br>
      Adapting methods developed by Canadian farmer Gary Lewis, of
      BioAgtive Technologies, Mr Linklater spent $20,000 customising
      equipment that cools the tractor's fumes to 30 degrees then expels
      them into the soil as gas fertiliser when he sows his crop.<br>
      <br>
      His trials, which are being replicated in Canada, Britain and
      South Africa, are gaining global attention and are now the focus
      of scientific research. ''When I heard about it, I listened and
      the science of it seemed to make sense, but with fertiliser costs
      at about $1200 to $1500 a tonne, the economics of it got me into
      gear,'' Mr Linklater says.<br>
      <br>
      At today's prices it would have cost him $500,000 in phosphorous
      and nitrogen fertilisers to prepare 3900 hectares for planting.
      But in the two years since he and his sons began trialling the new
      technique, no fertiliser has been applied. The saving is enough to
      wipe a healthy chunk off the debt that he, like many
      drought-stricken farmers, has racked up through years of meagre
      rain and below-break-even wheat prices.<br>
      <br>
      Political debate continues over inclusion of agriculture in
      Australia's emissions trading scheme, but Mr Linklater says
      farmers have nothing to fear from such a scheme. ''It's coming
      anyway, regardless of what happens in Australia. Governments
      around the world are moving ahead with carbon taxes and we will
      all have to pay.''<br>
      <br>
      The Federal Opposition has proposed amendments permanently
      removing agriculture's methane emissions from an emissions trading
      scheme while allowing farmers to make money through carbon credits
      earned from replanting trees and storing carbon in the soil.<br>
      <br>
      The Government has delayed a decision on agriculture, which
      accounts for 18 per cent of the nation's greenhouse gases, until
      2013.<br>

            Fertilizer</b></big><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>The summer of 2007 was one of the driest and hottest on record
      in Montana. Fields withered along the state's arid Hi-Line. But in
      the small, north-central town of Rudyard, one emerald-green
      cornfield stood out amid the brown. The field was a test plot
      grown with a technology that only a fed-up farmer could have
      invented: a system that turns diesel tractor exhaust into plant
      food.<br>
      <br>
      That farmer is Canadian Gary Lewis, a trained mechanic and the
      inventor of Bio-Agtive Emissions Technology, a tractor add-on that
      recycles diesel emissions into fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      He came up with the idea back in 2001, when despite his careful
      applications of pricey fertilizer, his timothy hay fields failed
      to grow. Lewis, who has a wife and five kids, was devastated.<br>
      <br>
      He believed that years of dousing his fields with chemical-heavy
      fertilizer had made the soil too salty, less biologically active
      and unable to retain moisture. So he decided to jump off the
      chemical treadmill and find another way to tend his plants, which
      on their luxury diets had grown lazy.<br>
      <br>
      Lewis, who looks like an "American Gothic" version of John Elway,
      has the tenacity of a champion quarterback. He spent the next year
      poring over plant-science textbooks like Horst Marschner's Mineral
      Nutrition of Higher Plants. Armed with a new understanding of soil
      and plant health, Lewis used his automotive skills to implement
      what he fondly calls his "crazy idea": harnessing the carbon
      dioxide, nitrogen gas and heavy metals -- zinc, copper, magnesium
      and iron -- in tractor exhaust and using them as fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      His invention cools the exhaust, runs it through a metal tubing
      system, and feeds it into the tractor's air seeder. Those
      emissions are then injected into the ground along with the seeds.
      Lewis believes this stimulates soil microbes and beneficial root
      fungi, whose activity liberates nutrients already in the ground
      and increases the plants' ability to absorb both nutrients and
      water.<br>
      <br>
      "My tractor became a living thing, burying all of its energy to
      feed things in the soil –– bacteria and fungi and
      micro-invertebrates," he enthuses.<br>
      <br>
      The Bio-Agtive process also coats the seeds with emissions, which
      Lewis believes protects them against soil pathogens. Some of the
      minor emissions from diesel engines, such as formaldehyde, are the
      same chemicals used in protective seed treatments, he says.<br>
      <br>
      More than 100 farmers in the U.S. and Canada have purchased
      Bio-Agtive through Lewis' company, N/C Quest Inc. But like any
      innovation that promises revolution, the system has its skeptics.
      "People thought I was burying poisonous gas in the soil!" says
      Lewis. Admittedly, diesel emissions are far from healthy for
      people. Yet Lewis contends they are fine for plants.<br>
      <br>
      To help prove it, he enlisted the support of Montana State
      University Northern's Bio-Energy Center, which began testing
      Bio-Agtive on spring wheat crops last year with the help of a
      Montana Research and Commercialization Board grant. Though
      preliminary, the results are promising: The center didn't detect
      any dangerous heavy metals in the grains or tissues of
      emissions-treated plants, and, after one season of testing, found
      higher yields and increased soil phosphorous levels in those,
      compared to fertilized fields. What's more, the acidic condensate
      associated with the cooled emissions helped reduce the test plots'
      alkaline soil (common in the arid West) to more neutral levels.
      The center is also testing Bio-Agtive with biofuels like camelina
      biodiesel, the use of which could reduce farmers' dependence on
      both fossil fuels and fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      Canadian soil ecologist Jill Clapperton has spent the last five
      years investigating Bio-Agtive's effects on soil, seeds and
      plants, working both with the Bio-Energy Center and the National
      Research Council of Canada.<br>
      <br>
      "When a farmer uses Bio-Agtive," says Clapperton, the seeds
      "become extremely coated with soot and exhaust emissions … they
      get very, very black." But the coating does not seem to reduce
      germination rates, as she had suspected it might. She also looked
      for negative effects on soil health -- respiration, the microbial
      community -- but found none.<br>
      <br>
      Lewis, she says, may be correct that emissions-coated seeds are
      better able to fend off potentially pathogenic fungi, but she
      stresses that more research is required. Clapperton's less sure,
      however, about Bio-Agtive's potential as a fertilizer. There are
      clear differences between the control and emissions-treated plots,
      she says. "But whether (those changes) relate to Gary's theory as
      he sees it is another question." Montana State University
      agronomist David Wichman worries Lewis' too-good-to-be-true tech
      is just that. He did not see yield increases in his research trial
      of Bio-Agtive on winter wheat, though he acknowledges the testing
      was limited in scope. He cautions farmers to wait for scientific
      proof before spending $30,000-$55,000 on a Bio-Agtive system.<br>
      <br>
      Lewis responds that the price is "about the same as one truckload
      of fertilizer." Indeed, small-grain farmer and Bio-Agtive
      distributor Craig Henke of Chester, Mont., says the system saves
      him $50,000 a year in phosphate fertilizer costs. He still applies
      some nitrogen to his plants but says he has seen a four-fold
      increase in soil phosphorous levels since he started using
      Bio-Agtive six years ago.<br>
      <br>
      For Lewis, it's all about helping farm families gain some
      independence and security.<br>
      <br>
      "When you are addicted to something, it's hard to take the risk to
      quit. But the best thing with this technology is that, in the
      gambling game of farming, you are keeping money in your pocket.<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      Dr. Jill Clapperton, formerly with Agriculture Canada's Lethbridge
      Research Station for 16 years and now the principal of EarthSpirit
      Land Resource Consulting, leads the way in trying to find out
      exactly how exhaust&nbsp; does what it does in the soil.&nbsp;
      Here's what she had to say about our Bio-AgtiveTM Emissions
      Technology at our 2008 convention:<br>
      <br>
      "It works, and its my job to find out how it works.&nbsp; We will
      be able to tell you exactly what's happening in the soil in 3-5
      years."<br>
      <br>
      "Gary's great goal is to make sure that people are growing food
      that is really good for them, and that they're doing good things
      for the soil - that they're taking care of their soil so they can
      grow great food."<br>
      <br>
      "...what is really nice about using the exhaust is that we're not
      using too much phosphorous."<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Jill has an extensive ongoing research program.<br>
      <br>
      What has been researched?<br>
      <br>
      What's going on in the soil as a result of our injection of
      exhaust emissions?&nbsp; The summer of 2007 saw the first real
      scientific research into our Bio-Agtive™ Emissions
      Technology.&nbsp; In two separate arms-length experiments
      co-funded by the National Research Council of Canada and N/C Quest
      Inc. (one in Alberta and one in Manitoba), two eminent Canadian
      agricultural scientists headed teams that seeded and monitored
      test plots with various crops, fertilizer and exhaust emissions
      treatments in two totally different areas of the country.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately the Alberta experiment supervised by Dr. Jill
      Clapperton was completely hailed out and yielded only limited
      data.&nbsp; Dr. Clapperton was, however, able to review and assess
      the research data, crop yields, soil tests, tissue tests, and
      anecdotal evidence collected elsewhere in 2007.&nbsp; With regard
      to the 2006 and 2007 yields of our licensees, she states that,
      while we may not know exactly what is going on below ground,
      "plants are indicators of what's going on in the soil, so plant
      success is always the first step [in proving the value of new
      technology]".<br>
      <br>
      The Manitoba experiment was a resounding success despite the
      extreme drought conditions in that area.&nbsp; What our scientific
      team found was "agronomy test data to show that exhaust stimulated
      soil nutrient release and uptake by both canola and wheat",
      according to Dr. Loraine Bailey.<br>
      <br>
      Continued research has been carried out in 2009/2010 with Dr.
      Clapperton and research summary for 2009 was released showing
      Yield Data in Stome, AB<br>
      <br>
      Montana State University Northern, Havre MT have a grant for the
      State of Montana USA to examine the quality of exhaust emissions,
      and how much exhaust is placed with the seed. A further grant
      offered trials in 2011 that have also received good results in
      determining how much life is in the soil before seeding, after
      seeding, after harvest with treatments as; check, diesel,
      bio-diesel, fertilizer. The scientific results have been published
      and the report is viewable under "Montana State University
      Northern" tab.<br>
      <br>
      Among the latest in research is or “Africa Project” lead by Mick
      Dennis of Field Master Ltd. in Arusha Tanzania. After entering the
      African Enterprise Challenge of 250 contestants, Bio-Agtive™
      placed first and was granted $400,000 to do further research in
      Tanzania on the technology. Updates will be continually posted as
      we get them!<br>
      <br>
      No funding or grants have been received yet in Australia but we
      look forward to running separate independent trials at future
      field days in 2012 year, we will keep it updated.<br>

      Our Bio-Agtive™&nbsp; Emissions Technology (BAET) is the
      culmination of more than nine years of experimentation by Mr. Gary
      Lewis on his own farm. His worldwide Patent&nbsp; Pending
      technology has two major components; the Bio-Agtive Emissions
      System (BAES) which is the mechanical system that captures,
      processes, and injects the exhaust emissions into the soil, and
      the Bio-Agtive Emissions Method (BAEM) - Gary's unique theory of
      how the soil and the plants growing in it interact biochemically,
      and are enhanced by, exhaust emissions. One part of the BAE
      Technology is useless without the other:<br>
      <br>
      The BAE System: because every producer's equipment isn't the same
      our distributor in your area will supply and install it in your
      farm shop to fit your equipment and your crop needs.&nbsp; That
      way you understand the inner workings of your BAE System.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;The BAE Method: your distributor will spend the time
      necessary to teach you how to use our technology properly to
      maximize your crop yields while minimizing your fossil fuel and
      fertilizer inputs, and ongoing advice will always be just a phone
      call away.<br>

      A fertilizer system is provided using extraction of nitrogen
      compounds and other plant nutrients from combustion exhaust gases,
      and which is particularly suited for use with an agricultural
      irrigation system or engine driven plant care equipment including
      self-propelled tractors, mowers and the like. The system includes
      an exhaust chamber in communication with the motor driving a pump
      of the system for receiving the exhaust gases therethrough. Water
      is injected into the exhaust chamber for mixing with the exhaust
      so that the steam being formed absorbs various nitrogen compounds
      and other plant nutrients from the surrounding hot exhaust gases.
      The steam is subsequently condensed in a condensing chamber from
      which condensate is collected and dispensed into the inlet of the
      pump with water circulated therethrough.; The water is thus
      enriched with various nitrogen compounds and other plant nutrients
      absorbed from the exhaust gases before being dispensed to a
      planted area by an irrigation system or a sprayer attachment on a
      self-propelled tractor, mower and the like.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a method and system for
      fertilizing using extraction of nitrogen compounds and plant
      nutrients from combustion exhaust gases, and more particularly to
      such a system or method when used for extracting nitrogen
      compounds and plant nutrients from exhaust gases, for example, in
      either an irrigation pump motor of an agricultural irrigation
      system for subsequent use of the nitrogen compounds in irrigation
      water of the irrigation system or in a driving motor for driving
      or propelling plant care equipment including self-propelled
      tractors, mowers, sprayers and the like.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Various nitrogen compounds and plant nutrients are known to
      be desirable for fertilizing various plants, in particular crops.
      Repeated adding of fertilizer to crops however can be time
      consuming and costly to both purchase and distribute to the
      plants.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] While forms of nitrogen are known to exist in large
      quantities in exhaust gases of combustion engines, these forms of
      nitrogen however are typically harmful to the environment and of
      little use as a fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] U.S. Pat. No. 6,446,385 to Crutcher describes a greenhouse
      system in which a gas turbine provides heat and power to maintain
      the greenhouse. An exhaust gas treatment system receives the hot
      gas from the turbine to remove and convert harmful nitrogen
      compounds while a fertilization system makes use of the converted
      nitrogen compounds as fertilizer for feeding the plants of the
      greenhouse. The method of extraction described refers to European
      patent application No. 97117779.5. The gas treatment system
      however requires consumption of an alkaline earth compound to
      react with nitric acid which is formed to then form an alkaline
      earth nitrate in an aqueous form. The resulting calcium nitrate or
      magnesium nitrate which may be produced are harmful to the plants
      and soil when distributed in excess quantities and accordingly
      this system would require careful monitoring so that only limited
      amounts of the fertilizer compound generated by the gas treatment
      system are in fact distributed to the plants through irrigation
      thereof in the greenhouse. This method converts NOx to nitric acid
      to be scrubbed out with earth alkaline in an aqueous effluent,
      leaving carbon dioxide in the exhaust stream to raise the carbon
      dioxide levels in the greenhouse.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] According to one aspect of the present invention there is
      provided a fertilizer system for extracting nitrogen compounds and
      other plant nutrients from exhaust gases of a combustion device,
      the system comprising:<br>
      <br>
      an exhaust chamber having an inlet and an outlet for receiving the
      exhaust gases from the combustion device there through;<br>
      a water injector for injecting water into the exhaust chamber for
      mixing with the exhaust gases to form a water vapor;<br>
      a condensing chamber for condensing said water vapor exiting the
      exhaust chamber with the exhaust gases to form a condensate
      solution; and<br>
      a collector for collecting said condensate solution from the
      condensing chamber;<br>
      characterised in that said condensate solution being formed
      comprises water and one or more compounds selected from the group
      including nitrate, nitrite and ammonium. Other useful nutrients to
      the plants which are extracted include sulphur phosphorus,
      magnesium, zinc, iron, copper and carbon dioxide as a carbonic
      acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] According to a second aspect of the present invention there
      is provided a method of fertilizing by extracting nitrogen
      compounds and other plant nutrients from exhaust gases of a
      combustion device, the method comprising:<br>
      <br>
      operating a combustion device to produce exhaust gases;<br>
      directing the exhaust gases through an exhaust chamber in
      communication with the combustion device;<br>
      injecting water into the exhaust chamber for mixing with the
      exhaust gases to form a water vapor;<br>
      condensing said water vapor exiting the exhaust chamber with the
      exhaust gases to form a condensate solution comprising water and
      one or more compounds selected from the group including nitrate,
      nitrite and ammonium; and<br>
      collecting said condensate solution from the condensing chamber.
      Other useful plant nutrients which may be included in the
      condensate solution as a result of the above steps include:
      sulphur, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, iron, copper and carbon
      dioxide as a carbonic acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] According to further aspects of the present invention there
      are provided fertilizer solutions comprising the condensate
      solution formed by the system and method noted above.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The use of water and exhaust mixed together and
      subsequently condensed produces a solution of water with nitrate,
      nitrite, ammonium, sulphur, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, iron,
      copper and carbon dioxide as a carbonic acid. These are useful to
      plants when watered therewith without concern of being toxic to
      the plants when left to operate continuously from an irrigation
      pump motor in an irrigation system for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] As described in our method of extraction, complete
      conversion to nitric acid is not required as water will scrub out
      NH4, NO2, NO3, and other plant nutrients such as sulphur,
      phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, iron, copper and carbon dioxide as a
      carbonic acid. This would carry the CO2 to the crop canopy to feed
      the crop and/or be stored in the soil as a carbon sink. NO2
      (nitrite) will feed soil bacteria and nitrite reductase (NiR)
      which transforms nitrite to ammonia and the nitrate bacteria will
      change nitrites into nitrates. Sulphur dioxide can be used by the
      crop canopy. Sulphur converts to sulphate in the soil for root up
      take when combined with water in which sulphuric acid is formed<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The use of an exhaust chamber in combination with a water
      injector permits nitrogen and nutrients to be readily collected
      from exhaust gases of commonly available combustion devices,
      including internal combustion engines and the like, at minimal
      cost and effort as the nitrogen compounds available in the exhaust
      gases are normally considered useless and therefore typically
      wasted. Collection of nitrogen compounds and plant nutrients in a
      condensate is particularly useful in an agricultural irrigation
      system as compounds are ready for immediate use with little or no
      effort on the part of the operator of the irrigation system.
      Further benefits to injecting water into the exhaust chamber for
      mixing with the irrigation water include preheating the irrigation
      water with heat from the exhaust gases and reducing undesirable
      emissions in the exhaust gases due to the mixing of the gases with
      water vapor in the exhaust chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] There may be provided a distribution system for
      distributing the condensate solution to a planted area, for
      example in irrigation system or a sprayer attachment on a
      self-propelled tractor or mower and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The condensate solution may be fully and continuously
      diverted to the distribution system comprising an irrigation
      system or a sprayer system on self-propelled equipment as it moves
      over the crop or area of application.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In a preferred embodiment, only water is added to the
      exhaust gases to form the condensate solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The combustion device may comprise an internal combustion
      engine, however other devices known to consume fossil fuels to
      produce products of combustion may be useful in certain instances.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The distribution system in a first embodiment comprises
      plant care equipment, for example a self-propelled tractor or
      mower, such that the combustion device comprises an engine driving
      the plant care equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Alternatively, the distribution system comprises a crop
      irrigation system, wherein the collector is coupled to communicate
      with an inlet of an irrigation pump for dispensing the condensate
      solution into irrigation water passing through the irrigation
      pump. The combustion device in this instance would comprise a
      motor driving the irrigation pump.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The water injector may be coupled to an outlet of the
      irrigation pump whereby the water injected into the exhaust
      chamber comprises a portion of the water pumped by the irrigation
      pump.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The condensing chamber may include a condenser core which
      is cooled by irrigation water passing therethrough or other heat
      exchanger equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] There may be provided a shut-off valve coupled in series
      between the collector and the distribution system which is
      arranged to be open only when the distribution system is
      operating.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The water injector may include a float valve coupled in
      series therewith, the float valve being supported in the
      condensing chamber such that the water injector is arranged to
      inject water into the exhaust chamber in response to a level of
      condensate in the condensing chamber falling below a prescribed
      level of condensate.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] There may be provided a catalytic converter coupled to an
      inlet of the exhaust chamber for receiving the exhaust gases
      therethrough prior to the exhaust chamber. The type of catalyst
      depends on type of fuel used or desired oxidation.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] There may be provided an air pump for injecting air into
      the exhaust gases near the water injector to assist in converting
      harmful emissions to more desirable compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] There may be provided high voltage arc means for generating
      an electric arc in a passage through which the exhaust gases pass
      also to assist in converting harmful emissions to more desirable
      compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] There may be provided an electrical field generator
      surrounding a passage through which the exhaust gases pass or a
      portion of water from the injector may be diverted to an
      electrolysis device before injection into the exhaust gases for
      injecting hydrogen and oxygen into the exhaust gases to further
      promote conversion of harmful emissions to more desirable
      compounds.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0039] Referring to the accompanying drawings, there is
      illustrated a fertilizer system generally indicated by reference
      numeral 10. The system is particularly suited for as an extraction
      system for nitrogen compounds and other plant nutrients from
      combustion exhaust gases. The phrase "nitrogen compounds" is
      understood in this specification to include any nitrogen related
      compounds including nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrite (NO2), nitrate
      (NO3), ammonium (NH4) and other aqueous or non-aqueous compounds
      containing nitrogen which may be known to have benefits for
      fertilizing plants. Other nutrients extracted are sulphur,
      phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, iron, copper and carbon dioxide as a
      carbonic acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The system 10 includes a pump 14 for pumping water from a
      source 16 of water used for distributing water to crops and
      plants. The pump is driven by a motor 18 which typically comprises
      an internal combustion engine consuming commonly available fossil
      fuels, for example gasoline, natural gas, propane or diesel fuel
      and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] While various embodiments are described and illustrated
      herein, the common features of each will first be described
      herein. The pump 14 includes an inlet 20 and an outlet 22. The
      inlet is coupled to a suction line 24 in communication with the
      water source 16 while the outlet communicates with an outlet
      pressure line 26 which directs the water to a distribution system
      for an area to be irrigated or watered.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The fertilizer system 10 includes an exhaust chamber 28
      which is similar in construction to a conventional automotive
      muffler in the illustrated embodiment. The exhaust chamber is a
      sealed chamber having an inlet opening 30 at a top end and an
      outlet opening 32 at a bottom end thereof. An inlet pipe 34
      connects the inlet at the top of the exhaust chamber 28 in
      communication with the exhaust of the motor 18 of the irrigation
      system. The inlet pipe 34 includes a downwardly extending portion
      36 which extends downwardly into the exhaust chamber 28 after an
      elbow 38 redirecting the inlet pipe from the motor. The exhaust
      chamber further includes internal baffles 40 which redirect the
      exhaust passing therethrough from the inlet pipe 34 to an outlet
      pipe 42 which is axially misaligned with the inlet pipe. As in a
      conventional automotive muffler the exhaust must pass through
      various baffles 40 and possibly through perforations in the
      respective inlet and outlet pipes in order to navigate through the
      exhaust chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] A catalytic converter 44 is coupled in series with the
      inlet pipe between the motor 18 and the exhaust chamber 28 so that
      exhaust gases pass through the catalytic converter prior to
      entering the exhaust chamber. The catalytic converter acts as a
      catalyst for the hot exhaust gases from the motor to react some of
      the compounds within the exhaust gases. The catalytic converter
      may be removed depending upon the desirable nitrogen compounds
      which are to be extracted and depending upon the particular
      application, the type of motor 18 and the type of fuel being
      consumed.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] A water injector 46 is provided for injecting water into
      the hot exhaust gases as it enters the exhaust chamber 28. The
      water injector is coupled to the downwardly extending portion 36
      of the inlet pipe to prevent backflow of injected water to the
      motor 18 of the pump. The water is sprayed into the exhaust
      chamber for mixing with the hot exhaust gases to be converted to
      steam before exiting through the outlet pipe. The water injector
      46 receives water from the outlet pressure line 26 to which it is
      coupled so as to receive pressurized water from the pump outlet to
      be injected into the exhaust chamber by an injector line 64.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The outlet pipe of the exhaust chamber 28 feeds into a
      condensing chamber 48 where the mixture of water vapor or steam
      and hot exhaust gases form condensate in the form of water
      enriched with nitrogen compounds and other plant nutrients. The
      condensing chamber 48 generally comprises a barrel or drum having
      an inlet pipe 50 extending downwardly into the barrel at a top end
      thereof to which the outlet pipe of the exhaust chamber is
      coupled. The condensing chamber further includes an exhaust
      opening 52 at the top end thereof. A condenser core 54 is provided
      within the condensing chamber which spans the walls of the chamber
      between the open end of the inlet pipe 50 and the exhaust opening
      52. The condenser core includes passages therethrough for
      circulating a cooling fluid to assist in the condensation process.
      In the illustrated embodiment the cooling fluid comprises water
      which is circulated from the outlet pressure line 26.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] A collector line 56 couples to a drain 58 at a bottom end
      of the condensing chamber. The collector line 56 is coupled at an
      opposite end to the suction line 24 adjacent the inlet of the pump
      14 so that condensate collected from the condensing chamber by the
      collector line 56 is drawn into the inlet of the pump with the
      irrigation water from the source 16 to be subsequently distributed
      by the outlet pressure line to a distribution system.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] A shut-off valve 60 is coupled in series with the collector
      line 56 between the condensing chamber 48 and the suction line 24
      to selectively interrupt flow of condensate through the collector
      line. The shut-off valve 60 includes a suitable controller for
      opening the valve 60 only when the pump motor 18 is operating so
      that the shut-off valve 60 is closed when the motor is not in
      operation to prevent leakage of condensate into the suction line.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] A float valve 62 is supported within the condensing chamber
      48 and is coupled in series with the injector line 64 coupling the
      water injector to the irrigation pressure line. The float valve is
      arranged to be opened only when a level of condensate within the
      condensing chamber falls below a prescribed level so that in the
      instance when the level falls below the prescribed level, the
      water injector 46 injects water to raise the condensate level.
      Once sufficient condensate collects within the condenser above the
      prescribed level, the float valve 62 closes to prevent further
      water being injected into the exhaust chamber. The float valve 62
      ensures that condensate level remains above the drain 58 and
      corresponding collector line 56 to prevent air from being drawn
      into the suction line of the pump.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The fertilizer system 10 is first started by operating the
      pump 14 using the pump motor 18. The motor draws in intake air
      from the surrounding air which is approximately 78% nitrogen in
      the form N2. The high heat of combustion in combination with the
      compression and ignition within the engine converts the nitrogen
      to useable forms of nitrogen compounds, for example nitrous oxides
      (NOx). The hot exhaust gases exit the motor and pass into the
      exhaust chamber 28 at which point the water injector 46 sprays
      water into the hot stream of exhaust gases entering downwardly
      into the exhaust chamber to form steam in the exhaust chamber
      which absorbs and collects nitrogen compounds and other plant
      nutrients from the hot exhaust gases forming various nitrogen
      compounds in solution with the water vapor. The condensate which
      then forms in the condensing chamber 48 includes such compounds as
      NO2, NO3, NH4, sulphur, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, iron, copper
      and carbon dioxide as a carbonic acid. As noted above the water
      level within the condensing chamber is controlled by the float
      valve to inject water from the outlet pressure line as required to
      maintain condensate level above the prescribed level. As long as
      the motor of the pump remains in operation, the shut-off valve 60
      remains open so that condensate from the condensing chamber is
      sucked through the collector line 56 into the suction line 24 of
      the pump to subsequently fertilize an area, upon which the
      enriched water is dispersed, with nitrogen compounds and plant
      nutrients carried by the water. By passing the exhaust through the
      additional catalytic converter before entering the exhaust
      chamber, the type or quantity of desirable nitrogen compounds can
      be increased in the condensate which later forms as different
      types of exhaust gases are converted as required depending upon
      the type of combustion device and the type of fuel being
      combusted.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The system 10 is particularly useful in combination with or
      as a retrofit kit for conversion of an agricultural irrigation
      system 12 or self propelled equipment 100 to enrich water to be
      fed to the plant material in association therewith while reducing
      harmful emissions of the engine/motor 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] When used in an irrigation system 12, as illustrated in
      FIG. 1, the engine 18 comprises an existing engine of the
      irrigation system used to drive the existing pump 14 of the
      irrigation system for pumping water from a source in the form of
      irrigation water collected for a crop or plants to be irrigated.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] When used on self propelled equipment 100, as illustrated
      in FIG. 3, the engine 18 comprises an existing engine of the
      equipment for propelling or driving the equipment, for example a
      sprayer or mower engine, which is supported on wheels 101 for
      rolling movement along the ground. The source 16 of water in this
      instance comprises a portable tank carried by the equipment or
      towed by the equipment on a trailer. The destination of the
      enriched water is a sprayer type distribution system also carried
      by the equipment 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Turning now to FIG. 3 in greater detail, additional control
      systems may be included for co-operation with the components noted
      above with regard to common features of both embodiments. To
      improve efficiency of the water scrubbing by injector 46, the
      injector 46 may include a plurality of nozzles 102 at plural
      spaced positions along the exhaust passage between the engine and
      the exhaust chamber. The plurality of nozzles serve to inject
      water at plural spaced positions more evenly and more gradually to
      ensure more thorough mixing of the products of combustion with the
      water vapour produced by the heat of the exhaust. Part of the
      water provided to the injector 46 may also be directed to an
      electrolysis device 104 which produced hydrogen and oxygen by
      electrolysis for injection into the exhaust with the water to
      further aid in the conversion process of nitrous oxides to useful
      nitrite and nitrate compounds. A set of high voltage electrodes
      106 can also be positioned within the exhaust passage extending
      between the engine and the exhaust chamber to produce to a corona
      or high voltage arc between the electrodes which provides energy
      to assist in desirable chemical reactions taking place to promote
      more favourable products of combustion. An electrical field
      generator may also be provided which surrounds the exhaust
      passage. Additional air to assist in the conversion of various
      nitrous oxide compounds to desirable nitrite, nitrate and ammonia
      is provided by an air pump 108 also driven by the engine 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] To provide more precise control of the fluid levels within
      the condenser chamber, the condenser chamber may include an
      auxiliary chamber 110 or may simply be enlarged to house further
      controls therein. The auxiliary chamber 110 is coupled to the
      condensate chamber so that levels of condensate are maintained at
      the same level within each. The float valve 62 can thus be mounted
      in either chamber in communication with the condensate for similar
      operation of water passing through the injector line 64 to the
      injector 46 when condensate levels fall below a prescribed level.
      An additional float valve 112 is provided in the auxiliary chamber
      110 in series with the collector line 56 where the collector line
      couples to the drain 58 of the condensate chamber to permit
      condensate to be dispensed into the collector line only when the
      float valve 112 is opened as a result of condensate levels within
      the condensate and auxiliary chambers being above a prescribed
      level. This configuration ensures that in the event of a lack of
      condensate for whatever reason, the collector line will not draw
      air into the pump if the pump is permitted to continue operating
      by the engine 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The system 10 operates on the equipment 100 in a similar
      manner of operation as the irrigation system by drawing water from
      a tank carried on the equipment through the pump to a distribution
      system of the equipment which may comprise sprayer nozzles and the
      like for dispensing the water onto a field or planted area. The
      pump is driven by an existing engine 18 of the equipment, for
      example the engine driving the mower blades or propelling a mower
      or sprayer for movement across the ground. Water is re-circulated
      and mixed with the exhaust gases in the manner described above so
      that desirable nutrients in the form of nitrite, nitrate and
      ammonium, sulphur, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, iron, copper and
      carbon dioxide as a carbonic acid are dispensed to the planted
      area while harmful emissions in the exhaust gases are reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In an irrigation system the source of water may comprise a
      lagoon or the like which feeds water through the system as
      described above for subsequently being dispersed to the irrigation
      area. The engine 18 in this instance preferably comprises an
      existing engine driving the irrigation pump of the irrigation
      system. In either instance the fertilizer system is preferably
      operated to run continuously while the engine is running with all
      of the condensate being fully diverted into the water to be
      dispersed over the planted area. Only water is preferably added,
      with air being optionally added to the existing products of
      combustion of the internal combustion engine 18 to provide a
      system which is simple to operate which obtains benefits from
      otherwise harmful and useless products of combustion.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Further benefits of the use of water injected into an
      exhaust chamber as described above include the pre-heating of
      irrigation water and control of emission gases from the combustion
      device. The addition of water to the exhaust gases is beneficial
      to the environment because the interaction of water with the hot
      exhaust gases causes some undesirable emissions to be converted to
      less harmful compounds that are less damaging to the environment
      and because the system requires no additional energy consumption
      other than the use of equipment which would otherwise already be
      in operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] When the water injected into the exhaust chamber comprises
      irrigation water which is returned to the irrigation pump, the
      exhaust chamber acts as a heat exchanger to recover waste heat
      from the exhaust gases to preheat the irrigation water. Preheating
      the irrigation water is of benefit so that cold source water, for
      example from a river, provides less thermal shock to irrigated
      plants which would normally be warmer than the source water.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] While some embodiments of the present invention have been
      described in the foregoing, it is to be understood that other
      embodiments are possible within the scope of the invention. The
      invention is to be considered limited solely by the scope of the
      appended claims.<br>
