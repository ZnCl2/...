      An amplituhedron is a geometric structure that enables simplified
      calculation of particle interactions in some quantum field
      theories. In planar N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory, an
      amplituhedron is defined as a mathematical space known as the
      Positive Grassmannian.[1]<br>
      <br>
      Amplituhedron theory challenges the notion that space-time
      locality and unitarity are necessary components of a model of
      particle interactions. Instead, they are treated as properties
      that emerge from an underlying phenomenon.[2][3]<br>
      <br>
      The connection between the amplituhedron and scattering amplitudes
      is at present a conjecture that has passed many non-trivial
      checks, including an understanding of how locality and unitarity
      arise as consequences of positivity.[1]<br>
      <br>
      Research has been led by Nima Arkani-Hamed. Edward Witten
      described the work as “very unexpected" and said that "it is
      difficult to guess what will happen or what the lessons will turn
      out to be."[4]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      In the approach, the on-shell scattering process "tree" is
      described by a positive Grassmannian, a structure in algebraic
      geometry analogous to a convex polytope, that generalizes the idea
      of a simplex in projective space.[2] A polytope is a kind of
      higher dimensional polyhedron, and the values being calculated are
      scattering amplitudes, and so the object is called an
      amplituhedron.[5][1]<br>
      <br>
      Using Twistor theory, BCFW recursion relations involved in the
      scattering process may be represented as a small number of Twistor
      diagrams. These diagrams effectively provide the recipe for
      constructing the positive Grassmannian, i.e. the amplituhedron,
      which may be captured in a single equation.[2] The scattering
      amplitude can thus be thought of as the volume of a certain
      polytope, the positive Grassmannian, in momentum twistor space.[1]<br>
      <br>
      When the volume of the amplituhedron is calculated in the planar
      limit of N = 4 D = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory, it
      describes the scattering amplitudes of subatomic particles.[5] The
      amplituhedron thus provides a more intuitive geometric model for
      calculations whose underlying principles were until then highly
      abstract.[6]<br>
      <br>
      The twistor-based representation provides a recipe for
      constructing specific cells in the Grassmannian which assemble to
      form a positive Grassmannian, i.e. the representation describes a
      specific cell decomposition of the positive Grassmannian.<br>
      <br>
      The recursion relations can be resolved in many different ways,
      each giving rise to a different representation, with the final
      amplitude expressed as a sum of on-shell processes in different
      ways as well. Therefore any given on-shell representation of
      scattering amplitudes is not unique, but all such representations
      of a given interaction yield the same amplituhedron.[1]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Implications</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      The twistor approach simplifies calculations of particle
      interactions. In a perturbative approach to quantum field theory,
      such interactions may require the calculation of hundreds of
      Feynman diagrams. In contrast, twistor theory provides an approach
      in which scattering amplitudes can be computed in a way that
      yields much simpler expressions.[7]<br>
      <br>
      The twistor approach was relatively abstract. The amplituhedron
      provides an underlying model. Its geometric nature suggests the
      possibility that the nature of the universe, both classical
      relativistic spacetime and quantum mechanics, can be described
      with geometry. Calculations can be done without assuming the
      quantum mechanical properties of locality and unitarity. In
      amplituhedron theory, locality and unitarity arise as a direct
      consequence of positivity. They are encoded in the positive
      geometry of the amplituhedron, via the singularity structure of
      the integrand for scattering amplitudes.[1]<br>
      <br>
      Since the planar limit of the N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills
      theory is a toy theory that does not describe the real world, the
      relevance of this technique for more realistic quantum field
      theories is currently unknown, but it provides promising
      directions for research into theories about the real world.<br>

      <b> </b>Perturbative scattering amplitudes in gauge theories have
      remarkable simplicity and hidden infinite dimensional symmetries
      that are completely obscured in the conventional formulation of
      field theory using Feynman diagrams. This suggests the existence
      of a new understanding for scattering amplitudes where locality
      and unitarity do not play a central role but are derived
      consequences from a different starting point. In this note we
      provide such an understanding for N=4 SYM scattering amplitudes in
      the planar limit, which we identify as ``the volume" of a new
      mathematical object--the Amplituhedron--generalizing the positive
      Grassmannian. Locality and unitarity emerge hand-in-hand from
      positive geometry. <br>

      </i><i> Artist’s rendering of the amplituhedron, a newly
        discovered mathematical object resembling a multifaceted jewel
        in higher dimensions. Encoded in its volume are the most basic
        features of reality that can be calculated — the probabilities
        of outcomes of particle interactions.</i> <i>Illustration by

      </i><i> </i><i> </i><br>
      Physicists have discovered a jewel-like geometric object that
      dramatically simplifies calculations of particle interactions and
      challenges the notion that space and time are fundamental
      components of reality.<br>
      <br>
      “This is completely new and very much simpler than anything that
      has been done before,” said Andrew Hodges, a mathematical
      physicist at Oxford University who has been following the work.<br>
      <br>
      The revelation that particle interactions, the most basic events
      in nature, may be consequences of geometry significantly advances
      a decades-long effort to reformulate quantum field theory, the
      body of laws describing elementary particles and their
      interactions. Interactions that were previously calculated with
      mathematical formulas thousands of terms long can now be described
      by computing the volume of the corresponding jewel-like
      “amplituhedron,” which yields an equivalent one-term expression.<br>
      <br>
      “The degree of efficiency is mind-boggling,” said Jacob Bourjaily,
      a theoretical physicist at Harvard University and one of the
      researchers who developed the new idea. “You can easily do, on
      paper, computations that were infeasible even with a computer
      before.”<br>
      <br>
      The new geometric version of quantum field theory could also
      facilitate the search for a theory of quantum gravity that would
      seamlessly connect the large- and small-scale pictures of the
      universe. Attempts thus far to incorporate gravity into the laws
      of physics at the quantum scale have run up against nonsensical
      infinities and deep paradoxes. The amplituhedron, or a similar
      geometric object, could help by removing two deeply rooted
      principles of physics: locality and unitarity.<br>
      <br>
      “Both are hard-wired in the usual way we think about things,” said
      Nima Arkani-Hamed, a professor of physics at the Institute for
      Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., and the lead author of the new
      work, which he is presenting in talks and in a forthcoming paper.
      “Both are suspect.”<br>
      <br>
      Locality is the notion that particles can interact only from
      adjoining positions in space and time. And unitarity holds that
      the probabilities of all possible outcomes of a quantum mechanical
      interaction must add up to one. The concepts are the central
      pillars of quantum field theory in its original form, but in
      certain situations involving gravity, both break down, suggesting
      neither is a fundamental aspect of nature.<br>
      <br>
      In keeping with this idea, the new geometric approach to particle
      interactions removes locality and unitarity from its starting
      assumptions. The amplituhedron is not built out of space-time and
      probabilities; these properties merely arise as consequences of
      the jewel’s geometry. The usual picture of space and time, and
      particles moving around in them, is a construct.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s a better formulation that makes you think about everything
      in a completely different way,” said David Skinner, a theoretical
      physicist at Cambridge University.<br>
      <br>
      The amplituhedron itself does not describe gravity. But
      Arkani-Hamed and his collaborators think there might be a related
      geometric object that does. Its properties would make it clear why
      particles appear to exist, and why they appear to move in three
      dimensions of space and to change over time.<br>
      <br>
      Because “we know that ultimately, we need to find a theory that
      doesn’t have” unitarity and locality, Bourjaily said, “it’s a
      starting point to ultimately describing a quantum theory of
      gravity.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Clunky Machinery</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      The amplituhedron looks like an intricate, multifaceted jewel in
      higher dimensions. Encoded in its volume are the most basic
      features of reality that can be calculated, “scattering
      amplitudes,” which represent the likelihood that a certain set of
      particles will turn into certain other particles upon colliding.
      These numbers are what particle physicists calculate and test to
      high precision at particle accelerators like the Large Hadron
      Collider in Switzerland.<br>
      <br>
      The iconic 20th century physicist Richard Feynman invented a
      method for calculating probabilities of particle interactions
      using depictions of all the different ways an interaction could
      occur. Examples of “Feynman diagrams” were included on a 2005
      postage stamp honoring Feynman.<br>
      <br>
      The 60-year-old method for calculating scattering amplitudes — a
      major innovation at the time — was pioneered by the Nobel
      Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. He sketched line drawings
      of all the ways a scattering process could occur and then summed
      the likelihoods of the different drawings. The simplest Feynman
      diagrams look like trees: The particles involved in a collision
      come together like roots, and the particles that result shoot out
      like branches. More complicated diagrams have loops, where
      colliding particles turn into unobservable “virtual particles”
      that interact with each other before branching out as real final
      products. There are diagrams with one loop, two loops, three loops
      and so on — increasingly baroque iterations of the scattering
      process that contribute progressively less to its total amplitude.
      Virtual particles are never observed in nature, but they were
      considered mathematically necessary for unitarity — the
      requirement that probabilities sum to one.<br>
      <br>
      “The number of Feynman diagrams is so explosively large that even
      computations of really simple processes weren’t done until the age
      of computers,” Bourjaily said. A seemingly simple event, such as
      two subatomic particles called gluons colliding to produce four
      less energetic gluons (which happens billions of times a second
      during collisions at the Large Hadron Collider), involves 220
      diagrams, which collectively contribute thousands of terms to the
      calculation of the scattering amplitude.<br>
      <br>
      In 1986, it became apparent that Feynman’s apparatus was a Rube
      Goldberg machine.<br>
      <br>
      To prepare for the construction of the Superconducting Super
      Collider in Texas (a project that was later canceled), theorists
      wanted to calculate the scattering amplitudes of known particle
      interactions to establish a background against which interesting
      or exotic signals would stand out. But even 2-gluon to 4-gluon
      processes were so complex, a group of physicists had written two
      years earlier, “that they may not be evaluated in the foreseeable
      future.”<br>
      <br>
      Stephen Parke and Tomasz Taylor, theorists at Fermi National
      Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, took that statement as a
      challenge. Using a few mathematical tricks, they managed to
      simplify the 2-gluon to 4-gluon amplitude calculation from several
      billion terms to a 9-page-long formula, which a 1980s
      supercomputer could handle. Then, based on a pattern they observed
      in the scattering amplitudes of other gluon interactions, Parke
      and Taylor guessed a simple one-term expression for the amplitude.
      It was, the computer verified, equivalent to the 9-page formula.
      In other words, the traditional machinery of quantum field theory,
      involving hundreds of Feynman diagrams worth thousands of
      mathematical terms, was obfuscating something much simpler. As
      Bourjaily put it: “Why are you summing up millions of things when
      the answer is just one function?”<br>
      <br>
      “We knew at the time that we had an important result,” Parke said.
      “We knew it instantly. But what to do with it?”<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Amplituhedron</b><br>
      <br>
      The message of Parke and Taylor’s single-term result took decades
      to interpret. “That one-term, beautiful little function was like a
      beacon for the next 30 years,” Bourjaily said. It “really started
      this revolution.”<br>
      Twistor diagrams depicting an interaction between six gluons, in
      the cases where two (left) and four (right) of the particles have
      negative helicity, a property similar to spin. The diagrams can be
      used to derive a simple formula for the 6-gluon scattering
      amplitude.<br>

      <br>
      In the mid-2000s, more patterns emerged in the scattering
      amplitudes of particle interactions, repeatedly hinting at an
      underlying, coherent mathematical structure behind quantum field
      theory. Most important was a set of formulas called the BCFW
      recursion relations, named for Ruth Britto, Freddy Cachazo, Bo
      Feng and Edward Witten. Instead of describing scattering processes
      in terms of familiar variables like position and time and
      depicting them in thousands of Feynman diagrams, the BCFW
      relations are best couched in terms of strange variables called
      “twistors,” and particle interactions can be captured in a handful
      of associated twistor diagrams. The relations gained rapid
      adoption as tools for computing scattering amplitudes relevant to
      experiments, such as collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. But
      their simplicity was mysterious.<br>
      <br>
      “The terms in these BCFW relations were coming from a different
      world, and we wanted to understand what that world was,”
      Arkani-Hamed said. “That’s what drew me into the subject five
      years ago.”<br>
      <br>
      With the help of leading mathematicians such as Pierre Deligne,
      Arkani-Hamed and his collaborators discovered that the recursion
      relations and associated twistor diagrams corresponded to a
      well-known geometric object. In fact, as detailed in a paper
      posted to arXiv.org in December by Arkani-Hamed, Bourjaily,
      Cachazo, Alexander Goncharov, Alexander Postnikov and Jaroslav
      Trnka, the twistor diagrams gave instructions for calculating the
      volume of pieces of this object, called the positive Grassmannian.<br>
      <br>
      Named for Hermann Grassmann, a 19th-century German linguist and
      mathematician who studied its properties, “the positive
      Grassmannian is the slightly more grown-up cousin of the inside of
      a triangle,” Arkani-Hamed explained. Just as the inside of a
      triangle is a region in a two-dimensional space bounded by
      intersecting lines, the simplest case of the positive Grassmannian
      is a region in an N-dimensional space bounded by intersecting
      planes. (N is the number of particles involved in a scattering
      process.)<br>

      It was a geometric representation of real particle data, such as
      the likelihood that two colliding gluons will turn into four
      gluons. But something was still missing.<br>
      <br>
      The physicists hoped that the amplitude of a scattering process
      would emerge purely and inevitably from geometry, but locality and
      unitarity were dictating which pieces of the positive Grassmannian
      to add together to get it. They wondered whether the amplitude was
      “the answer to some particular mathematical question,” said Trnka,
      a post-doctoral researcher at the California Institute of
      Technology. “And it is,” he said.<br>

      Arkani-Hamed and Trnka discovered that the scattering amplitude
      equals the volume of a brand-new mathematical object — the
      amplituhedron. The details of a particular scattering process
      dictate the dimensionality and facets of the corresponding
      amplituhedron. The pieces of the positive Grassmannian that were
      being calculated with twistor diagrams and then added together by
      hand were building blocks that fit together inside this jewel,
      just as triangles fit together to form a polygon.<br>
      <br>
      Like the twistor diagrams, the Feynman diagrams are another way of
      computing the volume of the amplituhedron piece by piece, but they
      are much less efficient. “They are local and unitary in
      space-time, but they are not necessarily very convenient or
      well-adapted to the shape of this jewel itself,” Skinner said.
      “Using Feynman diagrams is like taking a Ming vase and smashing it
      on the floor.”<br>
      <br>
      Arkani-Hamed and Trnka have been able to calculate the volume of
      the amplituhedron directly in some cases, without using twistor
      diagrams to compute the volumes of its pieces. They have also
      found a “master amplituhedron” with an infinite number of facets,
      analogous to a circle in 2-D, which has an infinite number of
      sides. Its volume represents, in theory, the total amplitude of
      all physical processes. Lower-dimensional amplituhedra, which
      correspond to interactions between finite numbers of particles,
      live on the faces of this master structure.<br>
      <br>
      “They are very powerful calculational techniques, but they are
      also incredibly suggestive,” Skinner said. “They suggest that
      thinking in terms of space-time was not the right way of going
      about this.”<br>

      <b>Quest for Quantum Gravity</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      The seemingly irreconcilable conflict between gravity and quantum
      field theory enters crisis mode in black holes. Black holes pack a
      huge amount of mass into an extremely small space, making gravity
      a major player at the quantum scale, where it can usually be
      ignored. Inevitably, either locality or unitarity is the source of
      the conflict.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Puzzling Thoughts</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      Locality and unitarity are the central pillars of quantum field
      theory, but as the following thought experiments show, both break
      down in certain situations involving gravity. This suggests
      physics should be formulated without either principle.<br>
      <br>
      Locality says that particles interact at points in space-time. But
      suppose you want to inspect space-time very closely. Probing
      smaller and smaller distance scales requires ever higher energies,
      but at a certain scale, called the Planck length, the picture gets
      blurry: So much energy must be concentrated into such a small
      region that the energy collapses the region into a black hole,
      making it impossible to inspect. “There’s no way of measuring
      space and time separations once they are smaller than the Planck
      length,” said Arkani-Hamed. “So we imagine space-time is a
      continuous thing, but because it’s impossible to talk sharply
      about that thing, then that suggests it must not be fundamental —
      it must be emergent.”<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unitarity says the quantum mechanical
      probabilities of all possible outcomes of a particle interaction
      must sum to one. To prove it, one would have to observe the same
      interaction over and over and count the frequencies of the
      different outcomes. Doing this to perfect accuracy would require
      an infinite number of observations using an infinitely large
      measuring apparatus, but the latter would again cause
      gravitational collapse into a black hole. In finite regions of the
      universe, unitarity can therefore only be approximately known.<br>
      <br>
      “We have indications that both ideas have got to go,” Arkani-Hamed
      said. “They can’t be fundamental features of the next
      description,” such as a theory of quantum gravity.<br>
      <br>
      String theory, a framework that treats particles as invisibly
      small, vibrating strings, is one candidate for a theory of quantum
      gravity that seems to hold up in black hole situations, but its
      relationship to reality is unproven — or at least confusing.
      Recently, a strange duality has been found between string theory
      and quantum field theory, indicating that the former (which
      includes gravity) is mathematically equivalent to the latter
      (which does not) when the two theories describe the same event as
      if it is taking place in different numbers of dimensions. No one
      knows quite what to make of this discovery. But the new
      amplituhedron research suggests space-time, and therefore
      dimensions, may be illusory anyway.<br>
      <br>
      “We can’t rely on the usual familiar quantum mechanical space-time
      pictures of describing physics,” Arkani-Hamed said. “We have to
      learn new ways of talking about it. This work is a baby step in
      that direction.”<br>
      <br>
      Even without unitarity and locality, the amplituhedron formulation
      of quantum field theory does not yet incorporate gravity. But
      researchers are working on it. They say scattering processes that
      include gravity particles may be possible to describe with the
      amplituhedron, or with a similar geometric object. “It might be
      closely related but slightly different and harder to find,”
      Skinner said.<br>

          Technology.</i><br>

      Physicists must also prove that the new geometric formulation
      applies to the exact particles that are known to exist in the
      universe, rather than to the idealized quantum field theory they
      used to develop it, called maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills
      theory. This model, which includes a “superpartner” particle for
      every known particle and treats space-time as flat, “just happens
      to be the simplest test case for these new tools,” Bourjaily said.
      “The way to generalize these new tools to [other] theories is
      understood.”<br>
      <br>
      Beyond making calculations easier or possibly leading the way to
      quantum gravity, the discovery of the amplituhedron could cause an
      even more profound shift, Arkani-Hamed said. That is, giving up
      space and time as fundamental constituents of nature and figuring
      out how the Big Bang and cosmological evolution of the universe
      arose out of pure geometry.<br>
      <br>
      “In a sense, we would see that change arises from the structure of
      the object,” he said. “But it’s not from the object changing. The
      object is basically timeless.”<br>
      <br>
      While more work is needed, many theoretical physicists are paying
      close attention to the new ideas.<br>
      <br>
      The work is “very unexpected from several points of view,” said
      Witten, a theoretical physicist at the Institute for Advanced
      Study. “The field is still developing very fast, and it is
      difficult to guess what will happen or what the lessons will turn
      out to be.”<br>
