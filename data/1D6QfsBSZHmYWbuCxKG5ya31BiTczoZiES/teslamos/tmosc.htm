          <span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB">"Nikola Tesla is 79
            years old, and he is one of the true geniuses of this time.
            Nevertheless, twenty-odd newspapermen came away from his
            Hotel New Yorker birthday party yesterday, which lasted six
            hours, feeling hesitantly that something was wrong either
            with the old man's mind or else with their own, for Dr.
            Tesla, serene in an old-fashioned Prince Albert and courtly
            in a way that seems to have gone out of this world,
            announced that: -<o:p></o:p></span><br>
          <span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB"></span><br>
          <span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB">1. He had discovered
            the so-called cosmic ray in 1896, at least five years before
            any other scientist took it up and twenty years before it
            became popular among scientists, and he is now convinced
            that many of the cosmic particles travel fifty times faster
            than light, some of them 500 times faster.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

          <span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB">2. He has found a way
            to produce a direct electric current by induction and
            without the use of a commutator, which is something the
            experts in electricity have considered impossible for the
            past hundred years.</span><br>
          <span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB"></span><br>
          <span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB">3. He has invented an
            "absolutely impossible" machine which will impart vibrations
            to the earth which, with proper receiving apparatus can be
            picked up anywhere on the earth's surface, and that this
            mysterious machine will allow scientists to explore the deep
            interior of the earth, will enable practical geologists to
            discover gold, coal and petroleum, and at the same time will
            give ships the means of navigating without compass or
            sextant.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

            700 patents to his name. He invented the rotary field motor,
            and is admittedly the seer and father of all modern
            electrical development. As has been his custom for five
            years now, he arranged his own birthday party, drank only
            hot milk as his part of the celebration, and made his
            announcements with the superb certainty of a man who knew
            what he was talking about, even if none of his guests did.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

          <span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB">He said, among other
            things, that he expects to have $100,000,000 within two
            years, and he revealed that an earthquake which drew police
            and ambulances to the region of his laboratory at 48 E.
            Houston St. in 188.7 or 1888 was the result of a little
            machine he was experimenting with at that time which "you
            could put in your overcoat pocket."<o:p></o:p></span><br>

            newspapermen pounced upon this as at least one thing they

            what had happened as follows: -<o:p></o:p></span><br>

          <span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB">"I was experimenting
            with vibrations. I had one of my machines going and I wanted
            to see if I could get it in tune with the vibration of the
            building. I put it up notch after notch. There was a
            peculiar cracking sound.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

            I put the machine up a few more notches. There was a louder
            cracking sound. I knew I was approaching the vibration of
            the steel building. I pushed the machine a little higher.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

          <span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB">"Suddenly all the
            heavy machinery in the place was flying around. I grabbed a
            hammer and broke the machine. The building would have been
            down about our ears in another few minutes. Outside in the
            street there was pandemonium. The police and ambulances
            arrived. I told my assistants to say nothing. We told the
            police it must have been an earthquake. That's all they ever

            the Empire State Building and the doctor replied: - "Five
            pounds of air pressure. If I attached the proper oscillating
            machine on a girder that is all the force I would need, five
            pounds. Vibration will do anything.- It would only be
            necessary to step up the vibrations of the machine to fit
            the natural vibration of the building and the building would
            come crashing down. That's why soldiers always break step

          about describing what his new machine is, although he believes
          it will be "the chief thing of my many inventions posterity
          will thank me for." …</span></div>

      ... His experiments in transmitting mechanical vibrations through
      the earth - called by him the art of telegeodynamics - were
      roughly described by the scientist as a sort of "controlled
      earthquake."<br>
      <br>
      The rhythmical vibrations pass through the earth with almost no
      loss of energy, he said, and predicted the system in time will be
      universally adopted, since it furnishes an "unfailing means of
      communication." He asserted:<br>
      <br>
      "It becomes possible to convey mechanical effects to the greatest
      terrestrial distances and produce all kinds of unique effects of
      inestimable value to science, industry and the arts." ...<br>

      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      ...One of the subjects, which he hoped, he said, will come to be
      recognized as his "greatest achievement in the field of
      engineering," was, he said, the perfection by him of "an apparatus
      by which mechanical energy can be transmitted to any part of the
      terrestrial globe."<br>
      <br>
      This apparatus, he said, will have at least four practical
      possibilities. It will give the world a new means of unfailing
      communication; it will provide a new and by far the safest means
      for guiding ships at sea and into port; it will furnish a certain
      divining rod for locating ore deposits of any kind under the
      surface of the earth; and finally, it will furnish scientists with
      a means for laying bare the physical conditions of the earth, and
      will enable them to determine all of the earth's physical
      constants.<br>
      <br>
      He called this discovery "tele-geodynamics," motion of
      earth-forces at a distance. It is of this, he said, that it would
      "appear almost preposterous." The apparatus, he added, is "ideally
      simple," consisting of a stationary part and a cylinder of fine
      steel "floating" in air. <br>
      <br>
      He has found means, he said, of "impressing upon the floating part
      powerful impulses which react on the stationary part, and through
      the latter to transmit energy through the earth." To do this he
      has "found a new amplifier for a known type of energy," and the
      "purpose is to produce impulses through the earth and then pick
      them up whenever needed."<br>

      <br>
      In order to convey a clear idea of the significance and
      revolutionary character of this discovery it is indispensable to
      make a brief statement regarding ELECTRICAL THERAPY.<br>
      <br>
      Fifty years ago, while investigating high frequency currents
      developed by me at that time, I observed that they produced
      certain physiological effects offering new and great possibilities
      in medical treatment. My first announcement spread like fire and
      experiments were undertaken by a host of experts here and in other
      countries. When a famous French physician, Dr. D'Arsonval,
      declared that he had made the same discovery, a heated controversy
      relative to priority was started. The French, eager to honor their
      countryman, made him a member of the Academy, ignoring entirely my
      earlier publication. Resolved to take steps for vindicating my
      claim, I went to Paris, where I met Dr. D'Arsonval. His personal
      charm disarmed me completely and I abandoned my intention, content
      to rest on the record. It shows that my disclosure antedated his
      and also that he used my apparatus in his demonstrations. The
      final judgment is left to posterity.<br>
      <br>
      Since the beginning, the growth of the new art and industry has
      been phenomenal, some manufacturers turning out daily hundreds of
      sets. Many millions are now in use throughout the world. The
      currents furnished by them have proved an ideal tonic for the
      human nerve system. They promote heart action and digestion,
      induce healthful sleep, rid the skin of destructive exudations and
      cure colds and fever by the warmth they create. They vivify
      atrophied or paralyzed parts of the body, allay all kinds of
      suffering and save annually thousands of lives. Leaders in the
      profession have assured me that I have done more for humanity by
      this medical treatment than by all my other discoveries and
      inventions. Be that as it may, I feel certain that the MECHANICAL
      THERAPY, which I am about to give to the world, will be of
      incomparably greater benefit. Its discovery was made accidentally
      under the following circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      I had installed at the laboratory, 35 South Fifth Avenue, one of
      my mechanical oscillators with the object of using it in the exact
      determination of various physical constants. The machine was
      bolted in vertical position to a platform supported on elastic
      cushions and, when operated by compressed air, performed minute
      oscillations absolutey isochronous, that is to say, consuming
      rigorously equal intervals of time. So perfect was its functioning
      in this respect that clocks driven by it indicated the hour with
      astronomical precision. One day, as I was making some
      observations, I stepped on the platform and the vibrations
      imparted to it by the machine were transmitted to my body. The
      sensation experienced was as strange as agreeable, and I asked my
      assistants to try. They did so and were mystified and pleased like
      myself. But a few minutes later some of us, who had stayed longer
      on the platform, felt an unspeakable and pressing necessity which
      had to be promptly satisfied, and then a stupendous truth dawned
      upon me. <br>
      <br>
      Evidently, these isochronous rapid oscillations stimulated
      powerfully the peristaltic movements which propel the food-stuffs
      through the alimentary channels. A means was thus provided whereby
      their contents can be perfectly regulated and controlled at will,
      and without the use of drugs, specific remedies or internal
      applications whatever.<br>
      <br>
      When I began to practice with my assistants MECHANICAL THERAPY we
      used to finish our meals quickly and rush back to the laboratory.
      We suffered from dyspepsia and various stomach troubles,
      biliousness, constipation, flatulence and other disturbances, all
      natural results of such irregular habit. But after only a week of
      application, during which I improved the technique and my
      assistants learned how to take the treatment to their best
      advantage, all those forms of sickness disappeared as by
      enchantment and for nearly four years, while the machine was in
      use, we were all in excellent health. I cured a number of people;
      among them my great friend Mark Twain whose books saved my life.
      He came to the laboratory in the worst shape suffering from a
      variety of distressing and dangerous ailments but in less than two
      months he regained his old vigor and ability of enjoying life to
      the fullest extent. Shortly after, a great calamity befell me: my
      laboratory was destroyed by fire. Nothing was insured and the loss
      of priceless apparatus and records gave me a terrific shock from
      which I did not recover for several years. The enforced
      discontinuance of MECHANICAL THERAPY also caused me deep regret. I
      had evolved a wonderful remedy for ills of inestimable value to
      mankind and invented apparatus offering unbounded commercial
      possibilities but when I came to consider practical introduction I
      realized that it was entirely unsuitable. It was big, heavy and
      noisy, called for a continuous supply of oil, part of which was
      discharged in the room as fine spray; it consumed considerable
      power and required a number of objectionable accessories. During
      the succeeding years I made great improvements and finally evolved
      a design which leaves nothing to be desired. The machine will be
      very small and light, operate noiselessly without any lubricant,
      consume a trifling amount of energy and will be, to my knowledge,
      the most beautiful device ever put on the market. The intention is
      to exhibit it in action at the occasion of my annual reception in
      honor of the Press which has been, unfortunately, delayed this
      year, and I anticipate that it will elicit great interest and
      receive wide publicity. Unless I am grossly mistaken it will be
      introduced very extensively and, eventually, there will be one in
      every household.<br>
      <br>
      The practical application of MECHANICAL THERAPY through my
      oscillators will profoundly affect human life. By insuring perfect
      regularity of evacuations the body will function better in every
      respect and life will become ever so much safer and more
      enjoyable. One of the most important results will be the great
      reduction — amounting possibly to seventy-five per cent — in the
      number of heart failures, which are mostly caused by some acute
      upset of the digestive process and normal operation of the
      stomach. Another vital improvement will be derived from the
      quickened removal of toxic excretions of organs affected by
      disesse. It is reasonable to expect that through this and other
      healthful actions ulcers and similar internal lesions or absesses
      will be cured and relief might be obtained even in case of a
      cancer or other malignant growth . Skilled physicians and surgeons
      will be able to perform veritable miracles with such oscillations.
      They stimulate strongly the liver, spleen, kidneys, bladder and
      other organs and by these desirable actions they must contribute
      not a little to well being. Persons suffering from anemia of any
      form will be especially helped by the treatment. But the greatest
      benefit will be derived from it by women who will be able to
      reduce without the usual tantalizing abstinence, privation,
      sacrifice of time and money and torture they have to endure. They
      will improve much in appearance, acquire clear eyes and
      complexions and it may be safely predicted that long continued
      treatment will bring forth feminine beauty never seen before. It
      is not to be forgotten that the elimination of countless drugs,
      patent medicines and specific remedies of all kinds taken
      internally, by which millions of people doom themselves to an
      early grave, will be of untold good to humanity.<br>

      <p>"Two important papers, hidden for more than 60 years, are

        teleforce -- the particle-beam weapon, and telegeodynamics --
        the mechanical earth-resonance concept for seismic exploration,
        are fully addressed. In addition to copies of the original
        documents, typed on Tesla's official stationery, this work also
        includes two Reader's Aid sections that guide the reader through
        the more technical aspects of each paper.&nbsp; The papers are
        followed by Commentary sections which provide historical
        background and functional explanations of the two devices.&nbsp;
        Significant newspaper articles and headline accounts are
        provided to document the first mention of these proposals.&nbsp;
        A large Appendix provides a wealth of related material and
        background information, followed by a Bibliography section and

      <p>"This book contains the original texts of two unique proposals
        that Nikola Tesla offered up during his later years.&nbsp; In
        both cases, the technologies described trace their roots back to
        an earlier and tremendously productive decade in Tesla's life
        beginning in the early 1890s.&nbsp; At the time of the
        proposals' unveiling, "teleforce," the particle beam concept,

        distance, including a related new means of communication and a
        method, he claimed, which would facilitate the unerring location
        of underground mineral deposits.&nbsp; At that time he recalled
        the earth-trembling "quake" that brought police and ambulances

      <p>"These are generated by Tele-Geo-Dynamic transmitters which are
        reciprocating engines of extreme simplicity adapted to impress
        isochronous vibrations upon the earth, thereby causing the
        propagation of corresponding rhythmical disturbances through the
        same which are, essentially, sound waves like those conveyed
        through the air and ether. . . . With a machine of this kind it
        will be practicable, in the differentiation of densities and

        as the vacuum tube projects Roentgen shadows on a fluorescent

        shadows which can be detected by acoustic devices or rendered

      <p>"Much of the material presented in this book is related to the
        construction of a class of machine invented by Tesla and known
        as the reciprocating Mechanical Oscillator.&nbsp; Serious
        students of Tesla's work may recognize this machine as the basis
        of his system for producing electrical vibrations of a very
        constant period. In 1898 another variation was used to create a
        small earthquake in the neighborhood surrounding his Houston
        Street lab.&nbsp; Tesla called this method of transmitting
        mechanical energy "telegeodynamics."&nbsp; Included are
        mechanical drawings that will guide you through the construction
        of a working model of the Tele-Geo-Dynamic Oscillator, plus a
        comprehensive description of the machine in Tesla's own words."

      <p>Excerpt from: </p>
      <center><b><i><font size="+1">Prodigal Genius: The Life and Times
              of Nicola Tesla</font></i></b><a name="oneill"></a>

      </center>
      <p><b>Tele-Geo-Dynamics</b> </p>
      <p>Tele-Geo-Dynamics is the transmission of sonic or acoustic
        vibrations, which can be produced with comparatively simple
        apparatus. There is of course much sonic equipment available now
        for different applications, but this has little or nothing to do
        with Nikola Tesla's oscillator-generator. What Tesla proposed
        represents a new technology in sonic transmission even today. </p>
      <p>In Tesla's oscillator-generator, a Resonance effect can be
        observed. Since resonance seems to be an ever increasing effect
        with this oscillator-generator, it can be deduced that there
        must be a great source of energy available through it. </p>
      <p>Why can a resonance be created in the oscillator-generator when
        it cannot in a ordinary reciprocating engine? With the
        oscillator-generator, all governing mechanisms are eliminated.
        On the other hand, consider the car engine. Starting with the
        cylinder, a reciprocating motion is converted into rotary motion
        by a means of shafts, cranks, gears, drivetrains, transmissions,
        etc. </p>
      <p>These parts all consume work by friction, but the greatest loss
        occurs in the change from reciprocating to rotary motion. At
        each point every varying inclination of the crank and pistons
        work at a disadvantage and result in loss of efficiency. </p>
      <p>In Tesla's oscillator-generator, the piston is entirely free to
        move as the medium impels it without having to encounter and
        overcome the inertia of a moving system and in this respect the
        two types of engines differ radically and essentially. </p>
      <p>This type of engine, under the influence of an applied force
        such as the tension of compressed air, steam, or other gases
        under pressure, yields an oscillation of a constant period. </p>
      <p>The objective of the Tesla oscillator-generator is to provide a
        mechanism capable of converting the energy of compressed gas or
        steam into mechanical power. Since the oscillator-generator is
        denuded of all governing devices, friction is almost
        non-existent. In other words, the piston floats freely in air
        and is capable of converting all pressure into mechanical
        energy. </p>
      <p>Our objective in building the engine is to provide an
        oscillator which under the influence of an applied force such as
        the elastic tension of a gas under pressure will yeild an
        oscillating movement which within very wide limits, will be of
        constant period, irrespective of variation of load, frictional
        losses, and other factors which in ordinary engines change in
        the rate of reciprocating. </p>
      <p>It is a well-known priciple that if a spring possessing a
        sensible inertia is brought under tension, i.e., being
        stretched, and then freed, it will perform vibrations which are
        isochronous. As far as the period in general is concerned, it
        will depend on the rigidity of the spring, and its own inertia
        or that of the system of which it may form an immediate part.
        This is known as Simple Harmonic Motion. </p>
      <p>This simple harmonic motion in the form of isochronous sound
        vibrations can be impressed upon the earth, causing the
        propagation of corresponding rhythmical disturbances through the
        same which pass through its remotest boundaries without
        attenuation so that the transmission is affected with an
        efficiency of one hundred percent. </p>

      <p>He attached an oscillator no larger than an alarm clock to a
        steel link 2' long and 2" thick. </p>
      <p>"For a long time nothing happened, but at last the great steel
        link began to tremble, increased its trembling until it dilated
        and contracted like a beating heart, and finally broke.
        Sledgehammers could not have done it", he told a reporter,
        "crowbars could not have done it, but a fusillade of taps, no
        one of which would have harmed a baby, did it." </p>
      <p>Pleased with this beginning, he put the little oscillator in
        his coat pocket. Finding a half-built steel building in the Wall
        Street district, 10 stories high with nothing up but the
        steelwork, he clamped the oscillator to one of the beams. </p>
      <p>"In a few minutes I could feel the beam trembling. Gradually
        the trembling increased in intensity and extended throughout the
        whole great mass of steel. Finally the structure began to creak
        and weave, and the steelworkers came to the ground
        panic-stricken, believing that there had been an earthquake.
        Before anything serious happened, I took off the oscillator, put
        it in my pocket, and went away. But if I had kept on 10 minutes
        more, I could have laid that building flat in the street. And
        with the same oscillator I could drop Brooklyn Bridge in less
        than an hour." </p>

      <p>Sparling, Earl: <i>N. Y. World-Telegram</i> (July 11, 1935),
        "Nikola Tesla, at 79, Uses Earth to Transmit Signals; Expects to
        have $100,000,000 Within Two Years" ~ Here Tesla tells the story
        of the earthquake generated by the mechanical oscillator in his
        NYC laboratory in 1898, which brought the police there to stop
        him. They entered the lab just in time to see Tesla swing a
        slegehammer and smash the tiny device, which was mounted on a
        girder: </p>
      <p>Nikola Tesla revealed that an earthquake which drew police and
        ambulances to the region of his laboratory at 48 E. Houston St.,
        New York, in 1898, was the result of a little machine he was
        experimenting with at the time which "you could put in your
        overcoat pocket." </p>
      <p>The bewildered newspapermen pounced upon this as at least one
        thing they could understand and "the father of modern
        electricity" told what had happened as follows: </p>
      <p>"I was experimenting with vibrations. I had one of my machines
        going and I wanted to see if I could get it in tune with the
        vibration of the building. I put it up notch after notch. There
        was a peculiar cracking sound. </p>
      <p>"I asked my assistants where did the sound come from. They did
        not know. I put the machine up a few more notches. There was a
        louder cracking sound. I knew I was approaching the vibration of
        the steel building. I pushed the machine a little higher.
        "Suddenly all the heavy machinery in the place was flying
        around. I grabbed a hammer and broke the machine. The building
        would have been about our ears in another few minutes. Outside
        in the street there was pandemonium. </p>
      <p>"The police and ambulances arrived. I told my assistants to say
        nothing. We told the police it must have been an earthquake.
        That's all they ever knew about it." </p>
      <p>Some shrewd reporter asked Dr. Tesla at this point what he
        would need to destroy the Empire State Building and the doctor
        replied: "Vibration will do anything. It would only be necessary
        to step up the vibrations of the machine to fit the natural
        vibration of the building and the building would come crashing
        down. That's why soldiers break step crossing a bridge." </p>
      <p>In another interview, he boasted that, "With this principle one
        could split the earth in half like an apple". </p>
      <p><i>Century Magazine</i>, p. 921, Figure 2 (April 1895) ~ In
        1893 Tesla constructed a preferred embodiment of the mechanical
        oscillator which he described as a "double compound mechanical
        and electrical oscillator for generating current of perfect,
        constant, dynamo frequency of 10 horsepower." </p>
      <p>Allan L. Benson: <i>World Today</i> (Feb. 1912); "Nikola
        Tesla, Dreamer" ~ An illustration for the article shows an
        artist's conception of the planet splitting in two. The caption
        reads: "Tesla claims that in a few weeks he could set the
        earth's crust into such a state of vibration that it would rise
        and fall hundreds of feet and practically destroy
        civilization.&nbsp; A continuation of this process would, he
        says, eventually split the earth in two." </p>

          An unusual and little-known device invented by Tesla was the
          Mechanical Oscillator which compressed air until the oxygen
          became a liquid. It was built in the form of an air cylinder
          and contained several chambers, each of which successively
          cools the air until it becomes liquid. Tesla stated that the
          device was highly efficient and could be used as a power
          generating system if magnets were attached to the oscillating
          pistons. Tesla believed that an "oxygen recycle system" was a
          vast improvement to gasoline engines and intended to conduct
          important experiments with LIQUID OXYGEN for new turbine
          engines capable of developing extraordinary power...<br>

        application, my object has been, primarily to provide an engine,
        which under the influence of an applied force such as the
        elastic tension of steam or gas under pressure will yield an
        oscillatory movement which, within very wide limits, will be of
        constant period, irrespective of variations of load, frictional
        losses and other factors which in all ordinary engines produce
        change in the rate of reciprocation. </p>
      <p>The further objects of the invention are to provide a
        mechanism, capable of converting the energy of steam or gas
        under pressure into mechanical power more economically than the
        forms of engine heretofore used, chiefly by overcoming the
        losses which result in these by the combination with rotating
        parts possessing great inertia of a reciprocating system; which
        also, is better adapted for use at higher temperatures and
        pressures, and which is capable of useful and practical
        application to general industrial purposes, particularly in
        small units. </p>
      <p>The invention is based upon certain well known mechanical
        principles a statement of which will assist in a better
        understanding of the nature and purposes of the objects sought
        and results obtained. Heretofore, where the pressure of steam or
        any gas has been utilized and applied for the production of
        mechanical motion it has been customary to connect with the
        reciprocating or moving parts of the engine a fly-wheel or some
        rotary system equivalent in its effect and possessing relatively
        great mechanical inertia, upon which dependence was mainly
        placed for the maintenance of constant speed. This, while
        securing in a measure this object, renders impossible the
        attainment of the result at which I have arrived, and is
        attended by disadvantages which by my invention are entirely
        obviated. On the other hand, in certain cases, where
        reciprocating engines or tools have been used without a rotating
        system of great inertia, no attempt, so far as I know, has been
        made to secure conditions which would necessarily yield such
        results as I have reached. </p>
      <p>It is a well known principle that if a spring possessing a
        sensible inertia be brought under tension, as by being
        stretched, and then freed it will perform vibrations which are
        isochronous and, as to period, in the main dependent upon the
        rigidity of the spring, and its own inertia or that of the
        system of which it may form an immediate part. This is known to
        be true in all cases where the force which tends to bring the
        spring or movable system into a given position is proportionate
        to the displacement. </p>
      <p>In carrying out my invention and for securing the objects in
        general terms stated above, I employ the energy of steam or gas
        under pressure, acting through proper mechanism, to maintain in
        oscillation a piston, and, taking advantage of the law above
        stated, I connect with said piston, or cause to act upon it, a
        spring, under such conditions as to automatically regulate the
        period of the vibration, so that the alternate impulses of the
        power impelled piston, and the natural vibrations of the spring
        shall always correspond in direction and coincide in time. </p>
      <p>While, in the practice of the invention I may employ any kind
        of spring or elastic body of which the law or principle of
        operation above defined holds true, I prefer to use an air
        spring, or generally speaking a confined body or cushion of
        elastic fluid, as the mechanical difficulties in the use of
        metallic springs are serious, owing mainly, to the tendency to
        break. Moreover, instead of permitting the piston to impinge
        directly upon such cushions within its own cylinder, I prefer,
        in order to avoid the influence of the varying pressure of the
        steam or gas that acts upon the piston and which might disturb
        the relations necessary for the maintenance of isochronous
        vibration, and also to better utilize the heat generated by the
        compression, to employ an independent plunder connected with the
        main piston, and a chamber or cylinder therefore, containing air
        which is normally, at the same pressure as the external
        atmosphere, for thus a spring of practically constant rigidity
        is obtained, but the air or gas within the cylinder may be
        maintained at any pressure. </p>
      <p>In order to describe the best manner of which I am aware in
        which the invention is or may be carried into effect, I refer
        now to the accompanying drawing which represents in central
        cross-section an engine embodying my improvements. </p>
      <p>A is the main cylinder in which works a piston B. Inlet ports
        CC pass through the sides of the cylinder, opening at the middle
        portion thereof and on opposite sides. Exhaust ports DD extend
        through the wall of the cylinder and are formed with branches
        that open into the interior of the cylinder on each side of the
        inlet ports and on opposite sides of the cylinder. </p>
      <p>The piston B is formed with two circumferential grooves EF,
        which communicate through openings G in the piston with the
        cylinder on opposite sides of said piston respectively. </p>
      <p>I do not consider as of special importance the particular
        construction and arrangement of the cylinder, the piston and the
        ports for controlling it, except that it is desirable that all
        the ports, and more especially, the exhaust ports should be made
        very much larger than is usually the case, so that no force due
        to the action of the steam or compressed air will tend to retard
        of affect the return of the piston in either direction. </p>
      <p>The piston B is secured to a piston rod H, which works in
        suitable stuffing boxes in the heads of the cylinder A. This rod
        is prolonged on one side and extends through bearings V in a
        cylinder I suitably mounted or supported in line with the first,
        and within which is a disk or plunger J carried by the rod H. </p>
      <p>The cylinder I is without ports of any kind and is air-tight
        except as a small leakage my occur through the bearings V, which
        experience has shown need not be fitted with any very
        considerable accuracy. The cylinder I is surrounded by a jacket
        K which leaves an open space or chamber around it. The bearings
        V in the cylinder I, extend through the jacket K which leaves an
        open space or chamber around it. The bearings V in the cylinder
        I, extend through the jacket K to the outside air and the
        chamber between the cylinder and jacket is made steam or air
        tight as by suitable packing. The main supply line L for steam
        or compressed air leads into this chamber, and the two pipes
        that lead to the cylinder A run from the said chamber, oil cups
        M being conveniently arranged to deliver oil into the said pipes
        for lubricating the piston. </p>
      <p>In the particular form of engine shown the jacket K which
        contains the cylinder I is provided with a flange N by which it
        is screwed to the end of cylinder A. A small channel O is thus
        formed which has air vents P in its sides and drip pipes Q
        leading out from it through which the oil which collects in it
        is carried off. </p>
      <p>To explain now the operation of the device above described. In
        the position of the parts shown, or when the piston is at the
        middle point of its stroke, the plunger J is at the center of
        the cylinder I and the air on both sides of the same is at the
        normal pressure of the outside atmosphere. If a source of steam
        or compressed air be then connected to the inlet ports CC of the
        cylinder A and a movement be imparted to the piston as by a
        sudden blow, the latter is caused to reciprocate in a manner
        well understood. The movement of the piston in either direction
        ceases when the force tending to impel it and the momentum which
        it has acquired are counterbalanced by the increasing pressure
        of the steam or compressed air in that end of the cylinder
        toward which it is moving and as in its movement the piston has
        shut off at a given point, the pressure that impelled it and
        established the pressure that tends to return it, it is then
        impelled in the opposite direction, and this action is continued
        as long as the requisite pressure is applied. The movements of
        the piston compress and rarify the air in the cylinder I at
        opposite ends of the same alternately. A forward stroke
        compresses the air ahead of the plunger J and tends to drive it
        forward. This action of the plunger upon the air contained in
        the opposite ends of the cylinder is exactly the same in
        principle as though a piston rod were connected to the middle
        point of a coiled spring, the ends of which are connected to
        fixed supports. Consequently the two chambers may be considered
        as a single spring. The compressions of the air in the cylinder
        I and the consequent loss of energy due mainly to the imperfect
        elasticity of the air, give rise to a very considerable amount
        of heat. This heat I utilize by conducting the steam or
        compressed air to the engine cylinder through the chamber formed
        by the jacket surrounding the air-spring cylinder. The heat thus
        taken up and used to raise the temperature of the steam or air
        acting upon the piston is availed of to increase the efficiency
        of the engine. In any given engine of this kind the normal
        pressure will produce a stroke of determined length, and this
        will be increased or diminished according to the increase of
        pressure above or the reduction of pressure below the normal. </p>
      <p>In constructing the apparatus I allow for a variation in the
        length of stroke by giving to the confining cylinder I of the
        air spring properly determined dimensions. The greater the
        pressure upon the piston, the higher will be the degree of
        compression of the air-spring, and the consequent counteracting
        force upon the plunger. The rate or period of reciprocation of
        the piston, however, is no more dependent upon the pressure
        applied to drive it, than would be the period of oscillation of
        a pendulum permanently maintained in vibration, upon the force
        which periodically impels it, the effect of variations in such
        force being merely to produce corresponding variations in the
        length of stroke or amplitude of vibration respectively. The
        period is mainly determined by the rigidity of the air spring
        and the inertia of the moving system, and I may therefore secure
        any period of oscillation within very wide limits by properly
        portioning these factors, as by varying the dimensions of the
        air chamber which is equivalent to varying the rigidity of the
        spring, or by adjusting the weight of the moving parts. These
        conditions are all readily determinable, and an engine
        constructed as herein described my be made to follow the
        principle of operation above stated and maintain a perfectly
        uniform period through very much wider limits of pressure than
        in ordinary use it is ever likely to be subjected to, and it may
        be successfully used as a prime mover wherever a constant rate
        of oscillation or speed is required, provided the limits within
        which the forces tending to bring the moving system to a given
        position are proportionate to the displacements, are not
        materially exceeded. The pressure of the air confined in the
        cylinder when the plunger J is in its central position will
        always be practically that of the surrounding atmosphere, for
        while the cylinder is so constructed as not to permit such
        sudden escape of air as to sensibly impair or modify the action
        of the air spring there will be a slow leakage of air into or
        out of it around the piston rod according to the pressure
        therein, so that the pressure of the air on opposite sides of
        the plunger will always tend to remain at that of the outside
        atmosphere. </p>
      <p>As an instance of the uses to which this engine may be applied
        I have shown its piston rod connected with a pawl R the
        oscillation of which drives a train of wheels. These may
        constitute the train of a clock or of any other mechanism. The
        pawl R is pivoted at R’ and its bifurcated end engages with the
        teeth of the ratchet wheel&nbsp; alternately on opposite sides
        of the same, one end of the pawl at each half oscillation acting
        to propel the wheel forward through the space of one tooth when
        it is engaged and locked by the other end on the last half of
        the oscillation which brings the first end of the oscillation
        into position to engage with another tooth. </p>
      <p>Another application of the invention is to move a conductor in
        a magnetic field for generating electric currents, and in these
        and similar uses it is obvious that the characteristics of the
        engine render it especially adapted for use in small sizes or
        units. </p>

      <p>To all whom it may concern: </p>
      <p>Be it known that I, Nikola Tesla, a citizen of the United
        States, residing at New York, in the county and State of New
        York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Steam
        Engines, of which the following is a specification, reference
        being had to the drawing accompanying and forming a part of the
        same. </p>
      <p>Heretofore, engines, operated by the application of a force
        such as the elastic tension of steam or a gas under pressure,
        have been provided with a flywheel, or some rotary system
        equivalent in its effect and possessing relatively great
        mechanical inertia, which was relied upon for maintaining a
        uniform speed. I have produced, however, an engine which without
        such appurtenances produces, under very wide variations of
        pressure, load, and other disturbing causes, an oscillating
        movement of constant period, and have shown and described the
        same in [ US Patent # 514,169 ]. A description of the principle
        of the construction and mode of operation of this device is
        necessary to an understanding of my present invention. When a
        spring which possess a sensible inertia is brought under tension
        as by being stretched and then freed it will perform vibrations
        which are isochronous and, as to period, in the main dependent
        upon the rigidity of the spring, and its own inertia or that of
        the system of which it may form an immediate part. This is known
        to be true in all cases where the force which tends to bring the
        spring or movable system into a given position is proportionate
        to the displacement. In utilizing this principle for the purpose
        of producing reciprocating movement of a constant period, I
        employ the energy of steam or gas under pressure, acting through
        proper mechanism, to maintain in oscillation a piston, and
        connect with it or cause to act upon such piston a spring,
        preferably an air spring, under such conditions as to
        automatically regulate the period of the vibration, so that the
        alternate impulses of the power impelled piston and the natural
        vibrations of the spring shall always correspond in direction
        and coincide in time. In such an apparatus it being essential
        that the inertia of the moving system and the rigidity of the
        spring should bear certain definite relations, it is obvious
        that the practicable amount of work performed by the engine,
        when this involves the overcoming of inertia is a limitation to
        the applicability of the engine. I therefore propose, in order
        to secure all the advantages of such performances as this engine
        is capable of, to utilize it as the means of controlling the
        admission and exhaust of steam or gas under pressure in other
        engines generally, but more especially those forms of engine in
        which the piston is free to reciprocate, or in other words, is
        not connected with a flywheel or other like device for
        regulating or controlling its speed. </p>
      <p>The drawings hereto annexed illustrate devices by means of
        which the invention may be carried out, Figure 1 being a central
        vertical section of an engine embodying my invention, and Figure
        2 a similar view of a modification of the same. </p>
      <p>Referring to Figure 1, A designates a cylinder containing a
        reciprocating piston B secured to a rod C extending through on
        or both cylinder heads. </p>
      <p>DD; are steam ducts communicating with the cylinder at or near
        its ends and E is the exhaust chamber or passage located between
        the steam ports. The piston B is provided with the usual
        passages FF’ which by the movements of the piston are brought
        alternately into communication with the exhaust port. </p>
      <p>G designates a slide valve which when reciprocated admits the
        steam or the gas by which the engine is driven, from the pipe G’
        through the ducts DD’ to the ends of the cylinder. </p>
      <p>The parts thus described may be considered as exemplifying any
        cylinder, piston and slide valve with the proper ports
        controlled thereby, but the slide valve instead of being
        dependent for its movement upon the piston B is connected in any
        manner so as to be reciprocated by the piston rod of a small
        engine of constant period, constructed substantially as follows:
        a is the cylinder, in which works the piston b. An inlet pipe c
        passes through the side of the cylinder at the middle portion of
        the same. The cylinder exhausts through ports dd into a chamber
        d’ provided with an opening d". the piston b is provided with
        two circumferential grooves e,f which communicate through
        openings g in the same with the cylinder chambers on opposite
        sides of the piston. The special construction of this device may
        be varied considerably, but it is desirable that all the ports,
        and more particularly, the exhaust ports be made larger than is
        usually done, so that no force due to the action of the steam or
        compressed air in the chambers will tend to retard or accelerate
        the movement of the piston in either direction. The piston b is
        ecured to a rod h which extends through the cylinder heads, the
        lower end carrying the slide valve above described and the upper
        end having secured to it a plunger j in a cylinder I fixed to
        the cylinder a and in line with it. The cylinder I is without
        ports of any kind and is air-tight except that leakage may occur
        around the piston rod which does not require to be very close
        fitting, and constitutes an ordinary form of air spring. </p>
      <p>If steam or a gas under pressure be admitted through the port c
        to either side of the piston b, the latter, as will be
        understood, may be maintained in reciprocation, and it is free
        to move, in the sense that its movement in either direction
        ceases only when the force tending to impel it and the momentum
        which it has acquired are counterbalanced by the increasing
        pressure of the steam in that end of the cylinder toward which
        it is moving, and as in its movement the piston has shut off at
        a given point, the pressure that impelled it and established the
        pressure that tends to return it, it is then impelled in the
        opposite direction, and this action is continued as long as the
        requisite pressure is applied. The movements of the piston
        compress and rarify the air in the cylinder I at opposite ends
        of the same alternately, and this results in the heqating of the
        cylinder. But since a variation of the temperature of the air in
        the chamber would affect the rigidity of the air spring, I
        maintain the temperature uniform as by surrounding the cylinder
        I with a jacket a’ which is open to the air and filled with
        water. </p>
      <p>In such an engine as that just described the normal pressure
        will produce a stroke of determined length, which may be
        increased or diminished according to the increase of pressure
        above or the reduction of pressure below the normal and due
        allowance is made in constructing the engine for a variation in
        the length of stroke or amplitude of vibration respectively. The
        period is mainly determined by the rigidity of the air spring
        and the inertia of the moving system and I may therefore secure
        any period of oscillation within very wide limits by properly
        adjusting these factors, as by varying the dimensions of the air
        chamber which may be equivalent to varying the rigidity of the
        spring, or by adjusting the weight of the moving parts. This
        latter is readily accomplished by making provision for the
        attachment to the piston rod of one or more weights h’. Since
        the only work which the small engine has to perform is the
        reciprocation of the valve attached to the piston rod, its load
        is substantially uniform and its period by reason of its
        construction will be constant. Whatever may be the load on the
        main engine therefore the steam is admitted to the cylinder at
        defined intervals, and thus any tendency to a change of the
        period of vibration in the main engine is overcome. </p>
      <p>The control of the main engine by the engine of constant period
        may be effected in other ways --- of which Figure 2 will serve
        as an illustration. In this case the piston of the controlling
        engine constitutes the slide valve of the main engine, so that
        the latter may be considered as operated by the exhaust of the
        former. In the figure I have shown two cylinders AA’ placed end
        to end with a piston B and B’ in each. The cylinder of the
        controlling engine is formed by or in the casing intermediate to
        the two main cylinders but in all other essential respects the
        construction and mode of operation of the controlling engine
        remains as described in connection with Figure 1. The exhaust
        ports dd, however, constitute the inlet ports of the cylinders
        AA’ and the exhaust of the latter is effected through the ports
        m,m which are controlled by the pistons B and B’ respectively.
        The inlet port for the admission of the steam to the controlling
        engine is similar to that in Figure 1 and is indicated by the
        dotted circle at the center of the piston b. </p>
      <p>An engine of the kind described possess many and important
        advantages. A much more perfect regulation and uniformity of
        action is secured, while the engine is simple and its weights
        for a given capacity is very greatly reduced. The reciprocating
        movement of the piston may be converted into rotary motion or it
        may be utilized and applied in any other manner desired, either
        directly or indirectly. </p>
      <p>In [ US Patent # 514,169 ] I have shown and described two
        reciprocating engines combined in such manner that the movement
        or operation of one is dependent upon and controlled by the
        other. In the present case, however, the controlling engine is
        not designed nor adapted to perform other work than the
        regulation of the period of the other, and it is moreover an
        engine of defined character which has the capability of an
        oscillating movement of constant period. </p>
