      When it comes to future challenges, one of the biggest will be
      water scarcity - on a warming planet we're going to have plenty of
      seawater, but not enough fresh, clean water in the right places
      for everybody to drink.<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      And while a lot of research has focussed on desalination, a team
      of scientists have now come up with another possible solution - a
      device that pulls fresh water out of thin air, even in places with
      humidity as low as 20 percent. All it needs is sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      It might sound too good to be true, but so far the research is
      solid. Called the 'solar-powered harvester', the device was
      created by teams from MIT and the University of California,
      Berkeley, using a special type of material known as a
      metal-organic framework (MOF).<br>
      <br>
      To be clear, it's only in the prototype phase right now and has
      been tested in pretty limited situations, but the results so far
      have just been published in Science.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a major breakthrough in the long-standing challenge of
      harvesting water from the air at low humidity," said one of the
      researchers, Omar Yaghi from UC Berkeley.<br>
      <br>
      "There is no other way to do that right now, except by using extra
      energy. Your electric dehumidifier at home 'produces' very
      expensive water."<br>
      <br>
      Two-thirds of the world's population is currently experiencing a
      shortage of clean water, but it's estimated that there's about
      13,000 trillion litres of water worldwide present in the air all
      around us.<br>
      <br>
      So far the prototype device has been tested under conditions of 20
      to 30 percent humidity, and was able to pull 2.8 litres (3 quarts)
      of water from the air over a 12- hour period, using 1 kilogram
      (2.2 pounds) of MOF.<br>
      <br>
      Successful tests have also been conducted on the rooftop at MIT,
      showing that it works in real-world conditions.<br>
      <br>
      The team says that the device could easily be scaled up to provide
      a family with their freshwater needs for the day.<br>
      <br>
      "One vision for the future is to have water off-grid, where you
      have a device at home running on ambient solar for delivering
      water that satisfies the needs of a household," said Yaghi.<br>
      <br>
      "To me, that will be made possible because of this experiment. I
      call it personalised water."<br>
      <br>
      Yaghi worked on the first MOF more than 20 years ago. Unlike
      regular sheets of metals, MOFs are structures where metals such as
      magnesium or aluminium are combined with organic molecules in an
      arrangement that creates rigid, porous structures ideal for
      storing gases or liquids.<br>
      <br>
      Since then, more than 20,000 different kinds of MOFs have been
      created by researchers around the world, and are already being
      used to capture CO2, and efficiently store chemicals such as
      hydrogen or methane.<br>
      <br>
      The MOF used in the solar-powered harvester, shown above, was
      synthesised in 2014, and contains a combination of<b> zirconium
        metal and adipic acid</b>, which binds water vapour. <br>
      <br>
      The MIT team then took dust-sized crystals of this MOF and
      compressed them between a solar absorber and a condenser plate,
      and placed the whole thing inside a chamber that was exposed to
      the outside air.<br>
      <br>
      As ambient air diffuses through the MOF crystals, water molecules
      attach to the interior surfaces. X-ray diffraction studies of the
      system have shown that the water vapour molecules often gather in
      groups of eight, forming cubes.<br>
      <br>
      Sunlight then heats the MOF up and pushes the bound water towards
      the condenser, which is the same temperature as the outside air.
      This vapour condenses as liquid water, and drips into a collector
      to provide clean drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      "This work offers a new way to harvest water from air that does
      not require high relative humidity conditions and is much more
      energy efficient than other existing technologies," said MIT team
      leader, Evelyn Wang.<br>
      <br>
      While it sounds pretty awesome already, the team admits there's a
      lot of room for improvement and fine-tuning, to make the device
      even more efficient.<br>
      <br>
      Right now, the MOF can only absorb 20 percent of its weight in
      water, but other MOF materials could potentially absorb more than
      40 percent.<br>
      <br>
      The material can also be tweaked to be more effective at higher or
      lower humidity levels.<br>
      <br>
      "It's not just that we made a passive device that sits there
      collecting water; we have now laid both the experimental and
      theoretical foundations so that we can screen other MOFs,
      thousands of which could be made, to find even better materials,"
      said Yaghi.<br>
      <br>
      "There is a lot of potential for scaling up the amount of water
      that is being harvested. It is just a matter of further
      engineering now."<br>
      <br>
      "To have water running all the time, you could design a system
      that absorbs the humidity during the night and evolves it during
      the day," he added.<br>
      <br>
      "Or design the solar collector to allow for this at a much faster
      rate, where more air is pushed in. We wanted to demonstrate that
      if you are cut off somewhere in the desert, you could survive
      because of this device."<br>
      <br>
      "A person needs about a Coke can of water per day. That is
      something one could collect in less than an hour with this
      system."<br>

      </b><b>Solar heat helps harvest humidity</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Atmospheric humidity and droplets constitute a huge freshwater
      resource, especially at the low relative humidity (RH) levels
      typical of arid environments. Water can be adsorbed by microporous
      materials such as zeolites, but often, making these materials
      release the water requires too much energy to be practical. Kim et
      al. used a metal-organic framework (MOF) material that has a steep
      increase in water uptake over a narrow RH range to harvest water,
      using only ambient sunlight to heat the material. They obtained
      2.8 liters of water per kilogram of MOF daily at 20% RH.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Atmospheric water is a resource equivalent to ~10% of all fresh
      water in lakes on Earth. However, an efficient process for
      capturing and delivering water from air, especially at low
      humidity levels (down to 20%), has not been developed. We report
      the design and demonstration of a device based on a porous
      metal-organic framework {MOF-801, [Zr6O4(OH)4(fumarate)6]} that
      captures water from the atmosphere at ambient conditions by using
      low-grade heat from natural sunlight at a flux of less than 1 sun
      (1 kilowatt per square meter). This device is capable of
      harvesting 2.8 liters of water per kilogram of MOF daily at
      relative humidity levels as low as 20% and requires no additional
      input of energy.<br>

      <br>
      Imagine a future in which every home has an appliance that pulls
      all the water the household needs out of the air, even in dry or
      desert climates, using only the power of the sun.<br>
      <br>
      That future may be around the corner, with the demonstration this
      week of a water harvester that uses only ambient sunlight to pull
      liters of water out of the air each day in conditions as low as 20
      percent humidity, a level common in arid areas.<br>
      <br>
      The solar-powered harvester, reported in the journal Science, was
      constructed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology using a
      special material - a metal-organic framework, or MOF - produced at
      the University of California, Berkeley.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a major breakthrough in the long-standing challenge of
      harvesting water from the air at low humidity," said Omar Yaghi,
      one of two senior authors of the paper, who holds the James and
      Neeltje Tretter chair in chemistry at UC Berkeley and is a faculty
      scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. "There is no
      other way to do that right now, except by using extra energy. Your
      electric dehumidifier at home 'produces' very expensive water."<br>
      <br>
      The prototype, under conditions of 20-30 percent humidity, was
      able to pull <b>2.8 liters (3 quarts) of water from the air over
        a 12-hour period, using one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of MOF</b>.
      Rooftop tests at MIT confirmed that the device works in real-world
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      "One vision for the future is to have water off-grid, where you
      have a device at home running on ambient solar for delivering
      water that satisfies the needs of a household," said Yaghi, who is
      the founding director of the Berkeley Global Science Institute, a
      co-director of the Kavli Energy NanoSciences Institute and the
      California Research Alliance by BASF. "To me, that will be made
      possible because of this experiment. I call it personalized
      water."<br>
      <br>
      Yaghi invented metal-organic frameworks more than 20 years ago,
      combining metals like magnesium or aluminum with organic molecules
      in a tinker-toy arrangement to create rigid, porous structures
      ideal for storing gases and liquids. Since then, more than 20,000
      different MOFs have been created by researchers worldwide. Some
      hold chemicals such as hydrogen or methane: the chemical company
      BASF is testing one of Yaghi's MOFs in natural gas-fueled trucks,
      since MOF-filled tanks hold three times the methane that can be
      pumped under pressure into an empty tank.<br>
      <br>
      Other MOFs are able to capture carbon dioxide from flue gases,
      catalyze the reaction of adsorbed chemicals or separate
      petrochemicals in processing plants.<br>
      <br>
      In 2014, Yaghi and his UC Berkeley team synthesized a MOF - a
      combination of zirconium metal and adipic acid -- that binds water
      vapor, and he suggested to Evelyn Wang, a mechanical engineer at
      MIT, that they join forces to turn the MOF into a water-collecting
      system.<br>
      <br>
      The system Wang and her students designed consisted of more than
      two pounds of dust-sized MOF crystals compressed between a solar
      absorber and a condenser plate, placed inside a chamber open to
      the air. As ambient air diffuses through the porous MOF, water
      molecules preferentially attach to the interior surfaces. X-ray
      diffraction studies have shown that the water vapor molecules
      often gather in groups of eight to form cubes.<br>
      <br>
      Sunlight entering through a window heats up the MOF and drives the
      bound water toward the condenser, which is at the temperature of
      the outside air. The vapor condenses as liquid water and drips
      into a collector.<br>
      <br>
      "This work offers a new way to harvest water from air that does
      not require high relative humidity conditions and is much more
      energy efficient than other existing technologies," Wang said.<br>
      <br>
      This proof of concept harvester leaves much room for improvement,
      Yaghi said. The current MOF can absorb only 20 percent of its
      weight in water, but other MOF materials could possibly absorb 40
      percent or more. The material can also be tweaked to be more
      effective at higher or lower humidity levels.<br>
      <br>
      "It's not just that we made a passive device that sits there
      collecting water; we have now laid both the experimental and
      theoretical foundations so that we can screen other MOFs,
      thousands of which could be made, to find even better materials,"
      he said. "There is a lot of potential for scaling up the amount of
      water that is being harvested. It is just a matter of further
      engineering now."<br>
      <br>
      Yaghi and his team are at work improving their MOFs, while Wang
      continues to improve the harvesting system to produce more water.<br>
      <br>
      "To have water running all the time, you could design a system
      that absorbs the humidity during the night and evolves it during
      the day," he said. "Or design the solar collector to allow for
      this at a much faster rate, where more air is pushed in. We wanted

            Metal–Organic Frameworks and Related Materials</b></font><br>

        <b>O. Yaghi, et al.</b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Water adsorption in porous materials is important for many
      applications such as dehumidification, thermal batteries, and
      delivery of drinking water in remote areas. In this study, we have
      identified three criteria for achieving high performing porous
      materials for water adsorption. These criteria deal with
      condensation pressure of water in the pores, uptake capacity, and
      recyclability and water stability of the material. In search of an
      excellently performing porous material, we have studied and
      compared the water adsorption properties of 23 materials, 20 of
      which are metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). Among the MOFs are 10
      zirconium(IV) MOFs with a subset of these, MOF-801-SC (single
      crystal form), −802, −805, −806, −808, −812, and −841 reported for
      the first time. MOF-801-P (microcrystalline powder form) was
      reported earlier and studied here for its water adsorption
      properties. MOF-812 was only made and structurally characterized
      but not examined for water adsorption because it is a byproduct of
      MOF-841 synthesis. All the new zirconium MOFs are made from the
      Zr6O4(OH)4(−CO2)n secondary building units (n = 6, 8, 10, or 12)
      and variously shaped carboxyl organic linkers to make extended
      porous frameworks. The permanent porosity of all 23 materials was
      confirmed and their water adsorption measured to reveal that
      MOF-801-P and MOF-841 are the highest performers based on the
      three criteria stated above; they are water stable, do not lose
      capacity after five adsorption/desorption cycles, and are easily
      regenerated at room temperature. An X-ray single-crystal study and
      a powder neutron diffraction study reveal the position of the
      water adsorption sites in MOF-801 and highlight the importance of
      the intermolecular interaction between adsorbed water molecules
      within the pores.<br>
