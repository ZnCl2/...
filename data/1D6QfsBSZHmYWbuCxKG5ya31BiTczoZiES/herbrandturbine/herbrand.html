      </div>
      <br>
      In 1989 (Vol. 2, No. 1) raum&amp;zeit published an article by
      Ludwig Herbrand, dealing with a development in Water Power, termed
      in that article the "Herbrand Turbine". While it seems that
      Herbrand is not the inventor of this technology, the present
      author nevertheless believes that there is something about water
      power that present scientific thinking and engineering are not
      aware of. He believes that the work of the Austrian genius Viktor
      Schauberger holds the key to understanding Herbrand's story.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Historical</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The sequence of "historical" events that led to Herbrand's
      discovery is as follows: Herbrand, in the early thirties, was a
      student of electrical engineering at the Aachen Technical College.
      The theme that was given him for his graduation thesis was the
      "Recalculation of the generators in the Rheinfelden power plant."
      Part of the thesis was also to make a comparison with an article
      that had appeared in the ETZ technical magazine of 1932, page 233.<br>
      <br>
      The power plant of Rheinfelden is a plant that directly utilizes
      the flow of the Rhein river's water, feeding it through turbines,
      essentially without the use of a dam.<br>
      <br>
      The power plant described in the ETZ magazine's article instead
      was a plant constructed in 1926 at Ryburg-Schwoerstadt, about 12
      miles up river from Rheinfelden. The description was as follows:<br>
      <br>
      "The dam and the power plant's generator building span the width
      of the river and dam up the water to a head of about 12 meters
      above the low water side. The driving power is provided by four
      turbines with an exceptional (for that time) capacity of 250
      m3/sec. The power of each generator is 35.000 KVA."<br>
      <br>
      The Rheinfelden power plant on the other hand was an older
      construction, built in the last decade of the nineteenth century.
      It had twenty turbines. As the total water flow of the Rhein river
      at that point is about 1000 m3/sec, each turbine received
      approximately 50 m3/sec of water. The power of each one of the
      generators, calculated according to established principles, was
      500 to 600 KW, the plant reaching a total power of 10 to 12 MW.<br>
      <br>
      However in this same power plant, some generators had recently
      been installed that were designed for a much higher power output
      than the older turbines. They were designed by Prof. Finzi of the
      Aachen Technical College and constructed by J.M. Voith of
      Heidenheim/Brenz. A description of these generators was as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      "They are built to yield 32.500 KVA and can be run with a 10 %
      overload indefinitely, thus actually producing 35.000 KVA. The
      tension is 10.000 Volts at 50 Hertz and 75 rpm, with a factor of
      cos phi of 0.7. Because of the continuous overload factor, all
      stresses are kept to a minimum."<br>
      <br>
      Herbrand recalculated the wiring of one of these generators and
      was much astonished when making his comparison to find that these
      new Rheinfelden generators without a dam and with only one fifth
      of the capacity (50 m3/sec) produced as much electric power as the
      huge generators at Ryburg with their capacity of 250 m3/sec and a
      head of 12 meters.<br>
      <br>
      He turned to his professor in dismay and Finzi's answer, as
      related to us by Herbrand, was:<br>
      <br>
      "Do not worry. It is correct. The generator has been working
      without problems for some time now. Make the calculations
      backwards and you will see for yourself. We are electrical
      engineers. Why, those other problems are not ours to solve, we
      leave them to the water boys. We have repeated our measurements
      and the generator's yield of power is exactly as specified. The
      only thing is - no one knows about this."<br>
      <br>
      Soon came the war and circumstances did not permit Herbran to
      obtain an electrical engineering job. Only many years later did he
      remember his graduation thesis and he has tried since then to
      offer his calculations to government and industry - without
      success. He also tried to obtain a patent but was refused as his
      proposal violated the law of conservation of energy, so he was
      told.<br>
      <br>
      These are the "historical" facts of the matter. Without wanting to
      take away from Herbrand's achievement, it would seem more correct
      to name the turbine a "Finzi-Herbrand-Turbine", because the actual
      designer was Professor Finzi, not Herbrand.<br>
      <br>
      In any case, Herbrand's great merit is to have come out publicly
      trying to get the idea into use more broadly.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Calculations of yield</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The kinetic energy of a water turbine is calculated with the
      following formula:<br>
      <br>
      E kin = m/2 . v2 (KW)<br>
      <br>
      m is the usable amount of water measured in m3/sec and v is the
      velocity of the water, expressed in m/sec.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, v is calculated by the use of the following formula:<br>
      <br>
      v = sqrt 2 . g . h<br>
      <br>
      whereby g is gravity with 9.81 m/sec2 and h is the difference in
      level between the head water and the water on the lower side
      expressed in meters.<br>
      <br>
      But here the matter becomes critical and we should clearly
      understand that the latter formula is only a secondary formula to
      find a v-equivalent in the special case of gravitational water
      pressure resulting from a difference in water levels. For the
      calculation of v in flowing water this formula is neither usable
      nor necessary. The velocity of flowing water can be quantified by
      direct measurement.<br>
      <br>
      The important concept here is that water can gain its velocity in
      two distinctly different ways.<br>
      <br>
      Water can be held up by a dam and at the point where we release it
      through a nozzle or say through a turbine, it will experience a
      strong acceleration. The resulting velocity can be calculated by
      use of the above formula.<br>
      <br>
      If we take for instance a difference in water levels of 12 meters,
      we get a velocity of the water of sqrt 2 . 9.81 . 12 = 15.34 m/sec<br>
      <br>
      Should the capacity of flow be 250 m3/sec then we get a kinetic
      energy of 250/2 . 15.34 . 15.34 = 29,414 KW, approximating the
      above description of the generators of the Ryburg-Schwoerstadt
      power plant.<br>
      <br>
      The second way in which water may reach a certain velocity is the
      normal flowing of a river and in particular the natural vortex
      movement of water.<br>
      <br>
      In our example of the Rheinfelden power plant, the velocity of
      water flow through the turbine was 35 m/sec, much higher than in
      Ryburg-Schwoerstadt.<br>
      <br>
      This higher velocity of flow was reached in two stages.<br>
      <br>
      A small island located in midstream provided the means for the
      first increase in velocity, as the water was forced to flow on one
      side only of the island. The water, finding itself in a much more
      narrow bed, increased its velocity of flow.<br>
      <br>
      A further increase was achieved by a funnel-like construction of
      the inlet towards the turbine, restricting the diameter of the
      water's flow even further and increasing the velocity so as to
      pass the turbine at a considerable 35 m/sec (approximately 80
      mph).<br>
      <br>
      So the kinetic energy, in accordance with our first formula as
      given above, was<br>
      <br>
      50/2 . 35 . 35 = 30,625 KW<br>
      <br>
      We see that with a fifth of the amount of water per second, but
      with a considerably increased velocity of flow, the same kinetic
      energy can be obtained as with 250 m3/sec and a water level
      difference of 12 meters.<br>
      <br>
      If we wished to obtain an equivalent of v = 35 m/sec through
      gravitationally induced water pressure, we would need a head 62.4
      meters (nearly 200 ft!) high.<br>
      <br>
      How is it possible that by simply restricting the space in which
      water may flow, we can free such tremendous energies?<br>
      <br>
      Herbrand has calculated the effect of contraction by introducing a
      factor n. He found that an increase of the factor n, that is, a
      greater contraction, will increase the energy of the water but he
      has found that this concept is exceedingly difficult to grasp for
      our scientific "experts".<br>
      <br>
      Viktor Schauberger: "We are using the wrong kind of motion!"<br>
      <br>
      The Austrian forest warden and inventor Viktor Schauberger has
      researched and successfully applied the laws of motion of water.
      He said that we are using the wrong kind of motion, referring to
      all of our technological "achievements", from the internal
      combustion engine to our way of putting streams of water into an
      unnatural straitjacket.<br>
      <br>
      In order to understand the discovery of Herbrand it is important
      to know that the natural motion of water is a centripetal vortical
      movement, turning or "rolling" inward around the axis of motion of
      the water's flow. This kind of motion tends to accelerate and
      contract the stream of water, accumulating kinetic energy in the
      form of an increased velocity.<br>
      <br>
      A simple example for this is the vortex that forms when a bathtub
      is emptied of water. We can also observe the same kind of motion
      on a simple tap of water. In fact, if the water leaves the tap
      without disturbances such as bubbles of air or other disturbing
      flows, we see that the water takes a spiral course, accelerating
      and contracting on its way.<br>
      <br>
      Anyone who has doubts as to the fact that the natural spiral
      movement can increase the kinetic energy of water, need only
      remember the extraordinary energies contained in tornadoes and
      hurricane winds. <br>
      <br>
      These energies are accumulated by just the same spiral movement.<br>
      <br>
      In the early years of his carreer as a forest warden, Schauberger
      has utilized this effect to allow the transport of
      heavier-than-water beechwood logs in wooden water sluices, very
      much to the amazement of his seniors and visiting scientists.<br>
      <br>
      Science at that time, just as today, could not explain how it was
      possible to transport beech logs in a flow of water, as the wood
      of the beech tree has a specific weight higher than that of water.<br>
      <br>
      Considering this, it is no wonder that also Herbrand's
      observations were to meet disbelief and even outright hostility
      from our scientifically educated "experts".<br>
      <br>
      <b>Thermodynamics and the Law of Conservation of Energy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This discussion about Rheinfelden and Herbrand's turbine lets us
      fly square into the teeth of recognized authority. We are
      seemingly violating the hallowed principle of the conservation of
      energy. I say seemingly, because all things considered,
      conservation of energy is assured. It's just that a stream of
      water is not a "closed system" as our scientists would like to
      believe.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, there are no really closed systems in this world and thus
      thermodynamics, at least its second law, as well as the law of
      conservation of energy, are not correct as currently stated.<br>
      <br>
      The author has dealt with the basic assumptions of physics and the
      law of conservation of energy in a previous article (A new
      Beginning for Thermodynamics).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Gravity and Inertia</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In closing, I would like to point out that gravity and inertia,
      although they do show analogous effects, are not identical.<br>
      <br>
      Even though we cannot subjectively distinguish the earth's gravity
      from an accelaration of 1 g (9.81 m/sec2), say in a spacecraft,
      when we talk about water we must distinguish well between
      gravitationally induced velocity and inertia, that is, velocity
      'already acquired', of the water, such as in a free flow
      situation.<br>
      <br>
      A mass of water held up by a dam is a mass which, under the
      influence of gravity, exerts a certain pressure and thus is able
      to drive a turbine. The energy utilized in this case is the
      gravitationally induced pressure, not the inertial force that
      comes from motion.<br>
      <br>
      A moving mass of water has an inertial mass which by virtue of the
      velocity of the water and in fact by the inertialy induced energy,
      is able to drive a turbine. In this case, the force we are using
      is a direct result of the velocity of motion of our water medium.<br>
      <br>
      The difference here is the natural (free flow) and the unnatural
      (pressure induced) motion of the water.<br>
      <br>
      According to current scientific knowledge we hold up the water by
      a dam, thus stopping its natural flow and losing the inherent
      inertial forces, in order to use only the gravitational pressure
      of this now motionless mass of water to drive turbines!<br>
      <br>
      It would be much more effective to use the natural motion of water
      and, if possible, to accelerate that motion, in order to gain more
      energy out of a fast flowing mass of water than we could ever get
      out of a dammed-up motionless mass, because<br>
      <br>
      E kin = m/2 . v2<br>
      <br>
      As this formula shows, the kinetic energy increases with the
      square of the velocity!<br>
      <br>
      Schauberger has explained the principles of motion to us, Prof.
      Finzi has built a turbine and Herbrand has recognized the paradox
      and has tried to bring it into the public domain.<br>
      <br>
      How long will it take us to finally understand that in our
      technological solutions we must work with nature and not against
      it?<br>
      <br>
      Schauberger had a word for this (freely translated): Observe,
      understand and then copy nature.<br>

      The invention relates to environmentally friendly energy
      extraction from a current which occurs in varying strength or at
      different times and is therefore not suitable for supplying the
      population with power. <br>
      <br>
      Immense quantities of energy are stored in wind, waves, floods and
      tides. The water level of rivers and lakes changes with the
      seasons. The power required in power stations fluctuates
      continuously, and yet the machines can work at full load without
      loss. Bilaterally acting tubular turbines coupled to generators
      generate current which is fed via a rectifier to an electrolysis
      unit. Oxygen accumulates at one electrode and escapes into the
      atmosphere to improve the air, and hydrogen accumulates at the
      other electrodes and serves as an environmentally friendly fuel
      for driving power stations or vehicles.<br>

          </b>Boosting energy from flowing water</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Large quantities of energy that are not developed are stored in
      clouds or in artificial lakes like coal in a mine. In order for
      these to be used, the potential energy which depends on the weight
      of the stored water and on the dynamic head, has to be converted
      into kinetic energy, which depends on the mass of the stored water
      and on the square of the velocity with which the mass is moved. It
      is found in flowing water, in streams, rivers, ocean currents or
      the like. A linear increase in the velocity before the energy is
      used causes a quadratic increase in the energy. Consequently,
      machines that are driven by water can provide more power than
      there is power contained by the unused forces. It is of no
      consequence whether the increase in velocity, which already takes
      place, for example, by a reduction in cross-section, is undertaken
      in the feed or in the turbine...<br>
      <br>
      Task: The object of the invention is to increase the energy of the
      flowing water.<br>
      <br>
      Solution: The object is achieved according to the invention by
      increasing the speed of the flowing water before the energy is
      used.<br>
      <br>
      Off + ührungsbei game; In the case of a garden hose, the amount of
      water flowing out can be regulated with the dispensing valve.
      Pressing the end of the hose together with your thumb and
      forefinger reduces the outlet cross section, increases speed, and
      sprays the water to the farthest corners of the garden. The amount
      of water entering the tube remains constant, but the energy of the
      exiting water increases in proportion to the square of the
      velocity.<br>
      <br>
      This realization can be applied to hydropower plants in a river
      where the turbines are placed one after the other in the river
      bed. Before each turbine, the speed of the water is increased by
      reducing the cross-section of the riverbed so far that even with
      low infestations a sufficient drive energy is ensured.<br>
      <br>
      In the South German power plant, the turbine is provided with two
      impellers, of which the upper, as with a vane pump, to increase
      the speed, and the underlying lying as a drive wheel for the
      generator. By contraction of the cross section between the wheels,
      a further increase in the speed of the water is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      Further embodiment of the invention A power supply with hydropower
      is particularly favorable for the developing countries. In
      particular, in the case of tube turbines that are anchored to a
      float without the construction of power plants, the energy can be
      obtained free of charge at the point where it is needed.<br>
      <br>
      Achievable Benefits: Using the technology described above, in
      1932, in a Lau + waterworks built in the previous century, without
      structural alterations, the output of a test generator that is
      still in operation was increased 70-fold.<br>
      <br>
      Performance increases on the 100 + % are quite possible.<br>
      <br>
      No dams that transform the natural habitat into lake plates are
      required.<br>
      <br>
      Green energy is abundant, enough to provide the whole world with
      energy when it is used. No coal-fired power station needs to
      destroy the livelihood of humanity through acid rain.<br>
      <br>
      Exemplary embodiment: An exemplary embodiment of the invention is
      illustrated chemically in the figure. At 1.) the water of the
      turbine flows 2.). The first impeller 3) of the turbine steers the
      water with an increase in speed in a shaft 4), which becomes
      narrower down to the second impeller 5.) and from there into the
      underwater at 6.).<br>

      In the same way as a fish squeezes the water out of its gills for
      moving through the water, the friction between outer skin and
      water is reduced and can help the propulsion. By the conical
      passage through which <br>
      <br>
      the water flows in the interior of the ship, the speed and thus
      the energy of the water is increased, which helps the propulsion
      or takes over the propulsion.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to an increase in energy from running water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>purpose</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The energy is obtained environmentally friendly from running
      water, without dams, without destruction of primeval landscapes,
      lakes and wetlands, without destroying the natural habitat of rare
      animal and plant <br>
      <br>
      species, without pumping out the groundwater, without endangering
      humans, animals, historical monuments and the like...<br>
      <br>
      When the water comes out of a bathtub or when the water enters a
      turbine, the body Q remains constant. According to the law of
      natural law 1 / n x n = 1, the velocity v increases with
      increasing n and the mass m decreases. This increases the energy
      that is a function of speed. &lt;img class = "EMIRef" id =
      "021732838-00120001" /&gt;<br>
      <br>
      Without energy, only by the contraction of the mass, the energy in
      the turbine is increased fourfold. It is the mass energy that can
      not be explained by German physics.<br>
      <br>
      This knowledge was used, and built a turbine, in which the water
      enters a funnel, which can be calculated according to the Natural
      Law and smoothly corresponds to the "natural course of the water".
      A second funnel pours its water into the lower one.<br>
      <br>
      The increase in energy from running water I have under P 34 18
      118.0-15 on 16. 5. 1984 patent pending. The disclosure took place
      on 21. 11. 85. At 6. 09. 1993 will the 10. Annual fee incl.
      Surcharge of DM 330.- requested. Anyone at home and abroad can
      rebuild the innovation and does not need to pay royalties because
      no patent has been granted, and the operators claim it will not
      work.<br>
      <br>
      The generator produced, as calculated 35 MW, 70 times more power
      than the other generators installed in the same power plant. The
      increase in energy is purely mechanical in the inlet or "in the
      turbine"; therefore, one turbine can be placed behind the other as
      long as the free flow of water is secured behind the turbine. All
      perform the same, because the energy is not used up.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mode of action and advantages of the invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The innovation is particularly suitable for retrofitting existing
      plants, where the performance can be increased to 10-100 times. In
      the previous design of water turbines, in which only the potential
      energy of the water is used, it was endeavored to direct the water
      as perpendicular to the impeller.<br>
      <br>
      To regulate the amount of water and thus the performance of the
      turbine, a regulating ring with adjustable vanes was attached,
      which leads the water in the mounted on the shaft carrier bags.
      The contraction by the handlebars results in an increase in
      energy, resulting in an efficiency of 100% of the potential
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      A Herbrand turbine deliberately uses the mass energy, which is
      increased by the contraction of the water in the energy basket to
      Vernail. The water flows horizontally with v1 into the turbine and
      is deflected by 90 degrees in the conical energy basket. The path
      of the water is getting higher and higher. The downward velocity
      v2 is significantly greater than the velocity v1 entering the
      energy basket. The energy equals the square of the speed and is
      significantly increased.<br>
      <br>
      <b>embodiment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the figure, the cross section of a Francis turbine is shown
      schematically in FIG. Via guide vanes 2 for regulating the amount
      of water, the water flows directly onto the impeller blades 3,
      which are mounted on the shaft 4. Here, only the pot. Energy of
      the water used.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 5 shows the Herbrand turbine with energy basket according to
      Vernail. Just as with a Francis or Kaplan turbine, a guide device
      6 is mounted, in which the guide vanes 7 are at an angle of about
      40-45 degrees. In addition, they are mounted so that they act like
      a nozzle, which increases the speed of the water.<br>
      <br>
      In the energy basket 8, the water flows freely down. From Fig. 5
      it can be seen that the water arriving at the bottom of the basket
      has to travel a shorter distance than the water entering the top
      of the energy basket. The speed of the water flowing upwards
      therefore increases without energy supply "by itself".<br>
      <br>
      The water flows at a speed v1 into the energy basket and out with
      v2. The speed in the energy basket is increased without friction.
      The speed increases linearly and the energy becomes square.<br>
      <br>
      By the pot. Energy is the water accelerates even more, until it
      hits the impeller with adjustable blades 9.<br>
