        <p>Have you ever heard of René Quinton? Probably not. Yet this
          man saved several thousands of children's lives in France and
          in Egypt at the beginning of this century by using a serum
          which now bears his name. </p>
        <p>René Quinton "was the first person to discern and to
          investigate the similarity between sea water and mammalian
          lymph and blood plasma systems. He endeavored to solve the
          mysteries of sea water and its compatibility with living
          organisms by proceeding to carry out several scientific
          experiments in hospitals. The results he obtained were
          dramatically unexpected, since several people who were dying
          regained their vigor. Rene Quinton worked in collaboration
          with Drs. Potocki, Mace and Jarricot, and for four years he
          labored at perfecting his techniques and adjusting dosages. In
          1904, he released the results of his hospital experiments in a
          book entitled, 'L'eau de mer, milieu organique' (Sea Water:
          Organic Medium). The book was re-issued in 1995 because of the
          timeliness of its well- researched contents." </p>
        <p>In 1921, Dr. Jarricot brought out "The Marine Dispensary"
          which contained the results of his therapeutic experiments in
          the treatment of childhood diseases using Quinton's formula. </p>
        <p>Hospitals everywhere became aware of René Quinton's new
          therapy and were favorably disposed to its use. Twelve centers
          for the application of his methods were subsequently
          established in France, Belgium and Egypt. Unfortunately, the
          war in Europe put an end to his research and his theories were
          temporarily set aside. Exhausted by his work, Rene Quinton
          died in 1925. It was not until the 1980's that French doctors
          and therapists once again started to investigate his
          therapeutic approach. </p>
        <p>This century-old approach is now widely used in France,
          Germany, Spain and Italy. A Study and Research Centre has also
          been established with the aim of making available earlier and
          current research carried out using Quinton products. Extensive
          studies are also being made, especially of injectable Quinton
          Plasma for use in the treatment of severe or advanced
          diseases, many of which are now on the rise. </p>

            <p><b>METHOD OF PREPARATION</b></p>
          </center>
        </b>
        <p>Sea water is extracted from a particular location which is
          situated between 10 meters from the bottom and 30 meters from
          the surface. This location is called the zone of solar
          penetration, and is known for its exceptional purity.
          Isothermic vehicles are used to transport the sea water to the
          laboratory for processing in less than 48 hours. The bottling
          in vials and packaging is completed in less than 24 hours
          under sterile conditions in the absence of any metallic
          contact or raised temperature in accordance with the original
          sampling techniques laid down by the physiologist and
          biologist René Quinton and in conformity with present day
          pharmacological standards as well as those of the G.M.P." </p>
        <p>"Sea water tends to maintain its characteristic biodynamism
          and the molecular balance of a 'living medium'. The entirety
          of trace elements contained in sea water are to be found in
          the solution in their active states. </p>
        <b>

            <p><b>SOURCE AND AUTHENTICITY OF QUINTON PRODUCTS</b></p>
          </center>
        </b>
        <p>After several years of research, René Quinton deduced and
          proved that sea water could not be extracted from random
          locations. </p>
        <p>The composition of sea water varies as a ratio of its
          distance from the coastline, according to climate and presence
          or absence of specific marine vegetation. </p>
        <p>He also proved satisfactorily that sea water, which is a
          colloidal solution, differed fundamentally in its therapeutic
          effects from the artificial saline solution (water plus salt)
          currently used. </p>
        <p>In addition, he proved that the drying out or desiccation of
          sea water destroyed it permanently. He showed that it was
          experimentally impossible to reconstitute sea water out of its
          dried extract. </p>
        <p>Another important factor which he brought to light was that
          the equilibrium of its pharmaco-dynamic action was totally
          destroyed in desalinized sea water, that desalinized sea water
          had no valid therapeutic action. The same goes for
          artificially isolated trace elements whether as single units,
          double units, or three at a time. Their action was noted to
          have minimal effect. </p>

          <p><b>René QUINTON's Patented Process : ---</b> </p>
        </b>
        <p>After several years of intensive research, Rene Quinton
          assembled his results and had them patented. </p>
        <p>The patent designates the following: --- The only area
          suitable for extracting the quality of sea water which is
          completely compatible with the mammalian organism; --- The
          methods and techniques for maintaining all the nutritive
          elements found in sea water in their active state without
          using chemical additives;--- Bottling and packaging methods. </p>
        <p>Quinton International Laboratories SARL is the sole
          proprietor of this patented process. It is the only laboratory
          to obtain a permit from the French Ministry of Health for
          marketing sea water prepared according to Rene Quinton's
          formula. Only vials and bottles originating at these
          laboratories may bear the mark "QUINTON" on the glass
          containers. </p>

          <center><b>QUINTON HYPERTONIC // QUINTON ISOTONIC</b></center>
        </b>
        <p>Quinton Hypertonic Solution is pure unadulterated sea water
          in its natural form with its oceanic components. It is
          extracted and stored under the strict conditions described
          earlier. Its mineral and trace-element concentration is thus
          superior to that of universal blood plasma, making it the most
          concentrated form of Quinton solutions, hence its name:
          Hypertonic Solution. </p>
        <p>Quinton Hypertonic Solution may be taken orally with a little
          water. </p>
        <p>Quinton Isotonic Solution, on the other hand, is produced
          from Quinton Hypertonic Solution. It contains exactly the same
          concentration of minerals and trace-elements as blood plasma
          but its sodium content matches that of blood, hence its
          alternative name: Quinton Plasma. </p>
        <p>Quinton Hypertonic Solution is reduced to isotonicity with
          the addition of Aqua Fontana (Mont Roucous Spring Water) which
          has no mineral or medicinal content and is guaranteed to be
          naturally sterile and free of bacteria. </p>
        <p>Quinton Isotonic Solution may be taken orally, injected or
          used in transfusion. Injections may be administered
          subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously as required.
        </p>
        <p>To recapitulate, Quinton Hypertonic Solution is the most
          concentrated form. Quinton Isotonic Solution or Quinton Plasma
          is equal to blood plasma in its mineral and trace-element
          concentration. Quinton Plasma can thus never be hypertonic. </p>

        <p>Quinton Hypertonic Solution promotes cellular nourishment to
          a noticeable degree. It is to be used as a regenerating and
          remineralizing factor, a life-giving essence when there is a
          need for a concentrated natural supply of all the minerals and
          trace-elements for the optimum functioning of any organism. </p>
        <p>Quinton Hypertonic Solution is recommended for use in order
          to produce a therapeutic shock effect on the organism, and to
          induce an almost immediate reinvigoration of depleted organic
          systems. It is also recommended for use prior to an
          anticipated drain of energy whether physical, intellectual or
          emotional. </p>

        <p>Research carried out by Rene Quinton and his successors has
          shown incontestably that, from a scientific and clinical
          standpoint, Quinton Plasma is identical with the indispensable
          fluid which sustains the development of life. </p>
        <p>Rene Quinton's successors were: - Professor Alexis Carrel
          (Nobel Prize in Neurophysiology) - Professor A. Bogolometz
          (Cytotoxic Serum) - Doctor Jean Jarricot (Marine Method) -
          Doctor Alfred Pischinger (Basic Regulation System) </p>
        <p>They all came to similar conclusions, that is to say, that
          sea water (as is contained in Quinton Plasma) is identical
          with the liquid inner environment of humans and mammals. This
          makes it possible, under certain optimum conditions, for
          isolated cells, tissue fragments and whole organs to survive
          in this medium. </p>
        <p>Modern analytical techniques used by A. Pischinger in 1994
          have confirmed what Rene Quinton could only intuit in 1904 in
          the absence of appropriate technology: </p>
        <p>Quinton Plasma expedites the regeneration of the organism
          either by the speedy or by the gradual substitution of a
          depleted inner medium by replacing it with a natural and
          identical equivalent, thus promoting optimum cell development
          and activity. This Plasma is, par excellence, a physiological
          serum. </p>

        <p>Quinton Plasma may be considered as a valuable adjunct in the

        <p>4 to 6 vials must be taken regularly every day over a period
          of many months. </p>
        <p>In certain cases, the Plasma should be administered by
          injection for maximum efficiency. Injections of 30 to 60cc (3
          to 6 vials) may be given every second day throughout the first
          two months. Advanced stages of the disease may require higher
          doses. Subsequent treatment, when appropriate, may be tapered
          off from a single injection twice a week to once a week." </p>

        <p>To maintain a healthy body, homeostasis must be kept
          constant. Thus a dynamic equilibrium is continuously
          reconstructed in the face of modifications due to the
          surrounding metabolism. A healthy organic terrain is the basis
          of health and conversely diseases develop on a depleted or
          congested terrain. <i>Upstream of most diseases there is an
            unbalanced terrain</i>." </p>
        <b>
          <p><b>Mineral salts</b> </p>
        </b>
        <p>The four most abundant cations in the body are sodium,
          potassium, calcium and magnesium from which phosphorus cannot
          be disassociated. Sodium is the monovalent cation
          characteristic of extracellular fluid (ECF) and, conversely,
          potassium is that of intracellular fluid (ICF). The
          composition of salts present in the ICF greatly differs from
          that of ECF but directly depends on the composition of the
          latter. Their relations are ensured by the ion pumps of the
          cell membrane. </p>
        <b>
          <p><b>Interaction and balance of mineral salts</b> </p>
        </b>
        <p>Magnesium can only be used if a balanced calcium-phosphorus
          ratio exists. Magnesium acts as a regulator of the calcium
          fixation and serves as a phosphorus carrier. It is therefore
          an integral part of the calcium-phosphorus complex. </p>
        <p>Any calcium-phosphorus imbalance reduces the resistance to
          illness and therefore enhances susceptibility to diseases,
          increases fatigue, weakens intellectual faculties and leads to
          premature ageing. </p>
        <p>In addition, an abnormal potassium rate produces a magnesium
          and sodium imbalance. No salt is independent of the others as
          they all interact directly or indirectly with the other
          electrolytes. </p>
        <p>Much more than an isolated salt, it is the general
          equilibrium of the saline matrix of the internal environment
          which will ensure proper functioning of the organism. </p>
        <p>For example, the influence of the different salts on cardiac
          automaticity evidences their separate involvement: sodium
          through volemia and its relation to calcium, potassium
          regulating cardiac automaticity, calcium and magnesium
          governing muscular contraction, etc. </p>
        <b>
          <p><b>Seawater</b> </p>
        </b>
        <p>Seawater is an extraordinarily rich and complex matrix that
          still possesses numerous unexplained features. </p>
        <p>Note first that <i>the structure of seawater remains
            incompletely known</i>. Indeed, to this day, no model
          encompasses all its physico-chemical properties. In addition,
          the elements that compose the marine saline matrix also
          exhibit specific properties: for example the coefficient of
          dissociation of salts present in the seawater is higher than
          that observed in salts dissolved in distilled water, in spite
          of the simultaneous presence of other salts in seawater.&nbsp;
          A 33% solution of sea salts, redissolved in distilled water
          does not exhibit all the properties of natural seawater of the
          same salinity. </p>
        <p>Additionally. most of the constituents dissolved in seawater
          (except for CaCO3) are far from saturated, irrespective of the
          importance of the external inputs or the availability of these
          elements in submerged rocks. </p>
        <p>Dittmar's laws show that whatever the total saline
          concentration, the relative concentrations of the different
          ions present in the ocean waters with respect to that of
          chlorine can be regarded as constant. The complex mechanisms
          governing these concentrations have not been fully explained
          yet. </p>
        <p>Also the issue of artificial seawater reconstitution remains
          highly complex: chemists have to introduce certain dosage
          modifications associated with the stability of the elements
          present at a very low concentration. </p>
        <p>The wealth and diversity of mineral salts and trace elements
          present in seawater are exceptional. Gregory and Overberger
          have shown that the marine saline matrix contains the 92 trace
          elements of Mendelev's periodic table. </p>
        <p>It includes all vital nutrient salts and trace elements at
          concentrations ranging from 1 mg/L and 10 mg/L. </p>
        <p>It exhibits an important buffering capability, with a pH
          comprised between 7.9 and 8.3 and a mean saline concentration
          of 33/%. </p>
        <p>Note in particular that all the minerals contained in
          seawater are at a concentration close to that at which they
          are usually found in man's internal environment. </p>
        <p>The joint study of seawater and internal environment
          highlights the similarity between the mineral compositions of
          human plasma and seawater. In addition, the results of
          treatments involving correctly elaborated water preparations
          demonstrate the amazing therapeutic efficacy of seawater. How
          can this be explained ? What are the links between seawater
          and the vital internal environment ? As a result what is the
          influence of seawater on the ionic and mineral balance of the
          organism ?" </p>
        <p>Rene Quinton addressed these questions with certain theories
          about the relationship between seawater and the internal
          environment of mammals, including man. He concluded that the
          human organism maintained this rich, life-giving internal
          environment so closely related to isotonic seawater for the
          full development of cells. </p>
        <p>"He postulated that from the mineral point of view, human and
          marine plasmas are environments of the same nature. In other
          words, there is physical and physiological identity between
          seawater and the internal environment of the organism. Not
          only do they exhibit very similar mineral compositions, but
          the particular form, organization and synergy of trace
          elements and mineral salts that make up the saline matrix of
          seawater closely resemble those of the internal environment
          constituents." </p>
        <p>After a documented body of scientific observations, Quinton
          surveyed the possible medical applications of his findings. </p>
        <p>"Together with a medical team, Quinton developed for more
          than 25 years the so-called "marine method" based on
          "Quinton's Plasma," a marine plasma in the form of an
          injectable isotonic solution. </p>
        <p>The works of physicians Jarricot, Robert Simon, Lacheze, Mace
          and Quinton rely on the principle of regeneration of the
          depleted internal environment, on which cells live, by means
          of purified seawater preparations exhibiting a balanced and
          complete composition, so as to allow the patient to globally
          reconstruct his terrain and the cells to find once again the
          elements they need. </p>
        <p>Given the particular period in which these works were
          published, they mainly cover various types of cutaneous
          disorders, neurovegetative asthenias, anorexias, acute
          cachexias, infant diarrheas, deep dehydrations,
          gastroenteritis, pulmonary tuberculosis, cholera, typhus." </p>
        <p>"Exceptional results were obtained and the findings of these
          precursors should now be supplemented by numerous other
          investigations. Their writings and the listed clinical cases
          demonstrate the great therapeutic attractiveness of Quinton's
          assumptions and the efficacy of his method. </p>
        <p>Marine plasma is a living medium. It is worth pointing out
          that, basically, living matter differs from mineral matter in
          its organization and not in the nature of the atoms that
          compose it. A living cell is much more than the sum of its
          elements. The mere dosage of components does not suffice in
          itself to account for the therapeutic effect of marine plasma.
        </p>
        <p>A good illustration of this can be found in the therapeutic
          mineral waters; except for the elements that are abundant in
          them, many waters develop their curative power essentially
          when drawn from the mineral water spring. Due to the
          preservation methods and conditions used, these waters lose
          their properties although the constitutive elements remain
          present. </p>
        <p>Hence is there a specific state of these waters when they are
          drawn? Numerous theories could be devised, starting from the
          "homeopathic dynamization" whose most probable substratum
          would be a particular state of the solvent, in this case
          water. </p>
        <p>As a result, how can we envisage the specific therapeutic
          gain that could result from the use of the trace elements
          present in marine plasma? The assumption of physiologic
          identity between human plasma and marine plasma supposes a
          form of availability particularly well-suited to the needs of
          the organism. </p>
        <p>Resulting from the mineral balance, pH should be restored by
          marine plasma. German physician Ropffer thoroughly
          investigated the evolution of body pH in patients to whom he
          had prescribed hydromarine treatments. He concluded the
          following: </p>
        <p>'For normal and alkaline organisms, an increase in acid
          values has unequivocally been established. Similarly for
          hyperacid organisms, a dramatic decrease in acid values has
          been recorded. No case has remained the same. </p>
        <p>It can therefore be stated that in case a global inconstant
          acidity, a cure of drinkable seawater causes the normal
          acidity to be recovered. In particular for gastritis due to
          dietary errors or alcohol and nicotine abuse remarkable
          results have been obtained.' </p>
        <p><i>Dr. Jarricot wrote:</i> </p>
        <p>'Marine plasma is not a serum against such and such illness,
          but it is designed for the living cell.' </p>
        <p>In other words, it is a product which by its very nature
          primarily contributes to the restoration of health and the
          suppression of disease and its symptoms.' " </p>

        <p>My long-time fear of having a blood transfusion or anything
          else injected directly into my unprotected bloodstream has
          grown stronger over the years. It's not a religious issue, but
          rather an occupational hazard. Being a health researcher,
          terrible visions of what could go wrong haunt me, with good
          reason. I feel like the meat inspector who becomes a
          vegetarian. I know things that forever destroyed my innocent
          faith in all things medical. I no longer worship in "The
          Church of Modern Medicine" nor tithe to its pseudo-gods
          voluntarily. </p>
        <p>"They," the health (read: disease) industry specialists,
          check blood better these days to catch unsafe blood supplies
          contaminated with HIV, Hepatitis, and other disease
          components, but blood products still aren't completely safe,
          even with modern technology. They can't sterilize blood any
          more than they can sterilize vaccines to kill all the unwanted
          "bugs" without destroying the nature of these products. They
          test blood and separate blood components through centrifugal
          action and other methods to purify it as much as possible, but
          it remains impossible to promise or deliver a completely safe
          blood-related product. Blood is 'alive'—it cannot be
          sterilized or rendered antiseptic. </p>
        <p>There are countless transfusion horror stories dating back
          many decades, but we rarely ever hear about them. For example,
          a neighbor down the street lost her husband about four years
          ago. He had cancer, but became infected with viral hepatitis
          from a blood transfusion and died from liver failure, not the
          cancer. Many people know someone who suffered from the effects
          of a blood transfusion gone bad. That's just a fact of life
          and one of the known risks of surgery, no matter how minor. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I've run across too many stories of this
          nature. I've spent most of my adult life doing research and
          writing in the field of alternative medicine (truthquest2.com)
          with an early focus on viral and bacterial diseases and
          problem vaccines, some of which are still made from pooled
          human blood products, or with "attenuated" vaccine viruses
          created by "serial passage" through contaminated animal cell
          cultures. That means they take human viruses and put them in
          layers of animal cells over and over again which forces them
          to adapt to the foreign cells to survive. This "adaptation"
          requires an exchange of genetic material between virus and
          host cells. When monkey kidney cells are used, the exchange of
          genetic material that takes place forces the human virus to
          become a little bit 'monkey-like', supposedly so it cannot
          initiate full-blown disease, which doesn't always work. In the
          process, native monkey viruses become a little bit
          'human-like', giving them greater compatibility with human
          cells. </p>
        <p>Such may be the case with the infamous Epstein-Barr virus
          which is referred to as "human" while many scientists believe
          it originated in monkeys, infected humans through contaminated
          vaccines in mutated form, and then became associated with
          Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and other maladies. But then, there
          is less of a species barrier with monkeys than with other
          animals, which gives us less protection from their pathogens.
          The bio-hazards of monkey viruses are well-known in certain
          scientific circles, but little-known by the general public. </p>
        <p>In the course of my research I came to study the subject of
          recombinant virology—the combining of unlike viruses into new
          "tribes," usually with more dangerous characteristics than the
          "parent" viruses, by men in white coats playing God.
          Recombination events can also happen in nature under certain
          conditions, particularly when helped along by bad science. For
          example, a monkey virus called SV-40 (Simian Virus 40, after
          becoming the 40th virus found in monkey tissues) was found to
          have unique properties. This "naked virus" can penetrate any
          kind of cell without the problem of a "species barrier" and it
          allows unlike viruses to attach to it and ride piggyback into
          the genetic material of a cell where they can take over the
          "machinery" and replicate new recombined viruses on their own.
          The discovery of this virus gave rise to the field of
          recombinant virology with many dire consequences. SV-40 became
          a well-documented but unpublicized contaminant in polio
          vaccines, made with the use of monkey kidney cell cultures,
          when it was given in 1955-1963 to 95 million unsuspecting
          recipients. </p>
        <p>The first official claim was that SV-40 viruses "do not have
          any significance in the safety or efficacy of polio vaccines",
          but when the virus was first tested on guinea pigs after its
          discovery, they developed salivary gland tumors and immune
          deficiency symptoms. The corresponding organ in humans is the
          pancreas. Deadly pancreatic cancer has since become epidemic
          in numbers. SV-40 is now associated with numerous cancers,
          including human mesotheliomas, osteosarcomas, brain tumors,
          epdnymomas, choroid plexus tumors and others. These same
          monkey cell cultures, used to make vaccines, contained other
          viruses such as SIV—Simian Immunodeficiency Virus—and that
          figures prominently in the makeup of another recombinant virus
          we know as HIV. There's no proof offered publicly whether HIV
          resulted from a naturally occurring recombination event, but
          the sophistication of this virus and some documented
          government requests for the creation of a similar biological
          weapon suggests otherwise, although a study generated at the
          request of the WHO, and then suppressed, linking African AIDS
          to the WHO vaccination campaign theorized that viral vaccines
          "activated" dormant viruses, so this is a possibility
          supporting natural recombination, unless HIV was intentionally
          added to certain vaccines. </p>
        <p>The London Times printed this story on May 11, 1986, but the
          story was withheld from the American media. This kind of
          information seldom reaches the general public in my country,
          like one of the most horrific scientific "errors" ever made
          and hushed up involving "HeLa Cells," the most aggressive
          cancer cell culture ever known which made its way into science
          labs all over the world for research and then contaminated
          many cell cultures used for vaccines… by accident. Think about
          human vaccine viruses being grown in cancer cells and
          exchanging genetic information with the cancerous host cells
          before being injected into millions of unsuspecting victims. </p>
        <p>That's just part of what a person potentially faces when
          receiving blood from another person or persons with undetected
          infection. Sam Bizer, a researcher in the field of alternative
          medicine, interviewed Dr. William Donald Kelly, D.D.S., M.S.,
          who related a conversation with Drs. Friedman and Burton from
          the former Immunological Center in Great Neck, New York, that
          did cancer research. They maintained from their findings that
          a blood transfusion may destroy your resistance to cancer. Dr
          Burton believed, as many religious groups do, that blood
          transfusions can cause cancer. "<font color="#ff0000">'</font>He




          says it works something like this… A tumor, in its natural
          drive to sustain its own life, secretes compounds called
          blocking factors which prevent the body's natural defense
          system from destroying it.<font color="#ff0000">'</font> He
          believed that when you give a transfusion, you pass on the
          blood donor's blocking factors and that this can suppress the
          recipient's own immune system sufficiently to allow a tumor to
          develop. Then this new tumor in turn secretes its own blocking
          factor, which inhibits the immune system further. So, while
          cancer is not contagious, its blocking factors can be
          transmitted. In this way, a blood transfusion may increase
          your susceptibility to cancer." <font color="#ff0000">[4]</font>
        </p>
        <p>While possible "blocking factors" and contamination from
          human and animal microbes in blood supplies worry me somewhat,
          there are other factors that keep me awake at night… Someone I
          knew in college just happened to mention in passing that a
          blood transfusion changed his life. He described coming out of
          surgery after an accident and waking up with a changed
          personality. He blamed his condition on the blood transfusion
          he was given. Since I only knew him after this event, I can't
          say whether the change was good or bad, but who wants
          something like that to happen while under anesthesia? </p>
        <p>But something far worse than a personality change affected my
          opinion in 1981. That year I gave birth to my only child in
          Alaska—a much anticipated arrival by me at age 34 and by the
          baby's godmother, Ceci Clark, an artist and gallery owner of
          some renown in Alaska. Ceci developed bone cancer which wasn't
          diagnosed immediately. Before they found it, she had surgery
          for something else and was given a blood transfusion. When she
          woke up, her "brains" were scrambled, so to speak. She
          recognized me, but thought I was her sister, and she grew
          confused trying to figure out where that newborn baby came
          from? They eventually found the cancer. She died soon after. </p>
        <p>In recent years my research turned to alternative cancer
          treatments and remedies for chronic/degenerative disease,
          particularly after becoming desperately ill and having my
          health, and that of other family members, restored without
          drugs or surgery by an unusual naturopathic physician in
          Spokane, Washington, the late Dr Harold Dick, whose
          extraordinary diagnostic and healing skills were both passed
          on to and added to by his daughter who completed a 3 year
          residency with him, became his partner, and then took over his
          practice after his death, Dr Letitia Dick-Watrous, N.D. Dr
          Dick not only turned my health around with a little-known
          diagnostic "tool" and an updated treatment modality with roots
          in the old "water cure" of Germany's famous Father Sebastian
          Kneipp—the O.G. Carroll Food Intolerance Test and
          Constitutional Hydrotherapy—but mentored me and lit a research
          fire in my belly that won't go out, and Dr Watrous fanned the
          flames. </p>
        <p>In the course of researching natural healing methods, I
          joined a membership website that featured little-known
          alternative treatments for cancer and infection and these
          included "The Marine Treatment" based on the work of French
          biologist/physiologist, Rene Quinton. He proved that seawater,
          properly formulated and under certain conditions, is virtually
          identical to mammal blood plasma. With the assistance of many
          eminent physicians, he successfully used seawater as a healing
          agent on thousands of patients in France and Egypt in the
          early 1900's. Cancer was almost unknown in those days, but
          many other disease conditions responded to injections of the
          diluted ocean water, a true "marine plasma", which could
          re-mineralize a sick body, normalize the pH (acid—alkaline)
          level and balance the electrolytes, thereby correcting the
          underlying cause of many disease conditions by regenerating
          the 'internal terrain', as Quinton called it. The report
          included before-and-after photos of patients. Like most
          people, I was drawn to the shocking 100-year-old photos first,
          and the science came in a distant second. Babies near death
          from cholera and other causes, cadaver-like bodies filled out
          to healthy plumpness, raw, weeping skin from eczema made
          smooth and lesion-free… many early 20th century scourges, such
          as tuberculosis, were shown— healed by something as natural
          and plentiful as sunlight or the air we breathe. </p>
        <p>How important is the mineral and trace mineral balance in the
          body? Many researchers, including Dr. Joel Wallach, author of
          the best-selling audio tape, "Dead Doctors Don't Lie", claim
          that the absence of one single mineral needed by the body can
          give rise to as many as ten different disease symptoms. Of
          course, much of modern medicine still blames germs and
          genetics for most human disease, so the "mineral deficiency"
          theory is generally ignored. But Dr Wallach believes that a
          common heart condition—cardiomyopathy—a condition that has
          killed countless victims, from professional athletes to heart
          specialists, or made them candidates for heart transplants—is
          caused by nothing more than a selenium (a trace mineral)
          deficiency and can be cured or prevented by a few cents worth
          of selenium supplements a day. </p>
        <p>Enter seawater—the missing link to deficient elemental
          nutrition! It contains every mineral and trace mineral known,
          in organic form, in the proper ratios needed by human tissues,
          and it's been there all along as a healing and life-giving
          agent, hidden in plain sight. While the website where I first
          found "The Marine Treatment" information had a good report and
          impressive photos, a more complete website on the subject was
          under construction. There, I discovered Dr. Juergen Buche,
          N.D. was in the process of translating a large body of ocean
          water research and supporting documentation from the original
          French into English on his academic oceanplasma.org website. </p>
        <p>What I found on that site hit so close to home that I'm still
          reeling! Besides curing many diseases of the day in the early
          1900s, my eye caught something that resonated with my
          transfusion phobias. It turns out that trials were run on
          stray dogs to test the Ocean Plasma (diluted, cold-filtered
          ocean water) as a transfusion substitute. In one experiment,
          Quinton and his medical team drained a dog of all of its blood
          and replaced it with isotonic (diluted) seawater. The dog
          should have died immediately, one would think, but the dog
          lived. On day 2 after the transfusion, 50% of the blood
          components had reappeared. By day 4, almost 100% of the
          missing blood components were restored in what appeared to be
          proof of biological transmutation (change from one element to
          another). Not only did the blood completely regenerate, but
          soon after the procedure, the dog bounced around like a puppy
          with greater vitality than before the procedure and it lived
          for many years afterwards. Just think what a safe, effective,
          plentiful substitute for blood transfusion would mean to the
          world? No side effects, no blood type matching needed, no
          pathogen screening required, and it would be a true plasma
          with proven healing properties in itself! </p>
        <p>So, what became of this wondrous marine treatment? World War
          I got in the way of medical research as well as drafting
          Quinton into the war. He died in 1925. These events somewhat
          interrupted the continuance of "Marine Treatment" hospitals
          and clinics, of which there were many. However, it was carried
          on by his medical co- workers and ardent followers and
          experienced a resurgence after World War II in several
          countries. Animal trials using seawater as a transfusion
          substitute were repeated with the same results in 1969; but as
          a therapeutic agent, "The Marine Treatment" has since then
          been used on people mostly as a foundational treatment for
          chronic/ degenerative disease. Also, it became known as a
          complete and readily-assimilated liquid mineral and trace
          mineral supplement for remineralization, for detoxification,
          for energy, and for anti-stress. </p>
        <p>No human trials for transfusion have ever been attempted. As
          for the healing properties of seawater, in today's restrictive
          medical atmosphere, seawater can only be referred to as a
          "mineral drink". If the word "cure" was uttered or written in
          relation to a brand name, the "offense" would be legally
          actionable. Only a DRUG, toxic by its very nature, can be
          called "curative", and no FDA-sanctioned studies will be
          funded or reported on the efficacy of seawater treatment for
          disease, because a supplement can be studied only in relation
          to its disease "risk reduction" factor as defined by the
          government agency, and not as a treatment for actual disease.
        </p>
        <p>Why haven't we heard of Rene Quinton and his marine
          treatment? This country, the North American continent in
          general and the USA in particular, has the worst national
          health of any industrialized country in the world—in spite of
          spending the most money on health research and health care.
          This country lags sadly behind in many areas of medical
          science, particularly when those who profit from bad science
          are called to arms for their own self-protection by safer,
          more effective and less expensive remedies and methods such as
          Quinton's modest but living ocean water. Look at the
          international pharmaceutical industry. It has such wealth and
          power that it controls not only the FDA but American
          health-related legislation and policies. Take for example the
          case of the "cholesterol" caper. In the past, the federal
          guidelines for managing cholesterol were this: Someone with
          300 mg of dietary cholesterol per day, with an HDL (good
          cholesterol) level of 35 mg per deciliter (dL) in the blood
          was considered unacceptable and in need of treatment. However,
          under the "guidance" of the powerful pharmaceutical industry,
          those federal guidelines were recently changed. Now, less than
          200 mg of dietary cholesterol per day is considered
          "acceptable" and an HDL (good cholesterol) level of anything
          less than 40 is now unacceptable. (JAMA 01; 285:2486-2487) </p>
        <p>Translation: Under the old guidelines, 13 million people were
          pushed into using cholesterol-lowering drugs. Under the new
          guidelines, 36 million people are now buying those drugs, and
          that means billions of dollars of additional revenue to the
          pharmaceutical companies. At the same time, these same drug
          manufacturers have been particularly hesitant to publish the
          effects of drug-induced low cholesterol, which includes
          depression, violent behavior, suicide, aggression, increased
          risk of stroke and poor immune function, according to certain
          studies. It's looks like we're being brainwashed by some kind
          of drug mythology into believing that diseases are caused by a
          drug deficiency and that they can only be cured by increased
          and expensive drug consumption. </p>
        <p>What would happen to these international drug cartels if an
          actual cure for cancer suddenly came on the market outside of
          their control? Since they exist financially only for
          "treatment of symptoms" (disease management) rather than
          curing anything, it is possible that our entire
          financial/medical infrastructure might collapse as a
          consequence. The stockholders of pharmaceutical companies want
          profits, not a cure to end human misery and stop the flow of
          profits.We hear similar stories about fossil fuel substitutes
          and other life-altering discoveries and inventions that never
          made it to the open market due to intervention by the
          competition. </p>
        <p>Likewise, a safe blood transfusion substitute might threaten
          too many rich and powerful areas of the medical market to ever
          see the light of day…but one can visualize the possibilities.
          However, <font color="#ff0000">"</font>Vision without action
          is only a dream.<font color="#ff0000">" [7]</font> Consider
          this article the start of action—maybe YOUR action?!
          Harvesting seawater for consumption (it can be ingested orally
          [by drinking] or be injected) is not easy and it requires
          knowledge, care, and the right equipment. First, the weather,
          tides, and other conditions need to be right. Secondly, ocean
          water is harvested far out to sea (35 miles or more) to ensure
          purity. Then, since nutrients are depleted in surface waters,
          where plants and algae grow, and are found in higher
          concentrations in deep waters, ocean water is pumped from 100
          feet below the surface. During the entire processing
          operations, from ocean to bottle, the seawater cannot touch
          metal and must be kept cold. Heating kills the invigorating
          living properties of seawater. It has to be transported and
          kept in glass or food-grade plastic containers. Then it has to
          be tested and cold-purified in a manner that protects it from
          alteration and preserves its state as a living solution. </p>
        <p>Seawater, in its original and primal state, once had only 1/3
          the saline content it has now, and this fact is still mirrored
          in the saline content of blood and tears. The oceans became
          more concentrated through the ages, and are now far too salty
          to drink in large amounts. To use ocean water as blood plasma,
          it must be diluted with ultra-pure water to the same
          concentration as blood plasma, namely 9 grams of salts per
          liter. As the perfect mineral supplement, it can be consumed
          orally in dilute form or full strength by those with no sodium
          sensitivities—but only in small amounts, like an ounce at a
          time, several times a day if necessary. However, it's
          extremely important to dilute it with pure spring water for
          home use, because chlorinated water has the same kind of
          damaging effect on ocean water as it has on the human body,
          according to several studies. The French got it right. They
          ozonate their drinking water instead of adding cheaper bleach
          to it. </p>
        <p>The exact properties of seawater remain a mystery to modern
          science. In spite of our great technical expertise, the
          complete nature of seawater defies analysis. It has some
          living quality beyond the sum of its parts. It can't be dried
          and reconstituted, or synthesized in a chemistry lab. The
          great French scientist Antoine Béchamp looked at blood as a
          kind of flowing tissue rather than just a liquid. Seawater
          also has something about it that makes it more than "just
          water." It sustains life, as proven by Nobel Laureate Alexis
          Carroll, who kept a piece of chicken heart tissue alive in it
          for over 26 years, needing only to change it daily to dispose
          of metabolic wastes. In fact, one could factually say that we
          have internalized the ocean within ourselves, and in that rich
          nutrient medium is the source of life. Every cell in the body
          bathes and feeds in it. It picks up and carries away the waste
          products of cell metabolism. It has a life force, unlike the
          familiar bags of saline solution seen in every hospital, which
          is nothing more than table salt and plain water. Processed
          table salt bears little resemblance to the raw, unprocessed,
          mineral-rich sea salt we should be using, and our depleted
          bodies suffer the consequences. </p>
        <p>If I have surgery, I want to see "Ocean Plasma" in a drip bag
          above my head before the lights go out. The world needs
          someone with courage and vision willing to initiate the first
          human trials; the world needs someone to extend Rene Quinton's
          dog trials and to make that leap into the future that signals
          true progress. </p>

          1912: Ed. Masson) Reprinted: Ed. ENCRE 1995". </p>
        <p class="rvps1">The experiments shown below were repeated,
          successfully, 50 years after Quinton's daring exploits </p>
        <b>
          <p><b>INTRODUCTION ---</b> </p>
        </b>
        <p>The earliest experiments were made in 1897, with [abandoned]
          dogs, at the laboratory of Etienne Marey at the "Hautes Etudes
          du College de France" for the study of physiology and
          pathology, where René Quinton had begun to work. </p>
        <p>All references to "seawater" infer that ordinary filtered and
          unheated seawater was reduced (diluted with [then] distilled
          water) to the isotonic 9‰ state of human plasma. Today, the
          dilution is accomplished with sterile but 'living' spring
          water. </p>
        <b>
          <p><b>GROUP 1 EXPERIMENTS (pages 165-168) ---</b> </p>
        </b>
        <p>Partial drainage of blood - Intra-organic injections of
          seawater, via saphena vein, using normal adult dogs. </p>
        <p>A first group of experiments was conducted where a volume of
          66% (EXPERIMENT 1 not related here), 81% (EXPERIMENT 2 not
          related here) and finally 104%(EXPERIMENT 3 - see below) of a
          dog's body weight was replaced, over a period of fixed time,
          with a corresponding amount of isotonic 9‰ seawater. </p>
        <p>Finally, (EXPERIMENT 4) a small dog was injected with 9‰
          Marine isotonic plasma at three varying rates and reactions
          were observed and recorded. </p>
        <p>The main discovery was that as long as the rate of injection
          kept pace with renal elimination, no traumatic reactions were
          encountered. </p>
        <b>
          <p><b>THIRD EXPERIMENT OF GROUP ONE (page 167) ---</b> </p>
        </b>
        <p>An [abandoned] dog, was injected with 10 kilos, 400 grams of
          9‰ isotonic seawater. This enormous quantity of water,
          representing 104% of the dog's [own] body weight, was injected
          over a period of 11 hours and 40 minutes. This was equivalent
          to the injection of 62.4 kilos of seawater into a man weighing
          60 kilos. </p>
        <p>Here follows the account of this experiment in René Quinton's
          own abbreviated words: </p>
        <p>"The dog lay quietly in the morning, covered, his body weight
          was 6.5 kg, the rectal temperature [was] 39.7 degrees C. The
          temperature of the injection was about 35-40 degrees C. The
          rate of injection was 14.9 cc - the same as urinary
          elimination. During the 11 hours and 40 minutes of the
          injection, there was no agitation, no diarrhea, no
          albuminuria, and all the reflexes remained active. The dog
          kept his eyes on the operator and reacted to every caress.
          Occasional vomiting of a yellowish liquid (50cc total
          quantity). The rectal temperature declined in stages to 36.8
          degrees C. and at the end of the injection [period] rose to
          37.2 degrees C. By this time, the dog had absorbed 10.4 kg of
          [isotonic sea] water and had excreted 9.4 kilos of urine." </p>
        <p>"One hour and ten minutes after the injection, the dog was
          back on his feet, moved normally except for a slight limp
          caused by the binding of his feet during this experience. At
          this time, his rectal temperature was normal at 39 degrees C."
        </p>
        <p>The next day, 14 hours after the injection, the animal was
          remarkably gay, ran and jumped in the laboratory, ate two
          portions of meat weighing 600 grams and drank 100 grams of
          water. His urine, from the night, showed a slight albumin
          cloudiness." </p>
        <p>The day after, and the following days, the dog continued to
          behave the same way: more energetic than before the injection,
          no diarrhea, no vomiting, normal albumin, not troubles of any
          kind." </p>
        <b>
          <p><b>FOURTH EXPERIMENT OF GROUP ONE (page 168) ---</b> </p>
        </b>
        <p>A third [abandoned] dog was injected with a large quantity of
          [isotonic} seawater. A small dog that weighed 5 kilos, was
          injected with 3.5 kilos of isotonic seawater at injection
          rates varying from 67.3 cc per minute per 10 kg of body weight
          during the first 30 minutes, to 5.4 cc per minute (renal
          elimination) to 58.2 cc per minute in a short period of 90
          minutes. The dog's stomach rapidly ballooned and the heart
          rate slowed perceptibly. The initial body temperature dropped
          from 38.2 degrees C. to 32.5 degrees, urination diminished.
          The corneal reflex disappeared. </p>
        <p>It was noted that during the slow injection rate the
          traumatic symptoms did not aggravate but normalized. As soon
          as rapid injection rates resumed, the re-appearance and
          aggravation of symptoms reappeared while renal elimination
          slowed. </p>
        <p>As soon as the injection stopped [after 90 minutes], the body
          temperature rose, urination accelerated and the coronary
          reflex returned. The dog began to stagger about, his swollen
          stomach was no longer&nbsp; recognizable. He took several
          steps and collapsed. The shock had been too violent and he
          found it hard to recover. But by the eleventh day, the
          recovery was complete. The animal was extremely gregarious and
          exuberant in spite of his confinement for days in the
          basement. His body weight was still five kilos. </p>
        <b>
          <p><b>GROUP 2 EXPERIMENTS (pages 169-170) ---</b> </p>
        </b>
        <p>Complete drainage of blood and replacement with an equal
          amount of isotonic seawater. </p>
        <p>This experiment involved withdrawing a quantity of blood
          blood plasma of a [mongrel] dog, and replacing it with an
          equal quantity of 9‰ isotonic seawater. No special precautions
          were made to prevent infection. The dog was to be placed at
          death's door, so that this would be a final test for the
          curative power of seawater and would demonstrate whether the
          isotonic water was a perfect [replacement] copy of the dog's
          blood plasma. Here is the report by the observers: </p>
        <p>"Dog of 12kg 400g. Withdrawal of most of his blood from the
          femoral artery, of 491 grams, during 4 minutes, without any
          [antiseptic] precautions, representing one twentieth of the
          [dog's] body weight. The corneal reflex halted. Presented with
          the impossibility of withdrawing any more blood, the injection
          of seawater at 23 degrees C. began and 532 cc (18.7 ounces) at
          23 degrees C. were injected during a period of 11 minutes. The
          corneal reflex was restored. The untied animal was unable to
          walk, breathed with difficulty, with short breaths and
          remained stretched out on a blanket without moving." </p>
        <b>
          <p>DAY 2 --- </p>
        </b>
        <p>"After 21 hours, the dog trots around the laboratory. The red
          blood cells have dropped from 6,800,00 before the treatment
          [experiment] to 2,900,000; white blood cell level is at 15,400
          from a previous 14,000, the hemoglobin has decreased from 19
          to 12. These results are a witness to the enormous withdrawal
          of blood, yet, the animal eats and drinks." </p>
        <b>
          <p><b>DAY 3 ---</b> </p>
        </b>
        <p>"The condition of the dog changed: the wound discharged puss,
          the body temperature rose to 40 degrees C., and the condition
          looked grave, the animal sad and depressed. Now it was to be
          seen whether the organism, impoverished by the withdrawal of
          blood could overcome the infection with the seawater and
          accomplish leukocytosis manufacture of white blood cells}. </p>
        <b>
          <p><b>DAY 4 ---</b> </p>
        </b>
        <p>"Although the condition continued to look grave, the red
          blood cells were now at 3,020,000, the white blood cells at
          24,000,000 and the hemoglobin at 16. Leukocytosis had been
          accomplished at a ratio of 1:484 vs. 1:125 before the
          procedure. That same evening, the dog ate 400 grams of meat."
        </p>
        <p>Thereafter, the progress was rapid. On the eighth day, the
          dog became exaggeratedly exuberant, ran about wildly and this
          continued during the following days. The results showed that
          the organism had become revitalized by the seawater to a level
          that EXCEEDED that of the [original] plasma that had been
          withdrawn. Five years later, Sodium, named after the memory of
          the experiment, was still alive and well. </p>

          <p><b>GROUP 3 EXPERIMENTS (Page 171- 173) ---</b> </p>
        </b>
        <p>The definitive experiment was to extract white blood cells
          from fishes, a lizard, a man, rabbit, a dog and a chicken and
          mix them, each in turn, with varying amounts of seawater (up
          to 200 times dilution of a unit of blood with Marine Plasma) )
          to observe when the white blood cells would cease living. This
          proved a total success. In all cases, the white blood cells,
          essentially simulating the cellular life of an organism,
          presented all the signs of vital normal life: adherence and
          amoebic movements. </p>
        <p>It was found also that white blood cells were able to survive
          25+ hours in non-sterile plasma solutions and upwards of a
          month in sterile solutions. This surpasses by far even the
          most optimistic artificial plasma solutions. </p>
        <p>André Mahe, contemporary of René Quinton and author of the
          book: Le secret de nos origines - 2nd Edition, Le courrier du
          Livre 1962, writes... </p>
        <p>"Now, Rene Quinton is confronted with an impasse, i.e.
          vis-a-vis the frightening keystone which is of course the
          experimentation. If my assumption is right, he thinks, while
          searching for examples of physiological evidence, one must be
          able to withdraw part of the blood plasma of an animal with
          impunity and then to replace this plasma by an equal quantity
          of sea water. In the same vein, one must be able, without
          danger, to inject the dog [he calls it an 'organism'] with a
          considerable quantity of sea water. Lastly, one should be able
          to make white globules, which do not remain alive in any
          artificial medium, live in sea water... </p>
        <p>It is here that many researchers, even courageous ones, even
          those trustful in the accuracy of their assumption, would have
          taken some precautions.&nbsp; It had been easy, indeed, to
          carry out experiments in total insulation in order not to lose
          face if the experimentation contradicted the postulate. But
          Rene Quinton chooses the risk, defies it, and in facing the
          test, which is essential, refuses the subterfuges. </p>
        <b> </b>
        <p>It is at the pathological Laboratory of Physiology of the
          High Studies of the Collège de France, the laboratory of
          Marey, where he is assistant, and in the presence of several
          researchers to whom he will present the proof of the
          postulates that he advances.&nbsp; We are in 1897. </p>
        <p>In the group of experiments of which I will speak of
          initially, he proposes to withdraw from a dog, by totally
          bleeding it, part of its interior milieu, and to replace it by
          an equal quantity of sea water, reduced to isotonicity - I
          will come back later to this aspect which is also capital. </p>
        <p>Then, the total and complete bleeding would cause the death
          of the animal if it is abandoned and left to its own
          resources. Moreover, the experiment withdraws not only a
          considerable part of the&nbsp; interior medium itself, but
          also the cellular part that sea water cannot restore to the
          animal.&nbsp; On the one hand, the respiratory function will
          be thus be affected gravely for lack of oxygenation.&nbsp; In
          addition, there will be at the same time depletion of all the
          white globules inherent in the blood, even at the moment when
          the operation on the animal, handled without special
          precautions, has to fight against the infection determined by
          the intervention itself.&nbsp; The total bleeding thus puts
          the animal at the door of death, and this represents the most
          unfavourable conditions to overcome victoriously if sea water
          is deemed to have the least toxic disadvantage.&nbsp; For the
          experiment to succeed in spite of so many unfavourable
          factors, it would be necessary that sea water be indeed a
          perfect analogy to the interior medium.&nbsp; Can one say that
          a failure, under such risky conditions, would have really
          proven an error of concept?&nbsp; Admittedly not, because the
          difficulties were so significant. </p>
        <p>Let us return to the facts in all the dryness of the
          scientific talk, not without imagining easily pathetic
          situations, curiosity, the probable anxiety of the young
          scientist in spite of his competency which made Marey
          say:&nbsp; "Rene Quinton is a genius in doing experiments, and
          he knows how to choose the perfect&nbsp; experiment." </p>
        <p>Here follows a description of the Group 2 Experiments. </p>
        <p>Later, a doctor, Doctor Tussaud, said that he obtained the
          same results as Rene Quinton while completely bleeding a dog
          and then injecting it simple physiological salt solution. But
          by pushing the investigation, one learned that the animal had
          survived only two months, and in the most extreme state of
          exhaustion, hardly able get around the laboratory.&nbsp; There
          is therefore no comparison to the results, the physiological
          salt solution being only a pale sea water substitute, besides,
          Rene Quinton will bring more evidence later and others after
          him will do so as well. </p>
        <p>Perhaps I presented a light distorsion to the chronology,
          this experiment being classified, according to the enumeration
          of Rene Quinton, in the second group.&nbsp; But he forges
          ahead more for reasons of scientific exposure, and actually
          started by totally bleeding the dogs, to then resuscitate them
          thanks to the injections with sea water. </p>
        <p>"I assisted personally, with Doctor Hallion, at the first
          experiment made by Rene Quinton with the College of France",
          wrote Charles Julliot later.&nbsp; "And I can still see, some
          thirty-five years later, the stupefaction of all three of us,
          when we saw the animal return to life and again standing on
          its own four feet after having come back from so far!" </p>
        <p>I like this assessment of Rene Quinton, always so sure of
          himself, with this impatiently awaited result, and one
          imagines so well the amazement of the sorcerer's apprentices
          to see the unhappy dog fully resurrected! </p>
        <p>The first group of experiments, which undoubtedly strikes
          less one's imagination, is however quite as significant for
          the biologists and physiologists. One proposes here to
          intravenously inject sea water, using a superior Vertebrate.
          If the interior medium of the animal is a marine environment,
          the sea water will have to behave in the organization like a
          vital medium, and not represent any toxic phenomenon there.
          The injectable quantity planned for the first dog is enormous
          here: 6 kg and 600 G, for an animal of 10 kg, this being 66%
          of its weight. </p>
        <p>The temerity of Rene Quinton seems really unreasonable, since
          nothing prevented him from starting with amounts much lower.
          There is a kind of demon in this man, like a deviant who wants
          to rape the secret of nature not only by facing it but also by
          taunting the gods... </p>
        <p>It is really not by chance that he stacks thus, once more,
          systematically all the chances against him. All indication
          leads one to believe that one will not introduce with impunity
          into an organism such a considerable quantity of foreign
          liquid, as vital as it seems to be!&nbsp; One will impose on
          the system an abnormal overload, abrupt or prolonged,
          according to speed, strong or low, of the injection.&nbsp; As
          for the kidneys, by which the elimination of the foreign
          liquid is carried out, one will ask for them an effort out of
          all proportions with their usual work. </p>
        <p>It is not the experiments of Rene Quinton that I this time
          refer to, but to the experimentation&nbsp; file of Doctor
          Hallion, member of the Academy of Medicine, which I reproduce
          here.&nbsp; Not because of this distinction, but only because
          Hallion, wanting to know how far one could go in this way
          proposed by Rene Quinton, injecting a dog with 10 kg and 400g
          of [isotonic] seawater - 104% of its weight - in eleven hours
          forty minutes... exactly as if one injected a man weighing 60
          kilos, from noon until midnight approximately, 62kg and 400g
          of sea water! Here is, accurately recopied, the summary of the
          Hallion-Carrion experiment report of which was communicated,
          as it had been done for those [experiments] of Rene Quinton,
          at the Biology Society: </p>
        <p>"Crossbred basset hound. Calibrated weight ten kilos.&nbsp;
          Rectal temperature: 39.7 degrees C. Temperature of the
          injection:&nbsp; About 35 to 40 degrees C. The seawater
          injection's duration is 11:40 hrs. It&nbsp; reaches, at the
          end of this time, 104% of the weight of the animal. </p>
        <p>...&nbsp; during the entire period of injection, no
          agitation, no diarrhoea, no albuminuria, all reflexes.&nbsp;
          The animal does not cease following the operator with its eyes
          and reacts to each caress. The rectal temperature, with only
          slight variations, descends to a low of 36.8 degrees C. At the
          end of the injection, it is 37.2 degrees C and the animal has
          received at this time 10kg, 400g of sea water, and excreted
          3kg, 400g of urine approximately. </p>
        <p>...&nbsp; the animal, put on its legs one hour, ten minutes
          after the end of the injection, walks around at once with all
          the appearances of a normal dog, except a light limp due to
          the binding of the legs, maintained during all the duration of
          the experiment. One hour, ten minutes later, rectal
          temperature:&nbsp; 39 degrees C. The following day, fourteen
          hours after the end of the injection, the animal, remarkably
          alert and gregarious, gallops and jumps through the
          laboratory. It eats, in two sittings, six hundred grams of
          meat and drinks hundred grams of water. The urine collected
          during the night has a slight albuminous cloudiness. The
          following day, 14 hours after the end of the injection, the
          dog continues to present the same aspect, sharper than before
          the experiment.&nbsp; Neither diarrhoea, nor vomiting, nor any
          disorder. Albumin decreases and then disappears." </p>
        <p>Pushed by his experimental passion, Rene Quinton widens this
          first group while injecting a dog, this time abruptly, a
          considerable quantity of sea water, in order not to give the
          kidney time to eliminate it and to thus transform the
          organization into a marine water mass. For the poor animal,
          the dangers of such an attempt are appalling due to the
          enormous and abrupt overload which it imposes on the economy.
          In 90 minutes, one injects this dog of 5 kilos a quantity of
          3,500g sea water. Quickly, there is an enormous abdominal
          distension making the animal unrecognizable, with cardiac
          deceleration, the temperature, from 38.2 degree c at the
          beginning, falls to 32.5 degrees C; renal elimination
          decreases. Then the corneal reflex disappears. Once the
          injection is finished, the temperature goes up, renal
          elimination accelerates, the corneal reflex reappears.
          Detached, the animal staggers. Its distension makes it
          unrecognizable. It takes some steps and collapses. The shock
          has been violent, and the animal has trouble to recover! But
          on the eleventh day, "...&nbsp; the animal, entirely
          re-established, presents a cheerfulness and an extreme
          exuberance, in spite of having been in a cellar for five days.
          Its weight did not vary, it totaled five kilos ". </p>
        <p>Rene Quinton now approaches the third group of experiments,
          so hazardous that his Masters with the Collège de France,
          Balbiani, Malassez, Henneguy, impassioned by his research,
          advise him to steer clear of experimentation that could only
          result in total failure, even though such failure, given the
          apparently insurmountable difficulties of the task, would have
          been entirely insignificant. Rene Quinton himself does not
          believe in success either, he will admit later, but it is
          those who cheered him on who said: "It is not necessary to
          hope in order to succeed..." </p>
        <p>At any rate, the white globule was the cell of choice, and,
          if the young scientist could prove its survival in sea water,
          the game was definitively won. All the other cells of the
          organism live only a local life, but the red globules, in
          spite of their appearance of mobility and their diffusion, are
          limited to a closed vascular system. The white globule
          primarily only see general life of the organism, in contact
          with all tissues, in the whole body. But its delicacy is such
          that it does not live in any artificial medium, and any
          artificial solution esults in quick death. Only the natural
          liquids of the organism keeps it alive. </p>
        <p>The experiment relates to Fish (tench), the Batrachians
          (frog), the Reptiles (lizard), the Mammals (man, rabbit, dog),
          the Birds (capuchin of China, hen). A unit of blood is taken
          from each subject and is diluted in sea water in order to
          observe either the continuity or the ceasing of life of the
          white globule in this new medium. </p>
        <p>Total success:&nbsp; in all the cases, with all the tested
          species, the bathed white globules of the marine liquid
          continued to present the various signs of a normal life,
          adherence, refringence, and amiboïd movements.&nbsp; Thus,
          through all the various branches of vertebrates, the
          experiments of Group III also show the persistence of the
          original marine environment like being THE vital medium of the
          organic cells. </p>
        <p>Rene Quinton and his entourage of scientists can now
          summarize. Into the first group, one injected an organism
          (please forgive them for calling a dog an 'organism - we know
          better today but during those days, scientists did not have to
          be politically 'correct' nor did they have the laws that
          protect or regulate animal experimentation) a quantity of sea
          water, equivalent approximately to three times the mass of its
          interior medium.&nbsp; As the kidneys eliminated at the rate
          of the injection, and that this elimination obviously
          related&nbsp; to the interior medium at well as to the liquid
          of injection, it so happened that at the end of the injection,
          a very significant part of the medium interior was eliminated
          and replaced by sea water. The new interior medium, bathing
          all the organic cells, was thus partly of sea water,
          introduced in the&nbsp; experiments. However, not only did
          this substitution not harm the general life of the organism,
          but the animal then was more alert than before the experiment.
          [Medical] Renal work can make it possible to appreciate the
          integrity of cellular life in the presence of sea water, since
          the renal cells of the Dog, eliminating in a normal state 150
          grams of urine in twelve hours, eliminated some 10kg&nbsp;
          during the experiment, that is to say sixty times more. </p>
        <p>In the experiments of the second group, the sea water
          injection practised immediately after the total bleeding,
          allowed leucocytosis to be victorious against the infection,
          namely the fast reconstitution of the [organism's] forces, the
          surprisingly prompt repair of the red globules. Sea water thus
          presented all the proof of the qualities which one could
          expect from the interior medium itself. </p>
        <p>Lastly, in the experiments of the third group, the white
          blood cells, a perfect example of the interior medium, proved
          that sea water, substituted completely for the interior medium
          of various animals, allows the survival of one of the most
          delicate cells of the organism. </p>
        <p>Was all this just a series of good luck? One can win the
          first prize in the lottery... but not ten times in a row, the
          theory of probability is not in agreement! And the
          identicalness (sameness) of the interior medium of vertebrates
          and sea water cannot be explained by a combination of
          circumstances, as certain people sometimes lightly
          suggest.&nbsp; The bird and the higher mammal do not live
          exclusively close to the sea or on the sea; they do not eat
          food rich in sea salt. Their basic food is vegetables,
          [grasses and seeds,] therefore very far away from the salty
          composition of the sea.&nbsp; The same goes for temperature.
          We are dealing here with a phenomenon of constancy with
          reference to cellular origin, with the conservation by the
          interior medium, in spite of new conditions, of the original
          marine environment. </p>
        <p>Although he did not yet, at that time, establish the chemical
          evidence, Rene Quinton thus considers that his assumptions had
          become a law, the law of marine constancy, and it reads as
          follows: </p>
        <p>Translation: "Animal life, that had originally appeared in
          cellular form in the seas, tends to maintain, for its best
          cellular functioning throughout the zoological species, its
          fundamental cells in a marine environment similar to its
          origin". </p>
        <p>Original in French - "La vie animale, apparue à l'état de
          cellule dans les mers, tend à maintenir, pour son haut
          fonctionnement cellulaire, à travers la série zoologique, les
          cellules constitutives des organismes dans le milieu marin des
          origines." </p>
        <p>Note: Rene Quinton evaluated the interior medium to be a
          third of the weight of an organism, and this is a proportion
          that is much lower than the current more moderate estimates. </p>
        <p>See our article "Comparative study of the Therapeutic
          Properties of Seawater Preparations" by Dr. André Passebecq,
          MD, ND, Ph.D. and Dr. Jean-Marc Soulier, Ph.D, Pharmacist. </p>
        <b>
          <p><b>THE CONCLUSION ---</b> </p>
        </b>
        <p>And here it is said slightly differently... "Animal life,
          having appeared in cellular form in the oceans, tends to
          maintain, in its highest cellular functioning throughout the
          entire zoological series, the constituent cells of the
          organisms in the 'quasi' original marine [internal]
          environment." </p>
        <p>Quinton implies that animal life has maintained within the
          entire body the original marine environment in its intra- and
          extra-cellular fluids. It is for this reason, for therapeutic
          applications, isotonic seawater has been found so incredibly
          compatible with animal/human plasma - even in exaggerated
          amounts - without other adjunctive products or procedures. </p>

          <p>" The marine treatment which we have practiced in the
            Parisian hospital services (St. Louis, Beaujon, Hotel-Dieu,
            Tenon, Maison Dubois, Pitie and the Asylum of Mouleau)
            consisted of injecting our seawater which we reduced to
            organic isotonic consistency , per dosage for this mixture,
            to one hundredth to one hundredth and a half of the body
            weight. </p>
          <p>"The first injections I practiced (July - August 1897) were
            intra-venous injections. In my absence, in a desperate case
            of cirrhosis, death being anticipated for that same day, a
            temporary intern obtained complete success after a
            subcutaneous injection of my preparation which he
            administered without any hope. The patient left the hospital
            on his own two weeks later. </p>
          <p>"I don't provide my formula as being final or the best one
            could use. I thought one had to inject the isotonic way in
            order to avoid unknown or troublesome factors, however I
            learned from physicians of the Marine Service who have had
            excellent results from simply injecting my preparation in
            its natural form. This practice would have the advantage of
            reducing by two thirds the volume to inject - a comparative
            experience would have to be tried. I limited the dosage to
            one hundredth or one hundredth and a half of the injection
            volume because it seemed to me that this dosage (same
            concentration as human plasma) was sufficient to produce the
            immediate effects of a double or triple dose, however, it is
            not established that a stronger dose by itself would have
            any advantages, which I have not had the occasion to
            observe. </p>
          <p>"The quality of the liquid to be injected provided more
            precise observations which could be summarized with
            finality. It no use to contemplate the composition of an
            artificial seawater. It must be treated according to my
            protocol and reduced to approximate organic isotonicity." </p>
          <p>Minimal injection dose: This depends on the condition of
            the patient. Please consult the Success Cases for guidance.
          </p>
          <p>Frequency of injections: When the injections must be
            repeated: every five days, then every six, seven, eight days
            etc., according to the readily discernible duration of its
            effects (see details further down). </p>
          <p><i>Effects from the Injection(s):</i> </p>
          <p>"When several injection are to be done on the same patient,
            it is best to inject at the same place. The local pain of
            the first injection will only be slightly felt during
            subsequent injections. </p>
          <p>"An injections is followed by a reaction that lasts about
            twelve hours. At a certain variable moment (one hour, two
            hours or three hours after and sometimes even while
            performing the injection itself if it is done slowly), the
            patient will feel chilly, sometime violently so, with
            chattering teeth and more or less intense thirst. Body
            temperature will rise without interruption during four or
            five hours (about 1.5 to 2.0 degrees C) and then will come
            down as it came up to finally stabilize below the initial
            temperature. The thirsty patient will drink 1 to 3 liters of
            water. He typically has absolutely no appetite, may have
            some nausea or slight headaches. The more this reaction is
            felt the more benefit will be derived from the injection. In
            any case, it is not to be feared with regardless of the
            weakness of the patient or his initial temperature. In the
            case of febrility, when the temperature before the injection
            is 39.5 degrees C, it can rise to 41.5 C and even remain for
            six consecutive hours at 41 degrees C without the slightest
            inconvenience. </p>
          <p>"Twenty-four hours after the injection, one finds the
            patient generally down, not only because of the crisis which
            just happened but also due to the resulting partial
            insomnia. The improvement is however evident by certain
            symptoms that begin to clearly show, in favorable cases,
            around the 36th hour or the latest on the second day. The
            improvements are constant and are progressive during the 3rd
            and 4th days. One can witness sometimes a veritable
            resurrection of the patient. Striking by its suddenness: all
            pain or uneasiness that may have been present before the
            injection have left; strength returns; appetite -
            non-existent before the treatment - becomes exaggerated with
            sudden hunger and the patient, bedridden for weeks, arises
            sand walks around for several hours. </p>
          <p>"On the fifth day, in the morning --- complete change. The
            scene is dominated by the same general weakness as prevailed
            before the treatment, except in acute cases where one
            injection suffices to produce a definite improvement. A
            second injection is therefore administered. The described
            cycle of effects occur once again but with more pronounced
            improvements. </p>
          <p>"The injections are spaced out in this natural manner for
            five, six, seven, eight days - according to the benefits
            that are obtained. </p>
          <p>"The difficulties which I had to face, when the Arcachon
            station could no longer send me the seawater that was
            treated according to my protocol, have successively
            interrupted many of my [clinical] trials. As a collective
            group, my preparations nevertheless seem to have proven to
            be a powerful adjunctive therapy. </p>
          <p>"In three particularly grave acute cases, infectious
            gastro-enteritis of indeterminate nature, oxalic acid
            poisoning, advanced liver cirrhosis, success was immediate
            and complete. In the case of syphilis, one early malignant
            syphillitis and one advanced case, the injection was
            followed, right from the second day, by very rapid healing
            of the lesions which covered the patient's body. In one
            case, healing was mostly complete after seven days. We
            obtained the same results in cutaneous tuberculosis. </p>
          <p>"The therapeutic action of seawater is therefore evident.
            Future trials should measure and evaluate it further." </p>

          <p><b>HYPERTONIC OR ISOTONIC Seawater SOLUTIONS</b></p>
        </center>
        <p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE --- The Solution is to be taken orally
          on an empty stomach 20 to 30 minutes before meals or at least
          1 1/2 - 2 hours after meals. The Solution is to be taken pure
          (hypertonic) or isotonic (diluted in water by 2/3). For
          children who find the product too salty, it may be taken
          diluted in some milk or juice. The Solution may be taken on a
          short term basis, over several weeks or months, or regularly
          year round, according to individual requirements. This product
          is not classified as a drug but is considered by traditional
          medicine an energy-boosting, re-balancing and regenerating
          nutritional supplement. Seawater Hypertonic Solution is
          suitable for all except those who suffer from high blood
          pressure, a heart condition, kidney disease, eczema or
          psoriasis. In such cases, Isotonic "OCEAN WATER" should be
          employed for several weeks and then one can switch over to
          hypertonic solution. "OCEAN WATER" Isotonic Solution is also
          recommended for elderly people. 10 ml per day is usually
          sufficient but sometimes two may be needed. </p>
        <p>The general dosage is as follows: </p>
        <p>From birth to one year of age - 10 ml in the feeding bottle
          every other day. <br>
          From 1 to 4 years of age - 10 ml daily away from meals <br>
          Over 4 years of age - 10 to 40 ml daily according to the
          severity of the case <br>
          Adults - 30 to 60 ml daily according to the severity of the
          case <br>
          Elderly people - 10 to 20 ml per day, or as required --- over
          several months </p>
        <p><i>Seawater NASAL SPRAY 150 ml Flask</i> </p>
        <p>Some people mistakenly believe that this nasal spray contains
          a mixture of water and salt. This, however, is not the case.
          Salt is highly irritating to the mucus membranes and it has no
          anti-inflammatory or healing properties. The spray contains
          Isotonic Solution. It can be used at any age: by infants,
          children, teenagers, adults and elderly people. Press down the
          nozzle gently to release the spray. </p>
        <p>COLDS: From the onset of any nasal congestion or the
          appearance of runny or stuffy nose, spray 4 to 6 times a day
          into each nostril. <br>
          SINUSITIS: Acute sinusitis: see Colds. Chronic sinusitis:
          Spray 3 to 4 times a day into each nostril. Avoid milk, beer,
          sweets and junk foods. <br>
          EXCESSIVE DRYNESS OF NASAL CAVITIES: Spray once into each
          nostril on a regular basis, morning and evening. <br>
          ALLERGIES: Spray 3 to 6 times a day as needed. <br>
          EAR INFECTIONS: Medical treatment can be supplemented by
          spraying 3 to 4 times a day into each ear. <br>
          SKIN moisturizing: For tired, dry or devitalized skin, spray
          on face or other parts of the body. Allow to dry. </p>
        <p><b>RECOMMENDED DOSES of ISOTONIC Seawater solution for the
            treatment of ECZEMA, HIVES or RASHES, PSORIASIS and other
            related skin diseases ---</b> </p>
        <p>1 - If taken orally (by an adult) First 10 days: 10 ml a day.
          Following 10 days: 20 ml a day. ; After that, if the skin
          eruptions begin to fade, continue to take 20 ml a day.
          Otherwise, alternate between 20 ml a day and 30 ml a day until
          eruptions begin to fade. If necessary, 30 ml a day may be
          taken. In obstinate cases of psoriasis, it is recommended that
          the dose be increased to 40 ml a day. To minimize the influx
          of toxins it is important to carefully watch the patient's
          diet for signs of inappropriate choices. When the lesions have
          disappeared, gradually taper off the number of mls taken until
          complete healing has occurred. External application of ginkgo
          biloba cream to psoriasis blemishes will help fade them more
          rapidly.--- If injected (subcutaneously or intravenously or
          intramuscularly) First 2 weeks: 20 cc (20 ml) every second
          day. Following 2 weeks: 30cc (30 ml) every second day. When
          the eruptions have faded: 30 ml every third day, then 20 ml
          every second day, then 20 ml once a week. Decrease the dose
          gradually until healing is complete. Seawater Isotonic
          Solution is available in boxes of 300 ml and containers of one
          (1) liter. Rene Quinton's shock treatment for Psoriasis
          (subsequently used successfully by many physicians) is as
          follows: Subcutaneous administration in the
          retro-trocharterian area 6 weeks of treatment. First week: 30
          ml every second day 3 times a week. Second week: 50 ml every
          second day 3 times a week. Third week: 70 ml every second day
          3 times a week. The improvement is spectacular, the lesions
          fade away without the use of standard medical treatment. In
          the light of the results obtained, the dose should be adapted
          to the patient's individual response as follows: Fourth week:
          120 ml every second day 3 times a week. Fifth week: 180 ml
          every second day 3 times a week. Sixth week: 200 ml every
          second day 3 times a week. Where there is mild persistence of
          symptoms, the initial treatment may be repeated after a pause
          of 2 months. To ensure that adequate and appropriately correct
          nutrition is obtained, it is recommended that the patient
          consult a knowledgeable Health Professional (not necessarily
          nutritionist). From 1952 to 1957, the French physician Jean
          Montfort studied over 600 clinical cases of this complaint as
          part of a medical team. Results of his research revealed that
          improvements tend to appear after the first injection as well
          as the third week. Dr. Jean Montfort treated his patients
          exclusively with OCEAN WATER without the addition of
          corticosteroids or antibiotics. He emphasized the absence of
          iatrogenic side effects in using OCEAN WATER as well as the
          surprising results obtained. Many of these patients showed no
          signs of relapse after 20 years. </p>
        <p><b>Depletion of the IMMUNE SYSTEM ---</b> </p>
        <p>In all instances of recurring infections, no matter what
          type, or in cases of frequent antibiotic administration,
          regular intake of one of the "OCEAN WATER" Seawater Solutions
          can rebuild a depleted immune system. In view of the
          established fact that OCEAN WATER regenerates the internal
          terrain, without diagnosis, being non-specific, one would be
          tempted to ask whether this substance would not be of great
          value in cases of AIDS and related diseases! Historically, an
          uninterrupted 3 to 4 month course of treatment is recommended.
          In severe cases, 6 months may be necessary. To keep fit, a
          twice yearly course of treatment is recommended in September
          and October - then in March and April. Infants under one year:
          10 ml daily in the baby's bottle. From 2 to 5 years of age: 20
          ml a day. 5 years and up, children, adolescents and adults: 30
          ml a day for the first 3 weeks, then reduce to 20 ml a day.
          HYPERTONIC and ISOTONIC Solution in cases of ACUTE or CHRONIC
          FATIGUE </p>
        <p><i>Acute fatigue</i>: Where the fatigue is temporary and has
          only just recently arisen: An intensive course of treatment of
          30 to 40 ml a day for 2 to 3 weeks is recommended. If the
          fatigue is more deeply rooted and has reached a more
          debilitating phase: 30 to 40 ml a day for 3 weeks, then reduce
          to 20 ml a day until recovery is complete. Chronic Fatigue: 30
          ml a day, 40 if desired, for 3 to 6 weeks, then reduce to 20
          ml a day until recovery is complete. In all cases of chronic
          fatigue, it is imperative to exclude the following from one's
          diet: peanut butter, alcohol, all forms of sugar (even natural
          sugars) excepting fresh fruit (i.e. no dates, no figs, no
          raisins, no prunes etc...). It would be wise to consult a
          Health Professional who is familiar with a natural and living
          diet in order to ensure adequate and nourishing nutrient
          quality and quantity. </p>
        <p><b>BONE and JOINT DISEASE: GROWING PAINS in Children,
            ARTHROSIS and OSTEOPOROSIS in Adults : </b>--- </p>
        <p>"OCEAN WATER" Hypertonic Solution is a powerful reminalizer
          and is, therefore, particularly suitable in cases of bone and
          joint disorders. In such cases, however, it must be remembered
          that wear and tear on bones and joints have occurred slowly
          over long periods and, consequently, the remineralization
          process will also be gradual. Adults suffering from arthrosis
          or osteoporosis should consider taking the Solution regularly
          over a period of 6 months to a year. An increase in bone
          density is observable using densitometry after only 6 months
          of treatment. Dosage: Growing pains in children: 20 ml daily -
          30 to 40 ml daily in periods of crisisArthrosis and

        <p>OCEAN WATER and the Seawater therapy itself constitute a
          valuable adjunctive therapy in the medical treatment of these
          diseases. While it is certainly not organ-specific, it does
          normalize cell electrolytes, pH values and mineral imbalances
          as well as increase overall vitality. OCEAN WATER has a rapid
          beneficial impact on the entire body system. Therefore, it
          should not be discussed as a specific cancer cure but be
          seriously considered for its great regenerating potential. Any
          therapy for degenerative diseases should always be combined
          with a wholesome, LIVING, RAW and saltless diet. Any cooked
          and processed foods would only hinder the process of healing.
          A competent practitioner in natural nutrition should be
          consulted even before starting the OCEAN WATER Seawater
          therapy or any other therapy. 40 to 60 ml must be taken
          regularly every day over a period of many months. In certain
          cases, the Plasma should be administered by injection for
          maximum effect. Injections of 30 to 60cc (30 to 60 ml) may be
          given every second day throughout the first two months.
          Advanced stages of the disease may require higher doses.
          Subsequent treatment, when appropriate, may be tapered off
          from a single injection twice a week to once a week. </p>

        <p>Modern advances in Physiology and Molecular Biochemistry make
          it easier to comprehend the greatsimilarity in mineral content
          of the inner environment and sea water with their common
          origin. This similarity makes it possible for any organism to
          select or reject what it needs in a natural way. The
          assimilation or elimination of marine ions is made possible
          through cellular receptors with a high degree of accuracy by
          the identifying polarity derived from biocenosis.
          Cold-sterilized Isotonic sea water is usually eliminated
          through the kidneys. This eliminated sea water tends to be
          twice as concentrated and twice as voluminous as artificial
          physiological serum. TOTAL OSMOSIS OCCURS BETWEEN THE PLASMA
          AND THE INNER FLUID ENVIRONMENT. The advantages of Seawater
          Isotonic Solution in colonic hydrotherapy: (9‰- this is 1/3 of
          normal salt/mineral concentration of original seawater ).
          Physiological irrigation and cleansing of the intestinal
          membranes. Anti-anaphylactic action of sea water.
          Re-absorption of micro-nutrients and minerals through the
          portal vein. Physiological stabilization in case of
          insufficient potassium. Anti-inflammatory and anti-spasmodic
          action as required in adjustable doses. In cases of infection:
          optimum absorption results. Strengthens the immune system.
          Using Marine Plasma SLIGHTLY DILUTED (21 - i.e.2/3 normal
          salt/mineral concentration of original seawater): An immediate
          REVITALIZING and ENERGY-BOOSTING effect is obtained. Seawater
          may be used exclusively for the entire Colonic Hydrotherapy
          session. Alternatively, the fluid may be used only in the
          final stages of the irrigation. The almost 100 year clinical
          history of the OCEAN WATER ensures the high quality and safety
          of the product. </p>

        <p>Dr. Pistor, who created the method of mesotherapy, defined it
          as: A special means for the intradermal introduction of a
          water soluble drug into the system. This definition reinforces
          the theory behind the technique for the administration of
          OCEAN WATER. The technique advocated the use of
          cold-sterilized Isotonic sea water for sub-cutaneous
          administration. </p>
        <p>Mesotherapy introduces small quantities of active ingredients
          usually transported by an artificial physiological serum. </p>
        <p>The superiority of OCEAN WATER over synthetic serum has been
          clearly demonstrated by abundant clinical bibliography. Such a
          bibliography indicates all the advantages that may be acquired
          by a practicing "Mesotherapist" in using cold-sterilized
          Isotonic sea water. </p>
        <p>The clinical practice of rehydration has been in existence
          for almost a hundred years and the best way to carry it out is
          by "Hypodermoclysis". Nowadays, this application is coming
          back into use after having been unjustifiably assigned to
          medical oblivion. &nbsp; <br>
        </p>
        <p>Specialized medical journals reflect this trend
          accurately.(l)<br>
        </p>
        <p>The aim of Mesotherapy is "to bring the remedy as close as
          possible to the site of the disease." This method must,
          therefore, take into account the advantages of using
          cold-sterilized Isotonic sea water.&nbsp; These advantages
          include the following:</p>
        <b><br>
        </b>Use as an active ingredient&nbsp; use as a vehicle for other
        active ingredients. The topical action of OCEAN WATER has
        already been demonstrated particularly in dermatology: in the
        treatment of psoriasis, eczema, rashes and burns. In cases of
        psoriasis, the clearing up of lesions is significant. It takes
        only a few days for a distinct improvement in pruritis to be
        observed. The method involves administering small 1ml doses
        intradermally around the lesions. Cleansing the lesions with
        Seawater Hypertonic Solution is recommended as the next step. As
        a vehicle for the transportation of active ingredients, the
        Plasma replaces synthetic physiological serums. Dr. Bernard Guez
        (2) perfected the technique of "tumescent percutaneous
        hydrotomy" which was used in 80 000 instances of medical
        treatment. The technique is the best example of the therapeutic
        role of water using cold-sterilized Isotonic sea water for its
        carrier effect. Where Seawater Isotonic Solution is concerned,
        this method is also directed towards: providing a natural
        topical liquid similar to interstitial fluid. providing a
        vehicle for other active ingredients. In articular Mesotherapy,
        the principal function of Seawater Isotonic Solution is to
        provide a remedy for "dysirrigation", in particular, processes
        of bone deterioration such as arthrosis and osteoporosis, or to
        improve anoxia of the tissues.(2) The topical application of the
        Solution to the affected areas makes it possible to provide
        healing elements which will regularize the condition of the
        lesion. <b>

                OCEAN WATER</b></p>
          </center>
          <p>Frequency: At the start of a series of treatments,
            injections (subcutaneous, intra-muscular, or intra-venous)
            are usually given every second day - 2 or 3 times a week. In
            case of terminal stage patients and cholera, they are given
            twice a day up to ten days in a row. The injections are then
            reduced to 2-3 times weekly. As the situation improves,
            injections are given less frequently, however they should
            not be abandoned too soon. Dosage: For children over five,
            adolescents and adults, the injections usually start at
            25-30cc and are gradually increased to 50, 75, 100 or even
            200cc if the response is not entirely satisfactory. In case
            of eczema, the dosages should always remain low. High
            dosages will cause strong adverse reactions. Cholera and
            patients in terminal stage require a high starting dosage,
            typically 2 x 250cc per day. For children under five, the
            dosages start at 20cc. When health state improves, the
            injections may be given only once or twice a week. Even if
            the illness symptoms have disappeared, the treatment should
            not be discontinued immediately. According to Doctors
            Jarricot, Rene Quinton and others, the effect of an Isotonic
            Plasma injection lasts about 12 hours. In the following
            first, second or third hour, the patient may get chills,
            which may be strong reactions or completely absent or
            anything in between. The body temperature occasionally rises
            from 1 to 2 degrees Celsius during the 4-5 hours following
            the injection but it then drops below the original
            temperature. Thirst is also to be expected and therefore
            appreciable quantities of water (1-3 liters or quarts) could
            be consumed by the patient. Lack of appetite, slight
            headache, or nausea are among the possible after-effects of
            the injection. However, these reactions should not be of any
            concern, since the improvements which follows these
            reactions will be proportional to the time of progressive
            recovery. Twenty-four hours after the injection, the patient
            may feel tired but an improvement clearly shows up in the
            next 36 to 48 hours. This improvement will persist and
            intensify on the third and fourth day. In certain cases, it
            may even be spectacular. On the fifth day, the patient might
            feel a bit down again. That is when the second injection is
            given. The cycle will repeated again but the adverse
            reactions will gradually diminish while the improvements
            rapidly increase. In many cases, important recoveries were
            observed after the third or fourth injection. Wounds and
            ulcers start to heal. Eczema stops to ooze, dead skin starts
            to peel off etc. Although the symptoms of illness have
            completely disappeared, the injections should not be
            interrupted at once. They should be continued for one or two
            more weeks and given again, from time to time, depending on
            the patient's state.<br>
          </p>
          <p>SOME CAUSES OF FAILURE TO SHOW RESULTS <br>
          </p>
          <p>An analysis of the failures of Rene Quinton's therapeutic
            methods shows that: In a large majority of these cases, the
            therapist did not employ the necessary or commended dosages
            of the injections. A double (second) injection during a
            twenty-four hour interval was not attempted. An
            inappropriate diet was used (particularly in the case of
            infants and the elderly) The treatment injections were
            interrupted too early. <br>
          </p>
          <p>ORIGINAL ISOTONIC SEAWATER INJECTION PROTOCOL <br>
          </p>
          <p>The above is today's treatment protocol. What follows is
            Rene Quinton's original Protocol... The marine treatment
            which we have practiced in the Parisian hospital services
            (St. Louis, Beaujon, Hotel-Dieu, Tenon, Maison Dubois, Pitie
            and the Asylum of Mouleau) consisted of injecting our
            seawater (now available as OCEAN WATER) which we reduced to
            organic isotonic consistency, per dosage for this mixture,
            to one hundredth to one hundredth and a half of the body
            weight. The first injections I practiced (July - August
            1897) were intra-venous injections. In my absence, in a
            desperate case of cirrhosis, death being anticipated for
            that same day, a temporary intern obtained complete success
            after a sub-cutaneous injection of my preparation which he
            administered without any hope. The patient left the hospital
            on his own two weeks later. I don't provide my formula as
            being final or the best one could use. I thought one had to
            inject the isotonic way in order to avoid unknown or
            troublesome factors, however I learned from physicians of
            the Marine Service who have had excellent results from
            simply injecting my preparation in its natural form (now
            available under the name of Seawater Hypertonic Plasma - a
            revitalizing dietary supplement). This practice would have
            the advantage of reducing by two thirds the volume to inject
            - a comparative experience would have to be tried. I limited
            the dosage to one hundredth or one hundredth and a half of
            the injection volume because it seemed to me that this
            dosage (same concentration as human plasma) was sufficient
            to produce the immediate effects of a double or triple dose,
            however, it is not established that a stronger dose by
            itself would have any advantages, which I have not had the
            occasion to observe. The quality of the liquid to be
            injected provided more precise observations which could be
            summarized with finality. It no use to contemplate the
            composition of an artificial seawater. It must be treated
            according to my protocol and reduced to approximate organic
            isotonicity (available now in the form of Seawater Isotonic
            Plasma). Minimal injection dose: 700g, for an adult with an
            average weight of 65 kg. Frequency of injections: When the
            injections must be repeated: every five days, then every
            six, seven, eight days etc., according to the readily
            discernible duration of its effects (see details further
            down). When several injections are to be done on the same
            patient, it is best to inject at the same place. The local
            pain of the first injection will only be slightly felt
            during subsequent injections. An injections is followed by a
            reaction that lasts about twelve hours. At a certain
            variable moment (one hour, two hours or three hours after
            and sometimes even while performing the injection itself if
            it is done slowly), the patient will feel chilly, sometime
            violently so, with chattering teeth and more or less intense
            thirst. Body temperature will rise without interruption
            during four or five hours (about 1.5 to 2.0 degrees C) and
            then will come down as it came up to finally stabilize below
            the initial temperature. The thirsty patient will drink 1 to
            3 liters of water. He typically has absolutely no appetite,
            may have some nausea or slight headaches. The more this
            reaction is felt the more benefit will be derived from the
            injection. In any case, it is not to be feared regardless of
            the weakness of the patient or his initial temperature. In
            the case of febrility, when the temperature before the
            injection is 39.5 degrees C, it can rise to 41.5 C and even
            remain for six consecutive hours at 41 degrees C without the
            slightest inconvenience. Twenty-four hours after the
            injection, one finds the patient generally down, due not
            only because of the crisis which just happened but also due
            to the resulting partial insomnia. The improvement is
            however evident by certain symptoms that begin to clearly
            show, in favorable cases, around the 36th hour or the latest
            on the second day. The improvements are constant and are
            progressive during the 3rd and 4th days. One can witness
            sometimes a veritable resurrection of the patient. Striking
            by its suddenness: all pain or uneasiness that may have been
            present before the injection have left; strength returns;
            appetite - non-existent before the treatment - becomes
            exaggerated with sudden hunger and the patient, bedridden
            for weeks, arises and walks around for several hours. On the
            fifth day, in the morning - complete change. The scene is
            dominated by the same general weakness as prevailed before
            the treatment, except in acute cases where one injection
            suffices to produce a definite improvement. A second
            injection is therefore administered. The described cycle of
            effects occur once again but with more pronounced
            improvements. The injections are spaced out in this natural
            manner for five, six, seven, eight days - according to the
            benefits that are obtained. </p>

          <p>The difficulties which I had to face, when the Arcachon
            station could no longer send me the seawater that was
            treated according to my protocol, have successively
            interrupted many of my [clinical] trials. As a collective
            group, my preparations nevertheless seem to have proven to
            be a powerful adjunctive therapy. In three particularly
            grave acute cases, infectious gastro-enteritis of
            indeterminate nature, oxalic acid poisoning, advanced liver
            cirrhosis, success was immediate and complete. In the case
            of syphilis, one early malignant syphillitis and one
            advanced case, the injection was followed, right from the
            second day, by very rapid healing of the lesions which
            covered the patient's body. In one case, healing was mostly
            complete after seven days. We obtained the same results in
            cutaneous tuberculosis. </p>
          <p>The therapeutic action of seawater is therefore evident.
            Future trials should measure and evaluate it further." Rene

          <b>RICH CLINICAL HISTORY</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
        </b>Quinton Marine Plasma is a natural marine solution that has
        100 years of clinical evidence supporting its therapeutic and
        health regenerating properties. Since 1897 Quinton Marine Plasma
        has been harvested from a unique vortex plankton bloom in the
        Atlantic Ocean. Quinton marine plasma has been applied by
        thousands of doctors in clinical settings for over 100 years
        though out Europe. One publication summarized a 2,000 person,
        20-year follow-up study that evaluated Quinton™ for both safety
        and efficacy.<br>
        <b><br>
          <b>The History: René Quinton (1866-1925)</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
        </b>René Quinton was a recognized doctor, biologist, biochemist,
        and physiologist.<br>
        <br>
        René Quinton was committed to answering the profound question,
        “Where did all life begin?” It was this question that set him
        out on an expansive journey of discovery that led him to observe
        the life cycle that originated from deep within the center of
        seasonal vortex plankton blooms. There he observed whales and
        other large marine life converging at the bloom; he later
        confirmed that the phytoplankton blooms were consumed by
        hundreds of different species of zooplankton (commonly referred
        to as “pre-krill”), which, in turn, fed the krill that these
        enormous marine creatures consumed and on which they thrived.<br>
        <br>
        René Quinton captured samples of this microcosmic ocean
        environment and began to study its similarities to blood plasma.<br>
        <br>
        His study of the rich bio-active “live” mineral content unique
        to this plankton-fed ocean water led René Quinton to refer to it
        as “ocean plasma” and later “Quinton Ocean plasma” in his
        definitive book, L’eau de mer milieu organique (Seawater,
        Organic plasma).<br>
        <br>
        By the results achieved with his ocean plasma, Quinton was one
        of the financiers behind the Wright Brothers’ race to make air
        flight a reality. Quinton wanted to be able to bring ocean
        plasma to Africa. His dream was cut short when he was drafted
        into the French army during WWI. He later died in 1925 from war
        wounds.<br>
        <br>
        When René Quinton passed away, he was a French national hero. It
        is estimated that as many as 1 million people from all around
        the globe attended his funeral. In fact, in October, 2004, the
        French Ministry of Science and Health celebrated 100 years of
        Quinton™ science by holding a world symposium on the historical
        and contemporary oral use of Quinton ocean plasma.<br>
        <br>
        ”The germ is nothing, terrain is everything.” – Claude Bernard
        (1817-1920)<br>
        <br>
        René Quinton began organizing his theory on the Origin of Life
        which he summarized in his treatise, “L’Origin de Mere”
        published in 1907.<br>
        Evolutionary Understanding of Original Quinton™ Marine Plasma’s
        Mineral Component<br>
        <br>
        100 years ago, René Quinton substantiated 15 elements of the
        periodic table were present in marine plasma; he suspected the
        existence of five more, and concluded that the scientific
        community should find them all. Gradually, as the forms of
        analysis progressed, more and more elements were confirmed.<br>
        <br>
        Henry Doffin, Professor of Biology at the University of
        Poitiers, France in the 1950’s, was the first to state that deep
        seawater contained all of the known trace minerals. Doffin
        famously defined seawater as a “…formidable fluid mass, enriched
        by all the cells extracted from the rocks of the deep or
        delivered by the rivers; each liter is ‘panatonic’; that is, it
        contains all of the existing elements.” With this definition, he
        opened the debate that has brought numerous authors to give
        mathematical formula of such concentrations.<br>
        <br>
        Gregory and Overberger (USA) also stated that Mendeleve’s period
        classification is found complete in the water of the sea. Wanoff
        proposed 44 elements, Jean Dermey 61 and Laboratories Quinton
        Laboratories Quinton International, S.L. gave us 62. These are
        according to complex calculations of the concentration started
        from the ml, liter, or km, adapting to each element and the
        analysis methods of the time. This explains the multiple
        versions that are given on the composition of seawater in terms
        of its concentration.<br>
        <br>
        At present we should not refer exclusively to the “weighted
        chemistry” aspect, but also to this “infinitesimal chemistry”
        that is difficult to interpret and especially to measure out.<br>
        <br>
        It is evident that we should refer to molar concepts in order to
        give the most exact definition possible.<br>
        <br>
        The University of Miami (fig. 1) provides us with an
        indisputable scientific answer giving a molar approximation by
        “neuron diffraction spectrometry.” At the moment this is the
        most exact form to compare the qualitative composition of the
        TOTAL ion-minerals of seawater and its concentration.<br>
        <br>
        This gives us a TOTAL of 83 BIOAVAILABLE elements in NATURAL
        seawater at biological temperature. Each liter of seawater
        corresponds on average to 300 milligrams of prebiotic carbon
        derivatives, such as amino acids, sugars, vitamins, etc. The
        ions (present in liquid form, missing in sold form) are natural
        chemical and electronic elements that are transformed by the
        phyto-plankton and zoo-plankton in natural chains.<br>
        <br>
        They act by synergistic effect in a natural symbiosis with our
        organism whose liquid mineral formula is identical to seawater.<br>
        <br>
        Cold treatment maintains this composition and formula.<br>
