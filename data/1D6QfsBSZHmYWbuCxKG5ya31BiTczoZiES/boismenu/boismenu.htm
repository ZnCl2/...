    <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Paris engineer, M.E. de Boismenu,
      claims to have produced small diamonds by a new electric furnace
      method. It will be remembered that the late Prof. Moissan
      succeeded in obtaining very small diamonds (of microscopic size)
      in the electric furnace, but the process required special skill,
      and in any case the results were merely of scientific interest. M.
      de Boismenu employs a new principle, which has the advantage of
      being very easy to carry out in practice by a skilled operator.
      Moreover, the process will undoubtedly be further improved so as
      to secure larger specimens than those so far produced, which range
      up to 2-1/2 millimeters in diameter.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inventor occupies a prominent
      position as director of an electric carbide furnace plant in
      France and conceived the idea that the diamond could be produced
      by electrolysis of a bath of molten carbide between the usual
      carbon electrodes.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The furnace used is built of
      refractory brick and has two carbon electrodes 6-1/2 inches in
      diameter, one of which can be adjusted by hand. The bed of the
      furnace is first packed with a mixture of powdered lime and
      carbon, which serves to hold a trough-shaped receptacle made of
      fused calcium carbide, as this is found best to hold the molten
      bath within the furnace. The carbons work within this trough, and
      are packed around with rather large fragments of carbide. By
      leaving the current on the bath of molten carbide for a number of
      hours, an electrolytic action takes place by which the carbide is
      decomposed and the negative pole becomes surrounded by a black
      carbonaceous mass, in which are found embedded small crystals.
      These crystals answer all the tests for the diamond.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first conclusive operation was
      made on April 13, 1908, in the inventor’s experimental laboratory
      in the suburbs of Paris, using direct current from a small dynamo
      plant therein installed. After heating up the electrodes, they
      were drawn one inch apart, and calcium carbide was gradually fed
      in in small lumps, so as to produce a molten bath. The carbons
      were then gradually separated until finally they were 10 inches
      apart. The heat commenced at 11 a.m. and ended at 5 p.m. with a
      continuous run of 6 hours. The current used was 800 amperes at 34
      volts. There were 8 pounds of melted carbide in the bath. At 3
      o’clock a pile of carbide fragments were heaped upon the bath, and
      the whole was covered with a mixture of equal parts of lime and
      carbon so as to stop up the interstices, and finally the furnace
      was covered with two refractory slabs. The furnace ran in this way
      up to the end of the test, when the current was stopped and the
      furnace allowed to cool off overnight. The scoriaceous mass
      resulting from this operation, weighing from 600 to 700 grams, was
      placed in a vessel of water and allowed to remain overnight. The
      residue was examined the next morning. During the night it had
      disaggregated in the water and formed a black mud, which was
      decanted and then slowly dried over an alcohol lamp. At once M.
      Boismenu’s attention was attracted by small brilliant points
      standing out against the black background. He was able to pick
      these particles out by forceps and thus separated about a dozen of
      them. They appeared as small transparent crystals of somewhat
      irregular shape whose size varied from ½ to 1-1/2 millimeters.
      Under the microscope they showed the characteristic appearance of
      diamonds. The specimens will scratch a plate of glass under very
      slight pressure, and the scratches are deep and remarkably clear;
      steel can also be scratched by them.</blockquote>
    <div class="MsoNormal">
      <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From April 20<sup>th</sup> to June
        5<sup>th</sup> the furnace made fifteen runs, of which eleven
        were very successful. The last two of these, the furnace ran for
        12 hours with 700 to 800 amperes at 24 to 25 volts, and some of
        the crystals reached one-tenth of an inch in diameter. This
        seemed to be as far as one could go with the present small
        plant, and a new one will be required for further work. The
        specimens were submitted to two jewelers of Paris, who were
        unable to distinguish them from natural diamonds. One of the
        largest specimens could even be cut, and the author sent it to
        Amsterdam for the purpose. It was returned cut with 32 facets
        with remarkable dexterity.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M. de Boismenu hopes to be able to
        continue his experiments in the near future, provided that funds
        are forthcoming for installing an electric furnace upon a larger
        scale. In closing, we should mention that the process has been
        patented by the author.</blockquote>

              Processs and Apparatus for the Fabrication of Diamonds in
              the Electric Furnace</font></b> </center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been found that the metallic carbides
          originating by combination of carbon with the alkaline metals
          and alkaline-earths can be decomposed by electrolysis at very
          high temperatures, to give on one hand the metal and on the
          other hand the carbon that can collected in the neighborhood
          of the anode in the form of a diamond crystals, in the
          operating conditions of a properly established device. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When one electrolyzes an amenable metallic
          carbide in a molten bath in an electric furnace it must be
          protected from oxidizing conditions. It is difficult to
          contain this bath, and one must use materials that are more
          refractory, or it will react with the molten mass that is
          produced. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present invention has for its object a
          process and devices allowing collecting of diamonds, using the
          same principle, more easily and with a higher yield than it
          has been possible to do so far. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this effect, one has recourse to a
          furnace of a crucible form appropriately established in
          graphite or in agglomerated coal, and presenting the following
          particulars being able to exist separately or in combination:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The crucible and the electrodes, except
          for the end in the interior of the crucible, are nested in a
          mixture well coal cup and powder lime filling the envelope of
          the electric furnace. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The lower part of the crucible is
          surrounded by entouree by an annular refractory enclosure
          designed to receive the excess bath of fusion, and
          communicates with the crucible by suitable&nbsp; openings. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The electrodes are isolated and
          protected, having their entry in the crucible, by very
          refractory pipes or tubes, for example in magnesia. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The description which follows, when
          compared to the additional drawings and examples, will explain
          the nature and the advantages of the invention. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure 1 shows in cross section an
          electric furnace for the manufacture of diamond, established
          in accordance with the first mode of realization of the
          invention. </p>
        <p><img src="fig1.jpg" width="383" height="295"></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figures 2 and 3 show respectively furnaces
          established in accordance with the second and third modes of
          realization of the invention. </p>
        <p><img src="fig2.jpg" width="352" height="292"></p>
        <p><img src="fig3.jpg" width="262" height="193"><img
            src="fig3a.jpg" width="235" height="277"></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid the disadvantages mentioned
          above, the first procedure consists of making the electrolyzed
          calcium carbide in a crucible itself made out of calcium
          carbide and surrounded by a garnish constituted preferably by
          a mixture of lime powder 80% and powder coal 20%. During
          effective experiments, applicant has noted that it forms
          around this crucible, during the operation, a hard hull and
          impermeable has the air, constituted by lime having undergone
          a beginning of fusion and having crystallized. It is in the
          interior of this protective hull that the phenomena are
          carried out and the reactions form the synthetic diamond. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To regulate the electrolytic actions and
          to contain the fusion bath, it is advantageous to simply take
          a crucible out of coal graphite, or same in agglomerated
          carbon, by having recourse simultaneously to the provisions
          which will be indicated hereafter. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If one takes, for example, the ordinary
          furnace represented in Figure 1, the crucible B in the form of
          a cup, made of coal graphite or agglomated coal of very good
          quality; this crucible, which has advantageously a thickness
          of 3 centimeters, intended to receive the bath C of metallic
          carbide in fusion. The edges of this crucible are bored with
          two holes of suitable diameter to insert both electrodes,
          which are isolated and protected, while passing in the
          crucible, by very refractory tubes D, advantageously made of
          magnesia. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the lower part of the crucible an
          enclosure is formed for example annular channel&nbsp; E to
          receive the surplus of the bath of fusion, and the finished
          reactions which one wants to carry out. This channel
          preferably is constituted by refractory plates and and tubes
          provided with some vents, and it is in relation to the lower
          part of the crucible by openings F, example with two, and
          receiving a diameter of 2 to 3 cm. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole of the crucible, the enclosure
          and the electrodes, is nested in a mass G constituted by a
          mixture of coal and powder lime filling all the interior of
          the electric furnace. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another provision, represented in Figure
          2, consists in inclining the electrodes from 30 to 60 degrees.
          The shape of the crucible is slightly modified as it is seen
          Figure 2, and the other provisions of the operation remain the
          same. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One can finally, as Figure 3 shows it, lay
          out the electrodes vertically. In this case, the negative
          lower electrode H butts in a crucible B, made of coal graphite
          like previously, and the shape of chalice, and which is to
          joined to it by a threading K. The other provisions
          (enclosure, openings, and pulvurent mass) are the same ones
          that those described above. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During experiments which it have been
          effected, it is advantageous to leave with a tension of 30 to
          35 volts, in order to determine the size of the arc; then, as
          soon as the fusion bath is well formed, there is no more
          arcing. The furnace has a function in resistance and it is
          necessary to decrease the voltage, and to bring it for example
          around 25 volts. The intensity can be determined by choosing
          for example a current density of 3.5 amps by cq. o prevent
          excessive corrosion of the electrodes and parts of the
          furnace. In particular, the applicant has established and
          obtained resultants with a furnace provided with cylindrical
          coals having 11 to 12 cm of diameter and 1.20 to 1.25 meter in
          length, with a tension of 20 to 25 volts, an intensity of 500
          to 600 amps, and a power of 12 kw. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clearly understood that the
          numerical provisions and information which are indicated above
          are examples and by no means restrictive and which can be
          modified without leaving the framework of the invention.</p>
