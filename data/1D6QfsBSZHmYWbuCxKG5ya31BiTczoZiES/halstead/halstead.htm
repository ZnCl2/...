            bold;">FDA AND STATE AUTHORITIES WAR AGAINST NATURAL
            REMEDIES</span></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A decade's-long dispute between a highly
      respected physician/scientist and the State of California ended
      with the elderly doctor, Bruce Halstead, on criminal probation and
      stripped of his license to practice medicine.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of this and other recent actions taken
      by state governmental authorities in cooperation with such U. S.
      institutions as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the FTC
      (Federal Trade Commission), the government appears to be engaged
      in a concerted war against a domain of the healing arts known as
      alternative medicine. This war, ostensibly for the protection of
      American citizens from unscrupulous "quacks," has apparently moved
      into a new phase. The FDA's pursuit of medical "public enemies" is
      no longer restricted primarily to non-MD practitioners not trained
      at established medical schools--those the general public largely
      considers the unorthodox fringe of the medical world. These
      federal agencies are now engaging the force of the government's
      legal machinery in the prosecution of physicians practicing
      "conventional medicine"--those who have dared to recognize and
      even incorporate into their practices the efficacy of holistic
      natural remedies.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Halstead is a graduate of Loma Linda
      University, a medical school which, to those in the field of the
      human physiological sciences, ranks as one of the more prestigious
      schools of medicine and scientific research in the world.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 77-year-old physician is currently on
      probation under the State of California, Los Angeles County, for
      his activities involving the prescribing of alternative
      medication, specifically for his cancer patients. Dr. Halstead has
      been suspended from any form of medical practice. "In fact," he
      told The WINDS, "I can't even talk to a patient about nutrition."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When his home and clinic in San Bernardino
      County were raided by the Los Angeles District Attorney, "I
      challenged their legal jurisdiction," Halstead informed The WINDS,
      "since I had never lived or worked in Los Angeles County, but that
      did not matter. I was a legal novice and had not yet learned that
      jurisdiction and venue were merely legal fantasies which have no
      meaning in actual fact for the alternative health physician."
      (Nor, apparently, does the constitutional doctrine of habeas
      corpus).<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Halstead was charged with twenty-eight
      counts of conspiracy, grand theft and violations of the Health and
      Safety Code, along with twenty felony and misdemeanor counts.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The prosecutor wanted me to go to prison for
      eight years," he told The WINDS, "but the court ultimately reduced
      the sentence to 32 months. I was offered, on at least ten
      different occasions, the 'opportunity' of plea bargaining for a
      crime which I did not commit," Halstead explained. "My reply was
      'not until hell freezes over.'"<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The assault upon alternative medicine "is not
      just against me," he said. "They're after everybody and
      everything" connected with the field.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE QUALIFICATIONS</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Halstead, acclaimed as a genius even among
      his peers, has authored hundreds of books and research
      publications. Among them are benchmark works such as Poisonous and
      Venomous Marine Animals of the World which the U.S. Navy considers
      of such importance as to fund a project to put the entire
      three-volume tome on CD-ROM.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WINDS obtained a copy of Dr. Halstead's
      Curriculum Vitae, the academician's equivalent of a resume´. The
      following qualifications belong to a man whom the government deems
      dangerous to his patients, incompetent to practice medicine and
      academically inadequate to determine what is harmful or beneficial
      to human physiology:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Eleven years teaching on the medical faculty
      of Loma Linda University.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Specializes in global preventive medicine,
      tropical diseases and biotoxicology.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Assistant Director on the School of Tropical
      and Preventive Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda,
      California.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Assisted in developing a global preventive
      military medical program at the U.S. Naval Medical School,
      Bethesda, Maryland.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Lectured on biotoxicology at the School of
      Aerospace Medicine, U.S. Air Force, San Antonio, Texas.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Conducted Arctic expeditions for the U.S.
      Army, Navy, Air Force and National Institutes of Health, studying
      poisonous and venomous marine animals, and potential drugs from
      the sea.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Contributor to Dorland's Medical Dictionary
      and the Encyclopedia Britannica, 15th Ed.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Engaged in marine scientific research with
      the Jacques Cousteau Society, traveling extensively with the
      Cousteaus for eighteen years. <br>
      <br>
      Additionally, Dr. Halstead has been deeply involved in the study
      of the use of oriental herbal therapy on immune deficiency
      disorders.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the foregoing portrayal of a
      physician/scientist depicts a man who is unqualified to recommend
      treatment to his patients, to whom would the government have its
      citizens resort?--to those whose abysmal record of success appears
      to condemn far more patients to death than life. With the
      aforementioned credentials ascribed to him, one could ask how any
      law enforcement agency, tasked with the medical oversight and
      welfare of its citizens, could be so zealous as to prosecute one
      such as Dr. Halstead and class him with the "snake oil" peddlers
      they sometimes encounter.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1959 Dr. Halstead founded the World Life
      Research Institute in Grand Terrace, California. It was his work
      with this organization that, years later, ran him afoul of the
      Food and Drug Administration when he attempted to incorporate his
      massive knowledge and experience into the treatment of cancer.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE MOTIVE SURFACES</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps something else Dr. Halstead revealed to
      The WINDS has played a part in the FDA's zeal to relegate him to
      the medical "scrap heap". "We have been monitoring the illicit
      regulatory activities of the FDA and the cancer establishment, "
      Halstead claims, "and are in constant contact with a network of
      organizations and attorneys dealing with their illegal health
      activities in this country which are steadily driving up our
      national health costs."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it not interesting how money keeps
      introducing itself into the mix? Halstead concurs making the
      ominous assertion that, "Cancer is the sacred cow of the medical
      industry. More people make money by treating cancer than there are
      victims dying from the disease."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a 25-year effort into medical/biological
      research, "I was shocked," Dr. Halstead exclaimed, "to find upon
      my Rip Van Winkle return to clinical medicine that dangerous toxic
      drugs, all FDA approved, had proliferated to a frightening
      extent--over 1.54 billion prescriptions written in the U.S. per
      year.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I found," Halstead continues, "that many of
      these drugs destroy your immune system and are carcinogenic. New
      and awesome medical technologies were also being spawned,
      mind-blowing in both their diagnostic capability and staggering
      costs to the consumer.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, in evaluating this new drug and
      health technology, I did not find a commensurate improvement in
      either morbidity or mortality statistics in chronic degenerative
      afflictions such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Costs had
      increased, but not the overall health index. We had dropped to
      about 23[rd] position among the nations of the world in health
      care."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This data, presented by an eminent
      physician/scientist, raises the logical question as to whether
      this may be a reasonable explanation as to why the strike by New
      York doctors several years ago resulted in a decline in the city's
      overall death rate. "At this point in time," Halstead concludes,
      "I have the profound conviction that America is on a disaster
      course in health care both economically and therapeutically....A
      dangerous therapeutic mind set exists in this country that it is
      better to die in an orthodox fashion than to survive in an
      unorthodox manner."<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE RAID</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In reference to his implication that the
      government would rather allow an individual to die than to condone
      the application of "unorthodox" treatment, Dr. Halstead relates
      the following event he presented in his court trial:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "During my final oral argument I recounted the
      incident when defendant Alfred Dix and his wife had their home
      raided by the Los Angeles District Attorney. Mr. Dix had been
      using and selling the herbal drink." [The doctor is here speaking
      of a specific compound of Japanese herbs (ADS) from which a tea is
      made that many clinical trials, according to Halstead, have proven
      very effective in the treatment of cancer].<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Dix had been diagnosed as having terminal
      abdominal cancer. She had had surgery, nine different types of
      chemotherapy, and over ninety different treatments of radiation,
      all of which had failed. Her doctors told her that she had only 30
      to 45 days to live. She was bedridden, had given up hope, and was
      preparing to die. She and her husband had even contacted a
      mortician to make funeral arrangements.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Dix then came in contact with ADS [the
      herbal compound]. After taking ADS for about ten days, Mrs. Dix
      began to feel better, started doing housework, shopping,
      traveling, and started entertaining again. I met Mr. and Mrs. Dix
      one day in the lobby of a hotel in Pasadena. She was walking,
      mentally alert, happy and laughing, and stated emphatically that
      she was feeling great. No aches or pains - thanks to ADS.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time of the raid at the Dix home, the
      D.A. confiscated all of her ADS. Her husband begged and tearfully
      pleaded with the D.A. to release enough of the ADS for his wife's
      use. The D.A. refused to release any of the tea to her.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next time I saw Mrs. Dix was in the
      courtroom. She looked pale, in a weakened condition, unable to
      walk, crestfallen and anguished. A few days later she died - a
      broken woman, a victim of the land of the free and the home of the
      brave.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What has happened to our national ideal of
      life, liberty and pursuit of happiness? Why has the prosecution
      denied Mrs. Dix the right to retain a cup of harmless adaptogenic
      tea which she purchased for her own cancerous condition? What has
      happened to her civil liberties?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I could not think of a single tyrannical
      country in which this scenario could have taken place."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, one might reason, Dr. Bruce Halstead's
      case and claims are somewhat of an isolated example of government
      intervention into the medical lives of Americans.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BURZYNSKI TOUCHES SACRED COW</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case-in-point #2: Stanislaw Burzynski, MD,
      PhD., who, in 1970, fled the repressive Communist regime of his
      native Poland and came to the "land of the free and the home of
      the brave" where he soon became a researcher at Baylor College of
      Medicine in Houston.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "During the next several years," as reported by
      radio commentator and columnist Paul Weyrich, "he authored and
      co-authored sixteen papers, mostly on cancer research. He became a
      member in good standing of both the AMA and the American
      Association for Cancer Research. It was during this period that he
      developed a non-toxic, experimental therapy which resulted in a
      synthetically-produced protein sequence which reprogrammed and
      reverted the activity of cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Over the past eighteen years," Weyrich
      continued in his commentary entitled, "Time to Review the FDA",
      "2500 people have been treated by Dr. Burzynski. Not a single one
      of them became ill from the treatment. But more importantly, every
      single patient showed anti-tumor activity and most of these
      patients are in a state of complete remission. That should be
      enough to earn Dr. Burzynski a place alongside such famous medical
      pioneers as Jonas Salk. But, unfortunately for Dr. Burzynski, for
      the second time in his life, he has encountered the oppressive
      hand of the all-powerful state. Thinking that he had come to
      America to escape the repressions of communism, the good doctor
      has been, for the past twelve years, fighting the Food and Drug
      Administration."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Burzynski has been another of those
      scientists to have touched the medical "sacred cow" of cancer
      research and been unfortunate enough, it seems, to have discovered
      an effective treatment for the disease.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another logical question arises from the
      confusingly inconsistent application of "human rights" by this
      nation's government. The WINDS has been discussing the fate of two
      highly respected physician/scientists, well established in not
      only the medical community but in the halls of scientific
      research. Their "crimes" were sharing with fellow human
      beings--those who happened to also be patients, suffering with
      maladies that are, for the most part, still a mystery to
      conventional medical science-- remedies for which there have been
      ample empirical and reproducible scientific evidence of
      effectiveness. Why were these men's actions deemed criminal by
      federal authorities? According to standard "government think", it
      is largely because the medical community does not, or will not,
      recognize the validity of most natural remedies. They are not
      sufficiently profit-intensive thereby, robbing the large,
      multi-national pharmaceutical companies of immense profits. Many
      very effective medications can be found growing as "weeds" in the
      forest, urban fields or even in one's own back yard where there is
      no law (yet) against harvesting and using them.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A support organization established in
      Burzynski's name has erected a web site, the contents of which
      appears to be a carefully recorded chronology of events describing
      the interaction between Dr. Burzynski and the Food and Drug
      Administration. That chronology includes quoted statements by FDA
      officials that render a chilling perspective on that powerful
      organization's support of large industrial pharmaceutical
      companies and the federal government's attitude of consigning the
      individual to relative insignificance.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Former FDA Bureau of Drugs Director, Richard
      Crout, is quoted as stating that any organization, other than
      large research establishments who desire the Administration's
      approval to conduct clinical trials, should be subject to "harsh
      regulations....Sometimes we say it is proper to hinder research."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who question that power and money are
      the controlling influences in the drug industry, Dr. Crout is also
      quoted as saying, "I never have and never will approve a drug to
      an individual, but only to a large pharmaceutical firm with
      unlimited resources."<br>
      alternative medicine in stocks<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOW IT BECOMES KNOWN</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally, there appears a light within the
      federal juggernaut emanating from one that seems to understand
      this nation's tenth amendment to the constitution. One such light
      resides in a statement from FDA official, William Nychis who is
      quoted by Burzynski as informing Herbert Koch, MD, of the Harris
      County Medical Society that, "a physician who manufactures and
      uses a drug within his own practice of medicine...is not subject
      to [FDA regulations] since the practice of medicine is properly
      regulated by state or local authorities."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently the FDA was not enlightened by
      Nychis' statement. In a response to a U.S. District Court Judge's
      tacit approval of Dr. Burzynski's use of his anti-cancer drug
      within Texas state boundaries, the FDA allegedly issued the
      statement that if the federal judge does not comply with its
      demands, the "...government would then be obliged to pursue other
      less efficient remedies, such as actions for seizure and
      condemnation of the drugs or criminal prosecution of
      individuals...."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This they did when Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski, MD,
      PhD, was subjected to four Grand Jury investigations in which one
      U.S. Assistant Attorney was disciplined for prosecutorial
      misconduct and "FDA Commissioner David Kessler face[d] harsh
      questioning by Congressman Joe Barton's Investigations
      Subcommittee about FDA's abuse of Grand Juries, and about how he
      can justify four Grand Juries with no indictment."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fifth Grand Jury attempt by the government to
      indict Burzynski, however, was successful on the grounds that he
      "released his out-of-state patients to return home with a supply
      of antineoplastons [the drug at issue]. The charges are based upon
      'interstate commerce of a new drug.'"<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FDA GOES FOR THE THROAT</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an article published in Reason Magazine,
      former FDA Chief Counsel, Peter Barton Hutt, makes a startling
      claim: "If you beat the FDA in court," Hutt asserts, "you have an
      angry FDA that is willing to slit your throat. When the FDA loses
      a case, it has a mind like an elephant. It's just something you've
      got to understand about the FDA. Once the agency makes a
      collective decision, trying to make it let go is almost
      impossible. These are FDA crusades -- in a real sense they are
      vendettas."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 27, as reported by the Houston
      Chronicle, Dr. Burzynski "who once faced 75 federal charges
      stemming from the interstate shipment of his experimental cancer
      treatment drug was acquitted...of the lone remaining count. "The
      verdict ended, without a single conviction, a 14-year effort by
      federal authorities to make a criminal case against the
      Polish-born physician."<br>
      <br>
      The Chronicle went on to report that,<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Patients and their families who packed the
      courtroom in a show of support wept and shouted when the verdict
      was read after about three hours of jury deliberation.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Burzynski, too, was elated.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's the end of 14 years of war. It's the
      beginning of the end of the war on cancer," he said.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He predicted that the verdict would put his
      class of experimental drugs, known as antineoplastons, on the fast
      track for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Burzynski now treats about 300 patients from
      all over the country, most of whom have brain cancer and
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma under an FDA program for investigational
      new drugs."<br>
      <br>
      "I found the government's behavior offensive," one of the jurors,
      a Houston attorney, is quoted as saying. "A lot of people felt it
      was. This was a Big Brother issue." (ibid.)<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the growing list of those who are finding
      the "government's behavior offensive are a few examples related to
      The WINDS by the publisher of The Echo, a Washington State-based
      watchdog publication that keeps track of such abuses.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Glen Warner, MD, helped draft a Washington
      state law prohibiting any medical oversight authority from
      suspending or revoking the license of a physician for practicing
      and prescribing alternative or holistic medicine. In a continuing
      illustration that the government respects no laws limiting its own
      authority, shortly after the aforementioned law went into effect,
      state medical authorities revoked Dr. Warner's medical license for
      his involvement in alternative medicine.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Dr. Jonathan Wright, Kent, Wa. Federal
      authorities seized over $100,000 worth of vitamins. He was raided
      for use of injectable B-12. The Justice Department reviewed the
      case and threw it out. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING?</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why this growing intervention from federal
      authorities in instances where the public's safety and well-being
      are clearly not an issue; instances where conventional medicine
      has demonstrated an impotence in dealing with the maladies being
      addressed? A series of rhetorical questions could be posed whose
      answers would seem ridiculously obvious.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does money have anything to do with the
      government's handling of the aforementioned instances? Does the
      fact that an inordinate number of FDA officials, according to
      congressional inquiries, accept executive positions with large
      pharmaceutical companies upon retirement play any role in creating
      an atmosphere where such super-lucrative business ventures, as
      cancer research, will be endlessly perpetuated? Recall Dr. Bruce
      Halstead's statement, "Cancer is the sacred cow of the medical
      industry. More people make money by treating cancer than there are
      victims dying from the disease."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, as national death statistics indicate,
      500,000 people per year die of the disease, the "cancer economy"
      of this nation is staggering in both the number of individuals
      employed and the quantity of capital outlay for research and
      pharmaceuticals. Could there be another even more insidious agenda
      behind this obstruction by the government of potentially massive
      lifesaving research?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the document that is the
      expression of the spirit guiding the New World Order since its
      inception, the answer is clear, "The upper class, which enjoyed by
      law the labor of the workers, was interested in seeing that the
      workers were well fed, healthy and strong. We are interested in
      just the opposite--in the diminishment, the killing out of the
      nations. Our power is in the chronic...physical and mental
      weakness of the worker. What that results in is his being made the
      slave of our will, and he will not find in the authorities of his
      own society either the strength or energy to oppose us... for an
      excited patient [one that is under stress] loses all power of
      judgment and easily yields to suggestion,"-- even the suggestion,
      it would seem, to die rather than reject the fallacious authority
      of those invoking his servitude to mindless administrative
      regulations.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If one were to describe, without including the
      details of the situation, the forgoing scenario of a government
      refusing to allow a person control over their own body, the
      narrative would most likely be mistaken for an anti-abortion or
      "pro-life" argument. The concept of "pro-choice" is, after all, a
      term applicable only when it applies to the destruction of
      children while still residing in their mother's body. The idea
      that the abstraction might apply to one attempting to save his or
      her own life or that of a loved one, is anathema to the collective
      consciousness of "the land of the free and the home of the brave."<br>

          HALSTEAD IMPRISONED AFTER 12-YEAR DELAY</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      In 1985, Bruce W. Halstead was convicted of 24 counts of cancer
      fraud.&nbsp; After losing an appeal, he was stripped of his
      medical license and sentenced to 32 months in prison.&nbsp; But
      federal officials never handed down the order for him to start
      serving his sentence.&nbsp; Twelve years passed, during which
      Halstead even landed an important Department of Defense contract
      to develop a computerized bank of toxin research data to provide
      doctors with instant access to such information (Halstead is a
      respected marine toxicologist).&nbsp; But last summer Halstead was
      recognized by an Orange County prosecutor when he testified in
      court as an expert witness.&nbsp; A call to the Los Angeles County
      district attorney's office brought the SNAFU to light. (SNAFU is
      military jargon for "Situation Normal, All Fouled Up!") After
      several months of legal maneuvering, Halstead was taken into
      custody in February. His age (77) and medical condition bought him
      some leniency.&nbsp; His sentence was shortened with a release
      date of May 12.<br>

      <br>
      Comment: Although Halstead no longer is allowed to practice
      medicine, he still promotes questionable health products,
      including to cancer patients.&nbsp; NCAHF has been told that he
      appeared at a cancer support group where he bashed standard
      care.&nbsp; He also sells a dietary supplement, Age Defense Tonic,
      which he imports from China to his company Bio-Defense Nutritions
      of Grand Terrace, California.&nbsp; The list of ingredients
      reveals that it is a concoction of herbs, vitamins, and other
      substances not likely to have any real effect on aging, but since
      the passage of the 1994 Dietary Supplements Health &amp; Education
      Act, almost anything goes.&nbsp; Halstead also has a legal defense
      fund to which his disciples may contribute and publishes a
      newsletter that expounds his views.&nbsp;&nbsp; None of these
      activities are illegal.<br>

      OTA Report: Regulation of Practitionerss, 13/1/2006<br>
      <br>
      Bruce Halstead, a practitioner of unconventional cancer
      treatments, has been convicted of multiple criminal charges. In
      1986, after three years of investigation by the California Board
      of Medical Quality Assurance and the resolution of several complex
      international and interstate legal issues, Halstead's medical
      license was permanently revoked and he was convicted of several
      criminal charges. Halstead used an unconventional treatment called
      Agua del Sol (ADS) to treat patients with cancer and other chronic
      diseases. ADS has been described as a homeopathic herbal treatment
      consisting of mulberry, hydrangea, and poppy, that is reportedly
      incubated in outdoor tanks containing water and bacteria. The ADS
      administered to Halstead's cancer patients had been manufactured
      in Costa Rica, shipped through Japan, and then purchased through a
      distributor in the United States (371).<br>
      <br>
      The charges brought against Halstead under California's Penal Code
      and Health and Safety Code originally included:<br>
      <br>
      Unassisted by an attorney for much of the litigation, Halstead
      relied on the testimony of his patients, family, friends,
      ministers, and colleagues. A special "Hearing Report," submitted
      on his behalf by the National Center for Institutions and
      Alternatives, urged that only a probationary sanction be issued.
      Halstead, who denied wrongdoing, asked to be allowed to continue
      practicing medicine under terms of probation, or community
      service, or both.<br>
      <br>
      However, at the sentencing hearing, the probation officer assigned
      to the case testified that the current charges against Halstead
      were not isolated incidents. Halstead had been called before the
      Board of Medical Quality Assurance in the past, his license had
      been suspended at least once, and he had previously been placed on
      probation. This history, combined with the probation officer's
      finding that Halstead "shows little or no remorse for
      his...crimes," led to the conclusion that unless his license was
      revoked, Halstead would continue to prescribe unconventional
      treatments. In addition, the probation officer noted that Halstead
      "used his position of trust, as a physician" to sell
      unconventional treatments to terminally and chronically ill
      patients. He recommended that Halstead "be removed from the
      community for as long a period of time as is legally possible"
      (371). The court found Halstead guilty of 20 felonies and several
      misdemeanors. In addition to the permanent revocation of his
      medical license, he was sentenced to 4 years in prison and fined
      $10,000 (372).<br>

      <br>
      Bruce Halstead, M.D., was convicted in 1985 of twenty-four counts
      of cancer fraud and grand theft for selling an herbal tea called
      ADS to ten patients with cancer and other serious diseases for
      $125 to $150 per quart.<br>
      <br>
      Although he maintained that ADS was a "nutritional supplement,"
      analysis showed it to be 99.4 percent water and a brownish sludge
      composed mainly of coliform bacteria (the same bacteria found in
      human feces). Halstead, who operated the Halstead Preventive
      Medicine Clinic in Colton, California, has been a leading promoter
      of laetrile, chelation therapy, and many other questionable
      practices.<br>
      <br>
      Following the trial, which lasted for five months, Los Angeles
      County Deputy District Attorney Hyatt Seligman called Halstead "a
      crook selling swamp water." He was fined $10,000 and sentenced to
      four years in prison, but remains free during the appeals process.
      According to an article published by Michael Evers, Halstead
      maintained during his trial that he was the target of a "Medical
      Gestapo" out to destroy health practitioners who deviate from
      orthodox cancer therapies such as surgery, radiation and
      chemotherapy. In 1992, his license to practice medicine in
      California was revoked. He is still vice-president of the
      Committee for Freedom of Choice in Medicine.<br>

      Dr. Bruce Halstead, a physician convicted of selling cancer
      patients a substance that was 99.4% water, lost his chance for
      leniency Friday when a judge decided that he had not made a
      "vigorous" effort to sell his clinic and was continuing to portray
      himself as a victim of a medical conspiracy.<br>
      <br>
      "The court is unhappy with the response it has gotten to its
      openly voiced concerns about Dr. Halstead's conduct," said
      Pasadena Superior Court Judge Marvin D. Rowen in ordering the
      physician to serve a four-year prison term.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bruce Halstead, M.D</span>. (
      Institute Director, World Life Research (USA) "... <span
        style="font-style: italic;">Number 1, there is no magic
        connected with your (Tien Hsien) product. It's a very very good
        product. It has a sound, solid, scientific basis to it. I have
        thoroughly investigated that. I can show you the scientific
        literature."</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      As the parallel worlds of traditional and modern medicine merge,
      people everywhere are discovering the true value of alternative
      healing methods. Tien Hsien Liquid No. 1 is composed of rare
      selected herbs and is produced under the strictest guidelines
      ensuring a product that is pure and free of contaminants. Tien
      Hsien Liquid has been in used for over 10 years by over one
      million people from all over the world and has had tremendous
      success. Although Tien Hsien Liquid No. 1 was originally
      formulated for the purpose of treating cancer, it is not being
      marketed in the United States as a cure or prevention for the
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      There have been many instances, however, where cancer patients who
      were suffering from the side effects of chemotherapy or radiation
      treatments, reported that their symptoms have lessened, and in
      some cases, even totally subsided as a result of using Tien Hsien
      Liquid No. 1.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Tien Hsien Liquid No. 1 has very powerful and unique anti-oxidant
      qualities that scavenge for health damaging free radicals within
      our system. It is non-toxic and formulated to increase the
      anti-cancer functions of the body's own immune system. Stimulating
      and strengthening the immune system will serve to better inhibit
      tumor growth.<br>
      <br>
      After taking 4 to 6 courses of Tien Hsien Liquid # 1, the growth
      of cancerous cells in the human body should be under control. They
      may even cease to multiply completely as time goes by.<br>
      <br>
      Extending the life expectancy of cancer patients and eliminating
      the threat of them leaving their loved ones too early is what we
      strive to accomplish along with easing the unbearable side effects
      of Western Cancer therapies.<br>

      <br>
      To better understand the manner in which Tien Hsien Liquid works,
      an independent study by the Taipei FRC Biology Study Center was
      conducted. The study encompassed fifteen experimental topics and
      verification processes where Tien Hsien Liquid was identified as
      subject FRC001 for the purpose of maintaining a completely
      unbiased and objective analysis of the product. The testing was
      concluded after two years where four primary directives were
      addressed. The following is a summary of those results:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Experiments on the Removal of
        Free Radicals</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Tien Hsien Liquid is able to effectively remove different free
      radicals in the body.<br>
      Tien Hsien Liquid can remove super oxide free radical with a
      clearance capacity of 300,000 units of SOD activity per cc.<br>
      Tien Hsien Liquid can remove free radical generated by white blood
      cells, which Vitamin E fails to effectuate.<br>
      Tien Hsien Liquid can remove hydroxyl free radical, which Vitamin
      E fails to effectuate.<br>
      Tien Hsien Liquid has the capacity to remove lipid peroxides more
      effectively than Vitamin E. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Toxicology Experiments</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In clinical studies, Tien Hsien Liquid was able to pass very
      stringent testing which included:<br>
      <br>
      Acute Toxicity Test<br>
      Micro-Nuclear Bone Marrow Cell test<br>
      Sperm Distortion Tests<br>
      Ames Test <br>
      Immunization Function Tests<br>
      Test conducted on laboratory mice concluded that Tien Hsien
      Liquid:<br>
      May increase the phagocytosis of macrophage.<br>

      <br>
      The story of the Tian Xian liquid stems from the mountains of
      Chang Bai in North Eastern China. During those times when people
      neither had the means nor the resources to cure their Cancer, they
      would boil a traditional Chinese herb which grows in the heart of
      Chang Bai Mountain. It is this herb that has been found to help
      cure Cancer. Over the years, a number of medical experts from both
      the United States and China have studied this Chinese herb and
      have contributed to the birth of the Tian Xian Liquida remedy
      that now offers hope to myriads of Cancer patients.<br>
      <br>
      Xue Piao Wu Cheng. Snow falls silently from the heavens and
      covers the earth. This seems insignificant. But when the time
      comes for this snow to melt, it nurtures the earth and gives birth
      to new life. This traditional Chinese saying summarizes the
      efforts of those medical experts who studied and developed the raw
      herb from the Chang Bai Mountain  an old herb that can give new
      life. Some of these medical forerunners who have contributed to
      the development of Tian Xian liquid are Dr. Wang Zhen Guo and Dr.
      Bruce Halstead. They, and many others, have opened the way for
      more studies to be made to vouch for the effectiveness of the Tian
      Xian liquid.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0001] The field of the invention is antiviral compositions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] Viral infections are relatively common infectious diseases,
      and various methods of treating a viral infection available to a
      practitioner. In one method of treating a viral infection, the
      immune response of an immune system is stimulated. For example, in
      some instances the Th1 response of the patient can be increased
      relative to the Th2 response. An increase in the Th1 response is
      thought to be beneficial because many viral infections are
      associated with a shift in the cytokine profile toward a Th2
      response, and a bias towards a Th1 response is known to be
      facilitated by several approaches.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] In one approach, cytokines are administered to modulate the
      Th1/Th2 balance towards a Th1-type response. For example, Knight
      et al. postulate that treatment with IL-12 (Interleukine-12), a
      cytokine that promotes the development of Th1 cells, may be used
      as a treatment for AIDS since IL-12 administration has been shown
      to be effective at restoring cell-mediated immunity in mice
      infected with mouse AIDS virus or with RLV [Knight, S. C. and
      Patterson, S., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994. 15: 593-615]. In another
      example, Gracie, J. A. et al., demonstrated that administration of
      IL-18 to mice exhibited pleiotropic activities critical to the
      development of Th1 responses. [Gracie et al. J Clin Invest 1999
      Nov 15; 104(10):1393-1401]. Although the administration of
      cytokines typically results in relatively specific increases in
      desired Th1 cytokines, prolonged administration of cytokines may
      be problematic for various reasons. For example, the production of
      recombinant cytokines is relatively expensive, and isolation of
      non-recombinant cytokines from natural sources is generally
      difficult due to the very low concentration of cytokines in
      natural sources. Moreover, depending on the nature of the
      cytokine, cytokines may not be well tolerated in patients.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In another approach, immunomodulatory substances other than
      cytokines may be employed to increase the Th1 response. For
      example, Sprietsma J. E. suggests that zinc ions (Zn&lt;2+&gt; )
      and nitric oxide (NO), together with glutathione (GSH) and its
      oxidized form, GSSG, may help to regulate an immune response to
      antigens [Sprietsma J. E; Med Hypotheses 1999 July; 53(1):6-16].
      The author reports in more detail that deficiencies of
      Zn&lt;2+&gt; , NO and/or GSH shift the Th1/Th2 balance towards
      Th2, and that replenishment with Zn&lt;2+&gt; , NO and/or GSH may
      shift the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th1. Administration of
      Zn&lt;2+&gt; or GSH/GSSG is especially advantageous, since these
      substances are non-toxic at even elevated concentrations, and
      inexpensive to produce. Furthermore, Zn&lt;2+&gt; and GSH/GSSG
      preparations may be orally administered, and therefore
      significantly reduce the risk of allergic reactions, especially
      when the preparations are not ultrapure. However, the
      administration of Zn&lt;2+&gt; and/or GSH/GSSG seems to be
      beneficial only to restore a Th1/Th2 balance from a Th2 dominated
      state, whereas it is unclear if administration of Zn&lt;2+&gt;
      and/or GSH/GSSG may increase a Th1 response from a normal Th1/Th2
      balance.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In another method of treating a viral infection, the virus
      is directly targeted with an appropriate anti-viral drug. For
      example, patients infected with the HIV virus often receive a
      cocktail of drugs to block virus propagation, and various classes
      for direct anti-viral treatment are known in the art. Some direct
      anti-viral drugs block the reverse transcriptase of a retrovirus.
      Reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors are typically nucleoside
      analogs such as AZT, 3TC, or ddI. Alternatively, non-nucleoside RT
      inhibitors, including quercetin may be employed. In vitro, RT
      inhibitors are typically potent anti-viral drugs. However, in
      vivo, and especially during a period of relatively fast viral
      replication, the generation of RT inhibitor resistant virus
      mutants is problematic. Moreover, many RT inhibitors also exhibit
      undesirable activity on DNA replication in the host organism and
      significant cytotoxicity at elevated concentrations, thereby
      limiting the concentration that may be administered without severe
      side effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Among other direct anti-viral drugs are the protease
      inhibitors, which block or interfere with virus protein
      processing. Protease inhibitors are typically highly specific
      towards the viruses' proteolytic enzymes, however, due to their
      mostly hydrophobic nature, administration at desirable
      concentrations often becomes problematic. Another problem is that
      development of cross-resistance and severe side effects frequently
      occur. In order to reduce the development of multidrug resistant
      virus strains, mixtures of RT inhibitors and protease inhibitors
      may be prescribed. Although such mixtures are presently employed
      relatively successfully, the relatively high occurrence of adverse
      side effects and the potential of generating multidrug resistant
      virus strains persist.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] To circumvent at least some of the problems associated with
      side effects and relatively high costs of antiviral drugs, Bennett
      et al. describe in U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,180 the use of EDTA
      complexes in a suppository. The use of chelating agents, including
      EDTA, has been found to promote disintegration of retroviruses
      [Wunderlich, V. and Sydow, G. Arch. Virol. 1982, 73:171-183].
      Bennett's suppositories contain disodium EDTA and
      controlled-release agents, which release the disodium EDTA over a
      period of about three to four hours after rectal placement of the
      suppository. However, Bennett's suppositories are limited to
      disodium EDTA that exhibits relatively moderate selectivity
      between Mg&lt;2+&gt; and Ca&lt;2+&gt; .<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Although various antiviral compositions and antiviral
      treatments are known in the art, all or almost all of them have
      one or more disadvantages. Therefore, there is a need to provide
      improved methods and compositions for treatment of viral
      infections.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0009] The present invention is directed to an antiviral
      composition having a supply of chelating agent that chelates an
      alkaline earth metal ion, wherein the chelating agent is
      formulated in a rectal deposition formulation, and wherein the
      supply of chelating agent has an immediate bioavailability. When
      rectally administered to a subject in an effective dose in vivo,
      contemplated agents promote disintegration of a virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In one aspect of the inventive subject matter, generally
      preferred chelating agents are various chelators other than
      ethylenediamine-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EDTA), chelate
      Ca&lt;2+&gt; and/or Mg&lt;2+&gt; , and include at least three
      carboxylic acid groups. While particularly preferred chelating
      agents include at least three acetic acid groups, especially
      contemplated chelating agents are
      1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA),
      Ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)tetraacetic acid (EGTA),
      1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid
      tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM),
      diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA),
      trimethylaminetricarboxylic acid (NTA),
      trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-tetraacetic acid (CDTA),
      poly(aspartic acid), and poly(glutamic acid).<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In another aspect of the inventive subject matter,
      contemplated viruses include a retrovirus, and especially
      contemplated retroviruses include the HIV virus. Preferred rectal
      deposition formulations are a liquid or a solid, and where the
      rectal deposition formulation is a solid and administered to the
      colon of a subject, substantially of the supply of chelating agent
      is present in the colon in a readily absorbable form in less than
      2 hours, preferably less than 1 hour, and more preferably less
      than 30 minutes. With respect to the effective dose in a rectal
      administration, it is contemplated that the chelating agent is
      employed in an amount of 500 mg, and more preferably 1500 mg.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In yet another aspect of the inventive subject matter,
      chelating agents other than EDTA may also be employed for purposes
      other than antiviral treatment, including heavy metal
      detoxification, and reduction of atherosclerotic plaques, wherein
      the chelating agent may be orally or parenterally administered.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Various objects, features, aspects and advantages of the
      present invention will become more apparent from the following
      detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0014] As used herein, the term "chelating agent" refers to a
      molecule that binds a metal ion and/or an alkaline earth metal ion
      via a non-covalent bond, most commonly a coordinate bond, with a
      KD of less than 10&lt;-3 &gt; mol&lt;-1&gt; , wherein the
      chelating agent may be in acid form, base form or a salt form. For
      example, EGTA in protonated or sodium salt form is considered a
      free chelating agent, because EGTA binds Mg&lt;2+&gt; and
      Ca&lt;2+&gt; with a KD of less than 10&lt;-3 &gt; mol&lt;-1&gt; .<br>
      <br>
      [0015] As also used herein, the term "immediate bioavailability"
      means that a composition or molecule is present in an active form
      in a formulation such that a substantial portion of a dose of the
      composition or molecule exhibits some systemic chelating effect
      within minutes, preferably within less than 15 min, more
      preferably within less than 10 min, and most preferably within
      less than 5 min. For example, a molecule that is dissolved in a
      carrier solution is regarded to have immediate bioavailability.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] It is known that retroviruses can be disintegrated by
      chelating agents, especially by agents that chelate Mg&lt;2+&gt;
      and/or Ca&lt;2+&gt; , and that chelating agents may further reduce
      infectivity of certain viruses [Wunderlich, V. and Sydow, G. Arch.
      Virol. 1982, 73:171-183]. Thus, it is contemplated that an
      antiviral composition generally has a supply of a chelating agent
      that chelates an alkaline earth metal ion, and it is particularly
      contemplated that the chelating agent in the antiviral composition
      is formulated in a rectal deposition formulation, wherein the
      supply of chelating agent has an immediate bioavailability.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] It should be appreciated that many chelating agents are
      known in the art, and that all of the known chelating agents are
      contemplated for use herein. It is generally preferred that
      contemplated chelating agents include at least three carboxylic
      acid groups, all of which are preferably acetic acid groups.
      Although not excluded, it is further contemplated that appropriate
      chelating agents are chelating agents other than EDTA. The choice
      of the particular chelating agent is predominantly determined by
      the desired physicochemical properties and tolerability of the
      chelating agent. For example, where a relatively high solubility
      (e.g., 1M) is desired, EGTA, CDTA or NTA may advantageously be
      employed. Where a more pronounced selectivity of chelation towards
      Ca&lt;2+&gt; is desirable, BAPTA may be utilized, and BAPTA-AM may
      be particularly suitable where sequestration of Ca&lt;2+&gt;
      within a cell is desired. Alternatively, contemplated chelating
      agents may include DTPA, NTA, and polymeric forms of aspartic
      acid, glutamic acid, and any reasonable combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] With respect to viruses that can be disintegrated and/or
      reduced in infectivity, virus particles that require Ca&lt;2+&gt;
      and/or Mg&lt;2+&gt; for structural integrity of their envelope are
      generally contemplated and include DNA and RNA viruses.
      Particularly contemplated RNA viruses are retroviruses in general,
      and HIV in particular. Further especially contemplated viruses
      include the hepatitis C and hepatitis D virus. Contemplated DNA
      viruses include polyomaviruses, HBV, etc. However, many more
      viruses are also contemplated, and a collection of appropriate
      viruses are listed in Fields Virology, Third Edition (Lippincot
      Williams &amp; Wilkins), pages 40-41, 52, and 1767-1847, and Arch.
      Virol. 1982, 73:171-183, both of which are incorporated by
      reference herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] It is still further contemplated that chelating agents are
      preferably formulated in a rectal deposition formulation, which
      may be in solid or liquid form. Where the formulation is in a
      solid form, it is further contemplated that appropriate forms
      include dissolvable carriers such as wages, fatty acids and oils
      with melting points of about 30[deg.]-35[deg.] C. Especially
      preferred formulations are formulations known in the art that are
      employed in the fabrication of rectal suppositories, so long as
      such formulations allow an immediate bioavailability. Thus, where
      a supply of chelating agent is administered into the colon of a
      subject in a solid form, it is particularly contemplated that
      substantially all of the supply of chelating agent is present in
      the colon in a readily absorbable form in less than 2 hours, more
      preferably less than 1 hour, and most preferably less 30 minutes
      after the administration of the formulation. Availability of the
      chelating agent or a portion of the chelating agent in less that 2
      hrs, less than 1 hr or less than 30 min may be achieved by a
      variety of time release formulations, and contemplated time
      release formulations may include formulations with a melting point
      of less than 37[deg.] C., enzymatically degradable carriers,
      dissolving or swellable carriers, etc. Thus, it is contemplated
      that an entire dose of chelating agent may be available (or
      released from the time release formulation) in less than 2 hours,
      preferably less than 1 hour, and even more preferably in less than
      30 min. A particular advantage of such time release formulations
      is that relatively high dosages may be administered that might
      otherwise pose a potential risk if administered without a time
      release formulation. However, it should be appreciated that
      administrations without time release may safely be administered by
      employing smaller dosages at multiple administrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Where the formulation is in a liquid form, it is
      contemplated that appropriate liquid forms may include buffered
      and unbuffered solutions, solutions with relatively high viscosity
      such as gels, creams, foams and ointments, which may or may not
      have a decreased viscosity at elevated temperatures. Liquid forms
      are particularly advantageous, since the delivery of the chelating
      agent is almost instantaneous. Where the solutions are buffered,
      it is contemplated that the buffers have an alkaline pH, and a
      preferred pH range is a range between 8.0 and 10.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Alternatively, the chelating agent may also be administered
      in various alternative routes, and it is especially contemplated
      that where the chelating agent is an agent other than EDTA that
      appropriate routes include oral and parenteral administration. For
      example, CDTA may be orally administered in form of an acid
      resistant caplet or capsule. However, oral administration need not
      be limited to a caplet or capsule, and alternative oral
      administrations include syrups, powders, tablets, etc. In another
      example, EGTA may be parenterally administered by intravenous
      injection. It is contemplated, however, that alternative
      parenteral administrations may also include inhalation,
      transdermal delivery, injections into sites other than a vein,
      etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In a particularly contemplated aspect of the inventive
      subject matter, it is preferred that the administration of the
      chelating agent is accompanied by (preferably oral) administration
      of a nutritional supplement. Preferred nutritional supplements
      include supplements that help replenish calcium levels and
      particularly preferred supplements include aragonite calcium
      carbonate from fossil coral minerals. Other contemplated
      supplements that include herbal products (e.g., adaptogenic
      formulations with no apparent cytotoxicity) are contemplated to
      assist in inhibition of viral replication (e.g., by inhibiting the
      production of reverse transcriptase). It is further contemplated
      that such supplements may also help boost the immune system and
      potentially improve overall vitality and stamina. It is further
      contemplated that such adaptogenic supplements are considered to
      have tumor preventive and radio-protective properties, and may
      help increase the functioning of the immune system by increasing
      the T-cell population. Exemplary compositions for contemplated
      nutritional supplements are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br>

      <br>
      &nbsp; Lonicera erythrorhizon&nbsp; 10 mg (10:1 concentrate)<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; Altemanthera philoeroides&nbsp; 10 mg (10:1 concentrate)<br>
      It should be appreciated, however, that various additional
      ingredients may be added to the supplement depicted in Table 1 and
      2 to either enhance or modulate the activity of the herbal
      components.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] With respect to the amount of chelating agent it is
      contemplated, that the chelating agent is administered to a
      subject in vivo in a dose effective to promote disintegration of a
      virus in the subject. The actual dose of the chelating agent may
      thereby vary among individual subject and may further be
      determined by the particular virus that is to be disintegrated.
      Therefore, an effective dose may comprises rectal administration
      of the chelating agent between about 5 mg-2500 mg, and generally
      contemplated doses include rectal administration of 500 mg or 1500
      mg of the chelating agent. However, where even higher dosages of
      the chelating agent are required, or where it is preferred to
      maintain relatively high dosages over an extended period of time,
      multiple dosages are also contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] It should further be appreciated that appropriate
      formulations may further comprise active and/or inactive
      ingredients. For example, active ingredients may include
      compositions to stimulate the immune system, an immunomodulating
      composition, a coral mineral product, compositions to facilitate
      uptake of the chelating agent into the blood stream, or direct
      antiviral compounds such as nucleoside analogs, etc. The term
      "immunomodulating composition" as used herein refers to a
      composition that enhances at least one of a humoral and cellular
      response towards a challenge. For example, an immunomodulating
      composition may increase an antibody titer against a challenge, or
      an activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Inactive ingredients may
      include fillers, coloring agents, thixotropic compositions, and
      foam building agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In an exemplary use, a person diagnosed with an HIV
      infection receives twice daily an enema of 20 ml of a 50 mg/ml
      solution of EGTA in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH8.4 for at
      least 30 consecutive days. It should be recognized, however, that
      the exemplary use need not be limited to the specified amounts and
      times, but treatment schedules may vary considerably. For example,
      where the person already receives an antiviral medication (e.g.,
      protease inhibitor cocktail, RT-inhibitor, etc.), lower dosages or
      less frequent administrations are contemplated, while in cases
      where the person does not receive another antiviral treatment,
      higher dosages and more frequent administrations are contemplated.
      It is also contemplated that the antiviral composition may be
      employed in a preventative fashion, i.e., the antiviral
      composition may be employed in a person that is not infected with
      a virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] It is still further contemplated that the compositions
      according to the inventive subject matter may have advantageous
      properties and uses in therapeutic applications other than
      antiviral activity, especially where the chelating agent is a
      substance other than EDTA, and particularly contemplated uses
      include heavy metal detoxification in animal and human, and
      reduction of atherosclerotic plaque.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] With respect to heavy metal detoxification in animal and
      human, it is known in the art that upon oral administration or
      injection EDTA complexes various metals and heavy metals other
      than Ca&lt;2+&gt; , and oral administration or injection of EDTA
      has therefore found widespread use in detoxifycation of some heavy
      metal poisonings. Various alternative oral or injectable chelation
      agents for heavy metals have also been described [e.g., Llobet, J.
      M. et al. Arch. Environ. Contam. Toxicol. 1990, 19(2): 185-9;
      Treatment of acute lead intoxication. A quantitative comparison of
      a number of chelating agents. Llobet, J. M. et al. Arch. Toxicol.
      1988, 61(4):321-3; Antidotes for zinc intoxication in mice] and
      include oral and injectable forms of penicillamine,
      2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, and
      2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate. However, it is not known to the
      inventors that chelators other than EDTA have been used for
      detoxification of heavy metals in animal and human via rectal
      administration. Rectal administration is particularly advantageous
      for various reasons. For example, suppositories can be
      self-administered by almost all patients. Furthermore, rectal
      administration inflicts only relatively low discomfort to the
      patient. Moreover, rectal administration bypasses the stomach, a
      highly acidic environment that may lead to at least partial
      destruction of some of the chelating agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Therefore, it is contemplated that rectal administration of
      chelating agents may also be employed in a method to reduce a
      heavy metal concentration in a subject, wherein in one step a
      chelating agent is provided that chelates a metal ion, wherein the
      chelating agent is formulated in a rectal deposition formulation
      and wherein the supply of chelating agent has an immediate
      bioavailability. Alternatively, the rectal deposition formulation
      may further comprise a time release agent to release the chelating
      agent in a period of between 0-30 min, 30-60 min, 60-120 min,
      120-180 min, or longer. In another step, the chelating agent is
      rectally administered to the subject in a concentration effective
      to reduce the heavy metal ion concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] It is generally contemplated that the heavy metal may be in
      elemental or ionic form, and particularly contemplated heavy
      metals include mercury, Zn&lt;2+&gt; , Cu&lt;+&gt; , Cd&lt;2+&gt;
      , and Co&lt;2+&gt; . However, various alternative metals and their
      ionic forms are also contemplated, including nickel, arsenic,
      selenium, iron, mercury, chromium, antimony, beryllium, thallium,
      silver, scandium, titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, etc.
      While it is generally contemplated that all known chelating agents
      may be suitable for reduction of heavy metals in a subject, it is
      particularly preferred that the chelating agent comprises a
      plurality of carboxylic acid groups and it is even more preferred
      that the chelating agent is EDTA, EGTA, CDTA, or DTPA. With
      respect to the rectal deposition formulation the same
      considerations as already described above apply.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] An exemplary method of reducing a heavy metal concentration
      in a subject may therefore comprise a single rectal administration
      of 20 ml of a 10 mg/ml buffered aqueous solution of CDTA three
      times daily over a period of about 15-20 days. It should be
      recognized, however, that depending on the particular heavy metal,
      the site of accumulation, and the concentration of the heavy metal
      in the subject many treatment schedules other than a single rectal
      administration of 20 ml of a 10 mg/ml buffered aqueous solution of
      CDTA three times daily over a period of about 15-20 days are also
      appropriate.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] For example, where treatment is prophylactic or
      necessitated by relatively low concentrations of a heavy metal,
      total daily dosages of less than 600 mg are contemplated,
      including total daily dosages of 200-600 mg, 50-200 mg, and less
      that 50 mg. Likewise, where acute and/or severe heavy metal
      intoxications are to be treated by a method according to the
      inventive subject matter, higher total daily dosages of more than
      600 mg are contemplated, including total daily dosages of 600-1500
      mg, 1500-2500 mg, and more than 2500 mg. With respect to the
      formulation it should be appreciated that numerous alternative
      formulations are also appropriate, and contemplated alternative
      formulations include the formulations already described above.
      Similarly, it should be appreciated that various alternative
      administration periods other than a period of about 15-20 days are
      also appropriate, including single administrations in cases where
      treatment is prophylactic, or administration over a period of less
      than 15 days, where the heavy metal concentration is relatively
      low. On the other hand, where the heavy metal is predominantly is
      tissues that bind the heavy metal relatively firmly (e.g.
      lipophilic tissue) administrations of 2-6 weeks and longer are
      contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] With respect atherosclerotic plaques it is contemplated
      that rectal administration of chelating agents may also be
      employed in a method to reduce a atherosclerotic plaques in a
      subject, wherein in one step a chelating agent is provided that
      chelates an alkaline earth metal ion, wherein the chelating agent
      is formulated in a rectal deposition formulation and wherein the
      supply of chelating agent has an immediate bioavailability. In
      another step, the chelating agent is rectally administered to the
      subject in a concentration effective to reduce the atherosclerotic
      plaque in a subject. As used herein, the term "reducing the
      atherosclerotic plaque" refers to a gross reduction in size and/or
      volume of one or more atherosclerotic plaques, which may also
      include complete disappearance of the atherosclerotic plaque or
      plaques.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In an exemplary method of reducing atherosclerotic plaque,
      a person diagnosed with atherosclerotic plaques receives once
      daily an enema of 10 ml of a 50 mg/ml solution of EGTA in 10 mM
      sodium phosphate buffer pH8.4 for a period of about 12 weeks.
      However, it should be appreciated that the exemplary method need
      not be limited to the specified amounts and times, and formulation
      and treatment schedules may vary considerably. For example, where
      the person already underwent a vasodilation procedure, lower
      dosages or less frequent administrations are contemplated, while
      in cases where the person did not receive previous treatment to
      reduce the atherosclerotic plaques, higher dosages and more
      frequent administrations are contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Likewise, the chelating agent need not be limited to EGTA,
      but may be various alternative chelating agents including EDTA,
      CDTA, and DTPA, wherein the choice of the chelating agent will
      predominantly depend on the desired specificity of the chelator
      and the tolerability at a particular concentration. Furthermore,
      the formulation of the chelating agent need not be restricted to
      10 ml of a 50 mg/ml solution of EGTA in 10 mM sodium phosphate
      buffer pH8.4. For example, alternative formulations may be
      employed to achieve a larger distribution, faster absorbption,
      etc., and appropriate formulations include those already described
      above.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Thus, specific embodiments and applications of antiviral
      compositions have been disclosed. It should be apparent, however,
      to those skilled in the art that many more modifications besides
      those already described are possible without departing from the
      inventive concepts herein. For example, the route of
      administration need not necessarily be restricted to a rectal
      administration of the chelating agent, but may also include
      vaginal administration. The inventive subject matter, therefore,
      is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the appended
      claims. Moreover, in interpreting both the specification and the
      claims, all terms should be interpreted in the broadest possible
      manner consistent with the context. In particular, the terms
      "comprises" and "comprising" should be interpreted as referring to
      elements, components, or steps in a non-exclusive manner,
      indicating that the referenced elements, components, or steps may
      be present, or utilized, or combined with other elements,
      components, or steps that are not expressly referenced.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] Treatment of viral infections is frequently limited by the
      availability, tolerability, and cost of known and approved
      pharmacological agents. Moreover, even if one or more antiviral
      agents are relatively well tolerated (physically as well as
      financially), resistance to such agents tends to develop rather
      quickly. Therefore, there is a continuing need for novel antiviral
      compositions that are well tolerated and relatively inexpensive.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] The inventors recognized that various plant extracts
      exhibit significant antiviral activity and that reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (RTI) may be isolated for such plant

      Zanoxylum nitidum. However, in alternative aspects many plants
      other than the above-listed plants are also contemplated. In fact,
      all plants are contemplated that exhibit antiviral activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] With respect to the identification of an RTI in
      contemplated plants, it should be appreciated that numerous assays
      are known in the art, and can readily be adapted to a screening
      process in which a fractions of a plant extract are screened for
      RTI activity. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,130,036 to Loeb et al.
      describes a high throughput assay system in which positive
      selective pressure is employed to select and/or identify an RTI.
      Once a fraction has been identified as having RTI activity, it is
      contemplated that further separation of the components in that
      fraction will eventually lead to an isolated (single or complex)
      compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] It is still further contemplated that such isolated
      compounds may then be characterized using various forms of mass
      spectroscopy (e.g., ESMS, FAB-MS, GC-MS, etc.), UV-, IR-, and
      VIS-spectroscopy, atom absorption spectroscopy, various forms of
      NMR (&lt;1&gt;H-NMR, &lt;13&gt;C-NMR, NOE-NMR, etc.), or other
      analytical method. While not limiting to the inventive subject
      matter, it is preferred that such characterization methods will
      lead to a chemical structure of the RTI, which may be employed to
      synthesize the RTI de novo, or to modify the structure to arrive
      at an RTI with improved or altered physico-chemical properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Particularly contemplated modifications of isolated and
      characterized RTIs include increased specificity towards the viral
      polymerase over non-specific interactions with non-reverse
      transcriptase molecules in a cell or biological system, higher
      affinity of the modified RTI towards the reverse transcriptase,
      reduced toxicity, increased solubility, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Consequently, it is contemplated that pharmacological
      composition comprises a synthetic reverse transcriptase inhibitor
      having a structure of a molecule that is present in a plant
      extract demonstrated to have an antiviral effect, wherein the
      molecule produces at least in part of the antiviral effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Thus, specific embodiments and applications of compositions
      having reverse transcriptase inhibitor activity have been
      disclosed. It should be apparent, however, to those skilled in the
      art that many more modifications besides those already described
      are possible without departing from the inventive concepts herein.
      The inventive subject matter, therefore, is not to be restricted
      except in the spirit of the appended contemplated claims.
      Moreover, in interpreting both the specification and the
      contemplated claims, all terms should be interpreted in the
      broadest possible manner consistent with the context. In
      particular, the terms "comprises" and "comprising" should be
      interpreted as referring to elements, components, or steps in a
      non-exclusive manner, indicating that the referenced elements,
      components, or steps may be present, or utilized, or combined with
      other elements, components, or steps that are not expressly

      <br>
      [0003] Viral infections are unfortunately an almost unavoidable
      challenge to the health of most human and other mammals, and while
      many viral infections are successfully cleared by the immune
      system of the infected individual before substantial damage
      arises, some viral infections lead to severe damage or even death.
      There are many known antiviral drugs, however, all or almost all
      of them suffer from one or more disadvantages, most notably
      adverse side-effects, built-up of viral resistance, complicated
      administration schedules, and often high cost. Therefore, there is
      a need for simple and effective antiviral compositions that are
      well tolerated, simple to administer, and relatively inexpensive.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] The inventors discovered that treatment of a viral
      infection can be significantly improved by coadministration of an
      antiviral agent with a chelator. More specifically, the inventors
      contemplate that particularly suitable chelators deplete the viral
      environment sufficiently to promote disintegration of the viral
      envelope.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Consequently, the inventors contemplate a pharmacological
      composition that includes an antiviral agent and a chelator in a
      quantity sufficient to reduce a serum concentration of a bivalent
      metal in an amount of at least 25%.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Suitable antiviral agents particularly include direct
      antiviral agents and indirect antiviral agents. As used herein,
      the term "direct antiviral drug" refers to an agent that directly
      interferes with one or more viral components. For example, virus
      protein specific antibodies, reverse transcriptase inhibitors or
      protease inhibitors are considered direct antiviral agents,
      because such compounds directly bind and to and/or reduce the
      activity of their respective viral target structures. As also used
      herein, the term "indirect antiviral drug" refers to a compound
      that indirectly interferes with a replication or propagation of a
      virus, and particularly include immunomodulatory agents (e.g.,
      cytokines, various nucleoside analogs, and/or Zn&lt;2&gt;+).
      However, it should be appreciated that chelators are explicitly
      excluded from the definitions of direct and indirect antiviral
      compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Especially preferred antiviral compounds include plant
      extracts and/or one or more isolated compounds (isolated from the
      plant or synthesized de novo) that are present in a plant extract
      demonstrated to have an antiviral effect. Particularly suitable
      plants for contemplated extracts and isolated compounds include
      Abies webbiana; Acacia spec. Acacia Arabia; Agrimonia eupatoria;
      Ajuga decumbens; Allium cepa; Allium sativum; Aloe vera;
      Altemanthera philoxeroides or sessiles; Ammi maius; Andographis
      paniculata; Apium graveolens; Apium leptophyllum; Arachis
      hypogaea; Arctium lappa; Amebia euhcroma; Asparagus racemosus;
      Astragalus spinosus; Astragalus lentingosis swainsonine;
      Buchenavia capita; Bryonia cretica ssp. Dioica; Bryonia
      angustifolia; Camellia theifera; Camellia sinensis; Cedrela toona;
      Chrysanthemum morifolium; Coffea arabica; Coptis chinesis; Coptis
      teetoides; Coptis japonica; Coraria nepalensis; Coriandrum

      [0008] With respect to the chelator it is generally contemplated
      that all chelating agents are suitable for use in conjunction with
      the teachings presented herein so long as such chelators (a)
      reduce serum concentration of a bivalent metal (e.g., Ca&lt;2+&gt;
      and Mg&lt;2+&gt;) in an amount of at least 25%, and (b) are at
      least partially effective to promote viral disintegration at an
      administered dosage. Particularly contemplated bivalent metals
      include Ca&lt;2+&gt; and Mg&lt;2+&gt;. Particularly preferred
      chelators include
      1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid,
      Ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)tetraacetic acid,
      1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid
      tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester),
      trans1,2-diaminocyclohexane-tetraacetic acid, and
      diethyllenetriamine-pentaacetic acid, trimethylaminetricarboxylic
      acid, poly(aspartic acid), and poly(glutamic acid),
      ethylenediamine-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, and EGTA.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It is further contemplated that suitable compositions will
      reduce the viral serum titer of a virus in an amount of at least
      10% (e.g., as determined by RT-PCR), and especially contemplated
      viruses include retroviruses (e.g., HIV, HCV), dsDNA and ssDNA
      viruses.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] With respect to the administration of contemplated
      compositions, it should be recognized that various protocols are
      suitable, and especially contemplated protocols include
      substantially simultaneous administration of the chelator (e.g.,
      coadministration in a single tablet), or administration of the
      chelator (or antiviral agent) while there is a measurable
      concentration of the antiviral agent (or chelator) in the patient.
      For example, it is contemplated that suitable antiviral agents may
      be orally administered, while the chelator is parenterally
      administered (e.g., via injection or mucosal presentation).<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Consequently, the dosage and formulation of contemplated
      antiviral agents and chelators may vary substantially, however, it
      is preferred that the antiviral agent is administered in approved
      and/or known dosages and formulations. Similarly, it is preferred
      that dosages and formulations of appropriate chelators are
      identical or similar to those known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Thus, specific embodiments and applications of antiviral
      treatments using a chelator and an antiviral agent have been
      disclosed. It should be apparent, however, to those skilled in the
      art that many more modifications besides those already described
      are possible without departing from the inventive concepts herein.
      The inventive subject matter, therefore, is not to be restricted
      except in the spirit of the appended contemplated claims.
      Moreover, in interpreting both the specification and the
      contemplated claims, all terms should be interpreted in the
      broadest possible manner consistent with the context. In
      particular, the terms "comprises" and "comprising" should be
      interpreted as referring to elements, components, or steps in a
      non-exclusive manner, indicating that the referenced elements,
      components, or steps may be present, or utilized, or combined with
      other elements, components, or steps that are not expressly

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] Numerous antiviral drugs are known in the art, however, all
      or almost all of them suffer from one or more disadvantages.
      Particularly problematic in the administration is of such drugs is
      their relatively low solubility and/or comparably short serum
      half-life time. Consequently, many patients need to follow a
      strict regimen to maintain effective serum concentration of such
      drugs, frequently resulting in repeated disruptions of an
      otherwise productive lifestyle. Therefore, there is a need for
      improved antiviral compositions that are well tolerated, simple to
      administer, and maintain a relatively long serum half-life.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] The inventors contemplate that treatment of a viral
      infection can be significantly improved by administration of a
      chelator in a time-release formulation. Furthermore, the inventors
      contemplate that the chelator is co-administered in a time-release
      formulation with a second or further agent with antiviral effect
      (which may be administered following a conventional protocol or in
      a second time release formulation). Contemplated viruses include
      retroviruses (e.g., HIV, HCV), ssDNA and dsDNA.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Consequently, the inventors contemplate a pharmacological
      composition that includes an a chelator in a time release
      formulation in a concentration such that a single administration
      of the chelator reduces the serum concentration of a bivalent
      metal in an amount of at least 20% for a period of at least 8
      hours, more preferably at least 30% for a period of at least 10
      hours, and most preferably at least 40% for a period of at least
      12 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] With respect to the chelator it is generally contemplated
      that all chelating agents are suitable for use in conjunction with
      the teachings presented herein so long as such chelators (a)
      reduce serum concentration of a bivalent metal (e.g., Ca&lt;2+&gt;
      and Mg&lt;2+&gt;) in an amount of at least 25%, and (b) are at
      least partially effective to promote viral disintegration at an
      administered dosage. Particularly contemplated bivalent metals
      include Ca&lt;2+&gt; and Mg&lt;2+&gt;. Particularly preferred
      chelators include
      1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid,
      Ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)tetraacetic acid,
      1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid
      tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester),
      trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-tetraacetic acid, and
      diethyllenetriamine-pentaacetic acid, tri-methylaminetricarboxylic
      acid, poly(aspartic acid), and poly(glutamic acid),
      ethylenediamine-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, and EGTA.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] There are numerous methods of preparing a time release
      formulation known in the art, all of which are contemplated
      suitable for use in conjunction with the teachings herein.
      However, particularly contemplated time release formulations
      include ion exchange resins, encapsulations with acid or base
      resistant coatings, compacting the formulation to control
      solvation, slow-melting carriers, enzyme-degradable carriers, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Depending on the amount chelator in contemplated
      compositions, it is contemplated that the viral titer in the serum
      of a patient infected with the virus will decrease at least 10%
      for at least 4 hours, more preferably at least 25% for at least 6
      hours, and most preferably at least 40% for at least 8 hours after
      administration of a single dose of contemplated compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It should further be appreciated that contemplated
      compositions may further comprise direct antiviral agents and/or
      indirect antiviral agents. As used herein, the term "direct
      antiviral agent" refers to an agent that directly interferes with
      one or more viral components. For example, virus protein specific
      antibodies, reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease
      inhibitors are considered direct antiviral agents, because such
      compounds directly bind and to and/or reduce the activity of their
      respective viral target structures. As also used herein, the term
      "indirect antiviral agent" refers to a compound that indirectly
      interferes with a replication or propagation of a virus, and
      particularly include immunomodulatory agents (e.g., cytokines,
      various nucleoside analogs, and/or Zn&lt;2+&gt;). However, it
      should be appreciated that chelators are explicitly excluded from
      the definitions of direct and indirect antiviral compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] With respect to the administration of contemplated
      compositions, it should be recognized that various protocols are
      suitable, and especially contemplated protocols include oral and
      parenteral administration (e.g., via a tablet, syrup, injection,
      suppository, topical administration transcutaneous administration,
      etc.). Consequently, the dosage and formulation of contemplated
      compositions may vary substantially. However, it is generally
      preferred that a single dosage is within the range of about 10 mg
      to about 3000 mg.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Thus, specific embodiments and applications of chelators in
      time release format have been disclosed. It should be apparent,
      however, to those skilled in the art that many more modifications
      besides those already described are possible without departing
      from the inventive concepts herein. The inventive subject matter,
      therefore, is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the
      appended contemplated claims. Moreover, in interpreting both the
      specification and the contemplated claims, all terms should be
      interpreted in the broadest possible manner consistent with the
      context. In particular, the terms "comprises" and "comprising"
      should be interpreted as referring to elements, components, or
      steps in a non-exclusive manner, indicating that the referenced
      elements, components, or steps may be present, or utilized, or
      combined with other elements, components, or steps that are not

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] Most patients infected with the HIV virus will develop
      AIDS, reflecting a breakdown in their immune system's capability
      to ward off foreign and "self"-generated antigens. For example,
      Kaposi sarcoma, and numerous bacterial and yeast infections are
      relatively common diseases associated with AIDS. Typically, these
      secondary diseases are treated with drugs that specifically target
      the etiologic agent (e.g., sarcoma cell, bacterium, or virus) of
      those diseases, thereby often increasing an already long list of
      undesired side effects brought on by attempts to control the
      propagation of the HIV virus.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] The inventors contemplate that treatment of HIV related
      conditions can be significantly improved by administration of a
      composition that comprises at least one of a chelator and an
      antiviral agent, wherein the antiviral agent comprises a plant
      extract, or a synthetic or isolated compound from a plant that is
      demonstrated to have an antiviral effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The term "HIV related condition" as used herein refers to
      intrinsic and extrinsic challenges to an immune system that may
      develop into an apparent (i.e., detectable by diagnotic tools)
      disease while the patient has a detectable HIV serum virus titer.
      Particularly contemplated conditions include bacterial infections
      (e.g., pneumocystis carnii, tuberculosis, salmonellosis,
      mycobacterium avium complex, etc.), viral infections (e.g.,
      cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, hepatitis, varicella zoster,
      Epstein-barr, etc.), fungal infections (e.g., candidiasis,
      cryptococcal meningitis, histoplasmosis, etc.), parasite
      infections (e.g., toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, etc.), and
      Kaposi sarcoma.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Suitable compositions are described in copending
      provisional patent applications with the title "Treatment of Virus
      Using Chelator and Antiviral Agent" by Bruce Halstead et al.,
      filed on or about May 30, 2001, "Time Release Chelators" by Bruce
      Halstead et al., filed on or about May 30, 2001, and "Time Release
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors" by Bruce Halstead et al., filed
      on or about May 30, 2001, all of which are incorporated by
      reference herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In a preferred aspect of the inventive subject matter, a
      method of treating a patient comprises one step in which a patient
      infected with HIV is diagnosed with an HIV related condition. In a
      further step, a composition is administered to the patient that
      comprises at least one of a chelator and an antiviral agent,
      wherein the antiviral agent comprises a plant extract or a
      synthetic or isolated compound from a plant that is demonstrated
      to have an antiviral effect. It should be recognized that all
      patients infected with an HIV virus may be treated using
      contemplated methods, however, patients with a CD4&lt;+&gt; count
      of less than 200 are particularly contemplated. Consequently,
      especially preferred patients include patients with developing or
      fully developed AIDS, wherein such patients may or may not receive
      pharmacological treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] With respect to the administration of contemplated
      compounds, it should be appreciated that a particular dosage and
      regimen will typically depend on the particular HIV-related
      condition. It is generally contemplated that the dosage, route and
      formulation is substantially identical or similar to those
      described in the copending provisional applications. However,
      where appropriate, alternative dosages, routes, and formulations
      may be employed, and in fact all dosages formulations and routes
      are contemplated that result in a positive response of the patient
      to the administration.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Thus, specific embodiments and applications of treatment of
      HIV-related conditions have been disclosed. It should be apparent,
      however, to those skilled in the art that many more modifications
      besides those already described are possible without departing
      from the inventive concepts herein. The inventive subject matter,

      [0007] In further especially preferred aspects, contemplated
      antiviral agents may include a chelating agent that chelates a
      bivalent metal ion, preferably Mg&lt;2+ &gt;and/or Ca&lt;2+&gt;.
      Especially preferred chelating agents include EDTA, EGTA,

      <br>
      [0008] There are numerous known methods of preparing a
      time-release formulation, and all of the known methods are
      contemplated suitable for use in conjunction with the teachings
      herein. Particularly contemplated time release formulations
      include ion exchange resins, encapsulations with acid or base
      resistant coatings, compacting the formulation to control
      solvation, slow-melting carriers, enzyme-degradable carriers, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] With respect to the dosage of contemplated compositions, it
      is contemplated that the RTI is present in a single dose in a
      concentration such that the viral titer is reduced at least 20%
      over a period of at least 6 hours, more at least 30% over a period
      of at least 8 hours, and most preferably at least 45% over a
      period of at least 12 hours. Furthermore, it is contemplated that
      where contemplated compositions further comprise a chelating
      agent, the chelating agent is present in a single dose in a

      &gt;concentration is reduced at least 20% over a period of at
      least 6 hours, more preferably at least 35% over a period of at
      least 12 hours, and most preferably at least 45% over a period of
      at least 12 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] With respect to the administration of contemplated
      compositions, it should be recognized that various protocols are
      suitable, and especially contemplated protocols include oral,
      topical, and parenteral administration. Consequently, the
      formulation of contemplated compositions may vary substantially,
      however, it is preferred that the RTI is administered in approved
      and/or known formulations.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Thus, specific embodiments and applications of time release
      RTIs have been disclosed. It should be apparent, however, to those
      skilled in the art that many more modifications besides those
      already described are possible without departing from the

      Ser. No. 09/253,223, filed Feb. 19, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No.
      6,165,797 which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] The field of the invention is detection and quantification
      of oxidative stress in a subject.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] It is by now common knowledge that stress in mammalian
      subjects develops directly or indirectly into a display of
      oxygenated species, which tends to change the usually reduced
      state of the body to a hyperoxygenated state. This hyperoxygenated
      state includes generation and reaction of hydroxides, peroxides
      and free radical species, which are thought to be implicated in
      physiological imbalance and actual physical damage. Physical
      damage can produce pathological states, which for example, may
      lead to atherosclerotic plaques. Such plaques often result in the
      deposition of lipids and may further lead to blockage of arteries
      that can cause a cessation of blood flow to the heart with a
      resulting heart attack. This is one of many human disease states
      that are thought to be caused by free radical attack from the
      hyperoxygenated state caused by stress. Despite the relatively
      large body of information linking oxidative stress to various
      diseases and/or disease states, there is still an appreciable need
      for suitable markers and test systems to determine the level of
      oxidative stress in a simple and inexpensive manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Malondialdehyde is a component of normal urine, and its
      presence can be determined using relatively expensive and
      typically stationary equipment such as spectrophotometers,
      fluorometers, high performance liquid chromatographs and gas
      chromatograph mass spectrometers. Such equipment typically enables
      an operator to determine not only the quantity of a particular
      aldehyde, but also to determine the chemical nature of a
      particular molecule with an aldehyde function. Unfortunately, the
      operator of such equipment needs to be highly trained, and the
      weight and size of the equipment is generally prohibitive for
      point-of-care tests.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Alternatively, a broad spectrum of chemically distinct
      aldehydes may be detected by mixing a drop of sample solution
      (which may contain the aldehyde) with 2 ml of 72 percent sulfuric
      acid in a test tube (disclosed at page 395 in "Qualitative
      Analysis by Spot Tests", Third Edition, authored by F. Feigl and
      published by Elsevier Publishing Company, Inc.). A small amount of
      solid chromatropic acid (1,8-dihydroxynapthlanene-3,6-disulfate)
      is added to the mixture, and the test tube is heated in a 60[deg.]
      C. water bath for about ten minutes. If an aldehyde is present, a
      bright violet color appears in the test solution. While the test
      is relatively non-specific for a particular aldehyde, the
      sensitivity of the test is reportedly about 3 ppm. However, the
      reaction mixture typically requires vigorous heating for at least
      10 minutes to provide an at least semi-quantitative and reliable
      test result.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In yet another method generally applicable to aldehydes,
      described at pages 339-340 of the Feigl publication, a drop of
      aqueous (or alcoholic) solution suspected of containing an
      aldehyde is treated on a spot plate with a drop of sulfurous acid
      and a drop of fuchsin/sulfuric acid and allowed to react on the
      plate. A red to blue color appears within about two to thirty
      minutes, according to the amount of aldehyde present in the test
      solution being tested. Such test is reportedly sensitive to about
      one microgram of formaldehyde in the drop of solution being
      tested. Although the fuchsin/sulfuric acid reaction can
      advantageously be performed at room temperature, the test results
      tend to vary depending on the time allowed for the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Although various quantitative and qualitative tests for
      aldehydes are known in the art, all or almost all of them suffer
      from one or more disadvantage. Moreover, despite the existence of
      known tests, it has never been appreciated that such tests can be
      applied to malondialdehyde in urine to detect oxidative stress.
      Thus, there is still a need to provide methods and apparatus for
      detecting oxidative stress in subjects.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0009] It has been discovered that the oxidative stress state of a
      person can be measured from the release into the urine of an
      aldehyde, and particularly malondialdehyde, and that an
      aldehyde-reactive chromogen based calorimetric test can measure
      the released aldehyde in a rapid, easily performed test.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In particular, a method of determining oxidative stress in
      a subject has one step in which presence of an aldehyde in a
      biological fluid of a subject is correlated with an oxidative
      stress in the subject. In another step, a test reagent comprising
      a pH regulator, a reducing agent, and an aldehyde-reactive
      chromogen is provided, and the test reagent is combined with the
      biological fluid to produce an aldehyde-modified chromogen. In yet
      another step, a color of the aldehyde-modified chromogen is
      correlated with the oxidative stress.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In one aspect of the inventive subject matter, any
      biological fluid is considered suitable for use with the test, and
      especially preferred fluids include saliva, serum, plasma, and
      spinal fluid, most preferably urine. It is further contemplated
      that such fluids are derived from a mammalian system (e.g., human,
      live stock, pet, or cell culture).<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In a further aspect of the inventive subject matter, the
      aldehyde comprises a dialdehyde, and especially contemplated
      dialdehydes include malondialdehyde. Particularly preferred pH
      regulators comprise a buffer or an acid, such as phosphoric acid
      and/or glacial acetic acid, and reducing agents typically have a
      sulfur (e.g., sodium metabisulfide) and/or phosphorous atom (e.g.,
      TCEP). Further preferred aldehyde-reactive chromogens (e.g.,
      fuchsin) include a reactive group that selectively reacts with an
      aldehyde and thereby shift their absorption maximum towards higher
      or lower wavelength in a concentration dependent manner.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0013] A test kit for determination of oxidative stress in a
      subject generally comprises a test reagent with a pH regulator, a
      reducing agent, and an aldehyde-reactive chromogen, wherein the
      aldehyde-reactive chromogen in the test reagent reacts with an
      aldehyde from a biological fluid to form an aldehyde-modified
      chromogen, and wherein the aldehyde-modified chromogen has a color
      intensity that correlates with the oxidative stress in the
      subject.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Consequently, a method of determining oxidative stress in a
      subject has a step in which the presence of an aldehyde in a
      biological fluid of a subject is correlated with an oxidative
      stress in the subject. In another step, a test reagent comprising
      a pH regulator, a reducing agent, and an aldehyde-reactive
      chromogen is provided, and the test reagent is combined with the
      biological fluid to produce an aldehyde-modified chromogen. In a
      yet further step, a color of the aldehyde-modified chromogen is
      correlated with the oxidative stress.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In a particularly preferred aspect of the inventive subject
      matter, a testing solution or reagent for testing for the presence
      of aldehyde in an aqueous solution comprises a solution of acetic
      acid, preferably about 20% acetic acid, and two additional
      ingredients designated herein as "Ingredient A" and "Ingredient
      B". Ingredient A consists essentially of sodium metabisulfite,
      phosphoric acid, and deionized water. The preferred proportions of
      the elements of ingredient A are about 18-22 grams sodium
      metabisulfite, 9-11 ml of concentrated phosphoric acid, and about
      450-550 ml deionized water. Most preferably, the proportions are
      20 grams sodium metabisulfite, 10 ml phosphoric acid, and about
      500 ml deionized water. Ingredient B consists essentially of a
      mixture of basic fuchsin (certified grade) and Ingredient A in the
      preferred proportions of about 0.45-0.55 grams basic fuchsin in
      about 90-110 ml of Ingredient A. Most preferably, the proportions
      are about 0.50 grams of basic fuchsin in about 100 ml of
      Ingredient A.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The components of the reagent are mixed in the proportion
      of about 90 to 110 parts of 20% acetic acid, 13.5-16.5 parts
      Ingredient A, and about 4.5-5.5 parts Ingredient B. An alternative
      method of making the reagent is as follows. First, dissolve 4
      grams of sodium metabisulfite in 80 ml of deionized water. Then,
      add 2 ml of concentrated phosphoric acid, and dilute the mixture
      with a quantity of deionized water sufficient to make 100 ml of
      dilute mixture. Then add 0.5 gram of basic fuchsin, and about 10
      grams of bone charcoal to decolorize the mixture. Remove the
      charcoal by centrifuging and filtering the mixture. Then, to 100
      ml of the decolorized solution, add 100 ml of 20%-40% glacial
      acetic acid, and finally, add 100 ml of deionized water. The
      active components are present in the reagent made this way in
      about the same proportion as in the method previously described.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The testing solution described above is preferably stored
      in individual, sealed test-size ampoules or vials of conventional
      medical solution type. When packaged in such a manner and stored
      in a cool, dry place, the sealed bottles or vials have an expected
      shelf storage life of at least 12 months. Assurance of active
      testing solution may be achieved, as described below, by positive
      aldehyde test procedures.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] A test for the presence of malondialdehyde in an aqueous
      solution is then made by mixing about 1 ml of test solution
      (containing traces of aldehyde) into about 0.2-0.6 ml of testing
      solution formulated as above. If the mixture of the test sample
      and testing solution remains colorless after a waiting period of
      about 2-5 minutes, the test is negative and the test sample
      therefore contains less than about 2 ppm aldehyde. Any color
      change of the mixture indicates presence of aldehyde in the test
      solution in a concentration greater than about 2 ppm. A positive
      malondialdehyde test is preferably by quality control techniques
      made before testing the test samples to assure that the testing
      solution is properly formulated or that, for example, the reagent
      bottles have not been replaced with other bottles containing
      non-testing solutions.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The positive malondialdehyde test is preferably performed
      by injecting 1 ml of available "Positive Aldehyde Test Solution
      (Standard)" into a bottle containing about 0.2-0.6 ml of the test
      solution. In approximately 2-5 minutes, the solution in the bottle
      should develop a pinkish-purple color provided the bottle contains
      properly formulated aldehyde testing solution. Otherwise, the
      bottle of "testing solution" from which the test bottle was
      selected should be discarded. The above-described positive test
      for aldehyde is sensitive to 10 ppm or more of aldehyde. For a 5
      ppm, a positive test for aldehyde, 0.5 ml of deionized water is
      used. A color less intense than that of the 10 ppm aldehyde test
      is obtained for the 5 ppm aldehyde test.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Basic fuchsin is a purple powder which reacts with
      aldehydes in the skin, urine or blood plasma. With low or no
      aldehydes present, there is no color development. With moderate or
      high levels of aldehydes, color gradations are roughly dependent
      on the level of aldehydes present. The amino group of the fuchsin
      couples with the aldehyde to produce the pink to purple color
      approximately dependent on the amount of aldehyde present in the
      blood or urine. A 40% glacial acetic acid solution gives maximum
      color development for the fuchsin reaction. Sodium metabisulfite
      ties up free oxygen so that only the aldehydes react with the
      fuchsin group. Basic fuchsin changes color in an acidic solution,
      relative to the amount of aldehyde present in the urine samples.
      The color developed depends on the pH, which is controlled by the
      amount of acid present. Metabisulfite is used to stop the
      interference of oxygen from air. Establishing a nitrogen blanket
      over the reagent mixture gives greater shelf life of the reagent
      to stop any oxygen reaction with the reagent. The phosphoric acid
      stabilizes the pH in a rough adjustment and the acetic acid gives
      the fine acid pH stabilization.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In alternative aspects of the inventive subject matter, it
      should be appreciated that the order, composition, and relative
      molar ratios of the reagents may vary substantially, and numerous
      modifications are contemplated so long as the test reagent
      comprises a pH regulator, a reducing agent (which may even be
      optional), and an aldehyde-reactive chromogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] For example, the pH regulator need not necessarily be
      limited to phosphoric acid and glacial acetic acid, and
      alternative pH regulators may include a buffer, an organic, an
      inorganic acid, or any reasonable combination thereof. For
      example, depending on the desired pH or pH range, suitable pH
      regulators may include a glycin-HCL buffer, a citrate buffer, a
      phosphate buffer, an acetate buffer, etc., and appropriate acids
      may include nitric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and so
      forth. Still further, it should be appreciated that where the
      reaction between the aldehyde and the aldehyde-reactive chromogen
      is base-facilitated or base-catalyzed, organic or inorganic bases
      may be employed, and contemplated bases include sodium hydroxide,
      potassium hydroxide, deprotonated weak organic acids, and any
      reasonable combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] With respect to the reducing agent, it is contemplated that
      many alternative reducing agents are also appropriate, and
      alternative reducing agents include agents with a sulfur and/or
      phosphorous atom. For example, where cost effectiveness is
      especially desirable mercaptoethanol, dithioerythrol (DTE) or
      dithiothreitol (DTT) may be utilized. On the other hand, where the
      objectionable odor of sulfur-based reagents is to be circumvented,
      phosphorous based reducing agents such as
      tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) may be employed. While the
      use of a reducing agent is generally preferred, it is also
      contemplated that no reducing agent may be necessary at all,
      especially where the remaining reagents/fluids have been purged
      (e.g., with argon) and/or have been kept under nitrogen or other
      oxygen free atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In yet further contemplated aspects, the aldehyde-reactive
      chromogen need not be limited to fuchsin, and various alternative
      aldehyde-reactive chromogens are contemplated. It is generally
      contemplated that suitable aldehyde-reactive chromogens comprise
      an aromatic system which may further be conjugated with at least
      another double- or triple bond containing system, and it is
      especially preferred that such aldehyde-reactive chromogens will
      have an absortion maximum of between about 240 nm to approximately
      900 nm. With respect to the molar extinction coefficient, it is
      generally preferred that the molar extinction coefficient if the
      aldehyde-modified chromogen is between 100-100000, more preferably
      between 1000 and 50000, and most preferably between 10000 and
      35000. It is further contemplated that suitable aldehyde-reactive
      chromogens have at least one reactive group that specifically
      reacts with an aldehyde, and particularly contemplated reactive
      groups include nucleophilic groups such as -NH, -NH2, -SH, -OH,
      etc. Suitable aldehyde-reactive chromogens are contemplated to
      have an absorption maximum and a reactive group that selectively
      reacts with the aldehyde, wherein the absorption maximum exhibits
      a hyperchromatic or hypochromatic shift when the reactive group
      reacts with the aldehyde. Alternatively, the maximum may be
      unaffected by the reaction of the reactive group, and it is then
      contemplated that the aldehyde-modified chromogen has (or looses)
      an additional maximum when compared to the aldehyde-reactive
      chromogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] It is generally contemplated that the concentration of
      aldehyde-modified chromogen can be visually (i.e., in an
      non-automated manner) determined, for example, by employing a
      reference chart which may be part of a test kit. Contemplated
      reference charts may thereby include a relative or arbitrary
      readout, or a semi-quantitative or quantitative readout.
      Alternatively, it is contemplated that the determination of the
      aldehyde may include an at least partially automated routine, and
      particularly contemplated routines may include a spectrophotometer
      (single or multiple wave length).<br>
      <br>
      [0026] With respect to molar proportions of alternative
      components, it should be appreciated that a particular composition
      will typically dictate particular molar proportions of the
      components, however, only such molar proportions are contemplated
      that will result in an observable and/or quantifiable change in
      light absorption (typically UV/VIS) when the aldehyde-reactive
      chromogen reacts with the aldehyde. While it is generally
      contemplated that the change in absorption has a substantially
      linear dependence on the concentration of the aldehyde-modified
      chromogen (i.e., follows the Lambert-Beer law), non-linear
      dependence is also contemplated. For example, where the aldehyde
      generates a catalytic intermediate species, logarithmic or
      pseudo-logarithmic dependence may occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] It is generally contemplated that malondialdehyde (MDA) and
      other related aldehydes are released from the breakdown of long
      chain polyunsaturated fatty acids by free radical attack.
      Interestingly, high levels of MDA and related aldehydes are found
      in a variety of diseases and disease states other than oxidative
      stress. Therefore, it should be especially appreciated that the
      methods and compositions according to the inventive subject matter
      may also be useful in detecting and/or confirming abnormal
      metabolism states, including coronary artery disease, type-1 and
      type-2 diabetes, and Parkinson disease.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Thus, specific embodiments and applications of tests for
      oxidative stress have been disclosed. It should be apparent,
      however, to those skilled in the art that many more modifications
      besides those already described are possible without departing
      from the inventive concepts herein. The inventive subject matter,
      therefore, is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Background of The Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Viral infections are relatively common infectious diseases, and
      various methods of treating a viral infection available to a
      practitioner. In one method of treating a viral infection, the
      immune response of an immune system is stimulated. For example, in
      some instances the Thl response of the patient can be increased
      relative to the Th2 response. An increase in the Thl response is
      thought to be beneficial because many viral infections are
      associated with a shift in the cytokine profile toward a Th2
      response, and a bias towards a Thl response is known to be
      facilitated by several approaches.<br>
      <br>
      In one approach, cytokines are administered to modulate the
      Thl/Th2 balance towards a Thl-type response. For example, Knight
      et al. postulate that treatment with<br>
      IL-12 (Interleukine-12), a cytokine that promotes the development
      of Thl cells, may be used as a treatment for AIDS since IL 12
      administration has been shown to be effective at restoring
      cell-mediated immunity in mice infected with mouse AIDS virus or
      with RLV [Knight, S. C. and Patterson, S., Annu. Rev. Immunol.
      1994.15: 593-615].<br>
      <br>
      In another example, Gracie, J. A. et al., demonstrated that
      administration of IL-18 to mice exhibited pleiotropic activities
      critical to the development of Thl responses. [Gracie et al. J
      Clin Invest 1999 Nov 15; 104 (10): 1393-1401]. Although the
      administration of cytokines typically results in relatively
      specific increases in desired Thl cytokines, prolonged
      administration of cytokines may be problematic for various
      reasons. For example, the production of recombinant cytokines is
      relatively expensive, and isolation of non-recombinant cytokines
      from natural sources is generally difficult due to the very low
      concentration of cytokines in natural sources. Moreover, depending
      on the nature of the cytokine, cytokines may not be well tolerated
      in patients.<br>
      <br>
      In another approach, immunomodulatory substances other than
      cytokines may be employed to increase the Thl response. For
      example, Sprietsma J. E. suggests that zinc ions (un2) and nitric
      oxide (NO), together with glutathione (GSH) and its oxidized form,
      GSSG, may help to regulate an immune response to antigens
      [Sprietsma J. E; Med Hypotheses 1999 Ju1 ; 53 (1) : 6-16]. The
      author reports in more detail that deficiencies of<br>
      Zn2+, NO and/or GSH shift the Thl/Th2 balance towards Th2, and
      that replenishment with Zn2+, NO and/or GSH may shift the Thl/Th2
      balance towards Thl. Administration of Zn2+ or GSH/GSSG is
      especially advantageous, since these substances are non-toxic at
      even elevated concentrations, and inexpensive to produce.
      Furthermore, Zn2+ and GSH/GSSG preparations may be orally
      administered, and therefore significantly reduce the risk of
      allergic reactions, especially when the preparations are not
      ultrapure. However, the administration of Zn2+ and/or GSH/GSSG
      seems to be beneficial only to restore a Thl/Th2 balance from a
      Th2 dominated state, whereas it is unclear if administration of
      Zn2+ and/or GSH/GSSG may increase a Thl response from a normal<br>
      Thl/Th2 balance.<br>
      <br>
      In another method of treating a viral infection, the virus is
      directly targeted with an appropriate anti-viral drug. For
      example, patients infected with the HIV virus often receive a
      cocktail of drugs to block virus propagation, and various classes
      for direct anti-viral treatment are known in the art. Some direct
      anti-viral drugs block the reverse transcriptase of a retrovirus.
      Reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors are typically nucleoside
      analogs such as AZT, 3TC, or ddI. Alternatively, non-nucleoside RT
      inhibitors, including quercetin may be employed. In vitro, RT
      inhibitors are typically potent antiviral drugs. However, in vivo,
      and especially during a period of relatively fast viral
      replication, the generation of RT inhibitor resistant virus
      mutants is problematic. Moreover, many RT inhibitors also exhibit
      undesirable activity on DNA replication in the host organism and
      significant cytotoxicity at elevated concentrations, thereby
      limiting the concentration that may be administered without severe
      side effects.<br>
      <br>
      Among other direct anti-viral drugs are the protease inhibitors,
      which block or interfere with virus protein processing. Protease
      inhibitors are typically highly specific towards the
      viruses'proteolytic enzymes, however, due to their mostly
      hydrophobic nature, administration at desirable concentrations
      often becomes problematic. Another problem is that development of
      cross-resistance and severe side effects frequently occur. In
      order to reduce the development of multidrug resistant virus
      strains, mixtures of RT inhibitors and protease inhibitors may be
      prescribed. Although such mixtures are presently employed
      relatively successfully, the relatively high occurrence of adverse
      side effects and the potential of generating multidrug resistant
      virus strains persist.<br>
      <br>
      To circumvent at least some of the problems associated with side
      effects and relatively high costs of antiviral drugs, Bennett et
      al. describe in U. S. Pat. No.<br>
      <br>
      5,602,180 the use of EDTA complexes in a suppository. The use of
      chelating agents, including EDTA, has been found to promote
      disintegration of retroviruses [Wunderlich, V. and Sydow, G. Arch.
      Virol. 1982,73: 171-183]. Bennett's suppositories contain disodium
      EDTA and controlled-release agents, which release the disodium
      EDTA over a period of about three to four hours after rectal
      placement of the suppository. However, Bennett's suppositories are
      limited to disodium EDTA that exhibits relatively moderate
      selectivity between Mg2+ and Ca2+.<br>
      <br>
      Although various antiviral compositions and antiviral treatments
      are known in the art, all or almost all of them have one or more
      disadvantages. Therefore, there is a need to provide improved
      methods and compositions for treatment of viral infections.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention is directed to an antiviral composition
      having a supply of chelating agent that chelates an alkaline earth
      metal ion, wherein the chelating agent is formulated in a rectal
      deposition formulation, and wherein the supply of chelating agent
      has an immediate bioavailability. When rectally administered to a
      subject in an effective dose in vivo, contemplated agents promote
      disintegration of a virus.<br>
      <br>
      In one aspect of the inventive subject matter, generally preferred
      chelating agents are various chelators other than
      ethylenediamine-N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid (EDTA), chelate Ca2+
      and/or Mg2+, and include at least three carboxylic acid groups.<br>
      <br>
      While particularly preferred chelating agents include at least
      three acetic acid groups, especially contemplated chelating agents
      are 1, 2-Bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane<br>
      N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), Ethylenebis
      (oxyethylenenitrilo) tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 1, 2-bis
      (2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis
      (acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM), diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic
      acid (DTPA), trimethylaminetricarboxylic acid (NTA), trans-1,
      2-diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic acid (CDTA), poly (aspartic acid),
      and poly (glutamic acid).<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect of the inventive subject matter, contemplated
      viruses include a retrovirus, and especially contemplated
      retroviruses include the HIV virus. Preferred rectal deposition
      formulations are a liquid or a solid, and where the rectal
      deposition formulation is a solid and administered to the colon of
      a subject, substantially of the supply of chelating agent is
      present in the colon in a readily absorbable form in less than 2
      hours, preferably less than 1 hour, and more preferably less than
      30 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to the effective dose in a rectal administration, it
      is contemplated that the chelating agent is employed in an amount
      of 500mg, and more preferably 1500mg.<br>
      <br>
      In yet another aspect of the inventive subject matter, chelating
      agents other than EDTA may also be employed for purposes other
      than antiviral treatment, including heavy metal detoxification,
      and reduction of atherosclerotic plaques, wherein the chelating
      agent may be orally or parenterally administered.<br>
      <br>
      Various objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present
      invention will become more apparent from the following detailed
      description of preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Detailed Description</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      As used herein, the term"chelating agent"refers to a molecule that
      binds a metal ion and/or an alkaline earth metal ion via a
      non-covalent bond, most commonly a coordinate bond, with a KD of
      less than 10-3 mol'1, wherein the chelating agent may be in acid
      form, base form or a salt form. For example, EGTA in protonated or
      sodium salt form is considered a free chelating agent, because
      EGTA binds Mg2+ and Ca2+ with a KD of less than 10-3 mol-1.<br>
      <br>
      As also used herein, the term"immediate bioavailability"means that
      a composition or molecule is present in an active form in a
      formulation such that a substantial portion of a dose of the
      composition or molecule exhibits some systemic chelating effect
      within minutes, preferably within less than 15min, more preferably
      within less than 10 min, and most preferably within less than
      5min. For example, a molecule that is dissolved in a carrier
      solution is regarded to have immediate bioavailability.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that retroviruses can be disintegrated by chelating
      agents, especially by agents that chelate Mg2+ and/or Ca2+, and
      that chelating agents may further reduce infectivity of certain
      viruses [Wunderlich, V. and Sydow, G. Arch. Virol. 1982, 73:
      171183]. Thus, it is contemplated that an antiviral composition
      generally has a supply of a chelating agent that chelates an
      alkaline earth metal ion, and it is particularly contemplated that
      the chelating agent in the antiviral composition is formulated in
      a rectal deposition formulation, wherein the supply of chelating
      agent has an immediate bioavailability.<br>
      <br>
      It should be appreciated that many chelating agents are known in
      the art, and that all of the known chelating agents are
      contemplated for use herein. It is generally preferred that
      contemplated chelating agents include at least three carboxylic
      acid groups, all of which are preferably acetic acid groups.
      Although not excluded, it is further contemplated that appropriate
      chelating agents are chelating agents other than EDTA. The choice
      of the particular chelating agent is predominantly determined by
      the desired physicochemical properties and tolerability of the
      chelating agent. For example, where a relatively high solubility
      (e. g., 1M) is desired, EGTA, CDTA or NTA may advantageously be
      employed. Where a more pronounced selectivity of chelation towards
      Ca2+ is desirable, BAPTA may be utilized, and BAPTA-AM may be
      particularly suitable where sequestration of Ca2+ within a cell is
      desired. Alternatively, contemplated chelating agents may include
      DTPA, NTA, and polymeric forms of aspartic acid, glutamic acid,
      and any reasonable combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to viruses that can be disintegrated and/or reduced
      in infectivity, virus particles that require Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ for
      structural integrity of their envelope are generally contemplated
      and include DNA and RNA viruses. Particularly contemplated RNA
      viruses are retroviruses in general, and HIV in particular.
      Further especially contemplated viruses include the hepatitis C
      and hepatitis D virus. Contemplated DNA viruses include
      polyomaviruses, HBV, etc. However, many more viruses are also
      contemplated, and a collection of appropriate viruses are listed
      in Fields Virology, Third Edition (Lippincot Williams &amp;
      Wilkins), pages 40-41,52, and 1767-1847, and Arch. Virol. 1982,73:
      171-183, both of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
      <br>
      It is still further contemplated that chelating agents are
      preferably formulated in a rectal deposition formulation, which
      may be in solid or liquid form. Where the formu- lation is in a
      solid form, it is further contemplated that appropriate forms
      include dissolvable carriers such as waxes, fatty acids and oils
      with melting points of about 30 - 35 C. Especially preferred
      formulations are formulations known in the art that are employed
      in the fabrication of rectal suppositories, so long as such
      formulations allow an immediate bioavailability. Thus, where a
      supply of chelating agent is administered into the colon of a
      subject in a solid form, it is particularly contemplated that
      substantially all of the supply of chelating agent is present in
      the colon in a readily absorbable form in less than 2 hours, more
      preferably less than 1 hour, and most preferably less 30 minutes
      after the administration of the formulation. Availability of the
      chelating agent or a portion of the chelating agent in less that
      2hrs, less than lhr or less than 30min may be achieved by a
      variety of time release formulations, and contemplated time
      release formulations may include formulations with a melting point
      of less than 37 C, enzymatically degradable carriers, dissolving
      or swellable carriers, etc. Thus, it is contemplated that an
      entire dose of chelating agent may be available (or released from
      the time release formulation) in less than 2 hours, preferably
      less than lhour, and even more pref- erably in less than 30min. A
      particular advantage of such time release formulations is that
      relatively high dosages may be administered that might otherwise
      pose a potential risk if administered without a time release
      formulation. However, it should be appreciated that
      administrations without time release may safely be administered by
      employing smaller dosages at multiple administrations.<br>
      <br>
      Where the formulation is in a liquid form, it is contemplated that
      appropriate liquid forms may include buffered and unbuffered
      solutions, solutions with relatively high viscosity such as gels,
      creams, foams and ointments, which may or may not have a decreased
      viscosity at elevated temperatures. Liquid forms are particularly
      advantageous, since the delivery of the chelating agent is almost
      instantaneous. Where the solutions are buffered, it is
      contemplated that the buffers have an alkaline pH, and a preferred
      pH range is a range between 8.0 and 10.0.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the chelating agent may also be administered in
      various alternative routes, and it is especially contemplated that
      where the chelating agent is an agent other than EDTA that
      appropriate routes include oral and parenteral administration. For
      example, CDTA may be orally administered in form of an acid
      resistant caplet or capsule. However, oral administration need not
      be limited to a caplet or capsule, and alternative oral
      administrations include syrups, powders, tablets, etc. In another
      example, EGTA may be parenterally administered by intravenous
      injection. It is contemplated, however, that alternative
      parenteral administrations may also include inhalation,
      transdermal delivery, injections into sites other than a vein,
      etc.<br>
      <br>
      In a particularly contemplated aspect of the inventive subject
      matter, it is preferred that the administration of the chelating
      agent is accompanied by (preferably oral) administration of a
      nutritional supplement. Preferred nutritional supplements include
      supplements that help replenish calcium levels and particularly
      preferred supplements include aragonite calcium carbonate from
      fossil coral minerals. Other contemplated supplements that include
      herbal products (e. g., adaptogenic formulations with no apparent
      cytotoxicity) are contemplated to assist in inhibition of viral
      replication (e. g., by inhibiting the production of reverse
      transcriptase). It is further contemplated that such supplements
      may also help boost the immune system and potentially improve
      overall vitality and stamina. It is further contemplated that such
      adaptogenic supplements are considered to have tumor preventive
      and radio-protective properties, and may help increase the
      functioning of the immune system by increasing the T-cell
      population. Exemplary compositions for contemplated nutritional
      supplements are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
      <br>

      Arcticum lappa 40mg (10: 1 concentrate)<br>
      Viola yedoensis 40mg (10: 1 concentrate)<br>
      Andrographis paniculata 40mg (10: 1 concentrate)<br>

      philoeroides 1 Omg (10 : 1 concentrate)<br>
      Table 2<br>
      <br>
      It should be appreciated, however, that various additional
      ingredients may be added to the supplement depicted in Table 1 and
      2 to either enhance or modulate the activity of the herbal
      components.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to the amount of chelating agent it is contemplated,
      that the chelating agent is administered to a subject in vivo in a
      dose effective to promote disintegration of a virus in the
      subject. The actual dose of the chelating agent may thereby vary
      among individual subject and may further be determined by the
      particular virus that is to be disintegrated. Therefore, an
      effective dose may comprises rectal administration of the
      chelating agent between about 5mg-2500mg, and generally
      contemplated doses include rectal administration of 500mg or
      1500mg of the chelating agent. However, where even higher dosages
      of the chelating agent are required, or where it is preferred to
      maintain relatively high dosages over an extended period of time,
      multiple dosages are also contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      It should further be appreciated that appropriate formulations may
      further comprise active and/or inactive ingredients. For example,
      active ingredients may include compositions to stimulate the
      immune system, an immunomodulating composition, a coral mineral
      product, compositions to facilitate uptake of the chelating agent
      into the blood stream, or direct antiviral compounds such as
      nucleoside analogs, etc. The term "immunomodulating composition"as
      used herein refers to a composition that enhances at least one of
      a humoral and cellular response towards a challenge. For example,
      an immunomodulating composition may increase an antibody titer
      against a challenge, or an activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.
      Inactive ingredients may include fillers, coloring agents,
      thixotropic compositions, and foam building agents.<br>
      <br>
      In an exemplary use, a person diagnosed with an HIV infection
      receives twice daily an enema of 20ml of a 50mg/ml solution of
      EGTA in 10mM sodium phosphate buffer pH8.4 for at least 30
      consecutive days. It should be recognized, however, that the
      exemplary use need not be limited to the specified amounts and
      times, but treatment schedules may vary considerably. For example,
      where the person already receives an antiviral medication (e. g.,
      protease inhibitor cocktail, RT-inhibitor, etc.), lower dosages or
      less frequent administrations are contemplated, while in cases
      where the person does not receive another antiviral treatment,
      higher dosages and more frequent administrations are contemplated.
      It is also contemplated that the antiviral composition may be
      employed in a preventative fashion, i. e., the antiviral
      composition may be employed in a person that is not infected with
      a virus.<br>
      <br>
      It is still further contemplated that the compositions according
      to the inventive subject matter may have advantageous properties
      and uses in therapeutic applications other than antiviral
      activity, especially where the chelating agent is a substance
      other than EDTA, and particularly contemplated uses include heavy
      metal detoxification in animal and human, and reduction of
      atherosclerotic plaque.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to heavy metal detoxification in animal and human, it
      is known in the art that upon oral administration or injection
      EDTA complexes various metals and heavy metals other than Ca2+,
      and oral administration or injection of EDTA has therefore found
      widespread use in detoxifycation of some heavy metal poisonings.
      Various alternative oral or injectable chelation agents for heavy
      metals have also been described [e. g., Llobet, J. M. et al. Arch.
      Environ Contam. Toxicol. 1990,19 (2): 185-9; Treatment of acute
      lead intoxication. A quantitative comparison of a number of
      chelating agents.<br>
      <br>
      Llobet, J. M. et al. Arch. Toxicol. 1988,61 (4): 321-3; Antidotes
      for zinc intoxication in mice] and include oral and injectable
      forms of penicillamine, 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, and
      2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate. However, it is not known to the
      inventors that chelators other than EDTA have been used for
      detoxification of heavy metals in animal and human via rectal
      administration. Rectal administration is particularly advantageous
      for various reasons. For example, suppositories can be
      self-administered by al most all patients. Furthermore, rectal
      administration inflicts only relatively low discomfort to the
      patient. Moreover, rectal administration bypasses the stomach, a
      highly acidic environment that may lead to at least partial
      destruction of some of the chelating agents.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it is contemplated that rectal administration of
      chelating agents may also be employed in a method to reduce a
      heavy metal concentration in a subject, wherein in one step a
      chelating agent is provided that chelates a metal ion, wherein the
      chelating agent is formulated in a rectal deposition formulation
      and wherein the supply of chelating agent has an immediate
      bioavailability. Alternatively, the rectal deposition formulation
      may further comprise a time release agent to release the chelating
      agent in a period of between 0-30min, 30-60min, 60-120min,
      120-180min, or longer. In another step, the chelating agent is
      rectally administered to the subject in a concentration effective
      to reduce the heavy metal ion concentration.<br>
      <br>
      It is generally contemplated that the heavy metal may be in
      elemental or ionic form, and particularly contemplated heavy
      metals include mercury, Zn2+, Cu+, Cd2+, and Co2+. However,
      various alternative metals and their ionic forms are also
      contemplated, including nickel, arsenic, selenium, iron, mercury,
      chromium, antimony, beryllium, thallium, silver, scandium,
      titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, etc. While it is
      generally contemplated that all known chelating agents may be
      suitable for reduction of heavy metals in a subject, it is
      particularly preferred that the chelating agent comprises a
      plurality of carboxylic acid groups and it is even more preferred
      that the chelating agent is EDTA, EGTA, CDTA, or DTPA. With
      respect to the rectal deposition formulation the same
      considerations as already described above apply.<br>
      <br>
      An exemplary method of reducing a heavy metal concentration in a
      subject may therefore comprise a single rectal administration of
      20ml of a l Omg/ml buffered aqueous solution of CDTA three times
      daily over a period of about 15-20 days. It should be recognized,
      however, that depending on the particular heavy metal, the site of
      accumulation, and the concentration of the heavy metal in the
      subject many treatment schedules other than a single rectal
      administration of 20ml of a l Omg/ml buffered aqueous solu- tion
      of CDTA three times daily over a period of about 15-20 days are
      also appropriate.<br>
      <br>
      For example, where treatment is prophylactic or necessitated by
      relatively low concentrations of a heavy metal, total daily
      dosages of less than 600mg are contemplated, including total daily
      dosages of 200-600mg, 50-200mg, and less that 50mg.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, where acute and/or severe heavy metal intoxications are
      to be treated by a method according to the inventive subject
      matter, higher total daily dosages of more than 600mg are
      contemplated, including total daily dosages of 600-1500mg,
      15002500mg, and more than 2500mg. With respect to the formulation
      it should be appreciated that numerous alternative formulations
      are also appropriate, and contemplated alternative formulations
      include the formulations already described above. Similarly, it
      should be appreciated that various alternative administration
      periods other than a period of about 15-20 days are also
      appropriate, including single administrations in cases where
      treatment is prophylactic, or administration over a period of less
      than 15 days, where the heavy metal concentration is relatively
      low. On the other hand, where the heavy metal is predominantly is
      tissues that bind the heavy metal relatively firmly (e. g.
      lipophilic tissue) administrations of 2-6 weeks and longer are
      contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      With respect atherosclerotic plaques it is contemplated that
      rectal administration of chelating agents may also be employed in
      a method to reduce a atherosclerotic plaques in a subject, wherein
      in one step a chelating agent is provided that chelates an
      alkaline earth metal ion, wherein the chelating agent is
      formulated in a rectal deposition formulation and wherein the
      supply of chelating agent has an immediate bioavailability.<br>
      <br>
      In another step, the chelating agent is rectally administered to
      the subject in a concentration effective to reduce the
      atherosclerotic plaque in a subject. As used herein, the term
      "reducing the atherosclerotic plaque"refers to a gross reduction
      in size and/or volume of one or more atherosclerotic plaques,
      which may also include complete disappearance of the
      atherosclerotic plaque or plaques.<br>
      <br>
      In an exemplary method of reducing atherosclerotic plaque, a
      person diagnosed with atherosclerotic plaques receives once daily
      an enema of 10ml of a 50mg/ml solution of EGTA in 1 OmM sodium
      phosphate buffer pH8.4 for a period of about 12 weeks.<br>
      <br>
      However, it should be appreciated that the exemplary method need
      not be limited to the specified amounts and times, and formulation
      and treatment schedules may vary considerably. For example, where
      the person already underwent a vasodilation procedure, lower
      dosages or less frequent administrations are contemplated, while
      in cases where the person did not receive previous treatment to
      reduce the atherosclerotic plaques, higher dosages and more
      frequent administrations are contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, the chelating agent need not be limited to EGTA, but may
      be various alternative chelating agents including EDTA, CDTA, and
      DTPA, wherein the choice of the chelating agent will predominantly
      depend on the desired specificity of the chelator and the
      tolerability at a particular concentration. Furthermore, the
      formulation of the chelating agent need not be restricted to 1 Oml
      of a 50mg/ml solution of EGTA in 1 OmM sodium phosphate buffer
      pH8.4. For example, alternative formulations may be employed to
      achieve a larger distribution, faster absorbption, etc., and
      appropriate formulations include those already described above.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, specific embodiments and applications of antiviral
      compositions have been disclosed. It should be apparent, however,
      to those skilled in the art that many more modifications besides
      those already described are possible without departing from the
      inventive concepts herein. For example, the route of
      administration need not necessarily be restricted to a rectal
      administration of the chelating agent, but may also include
      vaginal administration. The inventive subject matter, therefore,
      is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the appended
      claims. Moreover, in interpreting both the specification and the
      claims, all terms should be interpreted in the broadest possible
      manner consistent with the context. In particular, the
      terms"comprises"and"comprising"should be interpreted as referring
      to elements, components, or steps in a non-exclusive manner,
      indicating that the referenced elements, components, or steps may
      be present, or utilized, or combined with other elements,
      components, or steps that are not expressly referenced.<br>
