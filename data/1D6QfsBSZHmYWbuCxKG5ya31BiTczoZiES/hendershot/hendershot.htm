          Important ~ Built On A Radio Principle ~ Armature Winding New
          -- Invention Inspired By Young Son -- Lindbergh Flies Here</i>
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Detroit, Mich, Feb. 25 -- W.B. Stout,
        head of the Stout Air Lines and designer of the all-metal
        tri-motored Ford Monoplane, declared here today that he had seen
        what he characterized as an "impressive" demonstration of the
        Hendershot fuelless motor two weeks ago in Pittsburgh. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Lester J. Hendershot, the inventor,
        and his associate. D. Barr Peat, who is manager of the Bettis
        Field at McKeesport, demonstrated the motor secretly yesterday
        in a hangar at Selfridge Field. This block test was witnessed by
        Major Thomas G. Lanspier, Clonel Charles A. Lindbergh and
        others. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">It was explained today that the model
        used in the demonstration was a much smaller machine than an
        actual working motor capable of developing enough power to lift
        and propel an airplane. Its designers claim for it that it runs
        on an electromagnetic principle, bywhich it draws its force
        directly from the earth’s field, and through the properties
        within the motor itself transforms these electric currents into
        power tha can be delivered efficiently at a propeller shaft. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;"><i>Calls
          Demonstration Uncanny&nbsp;</i> </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">"The demonstration was very
        impressive", Mr. Stout said. "It was actually uncanny. I would
        like very much to see how a large model designed to develop
        power enough to lift an airplane would operate". </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Mr. Stout said the model he saw was
        about the size of the tiny motors used in vacuum cleaners. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">"I was told that the revolutionary
        feature was a hereto unknown manner of winding the armature",
        Mr. Stout continued. "Hendershot said he had succeeded in
        winding it in such a way that it draws energy directly from
        electrical currents which exist constantly in the air or in the
        ground. Such sources of cheap and inexhaustible power, of
        course, never have been reached before. The small model appeared
        to operate exactly as Hendershot explained that it did". </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Neither Colonel Lindbergh nor Major
        Lanphier would express themselves at length on the test they
        witnessed yesterday. Major Lanphier admitted, however, that they
        were experimenting with it and referred all questions to
        Hendershot. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">"He is the only one who knows all
        about it", the Major said. "Lindbergh has nothing to do with it,
        although he saw it". </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">William B. Mayo, chief engineer for
        the Ford Motor Company, was in conference with Major Lanphier,
        Hendershot and Peat at Major Lanphier’s quarters today. </p>

      <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;"><i>Hendershot Made
          First Fuelless Motor For His Son’s Toy Plane&nbsp;</i> </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The invention of the fuelless motor,
        tested at Detroit, was the result of a dream by its inventor,
        Lester Jennings Hendershot, who lives on "the street back of the
        railroad" in this town of about 3,000 inhabitants, 15 miles from
        Pittsburgh. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Although Hendershot was on his way
        from Selfridge Field today and is not expected home until
        tomorrow, his wife told of his conception of the machine and how
        the miniature model was constructed from the parts of a worn out
        radio which had been given to the inventor by his uncle. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Several years ago the vision of a
        machine which would operate from "earth currents" came to
        Hendershot in a dream, according to his wife, but it was not
        until last November that he actually started working on it. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">His 4-year old boy had built a small
        airplane at that time and was considerably chagrined because it
        would not operate. The father was disturbed too, so he told his
        son he would build an airplane which would work. The result of
        that was the fuelless machine.<span style="font-weight: bold;">
        </span></p>
      <div style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;"><i>First Model
          Worked Toy Plane&nbsp;</i> </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">When the miniature motor model had
        been constructed, Hendershot built a small airplane and placed
        the machine in it. A switch was turned and immediately the
        propeller began to move. The machie was not connected to any
        electrical current, but was running on is own accord from "earth
        currents". </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">For several weeks the little motor
        and the airplane rested upon a small table in the living room of
        the Hendershot home, which faces an unpaved street near the
        railroad tracks. One day D. Barr Peat of Bettis Field, the air
        mail port near McKeesport, Pa., visited the Hendershot home to
        see the model. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">He immediately became enthusiastic
        and a few weeks later he and Hendershot were at Selfridge Field
        where permission was been granted to build a model large enough
        to operate an airplane. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Hendershot, who is only 29 years old,
        was born in Hyndmann, Pa. His schooling has not been extensive,
        although he spent a few months several years ago at Cornell
        University, where he took a few courses in mechanics. He has not
        been employed at any particular task and has been known as a
        "freelance" worker. He has been a fireman and an engineer on the
        railroad, has worked in the mills near Pittsburgh, has inspected
        concrete and done electrical work. During the war he was a
        bugler with a machine gun company, but did not get overseas. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;"><i>Still Wants To
          See "How They Work"&nbsp;</i> </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">According to his mother, he has
        always been interested in mechanics and when a child he would
        insist upon taking his playthings apart. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">And that desire has not escaped him a
        man, for even now he takes his own son’s playthings apart to
        "see how they work". </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">It required only a few weeks for him
        to construct the miniature model of his fuelless motor, although
        he worked day and night during that time. He had a crude
        workbench in the cellar of his home, which was placed near the
        furnace, where it was warm. Early in the morning he would be
        there, tinkering about, and late at night he still could be
        found there. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Hendershot’s idea was that the earth
        currents which make the aurora borealis in the skies could be
        harnessed by man and made to produce power that would operate an
        engine. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The youthful inventor has no other
        inventions to his credit.<br>

          <p><b><font size="+1">"Works On Principle Of Compass"</font></b></p>
        </center>
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Lester J. Hendershot first came to
        Bettis airplane field in McKeesport between two and three years
        ago, and soon afterward brought one of his motor models to the
        officers of the field for inspection. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The fuelless motor works somewhat on
        the principle of a compass, and the original model would always
        operate when pointing north or south, as does the compass, but
        would not move when pointed east or west. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Young Hendershot worked nearly two
        years to overcome this defect, and finally he brought a motor to
        the Bettis field that appeared to be working perfectly. This
        motor was installed in a small model airplane and the plane
        flew, but owing to the failure to rig it properly, it crashed to
        the ground during on of the experiments. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Constantly improving the motor,
        Hendershot finally interested D. Barr Peat, manager of the
        Bettis Field, in his invention. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">After a short time several capitalist
        were interested, and a few weeks ago the motor was taken to
        Detroit by Hendershot and Peat for an exhibition. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">While no person at the field was in
        position to say authoritatively, it was stated that the
        capitalists who become interested in the Hendershot motor have
        about completed their arrangements for the purchase of the
        invention, or for controlling its production. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The fuelless motor, it is said,
        appears to have tremendous power and easily made between 1500
        and 2000 revolutions per minute on several occasions while being
        tested at the field. Pilots and mechanics believe it to be the
        greatest invention of the age, and all appear sure it will be a
        practical success as an airship motor. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">It was stated at the field that the
        inspection of the motor by Colonel Lindbergh was made in the
        interests of the capitalists who were arranging to purchase the
        invention.<br>

          <p><b><font size="+1">"Fuelless Motor Is A Generator"</font></b></p>
        </center>
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The Hendershot "Fuelless motor" is
        not a motor at all but a generator, according to Major Thomas G.
        lanphier, commandant at Selfridge Field, Mich., where he with
        Lester J. Hendershot, the inventor, and D. Barr Peat, have been
        quietly working on an experimental model. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Major Lanphier said he first became
        interested in the Hendershot electrical machine several weeks
        ago through Peat; that in common with others he thought at first
        it was more or less "bunk" but after seeing it work he became
        interested. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">"I saw the first model which
        Hendershot built hooked up to a small electric motor of the type
        used to operate a sewing machine. It not only ran the motor but
        it burned it out", Major Lanphier said. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Why this generator acts as it does,
        where the energy comes from that transforms it into power, Major
        Lanphier was not prepared to say beyond quoting Hendershot. It
        is the inventor’s theory that his machine draws its energy from
        the earth’s magnetic field. While unwilling to describe it in
        detail until pending patents have been received, Major Lanphier
        told a little about it. The first model consisted of a ring
        magnet less than three inches in diameter. Around the magnet
        were coils rigged as only Hendershot knows how to rig them, and
        another set of coils pass through the center of the ring. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">"With this contrivance we burned out
        the sewing machine motor and we also kept a 6 watt lamp going
        with it for 26 hours", he said. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The larger model which has not yet
        been hooked to a motor that will deliver power to a crankshaft,
        Major Lanphier himself helped build. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">"We put it together out of stuff we
        picked up at the field and with it we lighted two 110 watt
        lamps", Major Lanphier said. "I think that we have got enough
        electricity in this second model to kill a man". </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The second model is built around a
        ring magnet, the outside diameter of which is seven inches and
        the inside diameter six inches. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">It was suggested that perhaps the
        Hendershot engine was "stealing" power from some big radio
        broadcasting station. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">"We thought of that", Lanphier said,
        "but we ran it for 26 hours when stations were going and when
        they were not and we got the same results". </p>

      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Representative M. Clyde Kelly of
        Pennsylvania, it became known here today, plans to seek a
        Congressional patent for the "fuelless" motor of Lester J.
        Hendershot of West Elizabeth, Pa., if five scientists approve
        the invention as practical. A Congressional patent gives the
        patentee full protection for 17 years. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Hendershot’s invention, which he
        describes as a "magnetic induction" motor, was first announced
        in March. At that time in some quarters it was regarded with
        skepticism. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The motor, according to its inventor,
        is without visible means of power. It obtains its initial
        impulse, Hendershot maintains, from a precharged magnetic core,
        and its secondary and greatest power impulse by magnetic
        induction from the earth. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Hendershot today said several of his
        motors had been built here, and that one, which developed 60
        horsepower, had been in operation for two weeks without
        recharging the magnetic core. </p>

          Shifting Its Field To east And West Causes Rotary Motion ~

      <div style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Mildly indignant because the manner
        in which his fuelless motor gains its power had been
        misrepresented in dispatches from Detroit and Washington, Lester
        J. Hendershot today stated there was nothing mysterious about
        his motor, that the force that energizes it is the "same force
        that pulls the needle of the compass, and there is nothing
        mysterious about that". </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The fuelless motor was not his
        objective, he explained, at the time he began his experiments
        some three years ago, when he first became interested in
        aviation. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">"I soon learned that the ultimate
        development o aviation depended upon the discovery or invention
        of an absolutely true and reliable compass", he explained. "The
        ordinary magnetic compass does not point to the true north -- it
        points to the magnetic north, and varies from the true north to
        a different extent at almost every point on the earth’s surface.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">"There is another compass, the
        magnetic induction compass, that indicates true north. But it
        must be set before each flight, and is not always reliable. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">"I found that with a pre-magnetized
        core I could set up a magnetic field that would indicate true
        north, but I didn’t know just how to utilize that in the compass
        I set out to find. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">"In continuing my experiments, I
        learned that by cutting the same line of magnetic force north
        and south, I had an indicator of the true north, and that by
        cutting the magnetic field east and west, I could develop a
        rotary motion. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">I now have a motor built on that
        principle that will rotate at a constant speed, a speed
        predetermined when the motor is built. It can be built for any
        desired speed, and a reliable constant speed motor is one of the
        greatest needs of aviation. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The main secret of Mr. Hendershot’s
        invention, his Friend Barr Peat declares, is the method of
        winding a magnet in the motor so that it will rotate in the
        opposite direction than the earth revolves. He says there is no
        heat, because magnetic forces are cold and the motor is stopped
        only by breaking the magnetic field in the windings. The magnet
        in the motor, he thinks, probably would have to be recharged
        after about 2000 hours of operation. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Mr. Hendershot declares that one of
        his motors, complete and ready to be installed in an airplane
        would weigh little more than four ounces for every horsepower it
        developed, while the best of the gas engines now built weighs
        about two pounds per horsepower. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Mr. Hendershot says that altitude
        would not affect the efficient operation of his motor, for the
        magnetic influence of the earth has been found to remain the
        same as high as man has ever reached. </p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">He said that the same principle which
        made his original model operate only when it was placed in one
        direction, north and south, will be developed so that it will
        provide a compass that will always indicate true north.<br>
