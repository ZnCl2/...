      <div align="center"><b>Treat cancer with cold plasma? Purdue
          aerospace engineer helps bring first clinical trial</b><br>
        <b>by Kayla Wiles</b><br>

      <br>
      Cold atmospheric plasma technology, currently the only way to
      remove microscopic cancer tumors remaining from surgery, has been
      approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for first-ever
      use in a clinical trial.<br>
      <br>
      For solid tumor cancers such as those in the breast and lungs,
      standard treatment involves chemotherapy, radiation, surgery or
      all of the above. When these tumors aren’t fully removed, they can
      cause the cancer to come back. Approximately 20%-40% of women
      undergoing partial mastectomy in the U.S. each year, for example,
      return to surgery because of marginal tumors that the surgeon
      couldn’t see the first time around.<br>
      <br>
      A multi-institute team, which included Purdue University aerospace
      engineer Alexey Shashurin, developed a pen-like electrosurgical
      scalpel that sprays a blue jet of cold plasma at any remaining
      cancerous tissue or cells for 2-7 minutes. The device targets only
      tumors, leaving surrounding tissue unharmed, as demonstrated in
      vitro, in vivo and in FDA-approved compassionate use cases prior
      to the clinical trial.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Medical Innovations LLC (USMI) and the Jerome Canady Research
      Institute for Advanced Biological and Technological Sciences
      (JCRI/ABTS) led the team and are sponsoring the clinical trial,
      with plans to recruit patients in September.<br>
      <br>
      USMI developed and patented the first high-frequency
      electrosurgical generator with cold plasma for the selective
      treatment of cancer in 2014.<br>
      <br>
      The technology, approved for an FDA phase I clinical trial in 20
      patients, was developed by a team led by Canady, chief science
      officer of JCRI/ABTS, CEO of USMI and a research professor in the
      School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at The George
      Washington University; an engineering team led by Taisen Zhuang,
      the vice president of research and development at USMI; Michael
      Keidar, a professor in the School of Engineering and Applied
      Sciences and director of the Micropropulsion and Nanotechnology
      lab at The George Washington University; and Shashurin, an
      assistant professor in Purdue’s School of Aeronautics and
      Astronautics.<br>
      <br>
      “Plasmas are very reactive, which can cause a variety of responses
      on the cellular level in biological tissue. But because they’re
      also extremely hot gases, there had been a push over the past 20
      years to generate and test cold plasmas for biological
      applications,” Shashurin said.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to developing cold plasma solutions for cancer
      treatment technology, Shashurin’s lab also conducts research on
      various topics of experimental plasma sciences. These include
      generation and diagnostics of miniature cold plasmas at
      atmospheric pressure, application of cold plasma for
      sterilization, laser-induced plasma for combustion diagnostics,
      advanced spacecraft propulsion and nanosecond repetitive plasma
      discharges for aerodynamic flow control.<br>
      <br>
      In 2008, Keidar and Shashurin were among an early wave of
      researchers to develop a cold plasma generator and see that it
      produces responses from biological tissue. By 2011, the team had
      published a paper in the British Journal of Cancer showing that
      cold plasma selectively kills cancer cells in animal models.<br>
      <br>
      Keidar and Shashurin began consulting with USMI in 2013 on
      creating an industrial-scale prototype of the cold plasma
      generator and its application for cancer treatment, based on a
      generator they had developed and patented. The goal was to
      integrate cold plasma with Canady Hybrid Plasma electrosurgical
      scalpels already used in operating rooms because these scalpels
      allow for bloodless surgery. This is due to their ability to cut
      and coagulate tissue at the same time, sealing off blood vessels.<br>
      <br>
      This cold plasma technology selectively kills tumors through toxic
      molecules called reactive oxygen species, which damage targeted
      cancerous tissue but do not affect normal biological tissue.
      Lasers could also kill tissue, but the high heat would also bring
      permanent damage to surrounding tissue.<br>
      <br>
      To bridge the advantages of electrosurgical scalpels with cold
      plasma, JCRI/ABTS and USMI converted standard high-frequency
      electrosurgical generators into ones that spray cold plasma.<br>
      <br>
      “Cold plasma application is the fourth arm for the treatment of
      cancer, following chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. There’s no
      other ‘magic bullet’ out there for killing off residual tissue,”
      Canady said.<br>
      <br>
      One of the clinical trial sites for this device will be Rush
      University in Chicago. Meanwhile, Shashurin’s lab at Purdue will
      continue to collaborate with USMI on further development of this
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      The work aligns with Purdue's Giant Leaps celebration,
      acknowledging the university’s global advancements made in health,
      longevity and quality of life as part of Purdue’s 150th
      anniversary. This is one of the four themes of the yearlong
      celebration’s Ideas Festival, designed to showcase Purdue as an
      intellectual center solving real-world issues. <br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Intratumoral heterogeneity challenges existing paradigms for
      anticancer therapy. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the
      model of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the model of clonal
      evolution mutually contribute to intratumoral heterogeneity, as
      CSCs themselves undergo clonal evolution. The limitation of
      conventional anticancer therapies may lead to treatment failure
      and cancer recurrence, mainly due to drug resistance and
      self-renewal capacities of CSC. These two factors are responsible
      for resistance to standard oncology treatments. In this study, we
      examine cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) treatment of CSC in vitro.
      We demonstrate that two types of heterogeneous CSC populations
      derived from a single patient tumor are sensitive to the effects
      of plasma treatment. Surprisingly, the more aggressive CSC
      population (C13) was more sensitive to CAP treatment than the less
      aggressive type (C12).<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      Micro-sized cold atmospheric plasma (μCAP) has been developedt o
      expand the applications of CAP in cancer therapy. In this paper,
      μCAP devices with different nozzle lengths were applied to
      investigate effects&nbsp; on&nbsp; both brain&nbsp; (glioblastoma
      U87)&nbsp; and&nbsp; breast (MDA-MB-231)cancer&nbsp; cells.
      Various diagnostic techniques were employed to evaluate the
      parameters of μCAP devices with different lengths such as
      potential distribution, electron density, and optical emission
      spectroscopy. The generation of short-and long-lived species (such
      as hydroxyl radical (OH), superoxide (O2-), hydrogen&nbsp;
      peroxide&nbsp; (H2O2),&nbsp; nitrite&nbsp; (NO2-),&nbsp; et&nbsp;
      al) were&nbsp; studied.&nbsp; These&nbsp; data&nbsp;
      revealed&nbsp; that&nbsp; μCAP treatment with a 20 mm length tube
      has a stronger effect than that of the 60 mm tube due to the
      synergetic&nbsp; effects of reactive species and&nbsp; free&nbsp;
      radicals.&nbsp; Reactive&nbsp; species&nbsp; generated&nbsp;
      by&nbsp; μCAP enhanced tumor cell death in a dose-dependent

          Stimulated Media for Cancer Treatment</b><br>
        <b>Dayun Yan, et al.</b></div>
      <b></b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>To date, the significant anti-cancer capacity of cold
      atmospheric plasma (CAP) on dozens of cancer cell lines has been
      demonstrated in vitro and in mice models. Conventionally, CAP was
      directly applied to irradiate cancer cells or tumor tissue. Over
      past three years, the CAP irradiated media was also found to kill
      cancer cells as effectively as the direct CAP treatment. As a
      novel strategy, using the CAP stimulated (CAPs) media has become a
      promising anti-cancer tool. In this study, we demonstrated several
      principles to optimize the anti-cancer capacity of the CAPs media
      on glioblastoma cells and breast cancer cells. Specifically, using
      larger wells on a multi-well plate, smaller gaps between the
      plasma source and the media and smaller media volume enabled us to
      obtain a stronger anti-cancer CAPs media composition without
      increasing the treatment time. Furthermore, cysteine was the main
      target of effective reactive species in the CAPs media.
      Glioblastoma cells were more resistant to the CAPs media than
      breast cancer cells. Glioblastoma cells consumed the effective
      reactive species faster than breast cancer cells did. In contrast
      to nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide was more likely to be the
      effective reactive species.<br>

      <b></b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) treatment is a rapidly expanding
      and emerging technology for cancer treatment. Direct CAP jet
      irradiation is limited to the skin and it can also be invoked as a
      supplement therapy during surgery as it only causes cell death in
      the upper three to five cell layers. However, the current cannulas
      from which the plasma emanates are too large for intracranial
      applications. To enhance efficiency and expand the applicability
      of the CAP method for brain tumors and reduce the gas flow rate
      and size of the plasma jet, a novel micro-sized CAP device (µCAP)
      was developed and employed to target glioblastoma tumors in the
      murine brain. Various plasma diagnostic techniques were applied to
      evaluate the physics of helium µCAP such as electron density,
      discharge voltage, and optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The
      direct and indirect effects of µCAP on glioblastoma
      (U87MG-RedFluc) cancer cells were investigated in vitro. The
      results indicate that µCAP generates short- and long-lived species
      and radicals (i.e., hydroxyl radical (OH), hydrogen peroxide
      (H2O2), and nitrite (NO2−), etc.) with increasing tumor cell death
      in a dose-dependent manner. Translation of these findings to an in
      vivo setting demonstrates that intracranial µCAP is effective at
      preventing glioblastoma tumor growth in the mouse brain. The µCAP
      device can be safely used in mice, resulting in suppression of
      tumor growth. These initial observations establish the µCAP device
      as a potentially useful ablative therapy tool in the treatment of
      glioblastoma.<br>

      <b></b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Traditional breast cancer treatments such as surgery and
      radiotherapy contain many inherent limitations with regards to
      incomplete and nonselective tumor ablation. Cold atomospheric
      plasma (CAP) is an ionized gas where the ion temperature is close
      to room temperature. It contains electrons, charged particles,
      radicals, various excited molecules, UV photons and transient
      electric fields. These various compositional elements have the
      potential to either enhance and promote cellular activity, or
      disrupt and destroy them. In particular, based on this unique
      composition, CAP could offer a minimally-invasive surgical
      approach allowing for specific cancer cell or tumor tissue removal
      without influencing healthy cells. Thus, the objective of this
      research is to investigate a novel CAP-based therapy for
      selectively bone metastatic breast cancer treatment. For this
      purpose, human metastatic breast cancer (BrCa) cells and bone
      marrow derived human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were separately
      treated with CAP, and behavioral changes were evaluated after 1,
      3, and 5 days of culture. With different treatment times,
      different BrCa and MSC cell responses were observed. Our results
      showed that BrCa cells were more sensitive to these CAP treatments
      than MSCs under plasma dose conditions tested. It demonstrated
      that CAP can selectively ablate metastatic BrCa cells in vitro
      without damaging healthy MSCs at the metastatic bone site. In
      addition, our study showed that CAP treatment can significantly
      inhibit the migration and invasion of BrCa cells. The results
      suggest the great potential of CAP for breast cancer therapy.<br>

      <b></b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Triple-negative breast cancer is a phenotype of breast cancer
      where the expression level of estrogen, progesterone and human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptors are low or
      absent. It is more frequently diagnosed in younger and
      premenopausal women, among which African and Hispanic have a
      higher rate. Cold atmospheric plasma has revealed its promising
      ant-cancer capacity over the past two decades. In this study, we
      report the first cold plasma jet delivered by the Canady Cold
      Plasma Conversion Unit and characterization of its electric and
      thermal parameters. The unit effectively reduced the viability of
      triple-negative breast cancer up to 80% without thermal damage,

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) is an ionized gas with a near
      room temperature. CAP is a controllable source for reactive
      species, neutral particles, electromagnetic field and UV
      radiation. CAP showed the promising application in cancer
      treatment through the demonstration in vitro and in vivo. In this
      study, we first demonstrate the existence of an activation state
      on the CAP-treated cancer cells, which drastically decreases the
      threshold of cell vulnerability to the cytotoxicity of the
      CAP-originated reactive species such as H2O2 and NO2−. The
      cytotoxicity of CAP treatment is still dependent on the
      CAP-originated reactive species. The activation state of cancer
      cells will not cause noticeable cytotoxicity. This activation is
      an instantaneous process, started even just 2 s after the CAP
      treatment begins. The noticeable activation on the cancer cells
      starts 10–20 s during the CAP treatment. In contrast, the
      de-sensitization of activation takes 5 hours after the CAP
      treatment. The CAP-based cell activation explains the mechanism by
      which direct CAP treatment causes a much stronger cytotoxicity
      over the cancer cells compared with an indirect CAP treatment do,
      which is a key to understand what the effect of CAP on cancer
      cells.<br>

      <b></b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Plasma is an ionized gas that is typically generated in
      high-temperature laboratory conditions. Recent progress in
      atmospheric plasmas led to the creation of cold plasmas with ion
      temperature close to room temperature. Areas of potential
      application of cold atmospheric plasmas (CAP) include dentistry,
      drug delivery, dermatology, cosmetics, wound healing, cellular
      modifications, and cancer treatment. Various diagnostic tools have
      been developed for characterization of CAP including intensified
      charge-coupled device cameras, optical emission spectroscopy and
      electrical measurements of the discharge propertied. Recently a
      new method for temporally resolved measurements of absolute values
      of plasma density in the plasma column of small-size atmospheric
      plasma jet utilizing Rayleigh microwave scattering was proposed
      [1,2]. In this talk we overview state of the art of CAP
      diagnostics and understanding of the mechanism of plasma action of
      biological objects. The efficacy of cold plasma in a pre-clinical
      model of various cancer types (long, bladder, and skin) was
      recently demonstrated [3]. Both in-vitro and in-vivo studies
      revealed that cold plasmas selectively kill cancer cells. We
      showed that: (a) cold plasma application selectively eradicates
      cancer cells in vitro without damaging normal cells. For instance
      a strong selective effect was observed; the resulting 60--70% of
      lung cancer cells were detached from the plate in the zone treated
      with plasma, whereas no detachment was observed in the treated
      zone for the normal lung cells under the same treatment
      conditions. (b) Significantly reduced tumor size in vivo. Cold
      plasma treatment led to tumor ablation with neighbouring tumors
      unaffected. These experiments were performed on more than 10 mice
      with the same outcome. We found that tumors of about 5mm in
      diameter were ablated after 2 min of single time plasma treatment.
      The two best known cold plasma effects, plasma-induced apoptosis
      and the decrease of cell migration velocity can have important
      implications in cancer treatment by localizing the affected area
      of the tissue and by decreasing metastasic development. In
      addition, cold plasma treatment has affected the cell cycle of
      cancer cells. In particular, cold plasma induces a 2-fold increase
      in cells at the G2/M-checkpoint in both papilloma and carcinoma
      cells at about 24 hours after treatment, while normal epithelial
      cells (WTK) did not show significant differences. It was shown
      that reactive oxygen species metabolism and oxidative stress
      responsive genes are deregulated. We investigated the production
      of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with cold plasma treatment as a
      potential mechanism for the tumor ablation observed.<br>

          Cold Atmospheric Plasma and Promotes the Anti-Cancer Effect on
          Malignant Melanoma Cells</b><br>
        <b>by Christin Schneider, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b></b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>(1) Background: Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is ionized gas
      near room temperature. The anti-cancer effects of CAP were
      confirmed for several cancer types and were attributed to
      CAP-induced reactive species. However, the mode of action of CAP
      is still not well understood. (2) Methods: Changes in cytoplasmic
      Ca2+ level after CAP treatment of malignant melanoma cells were
      analyzed via the intracellular Ca2+ indicator fura-2 AM.
      CAP-produced reactive species were determined by fluorescence
      spectroscopic and protein nitration by Western Blot analysis. (3)
      Results: CAP caused a strong acidification of water and solutions
      that were buffered with the so-called Good buffers, while
      phosphate-buffered solutions with higher buffer capacity showed
      minor pH reductions. The CAP-induced Ca2+ influx in melanoma cells
      was stronger in acidic pH than in physiological conditions. NO
      formation that is induced by CAP was dose- and pH-dependent and
      CAP-treated solutions only caused protein nitration in cells under
      acidic conditions. (4) Conclusions: We describe the impact of
      CAP-induced acidification on the anti-cancer effects of CAP. A
      synergistic effect of CAP-induced ROS, RNS, and acidic conditions
      affected the intracellular Ca2+ level of melanoma cells. As the
      microenvironment of tumors is often acidic, further acidification
      might be one reason for the specific anti-cancer effects of CAP.<br>

      [0005] Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers diagnosed
      among American women (excluding skin cancers), which is the second
      leading cause of cancer death among women after lung cancer. See,

      state, CA: a cancer journal for clinicians 67(6) (2017) 439-448.
      The global burden of breast cancer exceeds all other cancers and
      the incidence rates of breast cancer are increasing. A. Jemal, R.
      Siegel, J. Xu, E. Ward, Cancer statistics, 2010, CA: a cancer
      journal for clinicians 60(5) (2010) 277-300. Different treatment
      methods including surgical techniques, medication drugs, and
      radiation-based approaches are routinely being used for breast
      cancer. L. Hutchinson, Breast cancer: Challenges, controversies,
      breakthroughs, Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology 7 (2010) 669-670.
      However, additional treatment modalities need to be developed to
      minimize the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.
      Breast cancer represent a multitude of different diseases with
      intratumoral and intertumoral genetic and epigenetic alterations.<br>

      [0006] Plasma medicine is emerging as an innovative field for
      cancer therapy, which combines biology, chemistry, plasma, and
      medicine. See, G. Fridman, G. Friedman, A. Gutsol, A. B. Shekhter,

      for cancer treatment, Plasma Sources Science and Technology 24(3)
      (2015) 033001. Plasma is one of the four fundamental states of
      matter, and is a fully or partially ionized gas. See, M. Keidar,

      Sandler, B. Trink, Cold atmospheric plasma in cancer therapy,
      Physics of Plasmas 20(5) (2013) 057101. Historically, plasma could
      be generated only at high temperatures or in vacuum, while more
      recent studies have reported on plasma generated at atmospheric
      pressure and at room temperature (cold atmospheric plasma, CAP).

      [0007] CAP has attracted a lot of attentions because of its
      remarkable potential to affect biological processes. Yan, D.;

      Controlling plasma stimulated media in cancer treatment
      application. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2014, 105, 224101. The potential of
      CAP in diverse bio-medical applications has been explored,
      including wound treatments, blood coagulation, disinfection,
      control of inflammation, regenerative medicine, and cancer
      therapy. Z. Chen, H. Simonyan, X. Cheng, E. Gjika, L. Lin, J.

      atmospheric plasma device for glioblastoma both in vitro and in
      vivo, Cancers 9(6) (2017) 61. The efficacy of CAP in the proposed
      applications relies on the synergistic action of the reactive
      oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), free
      radicals, ultraviolet (UV) photons, charged particles, and
      electric fields. See, S. B. Karki, T. T. Gupta, E. Yildirim-Ayan,

      [0008] ROS and RNS, combined or independently, are known to
      promote cell proliferation as well as cell death, additionally,
      extreme amounts of ROS and RNS may lead to the damage of proteins,
      lipids, senescence and induce apoptosis. P. Attri, T. Sarinont, M.

      nonthermal atmospheric plasma generated in water, Biointerphases
      11(3) (2016) 031010. Many studies of CAP for cancer treatment have
      shown that CAP dose not harm normal tissues when applied at the
      appropriate dosages. See, A. Shashurin, M. Keidar, S. Bronnikov,

      together, CAP therapy has been introduced as a cost effective,
      rapid and selective treatment modality for killing cancer cells.
      In addition, CAP with self-organized patterns has recently
      attracted significant attentions on cancer therapy. Z. Chen, L.

      [0009] Self-organization is generally referred to as a process of
      spontaneous transition from a homogeneous stable state to a
      regular pattern in a spatially extended system. See, Radehaus, C.,

      due to current filament formation in silicon pin diodes. Physics
      Letters A 117, 141-144 (1986). Self-organization is a complex and
      fascinating phenomenon commonly observed in both natural and
      technological contexts within diverse varieties of physics,
      chemistry and biology. Raizer, Y. P. &amp; Mokrov, M. Physical

      self-organized anode patterns in arc discharge simulations. Plasma
      Sources Science and Technology 22, 025017 (2013). Different types
      of self-organization phenomena have been reported in a wide range
      of plasmas, such as dielectric barrier discharge (see,
      Kogelschatz, U. Filamentary, patterned, and diffuse barrier
      discharges. IEEE Transactions on plasma science 30, 1400-1408

      Self-Organized Micro-Discharge Plasma-Liquid Interface. arXiv
      preprint arXiv: 1701. 01655 (2017)). The self-organization
      phenomena associated with the formation of electrode patterns are
      significantly different among these discharges, which typically
      occur in the anode or cathode layer. Benilov, M. Bifurcations of

      Self-organization patterns (SOPs) of plasma include
      square-textures, square-lattices, square/hexagonal superlattices,
      hollow-hexagonal, multi-armed spirals, rotating-wheels patterns,
      etc. Dong, L., Fan, W., He, Y. &amp; Liu, F. Self-organized

      self-organized pattern within a dielectric barrier discharge.
      Physical Review E 85, 066403 (2012). The formation of these
      patterns depends on various parameters such as driving current,
      electrolyte conductivity, gap length, gas species, and so on. See,
      Shirai, N., Uchida, S. &amp; Tochikubo, F. Influence of oxygen gas

      discharges with the liquid electrode have been studied referring
      to applications ranging from water decontamination and activation

      self-organization in plasma interacting with surfaces is interest
      not only from a fundamental point of view as intrinsic and
      fascinating characteristics of nature, but also from practical
      standpoint in current and emerging technological applications.<br>

      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0010] The present invention creates plasma with different
      self-organization patterns (SOPs) to activate saline solution. The
      plasma activated saline solutions have anti-tumor effects on human
      cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Plasma interacting with the liquid generates reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that act
      as key intermediate for cancer therapy. See, Boehm, D., Heslin,
      C., Cullen, P. J. &amp; Bourke, P. Cytotoxic and mutagenic
      potential of solutions exposed to cold atmospheric plasma.
      Scientific reports 6 (2016); Chen, Z. et al. A Novel Micro Cold
      Atmospheric Plasma Device for Glioblastoma Both In Vitro and In
      Vivo. Cancers 9, 61 (2017). The present invention creates plasma
      with different self-organization patterns (SOPs) to activate a
      media such as saline solution. The plasma activated medias have
      anti-tumor effects on human normal and cancer cells. A camera was
      used to characterize the patterns of plasma with SOP. The spectra
      of plasma with SOPs were determined by UV-visible-NIR optical
      emission spectroscopy OES). The concentration of hydrogen peroxide
      (H2 O2 ) and nitrite (NO2 − ) was measured by using a Fluorimetric
      hydrogen peroxide assay kit, and the Griess reagent system,
      respectively. The cell viability of H6c7 and BxPC-3 was measured
      via Cell Counting KIT 8 Assay. Typically, saline solution is used
      to treat dehydration by injection into a vein, and it is also used
      to dilute medications to be given by injection. Based on the
      results, one can suggest that SOP plasma-activated saline
      solutions (plasma solutions) has the potential to be utilized as
      an oral medicine or drug injected into tumors.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is a
      method for manufacturing plasma-activated media for treatment of
      cancer cells. The method comprises immersing a first electrode in
      a media in a container, positioning a second electrode at a fixed
      distance from a surface of the media in the container, and
      applying electrical energy to the second electrode for a fixed
      period of time, wherein the fixed distance and the fixed period of
      time are selected to cause a plasma self-organized pattern at a
      surface of the media with an atmospheric discharge between the
      second electrode and the first electrode. The fixed distance
      preferably is 4-6 mm. The fixed time may be, for example, 40
      seconds...<br>

      A method for preparing cold atmospheric plasma stimulated cell
      culture media with a cold atmospheric plasma system having a
