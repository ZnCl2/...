      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      The utility model discloses an experimental device for a second
      law of thermodynamics, and is characterized in that: a
      high-temperature high-pressure gas generation device is provided
      with a gas pressure sensor and a high-temperature high-pressure
      gas temperature sensor; an inner part of an unthrottled
      Hilsch-Ranque vortex tube is provided with a separating pore, the
      unthrottled Hilsch-Ranque vortex tube is in a T shape; a vertical
      part of the T-shaped tube is connected with the high-temperature
      high-pressure gas generation device, the center of a horizontal
      part of the T-shaped tube is provided with a circular separator
      plate, the center of the circular separator plate is provided with
      the separating pore; an outlet at one side of the T-shaped tube is
      provided with a stop valve and a low-temperature gas temperature
      sensor which are respectively used for adjusting an outflow volume
      of a low-temperature gas and detecting the temperature of the
      low-temperature gas at the auxiliary-side outlet; and the other
      side of the T-shaped tube is provided with a high-temperature gas
      temperature sensor. By adopting the experimental device of the

      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      In a gas cooling and drying apparatus using a vortex tube 15 of
      the type described in Specification 405,781, the compressed gas
      before its expansion is cooled by the cooled partial current in a
      heat exchanger 10, and the cooled partial current amounts to at
      least 70 per cent of the total current. The compressed gas
      supplied through a pipe 5 is first cooled in a precooler 6, the
      separated moisture being removed at 8, and then passes through the
      tubes 11 of the heat exchanger 10 and through a pipe 14 to the
      tangential nozzle 16 of the Ranque vortex tube 15. Cold air from
      the vortex tube passes by a pipe 19 to the heat exchanger and
      issues through a pipe 21. Precipitated liquid is removed by a
      separator 28. The warm air issuing through the valve 25 of the
      vortex tube 15 passes to the place of use through a pipe .23 to
      which is also connected the pipe 21. If ice, &amp;c. is formed two
      heat exchangers can be used operating alternately. To avoid the
      formation of frost a de-icing fluid is distributed by a pipe 27 to
      a porous substance 29 through which the compressed gas passes. A
      de Laval nozzle is used to feed the compressed gas tangentially
      into the tube 15, and the gas rotates in the tube at supersonic
      speed. The apparatus may be used to dry protective gases for
      furnaces. <br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Method is used in mixing a liquid fuel with air, in which a vortex
      tube is employed. The fuel and air are mixed in a turbulent
      centrifugal field, for supply to the combustion chamber. In this
      method, a Hilsch tube is used. This has opposite, hot and cold
      ends, each with restricted cross-sectional openings. The heated
      gaseous mixture is extracted from the hot end. Also claimed is a
      burner, to carry out the procedure. Regions near the air or fuel
      supply may be heated, or the vortex tube itself is heated.<br>

        <b>Deterring a workpiece, by supplying a partially heated

      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      The method comprises supplying a partially heated workpiece with a
      cooling medium, and subjecting a deterred area of the workpiece to
      a turbulence of a gaseous cooling medium. A cold gas flow of the
      cooling medium is created by an eddy-current generator such as an
      eddy-current or a vortex pipe and by a Ranque-Hilsch vortex pipe
      (7). The workpiece is: deterred within a cold gas chamber standing
      in fluid connection with the eddy-current generator; hardened by
      an inductive heating; and surface-hardened or air-hardened after a
      hot forging process. The method comprises supplying a partially
      heated workpiece with a cooling medium, and subjecting a deterred
      area of the workpiece to a turbulence of a gaseous cooling medium.
      A cold gas flow of the cooling medium is created by an
      eddy-current generator such as an eddy-current or a vortex pipe
      and by a Ranque-Hilsch vortex pipe (7). The workpiece is: deterred
      within a cold gas chamber standing in fluid connection with the
      eddy-current generator; hardened by an inductive heating; and
      surface-hardened or air-hardened after a hot forging process. The
      turbulence is created by a relative motion of tangential aligned
      nozzles and/or the eddy-current generators and the workpiece. The
      cooling medium includes a spray mist such as a compressed
      air-water mixture. An independent claim is included for a device
      for deterring a workpiece.<br>

      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Condensable products such as water liq. hydrocarbon are separated
      from natural gas by expanding the mixt. in a vortex chamber. Aided
      by the centrifugal force and the Ranque-Hilsch vortex effect, a
      cold and a hot gas stream are extracted, keeping the pressure
      ratio between gas intake and hot gas stream is 1.7 to 7. The cold
      gas stream is used to cool the mixt. before it enters. The liq. is
      extracted from the vortex chamber when its temperature and
      composition differs from that of the gas outflow. This creates a
      simple way of separating water and liq. hydrocarbon from natural
      gas and of minimising the erosion effect on the separator.<br>

      The cooling of a gas turbine is a critical problem and will
      consume a considerable quantity of compressed air at the
      temperature ordinarily available. To improve the cooling
      properties, a portion of the air delivered by the compressor is
      divided off and is conveyed to an expansion member, where it is
      further divided into a hot and a cold fraction. This cold
      fraction, which can have a temperature well below the freezing
      point, is used, preferably mixed with air delivered directly from
      the compressor, for cooling the turbine inlet means.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Preventing vaporization of the liquid in a centrifugal gas-liquid
      separator<br>
      This patent refers to a gas-liquid separation process by
      centrifugal force, which takes place in a fast turning vortex
      confined in a tube, similar to inventor's former patents. Against
      the separating centrifugal force the thermal (Ranque) effect tends
      to heat the periphery of the tube and vaporize the liquid. This
      improvement refers to a method of preventing the vaporization of
      the liquid, either by cooling a short section of the periphery
      with a cooling jacket, or by taking out the liquid at a short
      distance from the inlet, where the heating effect on the periphery
      is minimal, and insulating the liquid from this heating effect. It
      also refers to the method of control of this liquid separation,
      and the process of using it as a wellhead oil and gas separator.<br>

        <b>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR OBTAINING FROM A FLUID UNDER
          PRESSURE TWO CURRENTS OF FLUIDS AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES</b><br>
        <b>Georges Joseph Ranque</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The object of my invention is a method for automatically
      obtaining, from a compressible fluid (gas or vapour) under
      pressure, a current of hot fluid and a current of cold fluid, that
      transformation of the initial fluid into two currents of different
      temperatures taking place without the help of any movable
      mechanical organ, merely through the work of the molecules of
      fluid upon one anotner.<br>
      <br>
      The method according to my invention consists essentially in
      dividing the fluid under pressure, which is admitted tangentially
      into a vessel having the shape of a body of revolution, into two
      coaxial sheets of fluid moving with a gyratory motion and reacting
      upon each other so as to produce, under the acticn of centrifugal
      force, the compression of the outer sheet by the inner sheet which
      expands, this compression absorbing a certain amount of work,
      which is evidenced by'a rise in the temperature of the compressed
      sheet at the expense of the other sheet, which is thus cocled.<br>
      <br>
      In a practical mode of carrying out this method, the fluid under
      pressure is introduced tangentially into a vessel having the shape
      of a body of revolution provided with axial orifices disposed on
      either side of the fluid inlet. Said fluid is suitably guided so
      as to give it a helical motion toward one of said orifices, the
      cross section of which is suitably restricted so as to produce a
      backward motion of a portion of the fluid toward the opposite
      orifice. This produces two sheets of fluids having opposite axial
      motions, the inner sheet expanding and compressing the
      outer-sheet, thus supplying heat thereto.<br>
      <br>
      A current of hot fluid is thus received through the orifice of
      restricted cross section, while a current of cold fluid is
      received through the opposite orifice.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of my invention is to provide an apparatus for
      carrying out the method above referred to. According to my
      invention, this apparatus comprises a chamber having the shape of
      a body of revolution the middle part of which is provided with one
      or more tangential inlet tubes for the fluid under pressure. Axial
      orifices are provided at either end of said chamber, one of said
      orifices, toward which the liqf1id, or fluid is directed through a
      suitable guiding with a gyratory motion, having a cross section
      smaller than that of the sheet of fluid, so that a portion of the
      latter is driven back toward the opposite orifice in such manner
      that it is caused to flow over the sheet of fluid that is applied
      against the wall of the chamber in question.<br>
      <br>
      (Cl. 62-170) 11952,281 Preferred embodiments of my invention will

      drawings, given merely by way of example, and in which:<br>

      Figs. 13 and 14 are diagrammatical views of 8( two other
      embodiments of my invention..<br>
      <br>
      The principle on which my invention is based is illustrated by
      diagrammatic Figures 1 to 5.<br>
      <br>
      Supposing, as shown in Figs. I and 2, that a tube A B is provided
      in its middle part with a tangential inlet pipe 1 through which a
      current of a compressible fluid,(gas or vapour) under pressure is
      sent into said tube, said fluid is given in said tube a certain
      linear velocity parallel with the axis of said tube, said
      rectilinear movement being combined with a gyratory movement about
      the axis of the tube. The fluid flows toward bcth ends of the
      tube.<br>
      <br>
      As the fluid is moving away from the inlet pipe, its rectilinear
      velocity, which is parallel with the axis x Y of the tube,
      increases, and its angular velocity decreases, so that the fluid
      spreads along the wall of the tube so as to form a sheet 2 having
      substantially the shape of a body of revolution about axis x y
      (Mg. 3). In 100 said sheet the molecules are subjected to a
      pressure which is the higher as they are at a greater distance
      frcm the axis of the tube, due to the action of the centrifugal
      force. At the same time, the flow of the fluid produces a
      substantial 105 f all of pressure in the central zone of the tube,
      so that the outer air. which is at the atmospheric pressure, is
      drawn toward the central zone of the tube, thus forming two axial
      currents 2a (Fig. 4). When the outer air reaches said cen- 110
      tral zone, it is driven back toward the outside by the fluid
      moving with a gyratory movement, thus forming streams 3.<br>
      <br>
      If an annular diaphragm 4, the free central opening 4a of which
      has a diameter equal to the minimum diameter of the zone In which
      a fall of pressure is produced, as shown in Fig. 5, is provided in
      the central part of the tube, on one side of the tangential inlet
      pipe, the fluid moving with a gyratory movement will flow only
      toward orifice B, carrying along with it the atmospheric air
      coming from both orifice A and arifice B. The method and the
      apparatus according to my invention are based on the experimental
      facts that have just been stated.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment shown in Figs. 6 and 6a, the apparatus consists
      of a chamber 5 having the shape of a body of revolution about axis
      x y, the middle part 6 of said chamber being of restricted cross
      section and being provided with a tangential inlet pipe 7 for the
      fluid (gas or vapour) under pressure. The inner wall of chamber 5
      is provided, opposite the opening of said pipe, with a helical
      guiding surface 8. The orifice A of chamber 5 is freely opened,
      while the cross section of orifice B is restricted by a kind of
      frusto-conical diaphragm or deflector 9, so that the fluid under
      pressure, admitted through pipe 7, is only allowed to flow through
      an annular Soaperture 10, which is not sufficient for the amount
      of fluid fed thereto. The fluid under pressure admitted through
      pipe 7 and guided by helical surface 8 is simultaneously given a
      rectilinear motion which causes it to move within chamber 6 toward
      opening 10, and a rotary motion about axis x y. The sheet of fluid
      that is immediately adjacent the wall of the chamber flows out
      through said opening 10, while the remainder of the fluid, which
      is prevented from flowing out by diaphragm 9 is subjected to the
      fall of pressure existing in the central zone of the chamber and
      is given a, backward motion toward orifice A. I thus obtain,
      according to my invention, a first sheet of fluid 11, moving with
      a gyratory motion along the inner wall of the chamber, from
      orifice 7 toward orifice B, and a second sheet of fluid 12 moving
      with a gyratory motion along the inner surface of the first
      mentioned sheet in an opposite axial direction, said second sheet
      of fluid consisting of the difference between the amount of fluid
      admitted through pipe 7 and the amount of fluid that is allowed to
      flow out through opening 10.<br>
      <br>
      Said sheet of fluid under pressure 12, which moves with a gyratory
      motion not along the rigid wall of chamber 5, but along the
      elastic surface of the first mentioned sheet of fluid, tends on
      the one hand under the action of the centrifugal, force, and on
      the other hand under the effect of the increase of velocity due to
      the expansion and to the rotation that take place, to compress the
      molecules of the first mentioned sheet of fluid.<br>
      <br>
      That compression absorbs a certain amount of work, which is
      evidenced by a loss of heat from the second mentioned sheet to the
      benefit of the first mentioned one. Consequently, the temperature
      of sheet 12 falls, while the temperature of sheet 11 rises.
      Finally, there is obtained through orifice 10 a current of hot
      fluid, and Ahrough orifice A a current of'cold fluid.<br>
      <br>
      7o The initial guiding of the fluid toward one of the orifices is
      necessary for practical purposes in order to obtain an accurate
      centering of the central zone of depression or fall of
      temperature. In the example above described, that guiding is
      7&amp; effected through helical inclined surface 8. The I
      following description will show that the same result could be
      obtained through other guiding means.<br>
      <br>
      The adjustment of the cross section of the outlet orifice at B,
      which can be obtained through any suitable means makes it
      possible, by modifying the rates of flow at B and A, to vary the
      differences between the temperature of the initial fluid and those
      of the hot fluid and of the cold fluid escaping through outlet
      orifices B and A respectively.<br>
      <br>
      If, for instance, the cross section of the orifice through which
      the hot fluid Is allowed to flow out is considerably restricted,
      the rate of flow of the hot fluid is diminished, but the rate of
      flow of the cold fluid is simultaneously increased so that the
      heat that is given out from one sheet to the other one causes a
      considerable rise of the temperature of the hot fluid but a small
      fall of the temperature of the cold fluid, as compared with that
      of the initial fluid.<br>
      <br>
      Figs. 7 and 7a show a practical embodiment of my invention.<br>
      <br>
      This embodiment comprises a cylindrical chamber 12 in which the
      interchange of heat takes I place, and an annular distributing
      organ made of two pieces 13-13a which is provided with an inlet
      pipe 14 for the fluid under pressure. Said distributing organ
      comprises an inner cylindrical chamber 15 connected with cylinder
      12 1 through a frusto-conical surface 16, and with annular conduit
      17 of the distributing organ through a tangential passage 17a. The
      guiding helical surface 8 extends from one edge 17b to the other
      17c of the orifice of said passage. The tangential I passage 17a
      and the guiding inclined surface 8 are provided in a separate part
      19, provided with conical surfaces 19a-19b for the centering
      thereof between parts 13 and 13a of the distributing organ. On the
      side opposite to cylinder 12 said I distributing organ is
      connected with a cylinder 21 at the end of whic h the current of
      cold fluid is received, while the current of hot fluid passing
      through the annular orifice provided around conical diaphragm 9 is
      received through tube 22.<br>
      <br>
      Figs. 9 to 13 show other embodiments of the means for guiding the
      fluid. In the embodiment of Figs. 9 and 10, said guiding is
      obtained through several tangential pipes 7a opening into a
      frustoconical chamber 23 connected with the working 1 chamber 12.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment of Figs. 11 and 12,.the guiding action is
      obtained through several pipes 7a opening tangentially into
      chamber 12, but which are inclined with respect to the axis x y of
      said 1 chamber.<br>
      <br>
      It should be well understood that it is not absolutely necessary,
      according to my. invention, that the fluid under pressure should
      be admitted tangentially into a chamber having the shape of 1 a
      body of revolution in which the fluid is divided into two coaxial
      sheets one of which receives from the other one mechanical work
      which is transformed into heat. What is necessary. is to obtain an
      aimular flow of the fluid moving with a gyratory movement and any
      means for obtaining that result may be obtained according to my
      invention. In particular, I may use to this effect directing
      blades disposed for. instance in an inlet conduit coaxial with the
      chamber in which the interchange of heat takes place.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, instead of being provided on either side of the inlet
      conduit, the axial orifices through which the two sheets of liquid
      escape may be disposed on the same side of said inlet conduit, the
      annular orifice for the outflow of the hot fluid surrounding the
      outlet orifice for the cold fluid. In such an arrangement, the two
      sheets have parallel axial movements in the same direction, which
      may be advantageous in some cases for reducing their mutual
      friction. Such an arrangement is shown in ilig. 13 In which the
      fluid is admitted at one of the ends A of the chamber A B having
      the shape of a body of revolution and Is given a gyratory movement
      by a plurality of blades 23 disposed in an annular tube 24. The
      other end B, of chamber A B is provided with two concentric
      orifices 10 and disposed in such manner that the outer orifice is
      limited by a diaphragm 9 so that the fluid moving with a gyratory
      motion from end A past blades 23 cannot escape entirely through
      said orifice 10.<br>
      <br>
      A part of said fluid is compelled to escape through the inner
      orifice 25, of smaller diameter, which corresponds to a zone of
      lesser pressure.<br>
      <br>
      This causes an expansion of that portion of the fluid and it has
      been ascertained experimentally that said expansion starts as soon
      as the fluid leaves the directing blades and is continued as far
      as orifice 25. According to the laws of gyratory flow, said
      expanding sheet compresses the sheet that surrounds it and that
      flows out through annular orifice 10 and tube 26. In order to
      avoid parasitic entrainments, it is advantageous to give also to
      orifice 25 an annular shape by means of a deflector 27, along
      which the inner sheet flows before reaching tube 28. To sum up,
      tube 28 serves to the outflow of a portion of the fluid that is
      cooled by expansion with production of external work and tube 26
      serves to the outflow of the remaining portion of the fluid, which
      is heated by compression.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, instead of extracting the initial energy that is
      necessary for the working of the apparatus, from a compressed air
      reservoir, it may be necessary in some cases to make use of
      mechanical energy for imparting a gyratory movement to the fluid
      and for giving it the superpressure that is necessary for its flow
      through the apparatus. To this effect, I may dispose, in
      concentric relation with the stationary blades that control the
      inlet of fluid, a plurality of movable blades wbich are
      mechanically actuated and are disposed in the same manner as the
      rotor of an air fan or of a compressor. -Such an arrangement is
      diagrammatically shown in Fig. 14 in which the initial energy of
      the fluid is not due to a preliminary compression in a separate
      apparatus but is imparted thereto in the apparatus itself by means
      of a rotor with blades 29 which is mechanically driven by a shaft
      30.<br>
      <br>
      In this embodiment all the other parts are disposed in the same
      manner as in the apparatus of Fig. 1, with the exception of
      deflector 27 which is replaced by an annular body 31 extending
      along the whole length of chamber A B, which is preferable when
      the diameter of the latter is relatively large.<br>
      <br>
      While I have described what I deem to be preferred embodiments of
      my invention, it should be well understood that I do not wish to
      be limited thereto as there might be changes made in the
      arrangement, disposition and form of the parts without departing
      from the principle of my invention. It will be understood that it
      is advantageous to reduce the interchanges of heat between the
      various parts and between said parts and the outside by means of
      suitable heat insulating arrangements. Finally the adjustment
      1,952,281.<br>
      <br>
      of the difference of temperature between the hot sheet of fluid
      and the cold sheet may be obtained by modifying the ratio of the
      flows of the hot and cold fluids to the initial flow, which may be
      produced by modifying the sections or the inlet or outlet pressure
      of one of the three currents of fluid. In particular, in order to
      increase the temperature of the hot sheet, I may restrict the
      section left by diaphragm 9 for the outlet of said sheet or reduce
      the rate of flow by means of a valve disposed on the outlet pipe
      for the outflow of the heat fluid, or increase the initial
      pressure of the fluid admitted into the apparatus or again act on
      the section or the pressure at the outlet of the cold sheet.<br>

        <b>DEVICE FOR MEASURING DENSITY AND DEW POINT OF A GAS</b><br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      This invention uses a vortex tube or Hilsch tube in combination
      with a thermocouple to determine the apparent molecular weight or
      density of a gas mixture and the dew point of the gas mixture. The
      thermocouple has a flat planar configuration with one side highly
      polished for accurately indicating the dew point. The cold gas
      which is extracted from the Hilsch tube is used to cool the
      polished thermocouple until frost or dew is formed on the
      thermocouple. This indicates the dew point of the gas surrounding
      the polished surface of the thermocouple. The temperature of the
      thermocouple continues to drop until it indicates the exhaust
      temperature of the cold gas from the Hilsch tube. This output
      temperature is a function of the pressure and temperature of the
      incoming gas and the density of the gas. Thus if the incoming gas
      temperature and pressure are held constant the exhaust gas
      temperature is a function of the density of the gas mixture.<br>

      A vortex tube has its inlet connected to atmosphere and its
      outlets connected to one or more suction-producing devices so that
      it operates at sub-atmospheric pressure. At least the cold outlet
      is connected to the suction inlet of an I.C. engine through a heat

      through air-cleaner 50 and also through control valve 29 to the
      carburetter 27 of a petrol engine 20 having two suction pipes 22,
      23 the latter being connected to the carburetter and the former
      being connected through heat exchanger 26 with the cold outlet 24
      of the vortex tube. Cooling air for the passenger space of the
      vehicle driven by the engine may be blown over the heat exchanger.
      The hot outlet 28 of the tube is also connected to the inlet of
      the carburetter. If the engine be diesel, it has three suction
      pipes connected directly to ambient air, to the hot outlet of the
      tube, and to the cold outlet via the heat exchanger. In a
      modification, the cold outlet is connected to the intake of an
      I.C. engine driving a suction-producing device the inlet of which
      is connected to the hot outlet of the tube.<br>
