      </b><b>100 Years Ago: 17 January 1913</b><br>
      <br>
      Mounted on a two and a half horse power torpedo motor cycle, and
      travelling at a fairly uniform rate, Mr E. R. Godward (says the
      Southland Times) rode 41 times around the quarter-mile track at
      the Caledonian grounds at Invercargill on Monday afternoon. The
      occasion was the testing of an invention framed by Mr Godward
      whereby the consumption of petrol is diminished to a very
      surprising degree.<br>
      <br>
      The results obtained at previous tests had been made known, and
      their nature aroused curiosity in many cases and incredulity in
      others. The test was carried out under the strictest scrutiny. The
      nature of the apparatus by which the saving is effected has not
      been disclosed, as Mr Godward maintains that it is as yet only in
      the experimental stage. From external appearances the engine is
      practically unaltered. The petrol and oil tank is slightly larger
      than the average tank, and a pipe whereby hot air is drawn off the
      cylinder into the tank is the main alteration in the mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      There was a fairly sharp breeze blowing when the test was made,
      and the rider ran an extra lap in order to satisfy critics that he
      had covered the required distance. He did a full 10 miles, at an
      average speed of about 22 miles an hour, and it was found that 3
      1/2oz of petrol had been used, equivalent to a run of 457 miles
      per gallon. A test with kerosene over a five-mile run at an
      average speed of 26 miles an hour worked out at 3oz, or equivalent
      to 266 miles per gallon. After the latter test the ignition plug
      was removed, and it was found to be quite free of carbon deposits,
      a fact which will be noted with surprise by many motorists.<br>

      Spray carburettors -A carburettor primarily intended for
      motor-cycles comprises a spray carburetting-device 13 which is
      mounted below and fed by gravity from the petrol tank 1, and a
      surface apparatus through which the mixture passes comprising
      lengths of hose 5 made of turkish towelling or the like joined
      together by headers of the same material and all expanded by
      lengths of metal 10 of X-section. The surface apparatus forms the
      base of the petrol reservoir 1. The mixture finally traverses
      separate air and throttle valves in one casing 35 and a roll of
      gauze 36<br>
      <br>
      <b>COMPLETE SPECIFICATION.</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to carburettor apparatus used for
      carburetting air to produce fuel for internal combustion engines.<br>
      <br>
      In carburettors of the type most frequently used, the liquid fuel
      was introduced into the combustion chamber from a point in close
      proximity thereto and in quantities in excess of that required to
      carburet the air with the result that a certain amount of raw fuel
      passed through the combustion chamber without utilization and was
      consequently wasted.<br>
      <br>
      It is the object of the present invention to provide improved
      apparatus whereby this disadvantage is overcome, the liquid fuel
      being atomized and mixed with air, and the mixed air and atomized
      fuel being then passed through a. length of absorbent material
      whereby the liquid fuel which is not absorbed by the air is
      collected by the absorbent material and is retained thereby until
      sufficient air passes through the absorbent material to absorb the
      excess of fuel. In this way the lighter and more volatile
      hydrocarbons are held in suspension by the air assisted by the
      partial vacuum resulting from the suction stroke of the engine,
      while the heavier and less volatile hydrocarbons are caught by the
      absorbent material and gradually supplied to the air passing
      through the apparatus. The results are that a more uniformly
      carburetted air is supplied which may be used advantageously for
      internal combustion engines, illuminating and other purposes, and
      waste of fuel is avoided.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, provision is made of an apparatus whereby a uniform mixture
      is obtained which is free from excess fuel. It is well known that
      petrol comprises numerous particles having different degrees of
      volatility, and when fed to a system of the class described, the
      lighter and more volatile hydrocarbons will be absorbed by the air
      introduced at the inlet end and induced to travel through the
      compartments containing the absorbent material by the vacuum
      produced by the induction stroke of the engine. As air will only
      absorb. a certain quantity of petrol in the process of forming the
      mixture and the supply of petrol is greater than the air can
      absorb, the heavier or less volatile hydrocarbons are caught by
      the absorbent material in the system .and prevented from flowing
      to the cylinder or engine in liquid form, as the lining is longer
      than is necessary to absorb the lesser volatile hydrocarbons, the
      outlet end of the lining remaining dry, that is to say, free from
      petrol, and consequently the mixture will be uniform and wore
      homogeneous 'in passing from the chamber, it being obvious that
      after the heavier hydrocarbons have been absorbed by the lining,
      the mixture must pass the end of the lining which is substantially
      free from hydrocarbon in liquid form.<br>

      </b><b><img alt="" src="gb1914d.jpg" height="259" width="454"><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>A petrol tank (1) of ordinary design is used; having the usual
      vertical partitions (2) dividing the lubricating oil and the
      petrol, a horizontal division (3) terming the bottom of the petrol
      tank, and a cover for the container compartment (4). The
      compartment (4) is divided longitudinally, preferably with metal
      partitions a little shorter than the length of the compartment;
      one end of each alternate partition (4'\) and (48) being attached
      to one end".(4") of the compartment, and one end (4it) of the
      intermediate partition (41)1), is attached to the opposite end
      (4F) of the compartments. The spaces -between the .said partitions
      are hereinafter termed " conduits ".<br>
      <br>
      The container comprises a series of these conduits inserted in the
      compartment (4) placed side by side; four of- the said conduits
      are shown in Figure 4 numbered (5), (G), (7), and (8). ''Provision
      is made to line the 'conduits with fabric, indicated at (9) made
      preferably -- from Turkey towelling, hereinafter called the
      stocking. The stocking is held expanded in contact with the
      interior surface of the conduits by any suitable means. One method
      shown consists of a bar (10) resembling iu section the letter X,
      one length thereof being used for each conduit in the container as
      indicated in Figures 4, (!, and' 8. The"X shaped bars are inserted
      within the. stocking thus keeping the corners (10B), (10), (10a)
      and (10) in contact with' the stocking and retaining it in a
      semi-stretched condition against the interior surface of the metal
      conduits. A method of constructing the stocking is shown in Figure
      8, (the view being broken at (G) and (H) to show the X shaped bars
      (10)), two fabric lined conduits being placed side by side; (9A)
      represents a portion of the stocking (9) joining the two fabric
      lined conduits together; three of these portions (9A) would lie
      j'enjuired whey there are four fabric lined conduits as
      illustrated in Figure 5. The portions (9A) may have short X shaped
      sections to maintain them normally stretched if desired. The Inlet
      to the stocking is indicated at (11) Figure 2, the section thereof
      developing from squire at (12) to a circular shape at the inlet
      (11) to enable a handy coupling being made with the atomiser (13).<br>
      <br>
      Precautions are taken in the event of an excess of petrol lodging
      in the container. The outlet pipe (4c) is produced to within the
      container as indicated in Figure 1, and a suitable gauze cap (4H0
      is placed over the outlet. Apparatus is fitted between the
      container outlet (4G) and the cylinder of the engine, comprising a
      throttle (34), auxiliary air inlet (35) and it gauze chamber (3G).<br>
      <br>
      The throttle and air inlet may be controlled in the ordinary way
      by a Bowden control having the usual levers mounted on the handle
      bars or in some convenient position. The control connections are
      indicated at (34A) and (35A), Figure 1.<br>
