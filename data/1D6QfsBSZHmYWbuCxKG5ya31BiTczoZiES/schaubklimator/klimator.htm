          "I have certain devices in my possession that can cool a river
          with a temperature of about +20°C (+68°F) down to below 0°C
          (+32°F) in a few minutes without any cooling equipment of
          current design (ice or refrigerator). The breath-like
          regulation of oxygen between interconnected vessels
          (containing copper and zinc plates) is enough to eliminate
          thousands of heat-calories in a few seconds, or convert them
          into cold substances. These simple, natural processes are
          valid for temperature fluctuations in excess of 60°C (108°F).
          This involves the atomic dissociation of air or aqueous
          substances. I am now having machines built, which generate
          heat or cold organically. (see fig. 27) Heat or cold-producing
          dynamos of 1/8th horsepower heat and cool in a cold combustion
          process, without fire. The device is both heater and
          refrigerator. By means of an organic vacuum, it lifts water or
          air to any height, converts water or air into an immaterial
          form and distils the starting product, so that any kind of
          water or air can be produced. Main criterion: The correct
          composition of the material. Study catalysts that separate
          oxygen from water. For experiments use caustic potash and
          zinc, or sodium. To dissipate the additional heat, bind
          aluminium and silica with waterglass. The ratio of 1:1 is not
          right, because the resultant temperature is too high.
          Intuitively it should be in the ratio of 2:3, wherein the
          C-substances must predominate. The number of revolutions per
          minute should be between 4,000 and 9,000. Basic concept is
          planetary motion with suction and pressure on opposite sides
          of the catalyst. Depending on the rate of rotation, there can
          be a 350,000-fold increase in weight or pressure. The device
          can also be used to produce the cheapest artificial petrol.
          With one system as big as a fist, houses can be heated. On the
          other hand, any desired low temperature can be achieved merely
          by adjusting the needle-jets. Small motive impulses only are
          required to set it in motion -- kick-starter or electrical
          starter-motor. In a vacuum water will be evaporated and by
          means of cold is transformed (through mutators) into a gaseous
          state. In my next device air will be converted into
          electrozoic energy. ( 1 -- Electrozoic energy: an animalistic
          or organismic form of electrical energy. — Ed.) This is how
          the organic or physical vacuum comes into being, which even in
          small machines consumes about 4 m^3 (141.24 ft^3) of air per
          second, delivering about 10,000 hp to the drive-shaft to do
          work. If a physical vacuum is created in front of the
          suction-intake openings, then the machine itself is drawn
          forwards by this force, thus opening the way to the production
          of silent, fuelless aircraft (in the current meaning of the
          word)..."<br>

            Central heating with reactive forms of heat</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          In exactly the same way as happened after World War I, there
          is no other solution to the present shortage of coal than to
          cut down the forest in order to heat our houses over the
          coming winter.As a result:<br>
          <br>
          1. A valuable national asset will be further destroyed.<br>
          <br>
          2. A whole string of new economic disasters will ensue.<br>
          <br>
          3. Nothing will be achieved of any practical value. <br>
          <br>
          Assuming that we are able to fell such a large number of
          trees, then, as also happened after World War I, it will be
          impossible to transport the green and heavy fire-wood logs to
          the railways and on to further destinations, due to the lack
          of draft-animals and fuel. What is actually delivered, can
          barely be burned for at least six months, because firewood
          must first be dried out. At the same time the generation of an
          unhealthy form of heat, conducive to the propagation of
          bacteria will result. People should send me a few sheets of
          copper (Cu), brass (Cu5Zn8, Cu9Al4,Cu3Sn8) or aluminium (Al),
          which should be 0.8-1.0 mm (0.0315-0.0394 in.) thick. Steel
          sheet is hard to bend, although it is also very suitable. It
          is not worth having a press-die specially made merely to build
          a prototype to demonstrate how this problem can be solved
          naturally and inexpensively. Hardly anyone will be able to
          understand the essential nature of this new system of heating.
          Nevertheless, the attempt should be made in order to create
          interest. <br>
          <br>
          It is a well-known fact that it is warm below the
          ground-surface in winter and cool in summer. These variations
          in temperature originate from material changes in the raw
          materials present in the ground and in part are also effected
          through the cycloid-spiral-space-curve motion of the Earth.
          These internal and external changes in motion are brought
          about as Nature increases the intensity of the Suns rays in
          summer by lengthening their developmental path ( 2 -- In the
          northern hemisphere summer the distance between Sun and Earth
          increases to a maximum at aphelion about the 1st of June. —
          Ed.) and weakens them in winter through the earthward approach
          of the Sun at perihelion. In very general terms this enables
          dense agglomerations of oxygen to enter the ground. It is the
          same process that happens in a motor in cool weather or at
          night. The oxygen then consumes the residual matter, which the
          Earth created during the summer out of the earthly remains of
          deceased life-forms with the aid of her
          cycloid-spiral-space-curve motion. The movement of sap in
          summer and its state of rest in winter are the biological
          sequel to the above variations in intensity. These are the
          cause of the different motions, which in turn contribute
          towards the intensification of the Earths new processes. <br>
          <br>
          It is only in this way that qualigen is to be understood,
          whose waste-matter is also involved in the generation of
          reactive, falling and therefore concentrating influences of
          heat. Without these influences no growth is possible. It is
          these falling and concentrating forms of heat that are of
          interest to us at the moment, since they can solve the most
          urgent problems of fuel and heating quickly and simply. They
          are about 90% more efficient than normal methods of heating
          for the simple reason that they are produced from the
          waste-products of qualigen and hence will function equally
          efficiently in large, medium or very small heating appliances.
          A great deal of time, effort and expense can thus be spared
          using this naturalesque method of heating. Wood and coal will
          become as good as obsolete. In Nature nothing happens
          directly, but only indirectly. Without waste-matter,
          therefore, no growth and no gain is possible. As far as
          present heating problems are concerned, the trick is to learn
          how to make use of those waste-products that generate falling
          and concentrating heat rays. These heat from above downwards
          in the same way that the Sun heats the surface of the Earth. <br>
          <br>
          For this purpose a Klimator is required. What is a Klimator?
          It is merely a type of dynamo that generates natural forms of
          temperature, or more accurately, falling and concentrating
          heat rays as well as naturally rising and expanding forms of
          cold. The latter are health-promoting and lethal to bacteria.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Klimator essentially consists of three special components
          (see fig. 28) and: <br>
          <br>
          1. Is a small, conventional heating element, which is
          incorporated in the middle of a sort of selenium cell ( 3 --
          Selenium's electrical resistance increases with exposure to
          light and a selenium cell is a type of photo-electric cell
          comprising a thin coating of selenium applied to a metal disc
          and covered with a layer ofgold or platinum thin enough to
          allow the passage of light. — Ed. ), which is surrounded by a
          material mass. As in a natural living cell (similar to a
          protoplasm), all major and secondary basic elements are
          present in an allotropic state. Herein are contained all
          stocks of allotropic fructigens and seminal substances,
          oligodynamic (decay-promoting) and catalytic
          (growth-accelerating), exciting substances.<br>
          <br>
          2. Is a diminutive, but faithful copy of the Earth itself,
          within which an agitator rotates, which is attached to the end
          of the vertical shaft. In addition, the Klimator consists of a
          series of nested, rilled, calyx-like ( 4 -- Calyx = the sepals
          of a flower collectively forming the outer floral envelope,
          protective of the bud. -Ed.) vanes, which are so constructed
          that the through-flowing masses, such as water and air, can be
          bio-centrifugated. Through the increase in centripetating and
          centrifugating velocities, which have hitherto never been
          achieved anywhere, increases in pressure and suction are
          produced, which reciprocally amplify each other exponentially.
          This results in the decomposition of the water and air due to
          the thorough trituration of the smallest molecules of
          sediment, leading to the development of a hitherto unknown
          process of synthesis. This gives rise to two longitudinally
          oriented types of inward flowing, spiral-like currents, one
          flowing upwards and the other downwards.<br>
          <br>
          3. A small generator is also incorporated in the Klimator,
          whose armature is fixed and about which the stator rotates.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Fig. 28: The Klimator<br>

          The primary product of synthesis, a biomagnetic formative and
          levitative current, will not be elaborated in more detail
          here, since we are primarily interested in the solution of the
          problem of heating, namely, with the function of the secondary
          or reflux current. This is a potential with which it is
          possible to heat up a space from the ceiling downwards, like
          the Sun does. It is a radiant form of heat, which heats the
          whole space evenly. If the intensity of the small heating
          resistance (element) is reduced, however, for which the rate
          of rotation of the agitator must be increased, then the living
          space is suffused with an evenly dispersed, rising, expanding
          and high-altitude-like fresh air. In this way the natural,
          reactive forms of temperature are produced nearly free of
          cost, through which the natural warmth of the valley-climate
          comes into being. It is a mountain micro-climate. The Klimator
          represents the most basic developmental form in which the
          natural, primary motive forces can evolve, whose two
          components are to be differentiated as:<br>
          <br>
          (a) The metaphysical, which acts from the inside outwards, and<br>
          <br>
          (b) The physical, which acts from the outside inwards. <br>
          <br>
          Both these higher forms of pressure and suction together
          produce the original form of motion through which the higher
          influence arises, which in turn generates the increased and
          qualitatively improved, primary life-energy. This original way
          of generating natural formative and levitative essences is
          exploited by the stationary trout, which stands motionless in
          fast-flowing torrents and darts upstream like lightning when
          danger threatens, wherein it cannot only overcome its own
          body-weight, but also, swimming freely and without other
          assistance, overcomes the weight of the oncoming water. This
          was previously inexplicable as far as science was
          concerned.The secret of this mysterious overcoming of gravity
          solves the problem of the aforementioned, hitherto unknown
          synthesizing current, which is triggered off through the cold
          metabolic process. Contemporary science knows nothing about
          it, because it only uses warm processes of oxidation, which
          triggers the counter-current to the above current. This,
          however, is the most dangerous current of all. This
          annihilating current science uses for mechanical power and to
          heat living spaces. The suppression of the life-current means
          the gradual elimination of the life-force leading to disease
          and premature death. Progress can only be made in the search
          for the synthesizing current and quality of life when all
          substances are moved inwindingly. The cyloidally moving Earth
          demonstrates this to us daily. It was a trout that showed it
          to me. With the Klimator, the Repulsator and the Repulsine the
          first atom-bomb that rises can be produced instead of one that
          falls. The latter achieved the veritable zenith of almost
          complete annihilation with the aid of the most efficacious
          combustion process of all. But with it came the long-sought
          turning point, for in all truth no deeper nadir could have
          been reached. <br>

      <big><big><b> </b><br>
          The no longer mysterious secret of the naturalesque generation
          of power, heat, cold and light lies hidden in the substance
          that today's technologists combust, from which the so-called
          calories arise, and which understandably disappear when we
          drive our machines with Natures principal formative substance
          (fatty-matter), or use it for heating or for generating
          low-grade light. Derived from the ancient Greek word technao,
          technology means self-cheating or self-deception. Actually it
          ought to be called stupidity, because all we have to do is
          merely to move what actually moves, heats and illuminates
          naturalesquely in order to be able to set every kind of
          machine in motion originally or to produce heat and light
          naturalesquely. For this reason the ancient Greeks also
          rejected technology in any form.Instead they captured slaves
          so as to have the more demeaning and demanding tasks carried
          out by these natural machines, which run on metaphysical
          fatty-matter. In order to eat today the wretched slaves
          scramble for work, burrowing into the earth for coal, felling
          the forests and extracting oil from the ground, in order, so
          they believe, to alleviate their lot, but achieve precisely
          the opposite. More and more people have to work and the more
          diligently they slave away, the more keenly the hunger they
          will have to experience, because without coal, timber and oil
          no growth of vegetation is possible. In other words, there
          will be an increasing dearth of all that is most vital to
          life, if by the sweat of our brows we inhibit the build-up of
          quality matter and exploit Natures most important formative
          substance - fatty-matter - for every possible and impossible
          purpose, i.e. to drive machines and for ridiculous methods of
          lighting and heating: All this in the belief that these
          earthly residues of fatty-matter would in any case be reduced
          to dust and ashes if left in the ground,and therefore it does
          not matter whether we make soap or something else outof them,
          or merely combust them. Today this is totally unnecessary.
          Naturally there will be a hue and cry from all the
          well-camouflaged slave-masters, who earn fat sums through
          those they lead around by the nose, once the bio-technical
          secret is revealed and the mentally castrated work-oxen are
          shown the way to move this mysterious fatty-matter
          naturalesquely. This will provoke an upheaval of a kind that
          humanity has never yet experienced, because mechanical power,
          heal and light will be as good as free. In the future no
          intelligent person will operate machines or even generate heat
          and light with Natures principal working material, but will
          make the actual mover and Life re-awakener move
          bio-technically. To learn this art it is necessary above all
          to explain two fundamental concepts. Firstly, what actually is
          substance and secondly what actually is motion ? From a
          naturalesque viewpoint, the term substance is to be envisaged
          as a more or less highly developed energy-concentrate; a
          lattice of atoms, as it were, or as the word lattice implies,
          a sort of prison, in which Natures principal formative
          substance -- the fatty-matter in the process of change and
          formation -- also resides in an allotropic (naturally
          congealed or condensed) state. This only awaits the
          naturalesque motive impulse in order to be elevated to a
          freely moving atomic state, which happens all the more
          rapidly, the faster this energy-concentrate in a latent
          transitional state is rotated in inwinding space-spiral-curves
          about its own axis by means of so-called venal-motion.
          Immediately thereafter, what has come into being in this way
          is moved further in so-called arterial-motion in order to
          distribute what has been freely formed by way of naturalesque
          rhythmical motion through the surrounding body (the soil) in
          order to bring it to life.With this the secret of biotechnical
          motion stands revealed and all that remains is to explain the
          mysterious machine with which it is possible to ur-generate
          the originally moving and resuscitating, i.e. a higher-grade
          potential. With its use all machines can be powered and our
          homes heated and illuminated independently. Moreover, all
          growth -- which is none other than the natural solidification
          of energy-concentrates -- can be stimulated and increased as
          well as qualitatively improved. In short, our every wish can
          be fulfilled with very little effort. Naturally all this will
          be described as Utopian, as the product of a deranged mind
          intent on creating all kinds of confusion amidst the present
          economic chaos caused by the insanity of combusting Natures
          most vital primary substances. <br>
          <br>
          Consequently, great concern for the continuing supply of
          fatty-matter will inevitably arise; a substance that nowadays
          not only every house-wife lacks ( 5 -- This relates to the
          severe food shortages and rationing in Austria in the
          immediate post-war period. - Ed. ) , but one that is also
          lacking in the form of what might be called cerebral
          lubricant. For it is from the brain that all healthy thoughts
          arise, and above all the idea of doing things in accordance
          with Nature in the future ; something the director of an
          institute for commodity studies naturally cannot immediately
          appreciate. Therefore a number of other things must be
          explained in greater detail in order to make it clear to the
          various ministers of government departments as well. This is
          necessary so as to enable an increased production of
          commodities and above all a faster growth of calories, which
          under the present circumstances are not only being
          increasingly wasted, but ultimately would go to waste entirely
          were such individuals not to be enlightened by an outsider.
          That is, were the fundamental concepts of biotechnology not
          explained in a generally understandable way. Under the concept
          motion we have to visualise a rhythmical combination of
          pressure and suction, wherein it is of crucial importance
          whether pressure or suction predominates. If the former
          prevails, then a decadent potential or expressed more
          scientifically, an oxidation, takes place, which should
          generally be understood as a highly combustive process that
          inhibits development. In contrast, if suction prevails during
          a naturalesque course of motion, then a reduction process
          occurs, which is here to be generally understood as the
          aforesaid higher-grade transformation of an already high-grade
          material into spirit, or expressed more scientifically, into
          the above form of higher-grade potential. Naturally, this is
          also the source of higher-grade temperature and light
          phenomena, which as development-furthering instrumentalities,
          foster the development of naturalesque motive forces,
          high-grade heat and cold as well as light. In this formative
          process il primo movere, the initial motive impulse, also
          plays a decisive role. If any motion is actuated by a
          pressure-induced axial-&gt;radial (see fig. 14) impulse and
          pressure prevails, then the decadent form of potential
          results, because in this case the atom lattice ruptures due to
          the release of its content of unipolar and highly aggressive
          allotropic oxygen. In other words, when the oxygen has
          attained the energetic state that enables itto encircle the
          fatty-matter (carbone). The latter having become passive and
          coincident ( internally collapsed ) under this lower-grade
          heat influence, the oxygen loops around it in
          spiral-space-curves, and engulfs, consumes and digests it. The
          offspring of this outbirth of decadent energies are
          lower-grade temperatures, i.e. rising heat-forms and falling
          cold-forms, which foster the decay process. Subsequently, with
          the aid of these solidifying cold-forms, the relape into the
          earth of what has missed its way on evolutions upward path
          ensues. However, if a motion is initiated by a
          radial-&gt;axial impulse, i.e. if the initiating upward
          suction and inward impulsion are triggered simultaneously,
          then firstly the atom lattice of basic elements is
          disassembled naturalesquely, because under this centripetal
          motion it is only the oxygen that reacts and contracts into
          itself. Secondly, due to the developing coolness that occurs
          with all sucking action, the fatty-matter ( carbones ), which
          become free, unipolar and highly active then encircles the
          oxygen, also loops around it in inwinding spiral curves, and
          engulfs and digests it. The product of this metabolic process
          is the higher-grade potential, which immediately gives rise to
          higher-grade temperature-forms, i.e. falling and concentrating
          heat-forms and rising and expanding invigorative cold-forms.
          These combine the highest-grade elements into a new atom
          lattice and propel the product of this high-grade synthesis,
          which already has a desire to rise, into even higher zones of
          evolvement.<br>
          <br>
          To restate the process briefly: axial-&gt;radial expulsion
          results in explosion,decay and combustion. Impulsion, or a
          radial-&gt;axial impetus results in implosion, ennoblement and
          autonomous upward displacement (levitation). In this case
          reactive suctional forces operate first during the ascent and
          are then reinforced by supplementary reactive forces. This is
          how physical weight is overcome naturalesquely, during which
          process the already higher-grade energetic ballasting elements
          are precipitated out and manifest themselves as falling and
          concentrating heat-forms. If this formative process is copied
          naturalesquely in a so-called Klimator (see figs. 27 and 28),
          which is suspended from the ceiling and moved
          bio-centrifugally then a falling and concentrating heat-form
          is produced with which the living space can be naturalesquely
          heated in winter. If these invigorative cold-forms with their
          rising and expanding properties are introduced into an
          evacuated glass bulb, then the energy-concentrates,which in
          any case move exceptionally rapidly, exceed their highest
          velocity in this resistance-less space. In the process they
          eject high-grade ballast material which interacts with the
          residual oxygen still present in an extremely rarefied state.
          The product of this renewed union is atmospheric space-light,
          naturalesquely copied sunlight as it were. This evolves and
          lights up the vacuum bulb when the bulb, which has no other
          connections apart from the earth-wire, is merely earthed. All
          that is required therefore is to connect the earth-wire in
          order to make the living space as bright as day. To extinguish
          this natural light, which is of course temperatureless, the
          earth-wire is simply disconnected. If virtually free
          mechanical power is required, then the above higher-grade
          heating effects merely need to be switched off, thus
          converting them into formative and levitative invigorative
          forms (cold-forms). This immediately reactivates the ur --
          powerfully-waxing buoyant motion, which here should been
          visaged as a bio-magnetic up-current (a synthesizing current).
          With elemental force arising from an energy gradient that
          evolves along a common developmental axis, this up-current
          sucks up the generating device in its wake, i.e. it
          effortlessly overcomes its own weight. Aircraft, submarines
          orheavy projectiles can be propelled like lightning in this
          way at negligible cost.In stationary machines on the other
          hand, which must be well anchored to the ground, the indrawn
          air will be almost instantaneously decomposed, trans-formed
          and built up as described earlier by passing through a
          curviform pipe.The concurrently coincident water, i.e. the
          discharged and inwardly collapsed medium, will be expelled at
          the same time, resulting in the ur-generation of a high-grade
          high-quality space -- the organic vacuum. This is the opposite
          of atmospheric air pressure and is the best and cheapest
          attractional force to be found anywhere on this planet. It is
          also the space that produces ray-like forms which penetrate
          through al l enclosures and stream upwards.<br>
          <br>
          If a communicating pipe is interposed between this
          naturalesquely evacuated highly potent vacuity imbued with
          qualigens and the outer pressure of atmospheric space, and if
          a propeller or turbine is installed inside it, then the
          external atmospheric pressure exerts a force of 1 atm/cm2 on
          the inclined blades of the propeller (turbine). Since any
          desired volume of air can be reduced (transformed into
          formations of qualigen) in a fraction of a second with a
          naturalesquely constructed Repulsine (see figs. 30-33), for
          which at most a driving force of 0.8 kW isrequired, the
          levitative torque-producing force generated, or more correctly
          ur-generated, in this way is as good as free. For here, with
          increasing velocity due to the upward activation of the above
          bio-synthesising torque-producing force, the Repulsines power
          increases by the square of the ur-generative motion. This is
          to be compared with the increase in the resistance to motion
          in all technical machines, where understandably, due to the
          reversed direction of motion the forces of recoil increase in
          the same ratio as described above. That is to say, todays
          technology strives to move forwards with forces that operate
          backwards. Logically what has been achieved is not only a
          reversal of motion, but also of the economy; an economic
          decline resulting from the mechanical build-up of decadent
          repulsive pressures, which naturally have a decadent or
          destructive effect economically. Consequently, the economy
          willbecome increasingly unhealthy, the more widespread and
          intensive such technology, this self-deception becomes, or to
          put it mildly, the more the abysmal stupidity of generating
          decadent energies mechanically takes effect. This tragic
          aberration was inaugurated by the foolish belief that the
          progress of evolution comes to a halt when the life-functions
          are apparently extinguished and that the so-called soul
          escapes after the cessation of vital activity. In reality the
          true resurrection only begins after the proper decomposition
          of an atom lattice (fatty-matter concentrate) that has fallen
          back into the earth with the aid of and because of the
          cycloid-space-curve motion of the Earth itself, which provides
          the radial-&gt;axial impulse. In contrast, all technical
          machines, i.e. all dynamos, turbines, pressure pumps,
          propellers, explosion and steam driven engines, all furnaces,
          gas and electric heating appliances,all soil-tilling and
          harvesting machinery, etc. provide a developmentally harmful
          expulse to initiate motion. Because of this and without
          exception,the atom lattice thus moved ruptures, resulting in
          the disintegration of the molecular (bacteriophagous)
          formations in suspension. In unnaturally moved air or water
          decadent stresses appear, causing the decay of the decivise
          energy-concentrates (as a graphic example, see hydraulic river
          regulation and torrent confinement ( 6 -- See sections on
          river engineering in The Water Wizard, Vol. I of the
          Ecotechnology series. — Ed). This leads to the build-up of
          decadent potential and thedecomposition of the blood of the
          Earth, and thus to a total economic collapse along the whole
          course of development.<br>
          <br>
          The possibility of ur-generating virtually free mechanical
          power, heat, coldand temperature-less light, however, is only
          the first step towards cultural (economic) reconstruction. For
          with venal-motion, it goes without saying that the highest
          quality blood of the Earth - water containing exceptionally
          potent substances -- can be produced by mechanical means. With
          this water not only can reactive expansive pressures be
          generated and all petroleum fuels, etc. replaced, but all
          cancerous decay can also be healed naturally, which would
          revolutionize medicine, i.e. put it back on the right track.
          In a word, the naturalesque movement of any given medium and
          the atom lattice it contains, signifies a social
          reconstruction in every sense, because all slave-labour will
          cease with the restoration of natural abundance and freedom of
          movement. Everyone will be free and independent, and healthy
          once more in mind and body. This will happen for the sole
          reason that any given atom lattice - like the body of a dead
          animal or plant - can be transformed and built up with the aid
          of venal-motion, whereupon the subtle physical energies - the
          so-called life-forces - then come into being, which through
          this revitalising process move our bodies originally
          (autonomously). Precisely the same thing happens at a large
          scale if we transform and build up bacteriophagous threshold
          structures (minute molecular atom lattices of water or air)
          mechanically through venal-motion, and thereafter distribute
          these specifically densified higher-grade energy-concentrates
          where required by way of arterial-motion. This will reimbue
          the surrounding body orgeosphere -- the macro atom lattice -
          with life and restore its inner vibration. We have only to
          intensify this formative oscillating motion in order to
          stimulate the macro-climate or higher-grade potential out of
          which displacement, namely physical movement, reproduction and
          further development, arises as the biological sequel to a
          naturalesque motive impulse. With this I place the lever or
          the fulcrum that lies beyond space and time in the hands of
          humanity, which will enable the normalization of those
          evolutive processes whose normal motion has been dislocated
          and in this way the standard of living can be simply and
          fundamentally improved along the whole chain of development.
          Only when this is done can reconstruction finally begin in a
          truly natural way. In this regard all institutes for commodity
          studies and research are outdated and for this reason the
          Visamontana Biotechnical Research Institute Ltd ( 7 -- The
          name Schauberger can be broken down into two concepts —
          "Schau" = look/see and "berger" = of the mountain. Hence the
          Latin-derived name Visa (look/see) + montana (mountain) =
          Visamontana. — Ed. ) has been registered with the chamber of
          commerce. It is in the close interest of those who play a
          leading role in government to enable this research institute
          to come into operation quickly, because all the preconditions
          now exist for implementing these formative atomic energies. <br>
          <br>
          This will put an end to the present world-wide shortages of
          raw materials, food, fuel and germinating substances, which
          had to happen because the workings of evolution were subverted
          and put into reverse gear through the reversal of the
          naturalesque motive impulse. There can be no doubting what has
          been stated, because it is founded on indisputable practical
          results. It is contemporary science that erred and which, on
          the basis of various inventions, took the wrong evolutionary
          road.Science must now be shown another way by an outsider, and
          if not of its own free will, will be forced to do so by the
          mass of the people deprived of their most primitive rights to
          life. To err is human. It would be inhuman, however, now to
          delay and arrest this fresh start for the sake of scientific
          prestige or other interests. For in the present situation the
          life of millions upon millions of people, already hungry and
          freezing, is at stake. For this reason all this will be
          presented to the competent authorities and once more
          emphasized that the economy cannot move forward in reverse
          gear. Therefore everything must be switched around all along
          the line. <br>
