      <br>
      About an hour north of Boston, in a city by the sea, there’s a
      project underway to reinvent the marine industry. More
      specifically, the marine defense industry.<br>
      <br>
      Imagine a boat that moves through the water differently from any
      other boat in existence. It uses “supercavitation”—the creation of
      a gaseous bubble layer around the hull to reduce friction
      underwater—to reach very high speeds at relatively low fuel cost.
      Its speed and shape means it can evade detection by sonar or ship
      radar. It can outrun torpedoes. Its fuel efficiency means it has
      greater range and can run longer missions than conventional boats
      and helicopters.<br>
      <br>
      Now imagine that this vessel has already been built and tested. It
      “flies” through the water more or less the way it was designed
      to—like a high-tech torpedo, except part of the craft is above
      water—and it can be maneuvered like a fighter plane. “It’s almost
      as much an aircraft as it is a boat,” says its inventor, Gregory
      Sancoff, the founder and CEO of Juliet Marine Systems, a private
      company in Portsmouth, NH.<br>
      <br>
      The vehicle, dubbed the “Ghost,” is the first of its kind and is
      garnering attention from organizations like the U.S. Navy, Coast
      Guard, defense contractors, and foreign governments—as well as
      hackers in foreign countries, who are presumably trying to figure
      out how it works. Juliet Marine Systems has received about $10
      million in total funding, about half of which comes from its
      founder and private investors. The startup’s institutional
      investor is Avalon Ventures, a VC firm with offices in the San
      Diego and Boston areas.<br>
      <br>
      Until recently, the project was kept under wraps because of
      secrecy orders from the federal government. But this summer,
      Sancoff says, the Ghost—which looks like something out of Star
      Trek (see photos)—will be ready for prime-time deployment. His
      team of 16 employees is working on integrating weapons and sensors
      for military missions. “We have a fully functional, basically
      go-to-war boat right now,” Sancoff says.<br>
      <br>
      The question is, does it really work? And, more to the point, can
      it be used for missions safely, reliably, and effectively? If the
      answer is yes—and that’s a big if, from an outside perspective—one
      could imagine a squadron of Ghosts being deployed to the Persian
      Gulf, say, to defend warships and other interests against “swarm”
      attacks by small boats, Sancoff says. The vessel also could be
      used against pirate attacks, for Coast Guard rescue missions, or
      to transport workers to and from oil platforms. The technology
      might have much broader uses, too—in global cargo shipping, for
      example, to reduce fuel costs, or for commercial jet skis. (Wacky
      as it is, the concept is not as far-fetched as, say, a submarine
      that can also fly.)<br>
      <br>
      But to get a better sense of the ship’s real prospects—and the
      company’s—let’s consider the whole story.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">From Medical to Marine Tech</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Sancoff, 55, is a prolific inventor and serial entrepreneur who,
      I’m told, takes engineering magazines to bed. He grew up in a
      military family and went to high school in Lawrence, MA. As a kid,
      he lived on Army bases and says he remembers saluting the flag
      when he got out of the car. Sancoff never served in the military,
      but that’s probably because he was too busy inventing stuff.<br>
      <br>
      He started his first company when he was 18—a machine shop for
      doing rapid device-prototyping for other businesses. He sold that
      and headed west to San Diego in 1982, at age 25. As a consultant,
      he became an expert in medical devices, including systems for
      delivering intravenous fluids, collecting health data, and other
      applications. He started a new company, Block Medical, and sold it
      for $80 million in 1991. His next company, River Medical, was
      based around a new kind of drug-delivery device for hospitals.
      River acquired IVAC, a medical-device firm divested from Eli
      Lilly, and ended up being sold to Advanced Medical (IMED) for $400
      million in 1995.<br>
      <br>
      Sancoff’s next big project was to start Onux Medical, a surgical
      tech company based in New Hampshire. It was there, in 2000, that
      he first got inspiration for Juliet Marine and the Ghost ship.
      Sancoff was sitting in a conference room when he heard the U.S.S.
      Cole had been attacked off the coast of Yemen by a small boat
      loaded with explosives. Seventeen U.S. sailors had been killed and
      many more wounded. He sat there in disbelief as he realized a
      billion-dollar warship had nearly been sunk by a couple of guys in
      a raft.<br>
      <br>
      Juliet Marine would derive its name from a U.S. Navy “war games”
      exercise held in 2002. At $250 million, it was the most expensive
      exercise in Naval history. “Fleet Battle Experiment—Juliet”
      involved warships parked off the coast of California and a series
      of simulated small-boat attacks. The results of the simulation
      were grim: more than 20,000 deaths and massive losses to the
      fleet, in a Persian Gulf scenario. Yet, Sancoff says, the Navy
      hasn’t done anything in the past 10 years to guard against such
      attacks, other than work on targeted rocket systems.<br>
      <br>
      “When you’re an entrepreneur, there has to be an overwhelming
      reason why you do it,” Sancoff says. “That was it for me.”<br>
      <br>
      He saw a big opportunity—if only he could design a ship fast
      enough and maneuverable enough to intercept attackers before they
      could get close to big ships or shorelines. He had raced
      hydroplanes as a teenager—probably could bulls-eye womp rats, too
      (sorry, Star Wars joke)—so he had an intuitive feel for what it
      might take.<br>
      <br>
      Which brings us to supercavitation. It’s an old idea. During the
      Cold War, the Russians developed a torpedo called the Shkval
      (“squall”) that could go more than 200 mph — five times as fast as
      a conventional torpedo — using a rocket engine and air ejected in
      front to produce a gaseous bubble completely enveloping the
      projectile. That reduces the friction between the hull and its
      surroundings by a factor of about 900, enabling superfast travel.
      Yet rocket-propelled torpedoes have downsides in performance and
      reliability; the sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk in 2000 is
      rumored to have been caused by a malfunctioning Shkval.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy and others reportedly have been working
      on a next-generation supercavitating torpedo since at least the
      1990s. And in recent years, the Defense Advanced Research Projects
      Agency (DARPA) ran a program, called Underwater Express, to design
      a supercavitating submarine. There is also interest in using the
      concept to improve fuel efficiency for oil tankers, ferries, and
      other large ships, typically by creating air bubbles at the front
      of the hull. As of yet, however, nobody has publicly demonstrated
      a successful supercavitating craft.<br>
      <br>
      To that end, after leaving Onux (which was bought by Bard in
      2004), Sancoff spent several years doing research on his own and
      incorporated Juliet Marine in 2008. By June of last year, using $5
      million of mostly his own money, his team had built a fully
      functioning prototype — Sancoff prefers the term “pre-production”
      vehicle. And earlier this year, he secured an additional $5
      million from Avalon Ventures, the VC firm that invested in his
      last two companies.<br>
      <br>
      At a Bay Area event in March, Kevin Kinsella, the Avalon partner
      on the deal, spoke glowingly of River Medical in particular. “We
      got 10x [return] in 18 months, and I only had to go to four
      meetings. An ROI of 2.5x per board meeting is fantastic,” he said.
      (Onux didn’t cash out quite as well, but it still worked out
      fine.)<br>
      <br>
      After seeing firsthand what Juliet Marine built with $5 million,
      Kinsella said, “If you were taken around by a handler from
      Lockheed or Grumman or Northrop or any of them, and they told you,
      ‘We developed this on $150 million,’ you wouldn’t bat an eye.” He
      told the story of a meeting with Avalon and its fund investors.
      Someone asked Sancoff, “How did you get to be so capital efficient
      in your company?” Kinsella relays, “He leaned on the podium and
      said, ‘Because it was my money.’”<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Not Your Grandfather’s Boat</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      OK, so here’s how it works, according to a patent filing (see
      diagram, below). The main compartment of the Ghost vessel, which
      houses the cockpit and controls, sits above the water in between
      two torpedo-shaped pontoons or “foils,” which are submerged and
      create all the buoyancy and propulsion for the craft. The angle of
      the struts that connect the foils to the command module is
      adjustable — so the craft can ride high in choppy seas and at high
      speeds (so waves don’t hit the middle part), and low in calm water
      and at lower speeds.<br>
      <br>
      “We’re basically riding on two supercavitating torpedoes. And
      we’ve put a boat on top of it,” Sancoff says.<br>
      <br>
      At the front of each foil is a special propeller system that pulls
      the craft forward. The propellers are powered by a modified gas
      turbine — a jet engine — housed in each foil; the air intake and
      exhaust ports for the engines are in the struts. As the ship moves
      through the water, the motion of the propellers creates a thin
      layer of bubbly water vapor that surrounds each foil from front to
      back, helped along by the presence of “air trap fins” that keep
      the vapor in contact with the hull (and keep liquid away from the
      hull). The vapor is what constitutes the supercavitation, so the
      foils can glide effortlessly through the bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      “The key is the propulsion. You have to have a lot of power at the
      right location in this vessel,” Sancoff says. Exactly how this is
      done is a trade secret. But the propulsion system, which he says
      generates 30 percent more thrust than any other propeller-based
      system, essentially “boils water underwater and generates steam
      vapor.” (I take this to mean the pressure directly behind the
      propeller blades is so low that the liquid water there “boils” off
      and becomes a gas—hence the bubbles.)<br>
      <br>
      After doing some digging in the literature, I asked Sancoff
      whether what’s in the patent filing is really how it works — in
      terms of how the Ghost creates its mysterious supercavitation. His
      answer: “No.” (OK, so there’s more to the story here. But you know
      when you’re supercavitating, he says, because the engine
      efficiency actually improves as you go faster.)<br>
      <br>
      In any case, the overall design makes the craft go fast, but
      Sancoff isn’t making any public claims yet about exactly how fast.
      “We don’t talk about speed, how many weapons [it can carry], or
      how far we can go,” he says. Yet its rumored speed is at least
      80-100 knots — over 100 mph. That’s not going to challenge the top
      speedboat records — there have been hydroplane efforts (riding on
      the water surface) that have exceeded 200 mph (174 knots) and even
      300 mph (261 knots), some with fatal results—but the Ghost is
      faster than any previous underwater vehicle, Sancoff says.<br>
      <br>
      What’s more, he says, the Ghost provides a much smoother ride than
      what Navy SEALs are used to; many of them blow out their backs
      from the bumpiness of their boats, he says. “Our boat does not
      have impact from the waves. We cut through the wave,” Sancoff
      says. “That is critical science.”<br>
      <br>
      Hydrodynamics experts I’ve talked to say the main challenges of
      such a craft are controlling it, stabilizing it, and making it
      quiet. Going superfast in a straight line might be doable, they
      say, but any sort of turning or maneuvering must be done very
      carefully, because if the bubble layer distorts or breaks down at
      high speeds, tremendous water forces will come to bear on the
      foils, which can be catastrophic.<br>
      <br>
      To steer itself through the water and maintain stability, the
      Ghost uses four movable flaps on the front of each foil and four
      on the back of each foil, for a total of 16 flaps. (The flaps
      reach through the thin bubble layer into the surrounding water.)
      The struts are adjusted to keep the command module out of the
      water, and the foils stay submerged, so waves at the water surface
      should only hit the struts, which have a small cross-section.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s computer controlled, like a modern F-18,” Sancoff says.
      “We’re boring what looks like two wormholes underwater, and we’re
      flying through foam.” Sancoff himself has been test-driving the
      ship over the past couple of years. “I have been learning an
      entirely new craft since then. It’s a totally new experience,” he
      says. “Just because you drive Grandpa’s boat, you’re not going to
      drive this one. It’s more like a helicopter.”<br>
      <br>
      As for the craft’s audio profile, Sancoff is proud of its “silent
      propulsion” system that includes a sophisticated muffler system
      for the engines. You can’t hear it from 50 feet away, he says.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Coming Out of the Night</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      With any grand invention like this, some outside experts are going
      to be skeptical. “I wouldn’t say it’s not going to work. But I
      have concerns,” says Gary Balas, head of the department of
      aerospace engineering and mechanics at the University of
      Minnesota. Balas is an expert in flight and underwater control
      systems, but his main objection is that the propulsion system of
      the Ghost, with its forward propellers, is very unusual for a
      supercavitating craft. The typical approach, as in the Russian
      torpedo, is to propel the craft from behind and eject gas and/or
      use a blunt shape in the front to create an air cavity around the
      craft. “I don’t see how they’ll achieve what they expect to
      achieve,” Balas says. “And I don’t see how they’ll control the
      altitude and the yaw of the vehicle.”<br>
      <br>
      His colleague, Roger Arndt, also a professor at the University of
      Minnesota, is an expert in fluid flow and cavitation. He has
      doubts about the Ghost propulsion method as well. In fact,
      cavitation bubbles are normally bad for propellers and can cause
      serious damage. But there is a type of propeller, with
      wedge-shaped blades, that produces supercavitation in high-speed
      racing boats; presumably this is similar to Ghost’s propellers.
      But in this case, Arndt says, “I am dubious about the application
      of supercavitating propellers.” (To be fair, Sancoff said that
      what’s in the patent filing isn’t quite how it works.)<br>
      <br>
      Other experts on supercavitation declined to comment for this
      article. Sancoff emphasizes that the project has a lot of
      sensitive aspects to it, in terms of national security, so people
      who know about it aren’t talking. And he claims that Juliet
      Marine’s website is getting “attacked” 350 times a month by
      hackers, mostly in foreign countries.<br>
      <br>
      In any case, the current vehicle — which resides under tight
      security at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (“a great asset” for a
      startup to be able to rent space in, he says) — holds 18 people
      and weighs some 60,000 pounds fully loaded; the underwater part of
      the vessel is 62 feet long. Sancoff says it can be launched from
      any beach. “A group of these boats coming out of the night in the
      Persian Gulf, armed with torpedoes, would be undetectable to large
      ships,” he says. “Ghost cannot be hit by a torpedo. You would have
      to shoot it with a gun.”<br>
      <br>
      Not surprisingly, Sancoff sees an urgent military need for his
      craft. The Navy loses sleep about swarm attacks and security in
      the Strait of Hormuz (which runs between Iran, United Arab
      Emirates, and Oman) and other strategic waterways, he says. Yet it
      hasn’t moved quickly enough to do anything about the threats. “We
      talk with the Navy weekly,” he says. “We believe the U.S. could
      use a hundred of these boats right away.” At a price of $20
      million per boat — fully loaded with electronics, radar, and so
      forth — that “provides us with a billion-dollar market opportunity
      for coastal and fleet protection,” he says.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department has granted Juliet Marine
      permission to talk with the governments of Israel and UAE, which
      both have marine security concerns. The company says it is
      currently building a manufacturing facility near Portsmouth, in
      anticipation of ramping up to sell Ghost ships to customers.
      Sancoff adds that Juliet Marine is planning to build two more
      versions of the ship this fall, using what he calls “the final
      configuration.”<br>
      <br>
      And while the startup strives to gain full acceptance from the
      U.S. Navy and other potential defense customers, it is “working on
      weaponizing” the craft, says Sancoff. “The vehicle’s done. Now
      it’s time to get mission modules complete.” That means mounting
      torpedoes, machine guns, radar, mine-detection systems, and other
      sensors onto the craft — and making sure it all works the way it’s
      supposed to.<br>
      <br>
      That remains to be seen, of course. But if it performs as
      advertised, Juliet Marine could end up playing a vital role in
      global security on the high seas. “That’s the beautiful thing
      about being an entrepreneur,” says Sancoff. “You take a risk with
      it.”<br>

      'We plan to build a major company here,' says Greg Sancoff,
      founder of Juliet Marine Systems.<br>
      <br>
      When entrepreneur Greg Sancoff takes his watercraft out for a test
      drive on the Piscataqua River, the 75-foot long vessel draws
      quizzical looks from people who see it. There are good reasons for
      the double-take stares.<br>
      <br>
      The sleekly angled, supercavitating Ghost looks like it just
      arrived from the set of a Hollywood science fiction movie. In
      reality, the Ghost has the potential to play a vital role in
      protecting American Navy vessels in volatile regions of the world,
      such as the current, headline-making tensions in the Persian Gulf.<br>
      <br>
      Ghost is a high-speed attack craft - Sancoff calls it a modern
      version of the PT Boat - specifically designed to protect vital
      waterways like the Straits of Hormuz and to counter threats to
      commercial shipping, such as piracy, which is increasing in many
      areas of the world.<br>
      <br>
      Sancoff says the Ghost has been compared to an attack helicopter
      on the water. "Ghost would be a very important and cost-effective
      security tool to exert a constant presence in this troubled
      region," he said.<br>
      <br>
      For almost three decades as a successful entrepreneur in the
      medical devices industry, Sancoff was accustomed to taking risks.
      He has founded and sold four companies totaling more than $100
      million. But his latest venture, Portsmouth-based Juliet Marine
      Systems, required a combination investment of patriotism, personal
      finances and innovative research and development far beyond
      anything he had done before.<br>
      <br>
      "By far this is the most fulfilling thing I have ever done,"
      Sancoff said.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fast, fuel-efficient</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      What makes the Ghost unique is that it was developed entirely on
      spec in less than four years, unprecedented for a potential
      "game-changing" defense technology, he said.<br>
      <br>
      While other weapons and defense industry programs get government
      approval and research funding and then embark on lengthy
      development and deployment process, Juliet Marine Systems bypassed
      all of that.<br>
      <br>
      "It was the fastest way to get it done. We didn't get involved
      with government research institutions because it would have slowed
      us down," Sancoff said of his personal multimillion-dollar backing
      of the Ghost. "Look at Silicon Valley and the most efficient way
      to develop new technology. We did this in a think tank environment
      just as companies like Apple do."<br>
      <br>
      Juliet Marine Systems created and built the Ghost prototypes in
      secrecy at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard with only 10 full-time
      engineers and scientists.<br>
      <br>
      The Ghost could have been deployed already if the federal
      government had not put a secrecy order in place for more than 18
      months on some of Juliet Marine's patents. Sancoff said this
      prevented extensive testing during that time because the craft
      couldn't be seen in public.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the delay, Sancoff has built it and the Navy and maritime
      industry have come to see it.<br>
      <br>
      What they are seeing is a very fast, fuel-efficient craft that can
      barely be detected by radar and can stay on patrol for a very long
      time (because it's now classified material, Sancoff can't say
      exactly how fast the craft can go and how long it can go between
      refueling its gas turbine jet engines.)<br>
      <br>
      It's fast because it has been designed to fly through an
      artificial underwater gaseous environment that creates 900 times
      less hull friction than water. Sancoff also said the Ghost has 22
      special systems that give the craft stability.<br>
      <br>
      Juliet Marine is currently in discussions with defense companies
      to implement an off-the-shelf weapons solution. In keeping with
      his entrepreneurial roots, Sancoff will not make it a overthought
      process.<br>
      <br>
      "We do not have to reinvent the wheel," he said. "There are
      several systems today that would provide ample power and fit the
      mission characteristics."<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">'Call to action'</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      During a recent visit to the Pentagon, a high-ranking naval
      research officer asked Sancoff, "Why did you do this?"<br>
      <br>
      For Sancoff, it was a decades-long journey of finding a solution
      and "giving something back to my country."<br>
      <br>
      The genesis, Sancoff explained, came in October 2000 when the
      naval destroyer USS Cole was attacked and 17 sailors killed by an
      explosive-laden small craft guided by al-Qaeda terrorists in
      Yemen. He became focused on a solution for fleet security from
      attacks that are akin to land-based IEDs, or improvised explosive
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, provided another burst of
      motivation. Finally, there was a major naval fleet exercise in
      2002 to determine security from small boat attacks. The exercise
      was code-named Juliet, which provided the name for Sancoff's
      company, and the result showed too many vulnerabilities.<br>
      <br>
      "This was my call to action," he said.<br>
      <br>
      He said he began to do voluminous research, and when he sold his
      Hampton-based company, Onux Medical, in 2004, it became his
      full-time quest to create a new type of company to work at rapid
      deployment speed.<br>
      <br>
      "My wife Jennifer talked about this extensively. The idea was so
      strong that we decided to go forward and develop these ideas,"
      Sancoff said about the decision to finance the multimillion-dollar
      startup with their money. "I have been very successful and wanted
      to give something back to my country."<br>
      <br>
      The company was officially started in late 2007, and major
      research and development began in 2008 after the space at
      Portsmouth Naval Shipyard was secured. "We have a very small team
      of people, and they are very smart at what they do. This has
      allowed us to have such a rapid turnaround time," Sancoff said.<br>
      <br>
      The company's board members include two retired U.S. Navy admirals
      and former U.S. Sen. John E. Sununu of New Hampshire. Sancoff said
      construction of the Ghost was enhanced by the work of many
      regional machine shops, and he believes the Seacoast region should
      become the site for manufacture of the Ghost and other
      marine-related systems.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, the company has begun to add its engineering and
      scientific staff in anticipation of both commercial and military
      contracts for the Ghost.<br>
      <br>
      "It's up to them (users) just how fast they want to adapt this new
      technology," Sancoff said. "We have been in discussions about
      making a 150-foot version. There are so many applications, even
      down to pleasure craft size. We plan to build a major company
      here."<br>

      [0007] The five above-identified patent applications are hereby
      incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0008] This invention relates to marine vessels in general, and
      more particularly to high-speed attack and reconnaissance craft.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0009] The terrorist attack on the guided missile destroyer USS
      Cole in Aden harbor in 2000 provided a devastating example of what
      a small group of terrorists can do to a modern warship with
      minimal resources-in the case of the USS Cole, two terrorists in a
      small boat carrying a few hundred pounds of explosives came close
      to sinking a billion dollar warship.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The success of the attack on the Cole has given rise to
      another, even more disturbing concern-that a large number of high
      speed boats, each packed with explosives and manned by suicide
      bombers, could create a "small boat swarm" which could overwhelm
      the defenses of a warship, particularly in restricted waters where
      reaction time and maneuverability may be limited. Indeed, recent
      wargame simulations suggest that such swarm tactics could prove
      extremely effective against naval battle groups operating in the
      narrow waters of the Persian Gulf.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] It is currently believed that such "small boat swarm"
      tactics are best countered with fast, similarly-sized,
      highly-maneuverable and heavily-armed attack craft which can
      establish a defensive perimeter at a safe distance from the naval
      battle group. To this end, appropriately-outfitted Zodiac-type
      craft have already been deployed for this purpose. However,
      experience has shown that Zodiac-type craft are only practical in
      the relatively calm waters of a harbor. This is because operating
      Zodiac-type craft at high speed in the turbulent waters of the
      open sea imposes excessive physical stresses on the crews that can
      only be withstood for short periods of time. Furthermore, the
      defensive perimeter should, ideally, be established at a
      substantial distance from the battle group (e.g., at least 10
      miles out), in order to give the battle group sufficient time to
      react in the event that any of the small boat swarm should
      penetrate the defensive perimeter established by the Zodiac-type
      craft. However, due to their light construction, limited operating
      time at high speeds, and limited fuel-carrying capacity,
      Zodiac-type craft are not capable of maintaining a reliable
      defensive perimeter so far out from the battle group. In practice,
      with Zodiac-type craft, the defensive perimeter must generally be
      maintained much closer to the battle group, with the consequent
      loss of reaction time.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] It has been suggested that attack helicopters might be used
      to protect a naval battle group when it is at sea or at anchor.
      However, attack helicopters generally have relatively limited
      range and, perhaps more importantly, relatively limited sortie
      time, which effectively prevents them from maintaining a reliable
      defensive perimeter a substantial distance out from the battle
      group. Furthermore, attack helicopters generally have substantial
      radar, infrared and visual "signatures", thereby making them
      relatively easy to detect and target.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Thus, there is a need for a new and improved fleet
      protection attack craft which can be used to maintain a defensive
      perimeter a safe distance out from a naval battle group. In this
      respect, it should be appreciated that such a craft should be
      small, fast, highly-maneuverable and heavily-armed. Furthermore,
      the craft should provide a stable platform even when running at
      high speed in substantial ocean swells, whereby to minimize
      physical stress on the crew and to provide a stable weapons
      platform. Further, the craft should be capable of remaining on
      station for a substantial period of time, in order to maintain a
      reliable defensive perimeter at a safe distance from the battle
      group.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] There is also a need for a new and improved craft which can
      be used for reconnaissance, and/or to deliver small teams of
      special forces behind enemy lines and/or to extract the same.
      Thus, the craft should also be capable of "stealth mode"
      operation, i.e., it should have small radar, infrared, visual and
      noise signatures, thereby making it difficult to detect and
      target.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0015] These and other objects of the present invention are
      addressed by the provision and use of a novel fleet protection
      attack craft. The novel attack craft is small, fast,
      highly-maneuverable and heavily-armed. The novel attack craft
      provides a stable platform even when running at high speed in
      substantial ocean swells, whereby to minimize physical stress on
      the crew and to provide a stable weapons platform. And the novel
      attack craft is capable of remaining on station for a substantial
      period of time, in order to maintain a reliable defensive
      perimeter at a safe distance from a naval battle group. Thus, the
      novel attack craft provides an effective means for defending
      against a "small boat swarm", by establishing a defensive
      perimeter at a safe distance from the battle group and thereby
      permitting the interception, identification, warning and, if
      ultimately necessary, destruction of hostile boats long before
      they can approach the battle group.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In addition, the novel attack craft is capable of "stealth
      mode" operation, i.e., it has small radar, infrared, visual and
      noise signatures, thereby making it difficult to detect and
      target. Thus, the novel attack craft also provides an effective
      means for conducting reconnaissance and/or for delivering small
      teams of special forces behind enemy lines and/or for extracting
      the same.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Overview</span><br>
      <br>
      [0173] Looking first at FIGS. 1-6, there is shown a novel fleet
      protection attack craft 5. The attack craft 5 generally comprises
      a command module 100 for carrying a crew, weapons and payload
      (including passengers), a pair of buoyant tubular foils (BTFs) 200
      for providing buoyancy, propulsion and steering, and a pair of
      struts 300 for supporting command module 100 on BTFs 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0174] As seen in FIGS. 4, 7 and 8, and as will hereinafter be
      discussed in further detail, struts 300 can be disposed in a
      variety of different positions vis-à-vis the command module 100,
      so that the attack craft 5 can assume a number of different
      configurations, depending on the desired mode of operation,
      whereby to provide high speed, extreme stability, and stealth
      capability.<br>
      <br>
      [0175] Thus, for example, in standard seas, attack craft 5 may be
      placed in the configuration shown in FIG. 4 (i.e., so that the
      struts 300 are disposed approximately 45 degrees off the horizon,
      and at approximately a right angle to one another) so that command
      module 100 is safely out of the water and the vessel has modest
      radar, infrared and visual signatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0176] However, in high seas, while operating at high speed,
      attack craft 5 can be placed in the configuration shown in FIG. 7
      (i.e., so that the struts 300 are disposed substantially
      perpendicular to the horizon, and substantially parallel to one
      another) so that the command module 100 stands well out of the
      water and is free from the affect of swells.<br>
      <br>
      [0177] Furthermore, depending on sea conditions, the attack craft
      5 can be in a configuration somewhere between those shown in FIGS.
      4 and 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0178] Attack craft 5 is also designed to operate in stealth mode,
      by lowering its physical profile. In this case, the attack craft 5
      can be placed in the configuration shown in FIG. 8 (i.e., so that
      struts 300 are disposed almost parallel to the horizon, and almost
      co-linear with one another) so that the command module 100 is
      disposed just above, or actually in, the water, reducing its
      radar, infrared and visual signatures. This mode can be very
      useful when the attack craft 5 is being used for reconnaissance
      purposes and/or to deliver small teams of special forces behind
      enemy lines and/or to extract the same.<br>
      <br>
      [0179] Thus, in one preferred form of the invention, the attack
      craft 5 is normally operated in the configuration shown in FIG. 4,
      with the command module 100 completely out of the water, but the
      command module being as low as possible so as to have a reduced
      profile. However, in high seas and at high speed, the attack craft
      5 may be operated in the configuration shown in FIG. 7, so that
      the command module 100 stands well clear of any swells. And, when
      desired, the attack craft 5 can be operated in the configuration
      shown in FIG. 8 so as to assume a stealth mode.<br>
      <br>
      [0180] Or, attack craft 5 can be operated in a selected
      configuration between those shown in FIGS. 4, 7 and 8.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Prior Art Designs for Achieving</span><span
        style="font-weight: bold;"> High Speed and/or Extreme Stability</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0181] There are currently two competing approaches for achieving
      high speed and/or high stability in a water craft. These are (i)
      the hydrofoil approach, which generally provides high speed; and
      (ii) the Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull (SWATH) approach, which
      generally provides high stability.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Hydrofoil Approach</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0182] Hydrofoils have been in experimental use for many years,
      and today are in active service around the world for a variety of
      applications. Hydrofoils generally employ small airplane-like
      wings ("lifting foils") which provide lift for the hull of the
      vessel. The lifting foils are typically lowered into the water
      while the vessel is underway. At higher speeds, the lifting foils
      are capable of lifting the hull of the vessel completely out of
      the water, thereby allowing the vessel to operate with only its
      lifting foils (and their supporting struts) in the water, whereby
      to minimize drag and increase vessel speed. However, the lifting
      foils themselves provide no buoyancy and therefore cannot support
      the vessel at slower speeds. Thus, the vessel can only operate in
      hydrofoil mode when moving at substantial speeds. In addition, due
      to the thin nature of the hydrofoil's lifting foils, it is not
      possible to house the vessel's engines within the lifting foils
      themselves-instead, it is necessary to house the engines within
      the hull of the vessel and to use transmission technologies (e.g.,
      mechanical, hydraulic and/or electrical means) to transfer power
      from the vessel's engines down to its lifting foils, which carry
      the propellers. However, these power transmission technologies all
      involve substantial losses in power (thereby necessitating the use
      of larger engines and/or resulting in lower speeds) and
      significantly complicate the propulsion system of the vessel.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The SWATH Approach</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0183] SWATH vessels employ two or more torpedo-shaped structures
      which are disposed underwater and attached to the main body of the
      vessel with fixed vertical struts. The torpedo-shaped structures
      provide buoyancy for the main body of the vessel, which remains
      completely out of the water. In this way, SWATH vessels resemble
      catamarans, except that the two pontoon hulls of the catamaran are
      replaced by underwater torpedo-shaped structures which reside
      immediately below the hull at the ends of the vertical struts. The
      SWATH design generally provides excellent stability because the
      underwater torpedo-shaped structures are less affected by wave
      action than a traditional wave-riding hull. However, the
      substantial skin friction, and the inefficient hydromantic shape
      of the large underwater torpedo-shaped structures, generally
      result in higher power consumption. This higher power consumption
      in turn necessitates the use of larger engines and/or results in
      reduced vessel speed. However, the use of larger engines is itself
      problematic, since the engines must then be housed in the hull or,
      if the engines are to be housed in the underwater torpedo-shaped
      structures, the underwater torpedo-shaped structures must be
      enlarged. Housing the engines in the hull introduces all of the
      power transmission problems discussed above with respect to
      hydrofoils, inasmuch as the propellers are mounted to the
      underwater torpedo-shaped structures. Conversely, enlarging the
      underwater torpedo-shaped structures increases skin friction
      problems, and inefficient hydromantic shape problems, discussed
      above-which in turn necessitates the use of even larger engines.
      For this reason, it has previously been impossible to build a
      small, high-speed SWATH vessel. In addition to the foregoing, the
      SWATH design typically requires a high profile in order to ensure
      that the hull of the vessel remains completely out of water,
      particularly in high seas. This gives the SWATH vessel larger
      radar, infrared and visual signatures, thereby making it easy to
      detect and target.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Novel Approach for Achieving</span><span
        style="font-weight: bold;"> High Speed and Extreme Stability</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0184] The present invention overcomes the problems associated
      with the prior art through the provision and use of novel fleet
      protection attack craft 5. Attack craft 5 supports a command
      module 100 on a pair of buoyant tubular foils (BTFs) 200 via
      movable struts 300. BTFs 200 normally provide all of the buoyancy
      required for the craft, with command module 100 remaining
      completely out of the water. More particularly, BTFs 200 and
      struts 300 are often the only portions of the craft which contact
      the water, and they provide low friction hydromantic
      cross-sections so as to minimize water resistance. Significantly,
      BTFs 200 house substantially all of the propulsion, fuel and
      steering systems for the craft, thereby providing the craft with
      an unusually low center of gravity and permitting the volume of
      command module 100 to be dedicated to crew, weapons and payload.
      Furthermore, struts 300 are movable relative to command module
      100, thereby permitting the craft to assume a number of different
      configurations. This unique approach results in a craft with
      unparalleled speed and stability regardless of sea conditions, and
      with lower radar, infrared and visual signatures, thereby making
      it difficult to detect and target. Various aspects of the craft
      will now be discussed in further detail.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Module 100</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0185] Referring to FIGS. 1-9, command module 100 generally
      comprises a watertight enclosure 105 (FIG. 3) having a hull-like
      bottom surface 110 (FIGS. 4, 5, 7 and 8). Command module 100
      includes a cockpit 115 (FIGS. 2, 3, 6 and 8) for housing a pilot
      and weapons officer, and a bay 120 (FIG. 9) for housing weapons
      and payload (including passengers). Command module 100 further
      includes a rear hatch 125 (FIGS. 5, 6 and 9) for permitting entry
      and exit of crew, weapons and payload (including passengers), and
      a top hatch 130 (FIGS. 2, 6 and 9) for permitting various weapons
      systems to be raised out of the bay 120, fired, and then lowered
      back into the bay 120.<br>
      <br>
      [0186] Command module 100 is armored to protect all occupants,
      weaponry and payload. Windscreens 135 (FIGS. 7 and 9) are formed
      of bullet-resistant materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0187] Command module 100 comprises watertight bulkhead enclosures
      which, combined with hull-like bottom surface 110, allow waves to
      wash over the command module without effect when the attack craft
      5 is operating in its stealth mode (see below). Automatic vent
      doors seal any open systems against water leakage when attack
      craft 5 is in the stealth mode.<br>
      <br>
      [0188] The outer structure of the command module 100 is preferably
      based on so-called "stealth" principals in order to minimize the
      radar signature of the craft. More particularly, the outer surface
      of the command module 100 is designed to deflect radar energy and
      return only a minimal amount of radar energy to the radar
      transmitter. To this end, the exterior surfaces of command module
      100 are preferably highly angular, with the angles being selected
      so as to reflect the radar energy either downward towards the
      water or upward into the sky. In any case, the exterior surfaces
      of the command module 100 minimize the amount of radar energy
      reflected directly back to the sender. Furthermore, the command
      module 100 preferably incorporates a radar-absorbent paint which
      is capable of absorbing or further reducing any incident radar
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0189] Command module 100 is also configured to house all of the
      control systems for piloting the attack craft, all of the weapons
      control systems for operating the weapons carried by the attack
      craft, an auxiliary generator for supplemental power requirements
      (e.g., for navigation), a battery charger, an air filtration
      system, a head, a sink, an air compressor, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0190] The weapons systems carried by attack craft 5 preferably
      comprise (i) one 20 mm Vulcan Gatling gun, equipped with optic and
      night vision; (ii) two 30 caliber Miniguns equipped with optic and
      night vision; (iii) one or more 2.5 inch laser-guided rockets; and
      (iv) 8 "mini" torpedoes. Preferably, the Gatling gun, Miniguns and
      rockets are housed within bay 120 for elevated deployment through
      the top hatch 130, and the "mini" torpedoes are mounted to the
      exterior of the command module 100, e.g., such as is shown at 140.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Buoyant Tubular Foils (BTFs) 200</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0191] Referring next to FIGS. 10-15, a pair of the buoyant
      tubular foils (BTFs) 200 provide buoyancy, propulsion and steering
      for the attack craft 5. Each of the BTFs 200 generally comprises a
      hollow tubular structure 205 which houses an engine 210 for
      powering a propeller system 215, a fuel tank 220 for supplying
      fuel to engine 210, and steering elements (or spoilers) 225 for
      steering the attack craft 5.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hollow Tubular Structure 205</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0192] Hollow tubular structure 205 generally comprises a hollow
      hull which provides buoyancy for the attack craft 5. Hollow
      tubular structure 205 is configured to provide stability at low
      speed operations while still providing low water friction and an
      improved hydromantic profile to enable speeds of over eighty
      knots. At high speeds, the configuration of the hollow tubular
      structure 205 provides extraordinary stability for the vessel, due
      to the flow of water over the elongated tubular structure 205.<br>
      <br>
      [0193] More particularly, the low friction hydromantic
      cross-section of hollow tubular structure 205 traverses water with
      the lowest possible skin friction forces and the best hydromantic
      shape obtainable, yet still houses the engine 210 and the fuel
      tank 220, and supports the propeller system 215 and steering
      elements 225. It has been determined that best performance is
      achieved where the hollow tubular structure 205 has a
      cross-section which is between about 1/10 and about 1/30 of the
      length of hollow tubular structure 205, and preferably about 1/20
      of the length of the hollow tubular structure. By way of example,
      but not limitation, excellent performance can be achieved when the
      hollow tubular structure 205 has a 3 foot outer diameter and a 60
      foot length.<br>
      <br>
      [0194] As seen in FIGS. 12-15, the hollow tubular structure 205
      comprises a plurality of disconnectable sections that permit easy
      access to components disposed within the interior of the hollow
      tubular structure 205, e.g., for maintenance and quick replacement
      of power and sensor modules. By way of example, but not
      limitation, the hollow tubular structure 205 can comprise a center
      section 230 which is mounted to a strut 300, a forward section 235
      which is dismountable from the center section 230, and a rear
      section 240 which is dismountable from the center section 230.
      Preferably, interior components are equipped with slides for easy
      entry into, and removal from, the hollow tubular structure 205. By
      way of example, but not limitation, FIG. 14 shows how the engine
      210 may be equipped with slides 245 for supporting the engine 210
      within the hollow tubular section 205, and to facilitate insertion
      into, and removal from, the hollow tubular structure 205.<br>
      <br>
      [0195] The forward section 235 and the rear section 240 can mount
      to the center section 230 in a variety of ways. By way of example,
      but not limitation, the sections can be mechanically held together
      (e.g., by hydraulics, power screw actions, etc.) or they can twist
      lock together (e.g., in the manner of a bayonet-type mount). A
      watertight seal is provided between the sections so as to ensure
      hull integrity. The seal can be a continuous circular shape to
      match the cross-section of the hollow tubular structure 205, e.g.,
      a resilient O-ring having a round or flat cross-section.
      Alternatively, the O-ring can be an inflatable seal (e.g., like
      the inner tube of a bicycle tire) that can provide adjustable
      sealing forces by the injection of an appropriate amount of fluid
      (e.g., gas or liquid). Preferably, each O-ring seal has two
      sealing surfaces, i.e., the face surface between adjacent sections
      and the face surface against the skin of the hollow tubular
      structure 205.<br>
      <br>
      [0196] The ability to quickly unlock the various sections of the
      hollow tubular structure 205 permits the rapid servicing and/or
      replacement of the various components contained within the hollow
      tubular structure 205, e.g., engine 210, fuel tank 220, etc.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gas Turbine (Jet) Engine
        Propulsion</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0197] The engine 210 can be a conventional diesel engine,
      internal combustion engine, rotary engine, electric motor, etc.
      Preferably, however, the engine 210 comprises a gas turbine (jet)
      engine, e.g., of the sort used in aircraft, and particularly of
      the sort used in helicopters. A gas turbine engine is preferred
      due to its high power, small size and low weight. More
      particularly, a gas turbine engine typically has a
      horsepower-to-weight ratio of about 2.5 horsepower (HP) per pound.
      By comparison, a modern marine diesel engine typically has a
      horsepower-to-weight ratio of about 0.5 HP per pound. Inasmuch as
      there is generally a direct correlation between vessel
      acceleration and weight, it is generally desirable to use a high
      power, low weight engine in a high speed craft. Thus, a gas
      turbine engine is the preferred propulsion unit for the attack
      craft 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0198] Significantly, a gas turbine engine is also ideal for use
      in the attack craft 5 inasmuch as its size and configuration are
      perfectly suited for disposition within the hollow tubular
      structure 205. More particularly, gas turbine engines typically
      have an elongated, somewhat cylindrical configuration which easily
      fits within a hollow tubular structure. Significantly, gas turbine
      engines generally have relatively modest cross-sections, such that
      the gas turbine engines fit within a relatively small diameter
      tube. By way of example, but not limitation, the T53L13 gas
      turbine (jet) engine manufactured by Lycoming Engines (a division
      of Avco Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Textron, Inc.)
      of Williamsport, Pa. has a diameter which is ideally suited for
      disposition within the hollow tubular structure 205 of the attack
      craft 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0199] The use of a gas turbine engine in BTFs 200 also provides
      significant additional advantages.<br>
      <br>
      [0200] First, the use of a gas turbine engine in each BTF 200
      easily allows for the use of a centerline drive shaft to transfer
      power to the propeller system 215. This is an enormous advantage
      when it comes to efficiently delivering large amounts of power to
      the propeller system 215.<br>
      <br>
      [0201] Second, a gas turbine engine provides a starter generator
      that performs two functions, i.e., (i) to start the turbine
      engine, and (ii) to generate DC power. More particularly, most gas
      turbine engines provide 24 volts DC at 300 amps. This allows the
      attack craft 5 to power all of its electrical systems from the gas
      turbine engines, with the need for only a small supplemental
      generator for charging batteries.<br>
      <br>
      [0202] In addition, placing a gas turbine engine inside the hollow
      tubular structure 205, which is underwater, also provides superior
      cooling for the gas turbine engine since the radiated engine heat
      is transferred to the surrounding water through the skin of the
      hollow tubular structure 205.<br>
      <br>
      [0203] Furthermore, gas turbine engines are generally designed to
      be quickly and easily removed (e.g., by sliding) from an aircraft
      fuselage. Similarly, the gas turbine engine can be quickly and
      easily removed (e.g., by sliding) from the hollow tubular
      structure 205.<br>
      <br>
      [0204] The gas turbine engine usually has a high internal rpm
      (greater than 19,000 rpm) with internal gear reductions.
      Preferably, a gearbox 250 using planetary gears connects the
      engine 210 to the propeller system 215. This approach provides a
      gearbox which is smaller than the outside diameter of the gas
      turbine engine.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gas Turbine (Jet) Engine Intake
        And Exhaust</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0205] The "Achilles heel" of a gas turbine engine is its need to
      rapidly intake large quantities of fresh air and to rapidly expel
      large quantities of exhaust air. As a result of this need to
      rapidly move large quantities of air in and out of the gas turbine
      engine, gas turbine engines have not heretofore been a candidate
      for use in underwater structures (e.g., submarines and the
      submerged portions of SWATH vessels) due to the inability to
      adequately aspirate the jet engines.<br>
      <br>
      [0206] A critical aspect of the attack craft 5 is the air intake
      and exhaust systems which support the use of gas turbine engines
      underwater. In this respect, it will be appreciated that the
      design of the air intake and exhaust systems is complicated by the
      fact that attack craft 5 is designed to change configurations
      (e.g., as shown in FIGS. 4, 7 and 8) and the air intake and
      exhaust systems must be able to accommodate these configuration
      changes. More particularly, in attack craft 5, the gas turbine
      engines are housed underwater in BTFs 200, the BTFs 200 are
      disposed at the ends of struts 300, and struts 300 are movable
      relative to command module 100 (see FIGS. 4, 7 and 8). Thus, the
      air intake and exhaust systems of the attack craft 5 must be
      capable of rapidly moving large quantities of air in and out of
      the gas turbine engines, and through the struts 300, while at the
      same time accommodating movement of the struts 300 relative to the
      command module 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0207] To this end, the attack craft 5 comprises an air intake and
      exhaust system for rapidly delivering large quantities of fresh
      air to the gas turbine engine 210 and for rapidly expelling large
      quantities of exhaust air from the gas turbine engine 210. The air
      intake and exhaust system generally comprises an engine intake
      duct 255 and an engine exhaust duct 260. The intake side of the
      engine intake duct 255 is disposed in the command module 100 so
      that it can access cool air, which increases the efficiency of the
      gas turbine engines 210. Preferably, the intake side of the engine
      intake duct 255 is funneled so as to generate ram air forces while
      the attack craft 5 is moving at speed, which further increases the
      efficiency of the gas turbine engines 210. The outlet side of the
      engine exhaust duct 260 is disposed in the command module 100 so
      as to provide efficient exhaust venting with a minimal heat
      signature. Engine intake duct 255 and engine exhaust duct 260
      preferably pass through a flexible coupling located at a junction
      of the strut and the command module, in order to accommodate
      movement of the strut vis-à-vis the command module. This flexible
      coupling also accommodates other lines passing from the command
      module 100 to the BTFs 200 via the struts 300, e.g., fuel re-fill
      lines, electrical power lines, electrical control lines, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0208] It should be appreciated that the flexible coupling is
      configured so as to allow engine intake and engine exhaust to be
      vectored and bent while still accommodating the large gas volumes
      associated with the gas turbine engine. Furthermore, the flexible
      coupling is designed to accommodate high exhaust temperatures
      created by the gas turbine engine. The use of heat-resistant
      flexible materials in the coupling is essential to allow movement
      of the struts relative to the command module.<br>
      <br>
      [0209] It should also be appreciated that moving large quantities
      of air through a narrow strut (which is thinner than BTF 200)
      entails using substantially the entire inner structure of the
      strut as an air intake duct and an engine exhaust duct. In one
      preferred form of the invention, the engine exhaust duct 260 is
      routed inside the air intake duct 255 so as to allow the exhaust
      to be cooled by the intake air, whereby to provide a lower thermal
      signature for the attack craft 5. In another preferred form of the
      invention, the engine exhaust duct 260 is not routed inside air
      intake duct 255-rather, in this form of the invention, engine
      exhaust duct 260 is separate from the air intake duct 255, and the
      exhaust in engine exhaust duct 260 is separately cooled, e.g.,
      with a water cooling jacket. Furthermore, in this form of the
      invention, insulation may be used to keep the cool air in the air
      intake duct 255 from being heated by the hot exhaust in the engine
      exhaust duct 260 in order to increase the efficiency of the gas
      turbine engines 210.<br>
      <br>
      [0210] Preferably, the engine exhaust duct 260 includes insulation
      to prevent heat of the gas turbine engine 210 from overheating the
      outer skin of the strut 300.<br>
      <br>
      [0211] In one form of the present invention, the engine exhaust
      ducts 260 are double-walled, so as to allow a fluid to be
      circulated around the inner hot duct, whereby to further cool the
      engine exhaust and provide a lower thermal signature.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Attack Craft Propulsion Using
        Battery Power</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0212] Preferably, the attack craft 5 also includes an electric
      motor (not shown) and batteries (not shown) for selectively
      driving the propeller system 215. More particularly, in certain
      circumstances (e.g., reconnaissance operations and the delivery
      and/or extraction of special forces) it may be desirable to
      operate with reduced noise. In these circumstances, the electric
      motor and batteries may be used in place of the gas turbine (jet)
      engine discussed above.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Propeller System 215</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0213] Most vessels in use today utilize propellers which are
      disposed at the stern of the vessel and push the vessel through
      the water. This approach is generally satisfactory for most
      vessels. However, stern-mounted, pushing propellers are generally
      not satisfactory for those vessels which are trying to achieve
      very high speeds, e.g., speeds in excess of 80 knots. This is
      because propellers located at the stern of the vessel engage water
      which has been agitated by the prior passage of the vessel through
      the water. Since the efficiency of propellers is highly affected
      by the state of the water the propellers move through,
      stern-mounted, pushing propellers are generally impractical for
      high speed craft.<br>
      <br>
      [0214] Some high speed boats in use today (e.g., hydroplanes and
      ocean racing boats) use stern-mounted, surface-penetrating,
      forward-facing propellers that ride partially submerged in
      agitated water with air mixed in. These piercing propellers are
      designed with a heavy trailing edge and anti-cavitation cupping.
      These piercing propellers withstand the extreme forces of high
      horsepower and high rpm because the propeller is never fully
      engaged in the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0215] However, this type of propeller would not be effective for
      the attack craft 5, since with BTF 200, the propeller system 215
      must be fully submerged.<br>
      <br>
      [0216] Significantly, the present invention utilizes a propeller
      system 215 which comprises a pair of forward-facing, pulling,
      counter-rotating propellers 265, 270 located at the bow end of
      each BTF 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0217] More particularly, a propeller system 215 is placed at the
      bow of each BTF 200 so that the forward-facing, pulling propellers
      can "bite" into virgin water, whereby to obtain maximum
      efficiency. Furthermore, each propeller system 215 comprises two
      propellers, a leading propeller 265 and a trailing propeller 270,
      operated in a timed, counter-rotating mode, so as to provide
      reduced cavitation for the forward propeller. Leading propeller
      265 is the main propulsion element and does the majority of the
      work of pulling of the vessel. Trailing propeller 270 spins in the
      opposite direction from the leading propeller and evacuates water
      from behind the leading propeller, thereby permitting the leading
      propeller to work with maximum efficiency. Thus, trailing
      propeller 270 moves water out from behind leading propeller 265 so
      that the leading propeller can pull more water in. This provides
      increased propeller efficiency, which translates into higher speed
      and lower fuel consumption.<br>
      <br>
      [0218] Using the serially-mounted, counter-rotating propellers
      265, 270 also permits smaller propeller diameters to be used. This
      is because the surface areas of the two propellers combine to
      provide an overall effective surface area which is equivalent to
      the surface area of a single, larger diameter propeller. However,
      it is difficult to rotate a large diameter propeller at high
      speeds due to the forces involved. Thus, the use of
      serially-mounted, counter-rotating propellers permits the
      propellers to be rotated at higher rpms, thereby permitting higher
      speeds to be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0219] In addition to the foregoing, by using two counter-rotating
      propellers, there is no side torque. More particularly, side
      torque in propellers is the result of the centrifugal forces
      created by the rotation of the propeller. This side torque creates
      a tendency for the vessel to turn in the direction of the rotation
      of the blade. Side torque is not desired with attack craft 5,
      since it involves a loss of energy and can create steering issues
      for the vessel.<br>
      <br>
      [0220] The gearbox 250 connects the gas turbine engine 210 to the
      propeller system 215. More particularly, the gearbox 250 is
      configured to convert the single rotational motion of the output
      shaft of the gas turbine engine 210 into the dual, co-axial,
      counter-rotational motions needed to drive the counter-rotating
      propellers, 265, 270.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Super-Cavitation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0221] By placing the counter-rotating propellers 265, 270 on the
      forward end of BTFs 200, the propellers are able to pull the
      vessel through clean, undisturbed, virgin water, thereby ensuring
      optimal propeller performance. In addition, by placing the two
      serially-mounted, counter-rotating propellers on the fount end of
      BTFs 200, attack craft 5 is able to generate a highly gaseous
      environment, comprising a jet stream of dense collapsing bubbles
      that encapsulate BTFs 200 and significantly reduce vessel drag.
      More particularly, the actions of the propellers 265, 270, working
      together, pull water through the leading propeller 265 and allow
      the trailing propeller 270 to heavily cavitate the rapidly moving
      water and create a heavy stream of gaseous bubbles which surround
      the outer surfaces of BTFs 200. This gaseous envelope reduces hull
      drag and greatly increases the speed of the vessel, since the BTFs
      are essentially "flying through bubbles". See FIG. 15A. In this
      respect it should be appreciated that the kinetic coefficient of
      friction with air is approximately 1/800th the kinetic coefficient
      of friction of water. Furthermore, the faster the vessel goes, the
      greater the reduction in hull friction, inasmuch as (i) a greater
      quantity of gaseous bubbles are created by the serially-mounted,
      counter-rotating propellers, and (ii) the bubbles do not have time
      to collapse before BTFs 200 have passed completely through them.<br>
      <br>
      [0222] Attack craft 5 can also include additional means for
      producing an encompassing gaseous envelope. More particularly, a
      plurality of small holes 275 (FIG. 15B) are preferably located
      immediately behind trailing propeller 270 and disposed in a
      circler fashion about the periphery of the BTF structure. The
      holes 275 are in communication with ductwork leading to the
      outside air, allowing the trailing propeller to create a siphon
      effect, drawing air down for release just aft of the trailing
      propeller, whereby to create an even more dense gaseous envelope
      for reducing BTF friction. Alternatively, a pressurized gas source
      connected to the small holes 275 can also be used to release gas
      immediately aft of the trailing propeller, whereby to create the
      desired gaseous envelope for reducing BTF friction.<br>
      <br>
      [0223] In yet another form of the invention, a supply of
      friction-reducing fluid (e.g., detergent) can be connected to the
      aforementioned small holes 275, whereby to create the desired
      friction-reducing envelope about BTFs 200.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rudderless System</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0224] Conventional rudders are continuously deployed in the
      water, so that they create friction and drag not only when being
      manipulated so as to change the direction of the vessel, but also
      under normal operating conditions. This friction and drag has a
      substantial detrimental effect on the speed of the vessel.<br>
      <br>
      [0225] In contrast, and looking now at FIGS. 16-26, attack craft 5
      provides forward and aft steering elements (or spoilers) 225 that
      are projectable from, and retractable into, the outer skin of
      hollow tubular structure 205. In this respect it should be
      appreciated that each of the spoilers 225 can be projected an
      adjustable amount outboard from hollow tubular structure 205.
      Furthermore, command module 100 can be provided with various
      control systems which permit each of the spoilers 225 to be
      operated in a coordinated fashion or, if desired, independently
      from one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0226] In one preferred form of the invention, sixteen spoilers
      225 are provided: four spoilers 225 at the front of each BTF 200
      and four spoilers 225 at the rear of each BTF 200, with spoilers
      225 being disposed at the "12 o'clock", "3 o'clock", "6 o'clock",
      and "9 o'clock" positions. This arrangement allows spoilers 225 to
      apply left, right, up and/or down forces (or any combination
      thereof) to the front and/or rear of each of the BTFs 200 while
      attack craft 5 is underway.<br>
      <br>
      [0227] Spoilers 225 provide numerous significant advantages over
      conventional rudders.<br>
      <br>
      [0228] For one thing, spoilers 225 provide substantially no drag
      when the vessel is underway and no directional changes are
      needed-this is because the spoilers then reside flush with the
      outer skins of the hollow tubular structures 205. Spoilers 225
      impose drag on the vessel only when they are extended outwardly
      from the skins of the hollow tubular structures 205, whereby to
      provide the forces necessary to maneuver the vessel-and they are
      thereafter returned to their inboard (i.e., flush, and no-drag)
      positions as soon as the maneuver is completed and the vessel
      returns to standard forward motion.<br>
      <br>
      [0229] Additionally, and significantly, the provision of the
      spoilers 225 on the fore and aft portions of hollow tubular
      structures 205 permits the application of more dramatic turning
      forces. More particularly, by setting a fore spoiler to turn in
      one direction and a corresponding aft spoiler to turn in the
      opposite direction, significant turning forces can be quickly and
      easily applied to the vessel using spoilers of relatively modest
      size. Thus, course corrections can be effected quickly, making the
      vessel extremely agile, while permitting the turning friction of
      the spoilers to be applied only for short durations.<br>
      <br>
      [0230] Spoilers 225 can be used for turning left or right (see
      FIGS. 16-19), for adjusting the trim (i.e., the up/down attitude)
      of the vessel (see FIGS. 20-23), and/or to enhance deceleration of
      the vessel (see FIGS. 24-26).<br>
      <br>
      [0231] Spoilers 225 can be flush plates that protrude from the
      outer skins of the hollow tubular structures 205 and cause
      friction when needed to change direction. Alternatively, the
      spoilers 225 can be made of an elastomeric material that can be
      inflated with air, fluids, etc. and which protrude from the outer
      skins of the hollow tubular structures 205.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fuel Tanks 220</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0232] Fuel tanks 220 are housed inside BTFs 200, preferably in
      the center section 230. Fuel tanks 220 preferably comprise
      double-walled tanks made of a flexible bladder material (e.g., a
      flexible bladder disposed inside another flexible bladder). This
      arrangement allows for a fluid (e.g., seawater) to be pumped into
      the outer bladder in order to compensate for the consumption of
      fuel from within the inside bladder, thereby ensuring that the
      buoyancy of the attack craft remains constant.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Center of Gravity</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0233] The center of gravity for the attack craft 5 is intended to
      be as low as possible, in order to maximize vessel stability. This
      is achieved by positioning heavy components such as the engines
      210 and the fuel tanks 220 within the BTFs, thereby lowering the
      vessel's center of gravity so as to be as close as possible to the
      midline of the BTFs. In this respect, it will be appreciated that
      turbine engines 210 and fuel tanks 220 constitute approximately
      [2/3] of the total vessel weight and, due to the construction of
      the attack craft 5, this weight is disposed entirely below the
      waterline. This leads to enhanced vessel stability.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Connecting Struts 300</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0234] As noted above, the connecting struts 300 attach BTFs 200
      to the command module 100. As also noted above, the struts 300 are
      designed to be fixed to the BTFs 200 and pivot on the command
      module 100 to allow attack craft 5 to assume different
      configurations (FIGS. 4, 7 and 8), whereby to permit the command
      module 100 to sit different distances from the water. As seen in
      FIGS. 27-36, the struts 300 comprise hydraulic or electric jack
      screws 305 connected to load arms located within struts 300,
      whereby to move struts 300 relative to command module 100. In this
      respect, it will be appreciated that FIGS. 27-29 show struts 300
      in a position corresponding to the attack craft configuration
      shown in FIG. 4. FIGS. 30-32 show the struts 300 in a position
      corresponding to the attack craft configuration shown in FIG. 7,
      and FIGS. 33-36 show struts 300 in a position corresponding to the
      attack craft configuration shown in FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0235] Since struts 300 extend into the water, it is important to
      keep the struts as thin as possible so as to minimize drag.<br>
      <br>
      [0236] It should also be appreciated that the structural integrity
      of the struts 300 relies primarily on the strength of the load
      arms located within the struts acting in conjunction with the
      outer skin of the struts, while using minimal internal frames.
      This is important, since the struts 300 need to have large areas
      of uninterrupted volume in order to permit engine intake to pass
      uninterrupted through the interior of the struts.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fly-by-Wire Controls</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0237] In one preferred form of the invention, sensors are located
      on the hull-like bottom surface 110 of the command module 100 and
      continuously measure the distance of the command module from the
      water surface. A computer automatically adjusts the disposition of
      the struts 300 so as to maintain the command module a desired
      distance above the water surface. In this respect, it will be
      appreciated that, particularly when the attack craft 5 is
      operating at high speeds (e.g., 80 knots) in open water, it is
      important to keep the command module 100 from coming into contact
      with the surface of the water (and particularly important to keep
      the command module 100 from coming into contact with the irregular
      sea swells commonly found in the open sea).<br>
      <br>
      [0238] Thus, for example, in standard seas, the attack craft 5 can
      be placed in the configuration shown in FIG. 4, so that the
      command module 100 is safely out of the water and the vessel has
      modest radar, infrared and visual signatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0239] However, in high seas, while operating at high speed, the
      attack craft 5 can be placed in the configuration shown in FIG. 7
      so that the command module 100 stands well out of the water and is
      free from the affect of swells.<br>
      <br>
      [0240] Furthermore, depending on sea conditions, the attack craft
      5 could be in a configuration somewhere between those shown in
      FIGS. 4 and 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0241] Attack craft 5 is also designed to operate in stealth mode,
      by lowering its physical profile. In this case, the attack craft 5
      can be placed in the configuration shown in FIG. 8, so that the
      command module 100 sits just above, or actually in, the water,
      reducing its radar, infrared and visual signatures. This mode can
      be very useful when the attack craft 5 is being used for
      reconnaissance purposes and/or to deliver small teams of special
      forces behind enemy lines and/or to extract the same.<br>
      <br>
      [0242] Thus, in one preferred form of the invention, the attack
      craft 5 is normally operated in the configuration shown in FIG. 4,
      with the command module 100 completely out of the water, but the
      command module being as low as possible so as to have a reduced
      profile. However, in high seas and at high speed, the attack craft
      5 may be operated in the configuration shown in FIG. 7, so that
      the command module 100 stands well clear of any swells. And, when
      desired, the attack craft 5 can be operated in the configuration
      shown in FIG. 8 so as to assume a stealth mode.<br>
      <br>
      [0243] Or, the attack craft 5 can be operated in a configuration
      somewhere between those shown in FIGS. 4, 7 and 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0244] Preferably, speed sensors feed speed data to a main
      computer, which adjusts the sensitivity of the steering controls
      so that, while travelling at low speeds, the controls are more
      reactive and when travelling at high speeds, the controls are less
      reactive. In other words, the main computer preferably adjusts the
      sensitivity of the steering controls so that (i) large movements
      of the steering controls (e.g., a joystick) are required at high
      speeds to make modest changes in the disposition of the spoilers
      225, and (ii) small movements of the steering controls are
      required at slow speeds to make significant changes in the
      disposition of the spoilers 225. This construction eliminates the
      possibility that a modest movement of the controls at high speed
      will result in a catastrophic change in the direction or attitude
      of the craft.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Extendable BTF Boom</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0245] If desired, BTFs 200 can be provided with an extendible
      boom. This boom is deployable from the after end of the BTF, and
      is preferably flexible. The extendible boom can serve two
      purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0246] First, the extendible boom can have controllable surface
      protrusions along its length that can be enlarged or contracted so
      as to allow drag to be applied to the boom, thus further
      stabilizing the BTF in a manner similar to the tail of a kite. The
      protrusions cause drag that stabilizes the vessel in both the
      horizontal and vertical planes. The protrusions can be controlled
      by elastic bladders which are inflated so as to increase size (and
      hence drag) as desired, or a mechanical device located at the end
      of the boom that provides mechanical drag resistance, thereby
      increasing stability.<br>
      <br>
      [0247] Second, the extendible boom can also house sonar, listening
      devices, magnetometers, gravity interruption sensors, etc. that
      can be used for the identification of submerged objects. By
      mounting these devices on the end of an extendible boom, the
      devices can be isolated from the remainder of attack craft 5, so
      as to minimize interference with device function.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Super-Cavitating Air Channels:
        "Air Trap Fins"</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0248] As described above, the present invention comprises a high
      speed SWATH boat with pontoon-type underwater hull friction
      reduction. Creating an air skirt around the hull of the buoyant
      tubular foil (i.e., by propeller-generated supercavitation and by
      injecting air through the hull and into the flow of water)
      displaces water from around the hull, allowing air to come into
      contact with the hull. Water has 800 to 1000 times more friction
      than air, so the air skirt dramatically reduces friction as the
      hull moves.<br>
      <br>
      [0249] It is advantageous to keep the air bubbles traveling
      horizontally along the hull as much as possible, so as to decrease
      surface friction. Ideally, air needs to be maintained about the
      hull so as to act like a cushion and friction reduction means. At
      50 knots, a 60 foot long structure passes through the bubble
      region in one second, so it is important to keep the air against
      the hull-even a 1/10 second increase in bubble life results in
      substantial friction reduction for the buoyant tubular foil. The
      following are various ways to do this:<br>
      <br>
      [0250] 1. The hull is provided with many air outlet holes 310
      located horizontally along the tubular foil 200, providing a
      plurality of horizontal air outlet channels.<br>
      <br>
      [0251] 2. The hull is provided with long horizontal air trap fins
      315 that allow air to be channeled along the length of the hull
      and not allow all the air to immediately escape outwardly and off
      the hull.<br>
      <br>
      [0252] 3. The air trap fins 315 may be contoured (FIG. 37) so as
      to force the air bubbles to follow a tortuous path to escape from
      the hull.<br>
      <br>
      [0253] 4. The air trap fins 315 may be disposed in a spiral around
      the hull in a helical manner, e.g., like a screw (FIG. 37), so as
      to allow air to be trapped and constrained against the hull as the
      air bubbles defuse along the channel.<br>
      <br>
      [0254] 5. The air trap fins 315 may be of a scallop-type design
      (FIG. 37), providing air channels adjacent the hull of the buoyant
      tubular foil.<br>
      <br>
      [0255] 6. The air trap fins 315 provide a water flow boundary
      around the circumference of the underwater hull (FIGS. 37B and
      37C), providing a decrease in water density around the boundary
      water layer, from dense water to an air and water mixture. The
      height of the mechanical air trap fins 315 determines the water
      density boundary layer. The height of the fins 315 can be
      proportionally adjusted depending on the length of the hull.<br>
      <br>
      [0256] 7. The air trap fins 315 run for a portion or an entirety
      of the length of the hull and may be radially distributed on all
      surfaces (FIGS. 37B and 37C).<br>
      <br>
      [0257] 8. The air trap fins 315 may be radially distributed,
      except for the [1/4] to [1/2] bottom section of the underside of
      the hull (FIGS. 37 and 37D), in order to allow the bottom of the
      hull to ride on dense water and the remaining hull surfaces to be
      in an air/water bubbles stream. This provides better stability for
      the craft, due to the lack of compressibility of dense water
      supporting the craft.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Single Propeller Cavitation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0258] In an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 38, the marine
      vessel propeller system comprises a single propeller 530 placed at
      the bow of a buoyant tubular foil 500. The propeller 530 is sized
      and configured such that in operation the propeller creates and
      dispenses rearwardly a stream of supercavitated water which
      envelopes the marine vessel, which preferably is provided with air
      trap fins, as previously described, and operative to prevent
      immediate escape of the supercavitated water from the foil 500.
      Again, steering may be provided by spoilers as previously
      disclosed herein or, alternatively, rudders as shown in FIG. 38.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Submarine or Torpedo Embodiment</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0259] In the foregoing disclosure, there is disclosed a novel
      fleet protection attack craft 5 which generally comprises a
      command module 100 for carrying crew, weapons and payload
      (including passengers), a pair of buoyant tubular foils (BTFs) 200
      for providing buoyancy, propulsion and steering, and a pair of
      struts 300 for supporting command module 100 on BTFs 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0260] It is further within the scope of the invention to provide
      a novel submersible water craft, such as a submarine and/or a
      torpedo and/or an unmanned drone, which utilizes a single buoyant
      tubular foil, generally of the sort disclosed above, as the body
      of the submersible water craft (e.g., submarine, torpedo, unmanned
      drone, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      [0261] In one form of the invention, and referring to FIG. 39, a
      single buoyant tubular foil, such as a body 500 of a torpedo, may
      be provided with a warhead 510 (e.g., detonator and high
      explosives) and provides for buoyancy (including negative buoyancy
      where desired), propulsion and steering 515, as is known in the
      art. More particularly, in this form of the invention, buoyancy is
      preferably provided by ballast tanks 520 contained within the body
      500 of the torpedo. Propulsion is provided by at least one
      front-pulling propeller 530 of the sort disclosed above, and an
      electric motor contained within the body 500 of the torpedo, with
      the front-pulling propeller or propellers 530 providing an air
      skirt (supercavitation) around the body 500 of the torpedo during
      movement of the torpedo through water, in the manner previously
      disclosed. Again, steering may be provided by spoilers as
      previously disclosed herein or, alternatively, rudders as shown in
      FIG. 39.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Front Pulling Propeller Mechanism</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0262] It should be appreciated that with the preferred form of
      the present invention, a front pulling propeller mechanism is used
      to both (i) pull the buoyant tubular foil (BTF) though the water,
      and (ii) generate the friction-reducing air curtain which engulfs
      the trailing BTF. Thus, the same element (i.e., the front pulling
      propeller mechanism) is used to simultaneously provide both
      propulsion and the supercavitating friction-reducing air curtain.
      As noted above, each of these aspects provides significant
      improvements in propulsion efficiencies, with (i) the front
      pulling propeller mechanism biting into virgin water, which
      enhances the propulsion action of the propeller mechanism, and
      (ii) the front pulling propeller mechanism providing the
      supercavitating friction-reducing air curtain which reduces hull
      friction as the BTF moves through the water. Uniquely, the front
      pulling propeller mechanism is used to simultaneously provide both
      of these functions.<br>
      <br>
      [0263] Significantly, the same approach is used regardless of
      whether the BTF is part of a SWATH surface vessel, or the BTF is
      the hull of a submarine or other submersible vessel, or the BTF is
      the fuselage of another form of submersible vehicle such as a
      torpedo or unmanned drone. In other words, with the preferred form
      of the present invention, the front pulling propeller mechanism
      simultaneously provides its dual function (i.e., propulsion and
      the supercavitating friction reducing air curtain) for the
      elongated hull structure (i.e., the BTF) which trails the front
      pulling propeller mechanism. In this way, the elongated hull
      structure is moved through the water with great efficiency and
      hence significantly increased speed.<br>
      <br>
      [0264] It will be appreciated that it is important that the front
      pulling propeller mechanism be configured (e.g., blade shape,
      blade size, number of blades employed, counterrotation of the
      blades if more than one blade is provided, etc.) and operated
      (e.g., blade rotation speed, etc.) for both efficient propulsion
      and efficient air curtain generation. In this latter respect, it
      will be appreciated that the propeller mechanism should generate
      an air curtain of sufficient size and volume to engulf all (or
      substantially all) of the perimeter of the trailing hull structure
      (i.e., the BTF). In this respect it will be appreciated that not
      all front pulling propeller mechanisms will generate the
      supercavitating friction-reducing air curtain desired in the
      present invention. By way of example but not limitation, a
      propeller rotating relatively slowly will generate minimal
      supercavitation function (which may be a desired design feature,
      such as on a ballistic missile submarine which may give a priority
      to noise reduction). By way of further example but not limitation,
      a relatively small propeller may throw off a bubble stream, but
      the bubble stream may not be large enough to engulf the perimeter
      of the trailing hull structure and provide the desired air curtain
      about the outer surface of the trailing hull structure. Thus it
      will be appreciated that attention must be paid to the
      configuration of the front pulling propeller mechanism (e.g.,
      blade shape, blade size, number of blades employed,
      counterrotation of the blades if more than one blade is provided,
      etc.) and to the operation of the front pulling propeller
      mechanism (e.g., blade rotation speed, etc.) in order to provide
      the desired supercavitating friction-reducing air curtain for the
      trailing hull structure. Appropriate design and operational
      parameters will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of
      the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0265] In one preferred form of the invention, the front pulling
      propeller mechanism comprises a pair of counterrotating propellers
      to efficiently provide both propulsion and the supercavitating
      friction-reducing air curtain, with the propellers having a
      diameter which is approximately X percent of the diameter of the
      trailing BTF, and a rotation speed of approximately Y revolutions
      per minute (rpm).<br>
      <br>

        Applications</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0266] In the foregoing description, the attack craft 5 is
      described in the context of its use for military applications.
      However, it should be appreciated that the craft 5 may also be
      used for other, non-military applications, such as security
      applications (e.g., police, immigration and drug enforcement
      purposes), public safety applications (e.g., sea rescues),
      high-speed servicing and re-supply applications (e.g., for
      servicing oil drilling platforms), high-speed water taxi
      applications, private pleasure craft applications, etc.<br>
