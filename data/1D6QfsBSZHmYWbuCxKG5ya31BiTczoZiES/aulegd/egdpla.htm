      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A simple method of desalting
          ocean water now exists which uses no external energy, and
          produces electrical power at the same time! This revolutionary
          process, called Electro-Gravitational Desalination (EGD),
          makes it possible to recover as potable water more than 80% of
          the saline or brackish water treated with the process. It also
          produces at least enough electrical power to operate pumps to
          keep the system flowing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to Albert Aul
          (email inJanuary 2003), the Aul EGD process is currently
          "dormant" because:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) "It was discovered that
          the gap between anode and cathode had to be maintained at 0.25
          inches for the process to oeprate. This created a design and
          maintenance problem that limited the cost effectiveness of any
          equipment built, regardless of size.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) " Marine
          micro-organisms, such as gallionella, attacked copper
          voraciously: numerous test units were literally detroyed by
          them (chlorine does not appear to kill such organisms.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) "Most importantly, the
          development activity ran out of funds. Given the above
          described difficulties, a prolonged and expensive effort to
          overcome them was not to the best interest of the funding
          sources, and the work was abandoned."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Accordingly, the following
          information is presented with the suggestion that only the
          construction of a 1-gpd unit be attempted as a survival
          apparatus that can be cleaned manually, without concern for
          cost efficiency.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As human population
          increases, fresh water resources are being depleted rapidly
          due to waste, pollution, declining water tables, and
          subsequent salting-up (increased concentrations of dissolved
          minerals) of ground water, rivers, etc.. This makes
          desalination increasingly necessary and cost-competitive with
          the transportation of fresh water over long distances. Some
          900 desalination plants with a total capacity of almost 300
          million gallons/day are located throughout the world today.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Several processes have been
          developed for desalination of water. Distillation is the
          oldest and most common desalination process in use. Other
          processes include: solvent extraction, electro-dialysis,
          reverse osmosis, propane extraction, freezing, and
          ion-exchange systems. All of these methods consume large
          amounts of energy that alters the economics of desalination.
          But the cost of transporting fresh water is increasing, so
          desalination remains cost-competitive.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The new method of
          Electro-Gravitational Desalination (EGD) is the discovery of
          Albert H. Aul, who received <b><a href="#usp">U.S Patent #
              3,474,014</a></b>(Cl. 205-150) and several foreign patents
          for his invention.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Electronic coagulation of
          saline solutions has been developed since the early 1940s, but
          such systems employ strong direct current. The Aul EGD system
          requires no externally applied energy; rather, it generates
          its own electrical power. It is in effect a salt-water battery
          in addition to its desalination applications. Aul explains EGD
          as follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The principle upon which
          EGD is based is galvanic to the extent that a 'primary' (not
          rechargeable), low-power battery is galvanic. In any EGD
          system (as in any battery), each cell contains two electrodes:
          a copper anode and an aluminum cathode. The electrolyte
          (dilute sulfuric acid in a storage battery, but only sea water
          in an EGD unit) 'connects' the electrodes at one end, but in
          order to complete an electric circuit it must be connected at
          the other end as well, and in order not to deplete the
          'battery very quickly (as would be the case if the electrodes
          were connected only with a wire and no 'resistance' --- called
          a short-circuit), some resistance (or 'load') must be added,
          such as lights, or a motor or other devices, in the connection
          between the electrodes at the other end.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Electricity is produced by
          chemical action, and in the case of an EGD unit using copper
          anodes and aluminum cathodes, oxygen and aluminum are the
          materials that react with each other, and hydrogen is the
          catalyst. In plain terms, a catalyst is a substance that
          causes other substances to become unstable and recombine to
          become stable. Aluminum and oxygen, when in contact, without
          the presence of hydrogen, will remain independent and stable,
          but in the presence of hydrogen will combine, releasing
          electrons. Water is hydrogen and oxygen. When in EGD the
          aluminum and oxygen combine, the hydrogen goes off mostly as a
          gas.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In the EGD systems as
          described, no other electrode-metal reactions with materials
          in the water have been measured or observed. However, with the
          electrical field that exists, the particles of salts
          (chlorine, sodium, bromine, magnesium, and every other
          substance attached to the water molecules) become attracted to
          the electrodes. The field generated by the EGD system is
          stronger than the field that holds these particles to the
          water molecules; thus the copper anode electrode attracts the
          positively charged particles (anions), and the aluminum
          electrode attracts the negatively charged particles (cations),
          the particles or ions being molecules too, but composed of
          only atoms that each represents. Sea water, for example does
          not contain sodium chloride (table salt); chlorine and sodium
          ions are individually attached to the water molecule. In
          nature they only combine when the water molecule has been
          evaporated away, and there is no 'occupied' water molecule to
          become attached to. In EGD, these ions become detached because
          of the electrical field.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In EGD the field strength
          is really unimportant, as long as a field exists. We make up
          for that lack of a field strength of a copper/aluminum EGD
          device by flowing the water through a large number of cells.
          The number of cells and the flow rate dictates the rate of
          desalting and the amount of saline material remaining in the
          water after it has gone through EGD processing. There are
          limitations on flow rate for each design, and there are
          minimum numbers of cells for each design. The maximum number
          of cells is dictated by the builder of the EGD devices; there
          is a point in each design where the amount of matter removed
          in relation to the cost of the cells is so small that it
          becomes impractical to have the extra cells.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"As the materials (ions of
          various salts) accumulate adjacent to the electrode surfaces,
          and the water's laminar flow downward along the electrode
          surfaces carry the ions out of the field, much of the ion
          material becomes reattached to water molecules not in the
          field (they redissolve), forming a dense brine. That water
          from which the saline ions have migrated, now is unburdened
          and less dense than the saline water. The desalinated
          (desalted) water occurs in the center of the gap between the
          electrodes and is "bouyed" up by the denser saline water
          below, so that the desalted quantity is to be found at the
          top, center-of-gap location of each cell.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Only about 30% of the EGD
          process depends on chemical reactions. For this reason the
          initial urge of technical persons to analyze the process using
          conventional electro-chemical thermal balance equations should
          be subdued. The well-known phenomena of the behavior of matter
          ions in solution between a non-reactive cathode and
          non-reactive anode, more closely represents the facts, except
          that the electrolyte is not an electroplating medium, and that
          the system is galvanically disposed by a minimum reaction of
          cathode (aluminum) and electrolyte-borne oxygen/hydrogen,
          rather than with applied energy from an external source."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of the 30% of the EGD
          process that includes chemical reactions, many of the
          materials are released as gases such as hydrogen, chlorine,
          and others. Hydrogen and chlorine also recombine to form
          hydrogen chloride, which reacts with calcium carbonate to
          produce precipitant calcium chloride and free hydrogen. Some
          of the liberated ions of sodium, calcium and magnesium
          recombine with the carbonate radicals disrupted from calcium
          carbonate and form respective carbonates and hydroxides. <b><a
              href="#fig13">(Figure 1)</a></b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because most of the salts
          are removed by EGD rather than by reducing the electrodes, the
          electrodes last a very long time and require only periodic
          cleaning. The cathode reduction rate is calculated at 0.0013
          oz. avoir. of aluminum hydroxide for each 100 gallons of water
          desalinated. The average value of current produced is 0.000022
          amp/sq. in. of cathode surface in contact with saline water
          being processed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Albert Aul describes a very
          simple model that can be constructed to demonstrate the
          principle of EGD:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Two metal plates, one of
          aluminum and one of copper, approximately 2" x 3" x 1/16"
          thick, are drilled with two 1/4" diameter holes in the top
          corners of both plates. Insert wood dowels through the holes
          so as to support the plates about 1/2" apart in a wide-mouthed
          jar of about 3-pint capacity. Connect the electrode plates
          with a short piece (about 5") of insulated wire, to both ends
          of which are soldered alligator clips. Fill the jar with
          ordinary tap water in which is dissolved about 1/2 gram of
          table salt. Then add a few milligrams of thymol blue pH
          indicator. Adjust the pH with a minute amount of very dilute
          acetic acid (vinegar) and sodium hydroxide (lye) until the
          water turns an orange color. Any additional acetic acid will
          increase the pH and produce a bright red color. Additional lye
          will change the color to clear yellow. The apparatus now is
          complete."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The two plates are
          electrically connected using the wire and clips, thereby
          establishing a galvanic cell of the type described by Albert
          Aul. After several minutes a noticeable change becomes
          apparent: the copper plate becomes blanketed with a thin layer
          of dark red color, and the aluminum plate is covered with a
          thin yellow layer. As the copper anode attracts positive ions
          and decreases the pH in its area, the indicator turns bright
          red in that region. The pH increases around the aluminum
          cathode and the indicator changes to a yellow color in that
          zone as the negative hydroxyl ions accumulate there. Within
          ten minutes the colored layers become about 1/16" thick on
          each side of the metal plates. Then streams of red and yellow
          fluid can be seen coming off the bottom of the metal plates
          and extending to the bottom of the jar. As the operation
          continues, the colored zones increase at the bottom of the
          jar. After several hours of operation, small flecks of
          aluminum hydroxide form on the aluminum cathode.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The indicator changes color
          because the positively charged (electron-deficient) hydrogen
          atoms are attracted to the copper anode, and the negatively
          charged hydroxyl ions are attracted to the aluminum cathode.
          In the same manner, the dissociated salts yield positive ions
          of sodium, magnesium, and calcium that are attracted to the
          copper anodes while the anions of chlorine, carbonates, and
          hydroxides are attracted to the aluminum cathode. As the
          solution of ions increases near the plates they establish a
          gravitational convection flow in which the denser fluid layers
          containing higher concentrations of salt ions settle to the
          bottom of the jar, leaving the fluid zone between the
          electrode plates depleted of dissolved salts, i.e.,
          desalinated."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The construction of a
          practical EGD system requires certain constraints. For
          instance, the gap between the aluminum and copper electrodes
          must be 1/4", with only a narrow margin for variation. If the
          gap is too narrow, it short-circuits as chains of aluminum
          hydroxide build up and bridge between the electrodes. If the
          gap is too wide, the electrochemical potential is too low and
          insufficient to the electrochemical reaction threshold. Also
          the water must enter the system within the electrode zone, not
          below it, as indicated in <b><a href="#fig14">Figure 2</a></b>.
          The following is a description of a preferred embodiment of
          the Aul EGD process:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Four tubular copper anode
          containers were connected in such a manner as to permit saline
          water to be introduced a distance from the bottom of one tube,
          then permitted to flow out of the top of that tube into the
          next tube, where the inlet was in the identical location of
          the first, and so on for all four tubes. The distance from the
          bottom of the containers to the inlets was sufficient not to
          impede the deposition of the precipitants nor cause the
          incoming water to be mixed with the precipitants.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Tubular aluminum cathode
          elements were then suspended into the tubular anode
          containers. The cathodes were connected together by... an
          insulated wire. The anodes were connected together by an
          insulated wire, and then connected to one side of a meter
          calibrated to be read in milliamperes. The cathodes were
          connected to an electrical resistance of 10 ohms. The
          electrical resistance was connected to the other side of the
          ammeter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The axes of the copper
          anode containers and the aluminum cathodes were coaxial and
          oriented perpendicular with the earth's surface. The total
          capacity of the system was measured at 2.7 gallons of water.
          At the bottom of each container a stopcock was provided for
          the removal of precipitants.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Saline water was introduced
          and permitted to flow continually through the system at a rate
          of 2.7 gal./day. the water was tested. The total dissolved and
          solid saline materials were 36,000 ppm of water before the
          introduction into the process, and only 370 ppm after ejection
          from the system, indicating about 99% desalination. The
          precipitants were removed as a dense brine which measured
          104,000 ppm of suspended solids for each 2.7 gallons
          processed."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After sea water containing
          about 15,000 ppm of dissolved or suspended solids has passed
          through a series of about a dozen Aul EGD cells, its saline
          content has been reduced to about 250 ppm. This is good
          drinking water. If the water is used for agricultural
          purposes, a higher saline content is acceptable.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1965, Louis Shaffer,
          chief of the Reclamation Bureau's Division of Hydrology at San
          Bernardino, tested an Aul EGD plant which processed water from
          the Salton Sea to yield desalted water about equal in quality
          to kitchen tap water in San Bernardino. Shaffer said:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It's a revolutionary
          approach to the age-old problem of converting sea water to
          fresh water in the arid regions of the world."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Aul EGD process has
          become a dormant technology since the death of the inventor.
          This elegant technology now awaits further development, and a
          thirsty society awaits its implementation. Following herewith
          are Albert Aul's US Patent # 3,474,014 and construction plans
          for EGD units with 1 gallon/day and 100 gpd capacity. As
          stated at the beginning of this report, only the construction
          of a 1-gpd unit can be recommended as a survival apparatus...</font>

            method of desalination of salt water using two dissimilar
            metal electrodes connected externally which form a galvanic

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This process removes the
            saline materials from saline water for the purpose of making
            the water potable and useful for agriculture without ill
            effect.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The novelty of this
            invention is that it requires no application of energy from
            any source external to the process; that it incorporates no
            critical or strategic materials and that it is completely
            self-contained.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Existing desalination
            processes require the application of heat energy or
            electrical energy from an independent source to make the
            process operational, whether for direct separation of saline
            material from water by electrolytic means using applied
            electricity, distillation of steam or evaporated water,
            operation of pumps and other equipment necessary to such
            processes.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention produces
            its own electrical energy as well as making it possible to
            recover more than 80% of the volume of saline water injected
            into the process, as desalinated water.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Minerals such as aluminum
            and alloys of aluminum and other minerals react with saline
            materials that are dissolved and suspended in saline water.
            These chemical reactions cause the saline materials to
            combine with the minerals placed in the water for that
            purpose. The chemical reactions cause a change in the energy
            levels of various atoms in the reacting molecules.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When non-reacting minerals
            such as copper, alloys of copper or other minerals are
            placed at a distance from the reacting minerals with an
            unobstructed quantity of saline water between the reacting
            and non-reacting materials, an electrostatic field is caused
            to exist.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The mineral in contact wit
            the saline water and reacting with the saline water is
            called the cathode. The mineral in contact with the saline
            water and considered non-reacting is termed the anode. When
            the cathode and anode are placed at a distance from each
            other with an unobstructed quantity of saline water in
            contact with the surface of each, and when an electrically
            conductive material is placed so that it continually is in
            contact with both the cathode and anode, but not in contact
            with the saline water, an electric current is caused to
            exist. The rate of chemical reaction, production of
            electrical energy and rate of separation of the saline
            materials and their removal from the saline water are
            proportional.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Saline water tested by
            this process was obtained from the Pacific Ocean having a
            content of dissolved and suspended solids 44,000 milligrams
            per liter of water of which 6400 milligrams of the same
            solids were CaCO3 (calcium carbonate). After processing per
            this process, wherein the reaction was controlled to
            accomplish a separation of saline materials of approximately
            70% of the amount contained in the saline water, analysis of
            the processed water showed that the total of solid materials
            remaining dissolved and suspended in the water measured
            10,660 milligrams solids per liter of water. Of these solids
            1,530 milligrams were calcium carbonate. The control was
            subsequently adjusted to cause more separation and removal
            of saline materials; the resulting analyses showing the
            processed water to contain 650 milligrams per liter of water
            of solid matter, of which 320 milligrams were calcium
            carbonate.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The reacted materials do
            not adhere to the cathode but disengage as their density
            increases and fall to the bottom of the vessel in which they
            are contained. Non-reacting materials suspended in the water
            being processed become charged in the electrical field
            between the cathode and anode. Each particle will then be
            attracted to the next as their respective negative and
            positive poles come into opposition. Ultimately the
            accumulated density exceeds their former buoyancy as a
            result of the coalescence by attraction and these materials
            deposit at the bottom of the vessel in which they are
            contained.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electric current
            produced as a by-product of the desalination process
            chemical reaction was measured to have an average value of
            0.000022 ampere per square inch of cathode surface in
            contact with the saline water being processed. For each
            combination of cathode and anode the electromotive force as
            measured to be 0.5 volt. The rate of separation and removal
            of saline materials from the water, termed desalination, has
            been calculated. The calculations are based on the amount of
            material separated and removed from the water, the observed
            change in measurement of electric current and the amount of
            water processed. The rate of desalination of one cubic inch
            of saline water in contact with the surfaces of one cathode
            and one anode of one square inch area, where the cathode and
            anode are in mutual contact with an electrically conductive
            material not in contact with the water, is two minutes for
            water having a content of 650 parts&nbsp; of solid material
            in suspension and solution per million parts of water after
            processing from an original state wherein 44,000 parts of
            solid material in suspension and solution per million parts
            of water were measured before processing.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By analysis 31,675 parts
            of cathode materials were reacted and removed from the
            cathode for each million parts of water processed, where the
            processed water contained 650 parts of solid material in
            suspension and solution for each million parts of water.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The material separated and
            removed from the water by the desalination process described
            herein, are removed from the bottom of the vessels in which
            they are deposited, and made available for processing into
            chemical, metals, chemical products, metal products, and all
            other uses to which they are applicable. Many of the
            materials released by the chemical reactions of the process
            are released as gases, such as hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine
            and others.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These gases partially
            combine in the water, small portions of chlorine gas
            dissolving. Hydrogen and chlorine combine to form
            hydrochloric acid that in turn reacts with calcium carbonate
            resulting in free hydrogen gas and precipitant calcium
            chloride. The hydrogen gas expands out of the water to
            atmosphere.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The chlorine gas is
            released when the sodium chloride molecule is disrupted by
            the electrochemical reactions of this process. As the
            chlorine atoms are recombined as described in the foregoing
            so does the sodium atom combine with the carbon atoms of the
            disrupted calcium carbonate molecule resulting in
            precipitant sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide.</font> </p>

        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Example I:</font></b> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A tubular container of
            copper was constructed into which a cylindrical rod of
            aluminum was suspended coaxially. The aluminum cathode was
            connected to the copper anode with an electrical conductor.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The entire assembly was
            oriented with the axes of the cylindrical parts
            perpendicular to the earth’s surface. Saline water was

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The distance by which the
            surfaces in the container and the cathode rod were separated
            was 0.75 inch. The water was permitted to remain in the
            container one hour. After one hour the water was removed and
            tested. The remaining dissolved and suspended solid material
            was measured at 28,900 parts per million of water.</font> </p>

            containers were connected in such a manner as to permit
            saline water to be introduced a distance from the bottom of
            one tube, then permitted to flow out of the top of that tube
            into the next tube where the inlet was in the identical
            location of the first, and so on for all four tubes. The
            distance from the bottom of the containers to the inlets was
            sufficient not to impede the deposition of the precipitant
            nor cause the incoming water to be mixed with the
            precipitants.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tubular aluminum cathode
            elements were then suspended into an anode container. The
            cathodes were connected together by an electrically
            conductive material. The anodes were connected together by
            an electrically conductive material. The anodes were then
            connected to one side of a meter calibrated to be read in
            millamperes. The cathodes were connected to an electrical
            resistance of 10 ohms. The electrical resistance was
            connected to the other side of the ammeter.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The axes of the anode
            containers and the cathodes were coaxial and oriented to be

            amperes of electrical current at an electromotive force of
            0.5 volts continually. The water was tested. The total
            dissolved and suspended solid saline materials were 36,300
            parts of water before introduction into the process and 370
            parts per million parts of water after ejection from the

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FOREWORD:</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Electrogravitational
          Desalination of Saline Water (EGD), is a process designed for
          the desalting of sea water to produce potable and agricultural
          water as a supplement to existing water supplies, for
          application in sea coast communities.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention operates much
          the same as a storage battery except that there are a great
          number of cells, and the electrolyte (sea water), continuously
          flows through the system. The amount of residual salts left in
          the product water is controlled by the flow rate; the faster
          the water flows the more is left in it, conversely the slower
          the water flows the more is removed, however, for each design
          there is an optimum flow rate and a minimum flow rate. The
          average minimum flow rate should never fall below one gallon
          per day for any system, but for larger systems this figure is
          even too low. The rule of never permitting the system flow
          rate to be less than 10% of the designed optimum flow rate in
          units over 10 gallons per day is best to follow.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although some ion exchange
          takes place in the system and is the source of the by-product
          electrical power that is generated, most of the saline matter
          is removed by the electrogravitational phenomenon. Between the
          rods (the cathodes) and the tubes (the anodes), an electrical
          field comes into existence when tube and rod are connected
          together electrically (outside of the electrolyte), with some
          kind of resistance load (light bulbs, or motors, etc.)
          between. The electrolyte forms the other “connection” between
          the rod and tube. The dissolved salts are, in fact, ions
          (atomic sized particles) with positive or negative charges,
          attached to the water molecules. The electrical field in the
          EGO process causes these ions to be detached from the water
          molecules and migrate to either the anode or cathode,
          depending on the charge of the ion.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The ions accumulate at the
          surfaces of each (rod and tube), but only the Oxygen and
          Hydrogen ions will react with the materials of which the rods
          and tubes are made, and in the case of the designs contained
          in these instructions, only the rods are consumed over a long
          period of time. The rest of the ions (the salt ions)
          accumulate at the rod and tube surfaces, gradually being drawn
          downward by gravity until these reach the space below the rod
          (where there is no electrical field), where these redissolve
          (the ions become reattached to the water molecules), forming a
          dense brine. To this brine is added the hydroxides formed by
          the ion exchanges (reactions) between rods and those ions we
          mentioned before. These hydroxides are in the form of flakes
          and whitish in color. These flakes are only slightly more
          dense than the water, and though most will fall to the bottom,
          some will stay suspended in the water and usually filtered out
          before the product water is used. These hydroxides are
          harmless, being in fact one of the two constituent materials
          used in treating digestive tract ailments in products bearing
          trade names of Maalox, Di-Gel, etc. The main ingredients of
          these products are aluminum and magnesium hydroxides, of which
          ours is aluminum hydroxide.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Other beneficial side
          effects of EGD operation include the release of chlorine ions,
          which expand out of the water as a gas (rising to and out of
          the water's upper surface), some, of course, is carried down
          with the other materials. The gaseous chlorine destroys
          harmful organisms. All but trace amounts of chlorine are
          usually removed from the product water by aerating before
          storage, as it comes from the output filter.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">DESIGN BACKGROUND:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These instructions contain
          basic information for the construction of two different units;
          a unit that will produce 100 gallons per 24 hour day of water
          containing 400 parts per million total dissolved solids, from
          saline ocean water containing 30,000 parts per million total
          dissolved solids from which suspended matter has been removed
          by filtration to ten microns, and a one gallon per 24 hour day
          unit producing water of the same quality as that specified for
          the 100 gallon per day unit from the same source .</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The designs have been
          developed to permit the builder to obtain materials that are
          commercially available from hardware stores, plumbing supply
          centers, lumber supply centers and retail metal products
          suppliers. Significant latitude has been allowed to facilitate
          substitutions as well as permitting the builder to fully
          decide on certain materials as well as size of materials and
          parts. Where strict limitation was necessary in material
          selection, and dimensions they are clearly identified. The
          designs have been developed from fully tested and demonstrated
          laboratory devices.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Construction of tube
          assemblies for both types of units only differs in size. Rod
          assemblies for the two differ in construction due to the very
          small diameter of the one gpd unit's rods. The one gallon unit
          is intended to be an emergency device only, the design does
          not lend itself well to prolonged use as it is a hand filled
          unit, and when not in use must be disassembled completely, and
          all parts thoroughly dried (after removing all traces of
          saline water by rinsing in fresh water). The following
          instructions give more on the subject of storage .</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">CONSTRUCTION

          illustrates a vertical side view with partial cut-away to show
          cell (tube and rod, assembled), position and identify certain
          components as well as construction fundamentals. The solenoid
          shown is for lifting the perforated plate that pushes the
          valves open momentarily to dump the waste brine. The dumping
          need only be done once each day, and for no more than a half
          second of time. A hydraulic cylinder may be used instead, but
          this requires a motorized pump. The cylinder may be preferable
          over the solenoid in order to get the force needed to raise
          the valves against nearly 800 lbs. of water weight, but this
          is a decision the builder must make based on equipment
          availability. The schedule for Figure I is on the page
          following.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><a href="#fig2">Figure II</a></b>
          gives the recommended construction dimensions for the housing.
          Items 9 and 14 on Figure I need not be mounted to their
          support angles, but can be laid on them. The lid should be
          locked into position only to prevent shifting and dislocation
          that would adversely affect rod/tube alignment and electrical
          connections. The method of locking is optional. Inlet and
          outlet pipes are not shown or specified on the housing. The
          builder has the option as to which way these should project
          from the unit (whether out the ends or the sides), keeping in
          mind that the inlet of water to the tubes is at the bottom and
          the outlet at the top.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><a href="#fig2a">Figure
              IIA</a></b> shows the location of two sets of holes that
          correspond to the mounting positions of the rods, and the tabs
          for making the electrical connections to the tubes. The .201"
          diam. holes are for mounting of the rods to the lids as well
          as making the electrical connections to the rods. The .250"
          diam. holes are for passing the wires from the tube electrical
          connection tabs out onto the lid top where the connections can
          be made. The frame for the valve plate lift ropes and lifting
          mechanism support is also shown on Figure IIA . Standard
          fiberglass sheets come in a maximum size of 4' x 8'. These can
          be cemented together with a wide strip of the same material to
          obtain the larger dimensions recommended in these
          instructions, using epoxy cement (2 part is recommended).</font>

          (from centerline of a tube to the centerline of its neighbor
          tubes). The inlet and outlet direction is shown for

          well bonded coating without obstructing the perforations so
          that the waste water may pass through, may be preferred. The
          plate must lift the valve stems against approximately 800 lbs.
          of water weight, without permanently deforming.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><a href="#fig11">Figure
              XI</a></b> illustrates the electrical connections
          recommended; 1) connections are series connections that add
          the voltage of each cell so connected to the next, and 2)
          connections are parallel connections that add the current
          values of the cells so connected. Per the recommended
          connections shown, an average total of 997 Watts will be
          available. This power is ample for operating a water pump
          motor 1/4 hp to 1/3 hp), for filling the unit, at a constant
          rate. If it is preferred by the builder that the power be
          first converted from the DC produced to AC, it must be kept in
          mind that some power loss will result in such conversion. It
          is recommended that the builder employ a power panel
          containing a wattmeter and switching so that power stability
          can be monitored. Power drop-off is directly related to
          reduction in desalting activity, and is usually due to the
          rods having become coated with hydroxides. This condition can
          be corrected without shutting the unit down, by employing a
          hand held ultrasonic generator, and touching each tube for a
          few minutes to "shake-off" the hydroxide materials. Care must
          be taken not to cause an electrical short or to be subjected
          to electrical shock during this process. It is recommended
          that the ultrasonic device be fully electrically insulated.
          The rods can be vibrated through their mounting screws.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><a href="#fig12">Figure
              XII</a></b> illustrates the recommended container for a
          one gallon emergency use device. Figure XII and its associated
          schedule are considered clear enough to permit construction of
          such a device, employing the other applicable parts of this
          instruction (Figures IV, V, XI and their associated
          schedules), and the general recommendations given herein.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><a href="#fig12">Figure
              XII</a></b> - Item 10 is the top plate of the base box.
          This plate supports the rods and is where the electrical
          connections should be made. The electrical leads can be
          connected to a "jack" type socket on the side of the housing
          (base box), from which a number of items can be operated if
          fitted with mating plugs. Some of the possible devices are: an
          emergency transceiver radio, light, emergency radio
          transmitter beeper. The device will produce an average 0.98
          Watts, ample in a number of the devices mentioned. As shown on
          Figure XII, the lid assembly is also the filling reservoir.
          Again, as in the 100 gpd unit, the builder has the option of
          the outlet location, as well as the inlet to the first cell.
          The outlet should have a valve so that the flow can be
          controlled, but when flow is controlled at the outlet, extra
          care must be taken to prevent overflow of the tubes from
          filling with more water than is being allowed to pass out.
          Corrosion and electrical shorts can result that would
          seriously effect the desalting capability of the device.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">GENERAL INFORMATION:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If a unit is stopped for any
          reason, it must be drained of all saline water, the electrical
          circuit opened (switched off), the cell components thoroughly
          rinsed and dried (fresh water rinse). If the units are to be
          stored after having been used, stopped and dried, the rods
          should be removed from the cells and stored separately. Some
          corrosion of the tubes may occur in storage, or a patina may
          form in them. Providing that such storage is not for an
          exceptionally long period that might seriously damage the
          tubes, the unit can usually be put back into operation very
          quickly by filling the tubes with any of the liquid copper
          cleaners generally available to remove the corrosion products
          .The cleaner must be thoroughly rinsed out of the system
          before using the system again. The rods should be cleaned to
          remove all oxides and expose bare metal. Electrical connection
          points should be carefully inspected and corroded parts
          cleaned or replaced .</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The desalting unit should be
          filled with filtered sea water taken from far enough offshore
          to minimize the pollutant content. The finer the filtration,
          the lower the risk of potential troubles. Petroleum
          contaminants for instance, can cause very frustrating
          contamination that will obviously stop the process from
          operating effectively.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These units should be
          operated in as motion free an environment as possible.
          Agitation of the water in the tubes will cause mixing which
          totally defeats the process function. Too high a flow rate
          will cause turbulence that results in the same problem. The
          one gallon unit can be used in life boats as long as there is
          relative calm, or as long as internal "sloshing" can be
          prevented.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The waste brine tank in the
          bottom of both units must be fitted with a means for removing
          the brine periodically. To monitor the level, a clear plastic
          window can be cemented into the housing wall, and a manually
          operated drain valve installed. The brine can be evaporation
          dried and its salt content recovered .</font> </p>
