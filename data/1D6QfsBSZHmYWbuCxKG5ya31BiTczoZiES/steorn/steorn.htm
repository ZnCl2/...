          <p class="first">Since its foundation in 2000, Steorn has
            worked on innovative technologies in a number of areas,
            including e-commerce, anti-fraud, and energy for companies
            ranging from start-ups to multi-nationals.</p>
          <p>The Steorn team brings together a wealth of experience from
            diverse industries including engineering, energy, research
            and information technology. A highly-focused, integrated
            approach to our work allows us to drive projects forward
            with clarity and vision. </p>
          <p>With a range of services from project management to
            prototype development and testing, Steorn has brought its
            experience and expertise to bear on complex projects and
            technologies, creating and capturing Intellectual Property
            and turning concepts into reality.<br>

          <div style="text-align: center;"><big style="font-weight:
              bold;">Orbo</big><br>
          </div>
          <p class="first">The development of Orbo® follows on from
            results of tests on a custom designed permanent magnet
            generator carried out during mid 2004. Orbo technology is
            based on electromagnetic interactions concerning domain
            rotation within ferromagnetic materials, specifically the
            phenomenon of delayed magnetic field propagation.</p>
          <p>Delayed magnetic field propagation is a limited area of
            exploration within the physics community, while there are a
            number of papers that detail the test method and
            examination, no papers to date have gone as far as the
            research conducted by Steorn. </p>
          <p>The development of this technology is continuous as work
            progresses to the end goal of providing a safe, stable and
            continuous electrical power output. </p>
          <p>As core research and development continues a number of
            other technologies have been developed as a direct result,
            these technologies are either based on Orbo interactions or
            spin-outs from implementations of Orbo.</p>
          <p>These ancillary technologies include low frequency
            induction heating operating on AC line frequency without the
            need for intervening electronics, hybrid passive magnetic
            bearings and a range of rotary torque measurement systems
            for magnetic implementations.<br>

          Steorn Ltd is a small, private technology development company
          in Dublin, Ireland. It announced in August 2006 it had
          developed a technology which provides "free, clean, and
          constant energy" in violation of the law of conservation of
          energy,[3] a fundamental principle of physics.[4]<br>
          <br>
          Steorn challenged the scientific community to investigate
          their claim[5] and, in December 2006, said that it had chosen
          a jury of scientists to do so.[6] In June 2009 the jury gave
          its unanimous verdict that Steorn had not demonstrated the
          production of energy.[7]<br>
          <br>
          Steorn has also given two public demonstrations of their
          technology. In the first demonstration, in July 2007 at the
          Kinetica Museum in London, the device failed to work.[8] The
          second demonstration, which ran from December 2009 to February
          2010 at the Waterways Visitor Centre in Dublin, involved a
          motor powered by a battery and provided no independent
          evidence that excess energy was being generated.[9]<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">History</span><br>
          <br>
          Steorn was founded in 2000[10] and, in October 2001, their
          website stated that they were a "specialist service company
          providing programme management and technical assessment advice
          for European companies engaging in e-commerce projects".
          Steorn is a Norse word meaning to guide or manage.<br>
          <br>
          In May 2006, The Sunday Business Post reported that Steorn was
          a former dot-com company which was developing a microgenerator
          product based on the same principle as self-winding watches,
          as well as creating e-commerce websites for customers. The
          company had also recently raised about €2.5 million from
          investors and was three years into a four year development
          plan for its microgenerator technology.[2] Steorn has since
          stated that the account given in this interview was intended
          to prevent a leak regarding their free energy technology.[11]<br>
          <br>
          The company's investment history shows several share
          allotments for cash between August 2000 and October 2005,[12]
          the investments totalling €3 million.[2] In 2006, Steorn
          secured €8.1 million in loans from a range of investors in
          order to continue their research, and these funds were also
          converted into shares.[13] Steorn said that they would seek no
          further funding while attempting to prove their free-energy
          claim in order to demonstrate their genuine desire for
          validation.[13]<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Free energy claim</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          In August 2006, Steorn placed an advertisement in The
          Economist saying that they had developed a technology that
          produced "free, clean and constant energy".[5] Called Orbo,
          the technology was said to violate conservation of energy[3]
          but had been validated by eight independent scientists.[14]
          None of these scientists would talk to the media, and Steorn
          suggested that this was because they did not want to become
          embroiled in a controversy.[14]<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Views on the technology</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          No specific details of the workings of the claimed technology
          have been made public. Seán McCarthy stated in a 2006 RTÉ
          radio interview, "What we have developed is a way to construct
          magnetic fields so that when you travel round the magnetic
          fields, starting and stopping at the same position, you have
          gained energy".[15] In 2011, Steorn's website was updated to
          suggest that the Orbo is based on magnetic fields which vary
          over time.[16] Barry Williams of the Australian Skeptics has
          pointed out that Steorn is "not the first company to claim
          they have suddenly discovered the miraculous property of
          magnetism that allows you to get free energy"[4] while Martin
          Fleischmann says that it is not credible that positioning of
          magnetic fields could create energy.[14]<br>
          <br>
          Following a meeting between McCarthy and Professor Sir Eric
          Ash in July 2007, Ash reported that "the Orbo is a mechanical
          device which uses powerful magnets on the rim of a rotor and
          further magnets on an outer shell".[17] During this meeting,
          McCarthy referred to the law of conservation of energy as
          scientific dogma.[17] However, conservation of energy is a
          fundamental principle of physics[4] and Ash said that there
          was no comparison with religious dogma since there is no
          flexibility in choosing to accept that energy is always
          conserved.[17] Rejecting conservation of energy would
          undermine all science and technology.[17] Ash also formed the
          opinion that McCarthy was truly convinced in the validity of
          his invention but that this conviction was a case of
          "prolonged self-deception".[17]<br>
          <br>
          Many people have accused Steorn of engaging in a publicity
          stunt although Steorn deny such accusations.[18] Eric Berger,
          writing on the Houston Chronicle website, commented: "Steorn
          is a former e-business company that saw its market vanish
          during the dot.com bust. It stands to reason that Steorn has
          retooled as a Web marketing company and is using the "free
          energy" promotion as a platform to show future clients how it
          can leverage print advertising and a slick Web site to promote
          their products and ideas".[19] Thomas Ricker at Engadget
          suggested that Steorn's free-energy claim was a ruse to
          improve brand recognition and to help them sell Hall
          probes[20] while Josh Catone, features editor for Mashable,
          believes that it was merely an elaborate hoax.[21]<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jury process</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          In its advertisement in The Economist, Steorn challenged
          scientists to form an independent jury to test their
          technology and publish the results.[22][23] Within 36 hours of
          the advertisement being published, 420 scientists contacted
          Steorn[24] and, on 1 December 2006, Steorn announced it had
          selected a jury.[6] It was headed by Ian MacDonald, emeritus
          professor of electrical engineering at the University of
          Alberta, and the process began in February 2007.[7]<br>
          <br>
          In June 2009 the jury announced its unanimous verdict that
          "Steorn's attempts to demonstrate the claim have not shown the
          production of energy. The jury is therefore ceasing work".[7]
          Dick Ahlstrom, writing in the Irish Times, concluded from this
          that Steorn's technology did not work.[7] Steorn responded by
          saying that because of difficulties in implementing the
          technology the focus of the process had been on providing the
          jury with test data on magnetic effects for study.[25] Steorn
          also said that these difficulties had been resolved and
          disputed its jury's findings.[7][25]<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Demonstrations</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          A notice at the Kinetica Museum announcing the cancellation of
          the public demonstration<br>
          <br>
          On 4 July 2007, the technology was to be displayed at the
          Kinetica Museum, Spitalfields Market, London. A unit
          constructed of clear plastic was prepared so that the
          arrangement of magnets could be seen and to demonstrate that
          the device operated without external power sources.[8][26] The
          public demonstration was delayed and then cancelled because of
          technical difficulties. Steorn initially said that the
          problems had been caused by excessive heat from the
          lighting[8][27] but later blamed the failure on damage done to
          bearings due to a greenhouse effect within the box.[28]<br>
          <br>
          A second demonstration ran between 15 December 2009 and
          February 2010[29] at the Waterways Visitor Centre in Dublin,
          and was streamed via Steorn's website.[30][31] The
          demonstration was of a device powered by a rechargeable
          battery. Steorn said that the device produced more energy than
          it consumed and recharged the battery.[9] No substantive
          details of the technology were revealed and no independent
          evidence of Steorn's claim was provided.[9]<br>
          <br>
          On 1 April 2010 Steorn opened an online development community,
          called the Steorn Knowledge Development Base (SKDB), which
          they said would explain their technology.[32] Access is
          available only under licence on payment of a fee.[32][33]<br>

          <p>Amidst all the talk about Steorn's spectacularly failed
            demonstration, it's easy to overlook the most interesting
            new bit of information that did come out of all this --
            Steorn finally revealed what a working Orbo looks like. It
            appears that their press package for what they seem to have
            anticipated would be a successful media event included
            photos of Sean holding an Orbo device, and the central
            "rotor" disc does look to be spinning. The photo showed up
            in several articles during the past week, including coverage
            by the BBC.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Whether the Orbo is capable of working as claimed is as yet
            unknown, but that hasn't stopped people from analyzing how
            it's put together and how it would work if it could. Steorn
            forum member Axle posted several images showing an exploded
            view of the Orbo based on the published photos:</p>
          <p>The "stator" is shown in green and blue, and contains a
            circular arrangement of eight magnets fitted into slots
            around the periphery of a central cavity. In that cavity
            spins the "rotor", with four magnets around its
            circumference. The stator and rotor are connected by two
            bearings, seen in orange -- the weak links that, according
            to Sean, put an end to the demo.</p>
          <p>Some of this detail is conjecture, given the quality of the
            photos that the design is drawn from. The design resembles a
            variation of a classic magnet motor, a recurring motif among
            attempts to create perpetual motion machines. A magnet motor
            cannot generate more energy than is put into it because, due
            to the way magnetic fields work, there will either be a
            stable state where the rotor is being pushed in one
            direction just as strongly as it is being pushed in the
            other direction, or else the operation of the motor will
            progressively weaken the magnets themselves until the
            spinning stops. If Orbo does work, then it's doing something
            very unusual with the configuration of magnets, perhaps
            (according to Sean) somehow taking advantage of the time
            variance involved in the effect of magnetic viscosity. (Some
            members of the Overunity forum are trying to figure out how
            this might work).</p>
          <p>Until (and unless) Steorn reveals just how their Orbo is
            put together, all we can do is make speculations based on
            what little we have seen. But if Sean is holding a spinning
            Orbo device in these published photos, I think we can narrow
            down the possibilities of what it actually is to these four:</p>
          <p>1) A fake -- hidden in there somewhere is a battery, strong
            enough to keep the device running for a few days (or maybe,
            as it turned out, just a few hours).</p>
          <p>2) A type of "magnet motor" that will spin for a while,
            during which time the magnets themselves are weakened,
            eventually stopping the motion. This is in direct
            contradiction with Steorn's statement that tests showed no
            weakening of the magnets... but we've seen that Steorn's
            engineers (like any, to be fair) are not infallible.</p>
          <p>3) A very low friction magnet motor that will keep spinning
            if held and jostled a bit, but that without this small input
            of energy will eventually slow to a halt. It's possible that
            such a device could have fooled Steorn into believing they
            had a perpetual motion machine. This is difficult to
            reconcile with Sean's claim that a test Orbo has been run
            continuously for several weeks, however -- unless it was
            being carefully cradled by a hopeful and deluded energy
            source for part of that time.</p>
          4) It just might, of course, be the real thing.<br>
          <div class="entry-body">
            <p>Prior to their recent failed demo, Steorn made a number
              of preparations that would seem to indicate complete
              confidence on their part that the demo would be a
              spectacular success. They readied a stunning and
              provocative demonstration space, called in the media, and
              were set to stream the event live over the web. They also
              paid to fly in a knowledgeable physicist and skeptical
              forum member known as DrMike, offering him a chance to
              inspect the Orbo up close and report his findings.</p>
            <p>Steorn's demo fell apart before it began. DrMike had the
              opportunity to talk with Sean, hear his apologies and
              explanations, fiddle with magnets in the small workshop
              Steorn had set up at the demo site, hear Steorn's story
              about how Orbo defies conservation of energy, and chat
              physics with other scientists who had shown up for the
              demo.</p>
            <p>His opinion after seeing all of this? Orbo is nothing
              more than a delusion inside the mind of Sean McCarthy.</p>
            <blockquote>Sean lives in a world of delusion. His greatest
              strength is the ability [to] convince people of things,
              and it is also his greatest weakness. I am certain that
              Sean has seen a "start - stop" device operating. That it
              never existed outside his mind doesn't matter.
              <p>-DrMike</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>DrMike's full report states the case a bit more
              tactfully, but no less damningly:</p>
            <blockquote>I am certain Steorn really believed I would see
              something that resembled their claim... Watching Sean and
              listening to him talk (and boy can he talk!!) I am
              convinced he has seen everything he describes.
              Unfortunately, the rest of us have not... My conclusion
              after going through all this is that Steorn is neither
              hoax nor scam. It is delusion. The reason it seems surreal
              is because it is surreal - we are the real part of someone
              else's imagination.</blockquote>
            <p>What's more, after reviewing Steorn's technical documents
              describing how magnetic viscosity is employed to violate
              the laws of thermodynamics, DrMike is convinced he sees
              the flaw in their logic; unfortunately he can't share his
              idea with us due to Steorn's NDA, so we have little to go
              by but his confidence.</p>
            <blockquote>If it was a hoax, the whole upstairs [workshop]
              would not exist, nor would Sean have taken the time to go
              through all the details of how he thinks it all works. I
              can not describe any of those details without breaking the
              NDA, so it puts me in a fairly strange position. The flaws
              in the thought process are clear to me, but Steorn
              considers these details proprietary information.</blockquote>
            <p>There were only ever three classes of possible
              explanations for Steorn's claim; either it was a
              purposeful deception, an honest mistake, or a genuine
              method for generating free energy. Given the actions taken
              by Sean McCarthy and Steorn over the past year, as well as
              what we've found out about Steorn's history and finances,
              I'm willing to bet against the first option, purposeful
              deception (this would include all forms of deception such
              as scam, hoax, fraud, marketing tactic, alternate reality
              game, social experiment, film subject, etc.). DrMike,
              after having met and spoken at length with Sean and other
              Steorn employees, is also ready to discard that
              possibility.</p>
            <p>Of the two remaining options, DrMike is convinced that
              Orbo is an honest mistake on the part of Steorn. But how
              can a company with dozens of employees, including a number
              of engineers and PhDs, maintain such a blatantly erroneous
              belief over the course of several years? DrMike explains
              this as the result of the force of will and the
              charismatic persuasion of one deeply delusional man, Sean
              McCarthy.</p>
            <p>This story sounds terribly unlikely at first glance. What
              about all of Steorn's other engineers, who build and test
              Orbo devices? Wouldn't they have realized along the way
              that they had never actually witnessed proof of the basic
              assumption underlying their work? What about all of
              Steorn's other employees, hanging on for years as their
              company abandons "serious" work and devotes itself
              full-bore to the quixotic quest of defying the most basic
              laws of science? How could a single man be so delusional
              as to believe without a speck of evidence that he's
              accomplished the impossible, and yet preserve a veneer of
              coherence that allows him to maintain the confidence of
              his company and investors, and gather an international
              group of optimistic followers?</p>
            <p>As unlikely as this may sound, a combination of delusion
              and charisma has been used to create mass movements in
              politics and religion throughout history. And the
              unlikeliness of this possibility must be weighed against
              the unlikeliness of its alternative: that despite the
              conservation of energy being among the most solidly proven
              and repeatedly demonstrated theories in all of science,
              and despite hundreds of years of failed empirical effort
              toward violating that theory, a simple arrangement of
              permanent magnets has accidentally been shown to create
              energy from nothing. And recall that no one who has made
              the pilgrimage to Steorn and is capable of reporting back
              to the public has yet seen a working Orbo. Not Crank, not
              Dr. David Timoney, not DrMike.</p>
            <p>What does Sean McCarthy have to say these days, in the
              aftermath of his failed demo and as his mental health is
              increasingly being questioned? His confidence is unshaken.
              Recently he answered a series of questions on the Steorn
              forum, presenting the failed demo as a disappointment, but
              no more than a temporary obstacle:</p>
            <blockquote>Clearly no one involved in the company is happy
              about the failed demo, but despite this we also need to
              keep perspective - it's a failed demo[.] It has shaken to
              the core any confidence that people not involved with the
              company have, and this is understandable. But we know what
              we have so things are not as dire as people would like to
              make them. We will do the demo, and then move on.</blockquote>
            <p>About DrMike's allegations against Sean's grasp of
              reality, he replies:</p>
            <blockquote>I guess that in a way I understand his comments,
              its not true but in the circumstances I doubt that you
              will believe me.</blockquote>
            <p>Sean also gave a post-demo interview on Irish radio
              recently. He continues to seek media attention and his
              confidence appears to be intact. In the interview he
              states that a new public demonstration of Orbo "will not
              be too far away."</p>
            <p>We now have Sean McCarthy, convinced he can pull energy
              from nowhere, and DrMike, confidant that Sean's claim is
              impossible and that he knows just where Sean's logic went
              wrong. Neither of these people are able to produce an
              ounce of solid evidence. Once again we are left with
              little information, weighing the odds between the
              impossible and the impossibler.</p>
            <p>Sean asserts that a new and successful demo will occur,
              unannounced beforehand, in the near future. He also states
              that the previous failure will lead to more openness on
              Steorn's part, to public evidence of the reality of Orbo.
              If DrMike is right, then none of this will happen -- we'll
              never see a working Orbo, because Steorn can't make one
              and they won't fake one. As for this author, I'll keep an
              open mind to Steorn's claim until the end of the summer.
              If by then we haven't seen a working Orbo, I'll agree with
              DrMike that, for the good of his family and his employees,
              Sean McCarthy had best retire and spend some quality time
              in the care of a doctor.<br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
                "It's not the end of the Steorn story."</span></p>
          </div>
          <p>Far from disengaging from the media and quietly skulking
            away into obscurity, Sean McCarthy gave a fairly in-depth
            interview to the technology site Engadget that was published
            today. Much of it is an elaboration of what we have heard
            already: the reasons for the failure of the demo and
            Steorn's plans moving forward. Sean directly addresses the
            notion that the Orbo technology works only in the confines
            of his own mind, and confidently asserts that a successful
            demo will occur in the near future. Some excerpts follow:</p>
          <blockquote>So we will be doing a demo, again. Obviously
            people will believe it when they see it and I can understand
            the skepticism about that. It is a deferral, our guys are
            currently in the process of rebuilding some more robust
            systems and changing some parts to prevent the engineering
            thing from happening again and we'll be back out in the near
            future with it.</blockquote>
          <p>Regarding DrMike's opinion that Orbo is no more than a
            delusion on the part of Sean:</p>
          <blockquote>How can I criticize. We invited the guy to come
            from Canada to see something. He didn't see it. It's his
            opinion. He has no other basis, he has nothing else to work
            on, other than sitting and having a chat with us. I can't
            possibly criticize, Doctor Mike for what he said. It's
            exactly what I would have said, I probably would have been
            harsher if I had been in his shoes. </blockquote>
          <blockquote>Again, obviously if I'm delusional, whatever
            answer I give is going to be based on my own delusions. The
            only thing that I can say -- I can say a couple of things
            about it. First thing is that the answer that anybody
            looking at us and wants to know will ultimately be delivered
            contractually. It's going to happen whenever it happens from
            a bunch of scientists. So unless they're delusional as well,
            if they agree with us then we deal with that at the time. If
            you stand back from the failed demo and say ok, I don't
            think anybody should believe this -- I wouldn't believe this
            in the circumstances, demo or no demo -- there is a process
            that's in place that's a real process where real scientists
            are going to draw a conclusion and that conclusion will be
            made public.
            <p>The other side of it which I think is why people have
              taken the delusional route is because an awful lot of
              people had expected us to rig the demo. They expected us
              to have a hidden battery or whatever it is. If we were in
              that business, believe me, there would have been a
              spinning wheel. But we're just not in that business, the
              business of scamming people or rigging demos. It failed,
              it's prototype technology. Huge disappointment to us.
              We'll redo it. But the answers to the question -- the demo
              doesn't answer the question, it provides some thoughts
              from supporting evidence when it happens. But the answer
              to the question will be done by professionals and then
              we're either be found to be delusional or not.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>On Steorn's plans going forward:</p>
          <blockquote>Obviously we are going to have to redo the demo.
            There is no question that we are not going to do the demo.
            We will, as I said before, not pre-announce it this time. We
            will get it set up properly, but the ground rules will be
            identical. The ground rules will be physical public access
            to the device, online webcams so it will be as open as
            possible. If anybody has seen the intended device and then
            realizes that it's, well, not impossible obviously to hide a
            certain energy source, it becomes quite a convoluted
            process. So we are going to try and demonstrate the
            technology in it's simplest, simplest format in a place with
            public access where people can watch online and talk to
            people there.
            <p>That will be one thing we have -- and to invite skeptics
              along. We have to do that. We have to embrace the
              skepticism. But equally to understand, these are not
              intended to be slam dunk results, because they won't be.
              There will always be issues and rightfully so. A simple
              demo, no matter how long it lasts, isn't proof of the
              claim. Proof of the claim is scientific analysis. But we
              are going to have to do other things as well. I won't go
              into details, but the biggest mistake that we've made and
              obviously we have to learn from our mistakes was to
              pre-announce the London demo. We've paid the price for
              that, we won't do it again. But we will be doing probably
              an awful lot more than we had intended. Basically when it
              happens we'll be letting people know. It will not be that
              far away.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>A final word:</p>
          <blockquote>I've met an awful lot of disappointed people.
            People who came, who believed, who wanted to see history
            made. Disappointed skeptics, people like Doctor Mike who we
            dragged half way around the world -- and all I can do is
            apologize to them and say look it didn't work, but we are
            going to do it again. It's not the end of the Steorn story.
            Unfortunately, I'm sure that many people wish they've never
            heard of us again but we'll be back and we'll be back in the
            not too distant future.<br>

          Perhaps the only thing more impressive than claimed possession
          of an "infinite free energy" machine is the refusal to give-in
          under the weight of the world's skepticism-turned ire. "We
          screwed up," admitted Steorn's CEO Sean McCarthy yesterday
          after their failed demonstration, but "if we were here to rig
          a demo, we'd all be here watching a wheel spin." As
          shyster-Sean explains, Steorn brought three systems to London,
          one of which they got working for "about 4-hours" on Tuesday
          night. As we all know by now, it mysteriously ceased to
          function after it was moved to the display room. At that
          point, there was a breakdown of the watchmaker-quality
          bearings causing friction to "go to hell." Sean no longer
          attributes the failings to the lamp heat, lamenting only that
          his team doesn't know the cause. Moving forward Sean alluded
          to a less "covert and cryptic" Steorn as they attempt to
          regain the confidence (they had it?) of the public and more
          importantly, their shareholders who are more than likely
          discussing matters with legal counsel at this very moment.
          Still, he promised to return. Next time, however, the system
          will already be up and running before the demonstration is
          announced. While we seriously doubt they've circumvented the
          laws of our physical world, half the fun of any good scam (and
          this is a good'n) is picking apart the components to reveal
          the truth. Click-on through for the full Q&amp;A caught on
          video.<br>
          <br>
          Dead silence<br>
          <br>
          It's now been over a month since CEO Sean McCarthy or any
          other member of Steorn has spoken publicly, to either the
          press or the forums. Whether they're hard at work or falling
          apart, they're just not talking.<br>
          <br>
          The situation in the developers' club (SPDC) isn't much
          different. Apparently Steorn has given SPDC members a gag
          order, asking them not discuss the current situation. A few
          bits of information have slipped through anyway; enough to
          reveal that the SPDC doesn't know anything more about what
          Steorn's up to than do we. SPDC member my_pen_is_stuck wrote
          on July 31st, "Steorn don't even speak with the SPDC1 nowdays.
          Not a peep. Very weird." Later on August 5th he wrote, "I'm
          beginning to think that Grimer was on to something when he
          said the SPDC was a cult. Sean speaks, usual no evidence
          waffle, the SPDC bows down to kiss his ring. It's really
          fuckin' weird in there." On August 11th, GrantHodges wrote
          "There isn't any news on Steorn for this month. I'm in the
          SPDC and well . . .there isn't any news."<br>
          <br>
          Given the silence from Steorn, some have wondered whether
          they'd packed up and cleared out. Forum member Crank, who
          lives a few miles from Steorn, dropped by their office on July
          31st.<br>
          She reported back that the situation there was normal, and all
          employees were still present.<br>
          <br>
          One older item of interest that came out recently is the
          design of the demonstration unit that Steorn intends to have
          manufactured in a limited quantity (100,000), to be sold off
          as part of the public introduction of the Orbo technology. The
          device, shown below, looks like a horsehead or "nodding
          donkey" style oil pump, sitting atop an oil barrel. A video of
          this device in action was made available to the SPDC, however
          Sean stated that the motion of the prototype unit seen in the
          video was not actually generated by an Orbo. So, it proves
          nothing except that Steorn is laying plans for the public
          introduction of Orbo.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Steorn effect replicated?</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Today the Free Energy Truth blog announced that coming Friday
          will be an interview with someone who claims to have
          independently replicated the effect behind Steorn's free
          energy technology. If true, this would be the first time that
          anyone outside of Steorn has been able to replicate the effect
          and talk about it publicly. Of course, after the failed demo,
          repeated delays, and now complete silence that we've gotten
          from Steorn, it's reasonable to expect nothing less than full
          disclosure and a video of a self powered device before this
          claim is considered to be worth taking seriously. A successful
          demonstration, however, would beat Steorn to the punch and be
          the first display of a potentially revolutionary discovery.
          Further updates on this will follow as more information
          becomes available.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Update 8/31:</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The previously announced interview has been posted at the Free
          Energy Truth blog; the interviewee is a man named "Blake".
          Consensus on the Steorn forum is that this is Alton "Blake"
          Walston, a member of the SPDC who has gone by the forum handle
          ablaker2.<br>
          <br>
          Blake claims to have followed schematics provided by Sean
          McCarthy and built an Orbo device that ran continuously for at
          least 8 hours. According to his account the precise
          configuration of magnets in his device required a good deal of
          trial and error experimentation to get right, and after its
          initial 8 hour run he has thus far been unsuccessful at
          coaxing self-sustained motion from the device a second time.<br>
          <br>
          While Blake claims to be committed to getting his Orbo
          spinning again, and says he'll be sure to have a video camera
          on hand next time when it does, as it stands now Blake has
          only an anecdotal account of a one-time event to offer, with
          no objective record of any kind that it actually took place.
          It's certainly interesting to have this story brought out from
          the confines of the SPDC, but until Blake's Orbo is running
          continuously, repeatedly, and on video, it remains nothing
          more than that -- a story.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Established inventor
            validates Orbo</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          This week a video emerged showing the successful engineer and
          inventor, Thieu Knapen, discussing Steorn's technology, which
          he has personally tested. His conclusion is unambiguous: Orbo
          generates free energy.<br>
          <br>
          "Then I saw things that... I didn't believe."<br>
          <br>
          Knapen founded the Dutch company Kinetron in 1984, where he
          invented the microgenerators used in watches that are powered
          by the movement of the wearer and so do not require a battery.
          Apparently Sean McCarthy has told the SPDC that Kinetron will
          be manufacturing the Orbo motors to power the demo devices
          that are set to be manufactured to coincide with the public
          release of the Orbo technology.<br>
          <br>
          In the video Knapen is shown commenting on an early
          demonstration 'toy' designed to display higher energy output
          than input, but not designed to cycle perpetually. This video
          was made sometime before December 12th 2006, when it was
          presented to a small group at the Kinetica museum; it was also
          long ago shown to the SPDC. However, this is the first time
          that the video is available to the public. The documentary
          style editing and peppy background beat suggest that the video
          was put together as a promotional piece. It was allegedly
          found during an unrelated Google Video search by Steorn forum
          member RunningBare.<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          After 3 1/2 months of almost complete silence from Steorn, CEO
          Sean McCarthy granted an interview last week which was
          published today at the Free Energy Truth blog. The difficult
          questions were left unasked, but the interview does give a
          feeling for what Steorn's been up to lately. Here are some
          excerpts:<br>
          <br>
          On what they've been doing for the past few months:<br>
          <br>
          We continue to work on Orbo. Obviously we are looking at
          different implementations of it, more reliable implementations
          of it both mechanical and non mechanical. We’re also looking
          at the material science behind these time variant magnetic
          transactions as in what’s the real driver for them. What makes
          one material have a different response from another material?
          We’ve looked at a lot of third party research, fund some
          research and obviously do our own research into this area, we
          have managed to rule out most of the drivers to time based
          domain response (eddy currents, heat and so on) but as to why
          ferrite has a different response to Iron – well more work to
          be done.<br>
          <br>
          On where the second demo will be located:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will most likely be in Dublin, Ireland.<br>
          <br>
          On what their recently trademarked name SteornLab refers to:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An awful lot of what we have developed over
          the years has been based on tests... SteornLab relates to the
          productization of these testing technologies we’ve developed
          over the years.<br>
          <br>
          On whether Orbo creates or extracts energy:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a question of views. I would say that,
          in the same way as there is a mass/energy equivalent there is
          also a form of time/energy equivalent and whether you consider
          that energy creation or conversion is a matter of semantics.<br>
          <br>
          On whether Steorn will license Orbo for military and weapons
          applications:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s specifically precluded.<br>
          <br>
          On the development of the mechanical, as well as a solid-state
          version of Orbo:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have some engineering issues that we are
          currently resolving in terms of mechanical systems; we are
          constantly looking at ways to capture and express the energy
          in a real world environment that are simpler and simpler and
          there is nothing simpler than a solid state device. So it’s in
          the plan, but its not something that we [are] actively engaged
          in at this time.<br>
          <br>
          On whether anyone else has ever discovered the effect behind
          Orbo:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think lots of people have. I can look at
          many of the other free energy claimants and understand exactly
          how they could work. I could also see why many would be
          difficult to replicate without understanding what was
          happening.<br>
          <br>
          There are two main points that I take from this interview: 1)
          Steorn is still humming along, and still believes in what they
          have, and 2) Don't expect a second demo any time soon.<br>
          <br>
          I add the second point because Sean thinks that the second
          demo will "most likely" take place in Dublin. If it were to
          take place further off than Dublin, a good deal of planning
          would be involved; so the fact that it's still not certain
          whether it will be in Dublin or elsewhere means that they
          haven't reached the point yet of planning for an actual second
          event.<br>
          <br>
          Another curiosity is that Steorn is already looking to
          productize the testing technology they've acquired and
          developed for the purpose of testing Orbo. For them to spare
          the energy to develop a tangential line of business, does this
          mean they are running short of cash, or doubting the future
          prospects of Orbo, at least in the near term?<br>
          <br>
          Steorn is still chugging away, and most signs are that they're
          still confidant in the development of Orbo. Once again,
          there's nothing new here – the message from Steorn is, as
          usual: just you wait.<br>

          <br>
          Reader [Hjhndr] ran across an interesting set of tests and
          wanted to know if they’re brilliant or just a load of bull.
          We’re not making the call on that, but the tests on a Steorn
          Orb motor replica are worth looking at.Keep in mind, people
          used to think the earth was flat and scientists of the time
          would have sworn up and down that’s the way things were.<br>
          <br>
          The Steorn Orbo is a motor that generates more power than is
          put into it. At least according to Steorn Limited that’s what
          it does. An independent panel of scientists said otherwise a
          few years back but that didn’t stop the company from showing
          off the concept a few more times, most recently a showing in
          Dublin ended this month.<br>
          <br>
          So anyway, [Jean-Louis Naudin] took what he saw from those
          demonstrations and built a replica. He’s made several papers
          about the principle as well as his testing available online.
          There’s a lot of math, a little bit of smoke and mirrors, and
          several videos. Take a look and let us know what you think in
          the comments.<br>

          <br>
          You will find below 3 very simple experiments which can help
          you to understand the hidden principles of the Orbo motor from
          Steorn. The experiments proposed here and their explanations
          are only based on my personnal interpretation only of the Orbo
          working principle presented to the public through videos and
          photos by Sean McCarthy in Dublin and may be differ from the
          official Steorn explanations. These experiments presented here
          are the tests results of all my researches about the Orbo
          device from Steorn.<br>
          <br>
          These experiments are very simple to do and you can check
          these facts by yourself with few equipement. So, these key
          experiments are intend to demonstrate the main effect in the
          Orbo device which can produce free energy from moving magnets.<br>
          <br>
          To conduct these experiments, you need these parts:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 2 plastic boxes (the size of mines is
          62x82x32mm),<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 2 strong neodymium magnets (I have used
          NdFeB 27 MGoe magnets, 22 mm diam, 10 mm thick),<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 1 toroidal coil, with a ferromagnetic
          core (grade 3E25) specific inductance Al=3820 (23x14x7 mm)
          (µ=6000) wound CW with 7.5 m of 4/10 mm copper wire,<br>
          <br>
          The 1st plastic box is used to install the moving magnets
          which will be used to simulate the rotor magnet. The neodymium
          magnets are installed as shown in the photo below :<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 610px;
              height: 453px;" alt="" src="orboexpl2jln.jpg" height="453"
              width="610"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          A 3 mm foam spacer has been added so as to set an air gap
          between the boxes.<br>
          <br>
          The 2nd plastic box is used to simulate the toroïdal stator
          coil of the Orbo. The coil has been installed in the box as
          shown below :<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 539px;
              height: 350px;" alt="" src="orboexpl3jln.jpg"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Two sheets of carbon have been fixed on the sides of the box
          to maintain the alignement with the moving magnet box.<br>
          <br>
          The final setup is shown below :<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 707px;
              height: 434px;" alt="" src="orboexpl1jln.jpg"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          The coil MUST BE PERFECTLY ALIGNED BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS.
          This is very important !!!<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 640px;
              height: 480px;" alt="" src="orboexpl5jln.jpg"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          There is a 8 mm air gap between the magnets and the toroïdal
          coil.<br>
          <br>
          The measured coil Rdc is 1.1O ohms.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">1 - First key experiment :
            Demonstrating the inductance changing effect</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 640px;
              height: 507px;" alt="" src="orboexpl6jln.jpg"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          One of the key point of the Orbo principle is the change of
          the inductance of the toroïdal stator coil while the magnets
          approach it. To conduct this experiment, you need only to
          connect an inductance meter to the output of the coil.<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 640px;
              height: 495px;" alt="" src="orboexpl7jln.jpg"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Without the magnets the measured inductance is 236 mH. This
          will be named the REF position.<br>
          <br>
          When the magnets box is placed on the side of the stator box,
          the measured inductance drops to 179 mH.<br>
          This will be named the TDC position (Top Dead Center).<br>
          <br>
          This very simple experiment demonstrates that there is an
          inductance change effect when the magnets box is at the TDC
          position. It is very important to recall that the toroïdal
          stator coil must be very precisely aligned between the two
          magnets, if this is not the case the following experiments
          won't work correctly.<br>
          <br>
          The first Orbo effect has been demonstrated with this 1st
          experiment.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">2 - Second key experiment :
            Demonstrating that the magnetic attration force is canceled
            by the pulse.</span><br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 800px;
              height: 300px;" alt="" src="orboexpl8jln.jpg"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          This experiment is very simple, you need to hold the stator
          box vertically while the magnets box hangs magnetically under
          the stator box. You may notice that the magnets box is
          attracted by the ferromagnetic material of the toroïdal coil
          due to the magnetic energy. This is here a FREE ENERGY
          MAGNETIC FORCE, you don't need to power the coil to attract
          the magnets.<br>
          <br>
          Now, if you power the coil at about 6 Volts DC, the magnetic
          force attraction vanishes and the magnets box drops to the
          ground...<br>
          <br>
          This is an important key experiment here to understand the
          Orbo working principle: Contrary to a common motor, in the
          case of the Orbo motor, when you apply current to the stator
          coil, it is only to release the magnet AFTER it has produced
          FREE MECHANICAL WORK !!! Think about this...<br>
          <br>
          The second Orbo effect has been demonstrated with this
          experiment.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">3 - Third key experiment : NO
            EXTRA POWER is needed to release the magnet from the TDC
            position to the REF position</span><br>
          <br>
          Here, a bit more complicated experiment, but this is one of
          the most important experiment about the Orbo principle.<br>
          <br>
          A function generator is connected on the optocoupler input of
          my Steorn Orbo v4.1 driver. The function generator has been
          programmed so as to send the same shape of pulse sent by the
          motor at full speed. Below you will find the diagram.<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 956px;
              height: 558px;" alt="" src="orbopulsediagjln.gif"><br>

          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 559px;
              height: 551px;" alt="" src="orboexpl9.jpg"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Look at the video of the test below, you will notice that the
          alignment of the stator coil with the middle line of the
          magnets is very critical at the "TDC position".<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight:
              bold;">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3RLp3ezs1Q&amp;feature=player_embedded</span><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          The voltage and the current have been measured across the coil
          with a digital oscilloscope at the REF position (no magnets)
          and at the TDC position (with the magnets).<br>
          <br>
          Below you will find the results.<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 640px;
              height: 468px;" alt="" src="obref.jpg"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Below, the current curve at the REF position (white curve) has
          been memorised and superposed to the current curve (yellow
          curve) at the TDC position. You may notice that the two
          current curves are identical...<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 640px;
              height: 468px;" alt="" src="obtdcjln.jpg"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          The Power (V*I) has been computed for the two positions ( TDC
          and REF ) and you may notice that the power curves are also
          identical...<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 640px;

          </div>
          <br>
          You may also notice the fast rise of the current and then its
          horizontal shape.<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 1024px;

          <br>
          A precisely machined device and a very fine alignement of the
          toroïdal coils is the key of the success...<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 602px;
              height: 405px;" alt="" src="orbojln.jpg"><br>

              style="font-weight: bold;">
          </div>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">To summarize</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          It is very important that the toroïdal stator coils must be
          perfectly aligned with the middle point between the two
          magnets :<br>
          <br>
          The magnets must have the equal strength,<br>
          the rotor must be perfectly balanced and must not have a
          wobble,<br>
          the rotation axis of the rotor must be frictionless.<br>
          <br>
          These KEY EXPERIMENTS about the Orbo motor principle presented
          here demonstrate fully that :<br>
          <br>
          KEY 1 : The coil inductance decreases when the magnet goes
          from the REF position (far from the stator coil) to the TDC
          position (close to the stator coil).<br>
          <br>
          KEY 2 : The mechanical power is produced only by the
          attraction of the magnet by the ferrite of the stator, this is
          a FREE WORK produced by the conversion of the magnetic
          potential energy into kinetic energy. The current used to
          power the stator coil is used only to release the magnet AFTER
          it has produced a free mechanical work.<br>
          <br>
          KEY 3 : The electrical power (Current * Voltage ) needed to
          energize the toroïdal stator coil at the TDC position is EQUAL
          to the electrical power for the REF position and this is fully
          independant of the position of the magnet of the rotor Vs the
          toroïdal stator coil. The electrical input power is fully
          decoupled from the output mechanical power.<br>
          <br>
          KEY 4 : When the magnet leaves the TDC, there is a magnetic
          energy gain in the stator coil because the current remains
          constant during the increase of the inductance.<br>
          <br>
          Importants tips for the best tuning :<br>
          <br>
          Use two strong neodymium magnets oriented N-S towards the
          toroïdal coil.<br>
          <br>
          The plane of the toroïdal coil must be perfectly aligned with
          the middle point of two magnets.<br>
          <br>
          The gap between the coil and the magnets must be tuned with a
          scope so as to find the point where there is no change in the
          shape of the current curve between the TDC and the REF
          position, this tuning is very critical.<br>
          <br>
          Use high permeability ferromagnetic material ( high
          permeability ferrite core or better Nanoperm core ).<br>
          <br>
          Don't forget that the free mechanical power produced by the
          magnetic attraction of the magnets towards the ferromagnetic
          core has no link with the electrical power spent to release
          the magnets.<br>

          Interesting document to read:<br>
          <br>
          Comments from Jean-Louis Naudin: Why this patent, below, is
          interesting for the Orbo motor ?<br>
          <br>
          The patent below is very interesting because it says that in a
          common toroidal coil, each layer is equal to a "one turn coil"
          whose axis is parallel to the axis of the toroid. So, one
          layer of toroidal coil is equal to a flat coil of one turn and
          thus it can tap or produce EMF outside the torus. So, to
          counter this interference effect, the only thing to do is ,
          for each layer of the toroidal coil, to wound a one turn flat
          coil along the circumference of the toroid so as to produce a
          magnetic field which nullify the virtual one turn coil created
          by each layer of the toroidal coil... This is very simple and
          a very important thing to do for canceling the weak CEMF
          induced in the toroid by the motion of the magnet and this is
          one of the most important key of the Orbo motor... <br>

          <br>
          Use of inductors or coils is well know as for storing
          electrical energy. As the electromagnetic parameters of
          inductors increase however, severe problems are encountered
          therewith, for example in power distribution systems of
          electric utilities. Because of Lorentz Forces which result
          from the interaction of currents with magnetic fields,
          structural integrity becomes a primary consideration. Magnetic
          fields which radiate externally from many inductors are also
          an important consideration because energy losses result
          therefrom, and a hazard to life and equipment.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention is in the field of electromagnetic systems
      and induction.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Inductance in an electric circuit occurs where a change in the
      current flowing through the circuit induces an electromotive force
      (EMF) which opposes the change in current.<br>
      <br>
      Mutual inductance is well known in the art, most commonly found in
      transformers. It is typically defined as a measure of the relation
      between the change of current flow in one circuit to the electric
      potential generated in another by mutual induction.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The invention disclosed herein relates to an electromagnetic
      system and more particularly an electromagnetic system with no
      mutual inductance and an inductance gain.<br>
      <br>
      The electromagnetic system disclosed herein has four defined
      states of magnetic interaction which are switched in a defined
      sequence.<br>
      <br>
      The system consists of a minimum of two solenoids, wired in
      series, one mounted either side of a toroid.<br>
      <br>
      The first of the defined magnetic interactions, called step one,
      takes place when there is a voltage applied across the toroid.<br>
      <br>
      The second of the defined magnetic interactions, called step two,
      takes place when there is a voltage applied across the solenoids.<br>
      <br>
      The third of the defined magnetic interactions, called step three,
      takes place when there is no voltage applied across the toroid.<br>
      <br>
      The fourth of the defined magnetic interaction sequences, called
      step four, takes place when there is no voltage applied across the
      solenoids.<br>
      <br>
      For step one, a voltage is applied across the toroid.<br>
      <br>
      For step two, after the completion of the current rise in the
      toroid, a voltage is applied across the solenoids.<br>
      <br>
      For step three, after the completion of the current rise in the
      solenoids, the voltage across the toroid is switched off.<br>
      <br>
      For step four, after the completion of the current fall in the
      toroids, the voltage across the solenoids is switched off.<br>
      <br>
      Following this sequence of four steps, there is an inductance gain
      on the solenoids which is due to the saturation of the toroidal
      core material caused by the current flowing through the toroid.
      There is also an inductance gain on the toroid due to domain
      rotation of the toroidal core material caused by the current
      flowing in the solenoids. Another by-product of this sequence is
      that there is no mutual inductance between the toroid and the two
      solenoids.<br>
      <br>
      By changing the permeability of the coil's cores the inductive
      energy between the toroid and the solenoids is changed which leads
      to an inductive energy gain.<br>
      From Figure 2 it can be seen that at step two there is an
      inductance gain on the solenoids. The presence of the
      current-carrying toroid results in a faster rise time for the
      solenoids than would otherwise be the case.<br>
      <br>
      The curves entitled Voltage Control and Current Control show
      respectively the voltage across the solenoids and the current
      flowing through the solenoids without current flowing through the
      toroid.<br>
      <br>
      The curves entitled Voltage Active and Current Active show
      respectively the voltage across the solenoids and the current
      flowing through the solenoids with current flowing through the
      toroid.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 3, it can be seen that at step three, when the voltage
      is switched off in the toroid, there is an inductance gain in the
      toroid as a result of domain rotation in the toroid core material
      due to current flowing through the solenoids.<br>
      <br>
      The curves entitled Voltage Control and Current Control show
      respectively the voltage across the toroid and the current flowing
      through the toroid without current flowing through the solenoids.<br>
      <br>
      The curves entitled Voltage Active and Current Active show
      respectively the voltage across the toroid and the current flowing
      through the toroid with current flowing through the solenoids.<br>
      <br>
      It can be seen that the fall time is longer when there is current
      flowing through the solenoids therefore showing the inductance
      gain at step 3.<br>
      <br>
      The overall sequence of these steps is illustrated in Figure 4. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </span><br>
      <br>
      The present invention is in the field of electric motors. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </span><br>
      <br>
      Electric motors are well known in the art and are utilized in a
      wide range of applications ranging from home appliances to large
      scale industrial use to transport. <br>
      <br>
      The electric motor has changed little since its inception in the
      sense that its operation is based upon magnetic interactions,
      namely the repulsive and attractive nature of magnetic
      interactions between magnetic bodies. It is the controlled
      interaction of these magnetic interactions which allows an
      electric motor to create a rotational motion which can in turn be
      translated into an increase in kinetic energy of the system's
      rotor. <br>
      <br>
      What has changed is the materials science of the components of an
      electric motor. Known in the art are permanent magnets which
      exhibit ever increasing inherent magnetization levels. Insulation
      techniques for copper wire and other conductive materials allow
      for the function of an electric motor over a wide operational
      range. The development of soft ferromagnetic materials enables the
      use of materials which have a high permeability but low remanence
      values coupled with low coercivity characteristics and such
      materials exhibit a narrow and square hysteresis curve or loop. <br>
      <br>
      The hysteresis loop shows the history dependent nature of a
      magnetization effect on a magnetic material. For example, if a
      suitable material, which has no magnetization levels, is saturated
      for the first time it will retain most or all of its magnetization
      once the external magnetic field used to achieve this saturation
      is removed. This is the fundamental difference between a permanent
      magnetic material and a soft ferromagnetic material in that once a
      soft ferromagnetic material is removed from its influencing
      magnetization field its magnetization will drop back to zero. <br>
      <br>
      In the field of electromagnetic systems and research, advances
      have been made in component and equipment functionality, such as
      in power supplies, current measurement and differential probes,
      and materials choice for rotors and optical encoders or similar
      switching controllers. An important advance is the availability of
      low friction bearings, typically passive magnetic bearings, which
      provide for restraint of the spindle and allow its attached rotor
      to rotate about a defined axis at the lowest possible friction
      cost. <br>
      <br>
      There are several aspects of classical physics which are relevant
      to this area of electric motors. Faraday's Law is one of the
      fundamental laws of electromagnetism. In essence the Law states
      that the electromotive force generated is proportional to the rate
      of change of magnetic flux. <br>
      Following on from Faraday's Law is Lenz's Law, which states that
      an induced current is always in such a direction as to oppose the
      motion or change causing it. This Law links electromagnetism to
      Newton's Third Law which states that for every action there is an
      equal but opposite reaction. <br>
      <br>
      The implications of these Laws for electric motors are as follows:
      Counter electromotive force, or CEMF, is the electromotive force
      or voltage that will push against the applied current and is only
      caused by a changing magnetic field. Back electromotive force, or
      BEMF, is a more specific term to electric motors, and is an
      induced voltage that occurs where there is relative motion between
      the armature or rotor of the motor and the system's external
      magnetic field. CEMF or BEMF negatively affects the efficiency of
      electric motors known in the art. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The concept of the basic operation of an electric motor is very
      well understood in that an input in the form of electrical energy
      is converted into an output in the form of an increase in the
      kinetic energy of the system's rotor. This invention sets out a
      motor system that can achieve the same operation but without the
      associated counter/back electromotive force due to the motion of
      the rotor. <br>
      <br>
      The invention disclosed herein relates to an electromagnetic motor
      system and more particularly an electric motor with no
      counter/back electromotive force (EMF) which is typically present
      due to the rotation of the system's rotor. <br>
      <br>
      The invention disclosed herein relates to a motor system which has
      two defined states of a magnetic interaction which are switched in
      a defined sequence. <br>
      <br>
      The system consists of a minimum of two permanent magnets of a
      high grade and magnetization level attached to the outer edge of
      the motor's rotor. The permanent magnets are positioned adjacent
      to each other such that their polarities are opposed i.e.
      North-South and South-North. Fixed with respect to the rotation of
      the rotor is an electromagnetic coil with a soft ferromagnetic
      core. The permanent magnets are positioned on the rotor so that
      they are symmetrically arranged with respect to the coil and soft
      ferromagnetic core in the direction of the system's axis. Their
      position is also such that as the system's rotor rotates they will
      both always be at the same angular displacement from the fixed
      coil and soft ferromagnetic core. <br>
      <br>
      The soft ferromagnetic coil in this particular embodiment is of a
      ferrite material with a composition of Manganese and Zinc, though
      similar soft ferromagnetic materials such as those of a Nickel and
      Zinc composition may be utilized. <br>
      <br>
      The first of the defined magnetic interaction sequences, called
      state one, takes place when there is no voltage applied across the
      electromagnetic coil. <br>
      <br>
      In the second of the two interactions, initiated through the use
      of an optical disk and sensor set-up, a voltage of ample magnitude
      is applied across the coil to produce a sufficiently strong
      current to saturate the ferrite core of the electromagnetic coil.
      This is called state two of the system. <br>
      <br>
      Switching takes place when the permanent magnets on the rotor are
      at their closest to the ferrite core. <br>
      <br>
      During state one when there is no voltage applied across the coil
      and the rotor is free to rotate towards the fixed coil and its
      ferromagnetic core, a torque will act on the rotor to cause it to
      move towards an angular position so that the permanent magnets and
      soft ferromagnetic core reach their closest point. <br>
      <br>
      Torque exists on the system's rotor due to the fact that the soft
      ferromagnetic core will be polarized by the fields of the
      permanent magnets on the rotor in a direction vertical to the
      plane of the rotor. This polarization of the soft ferrite core
      will cause a force of attraction to exist between the permanent
      magnets on the system's rotor and the soft ferromagnetic core. The
      polarization of the ferrite is such that a south pole is created
      to oppose the presented north pole of one of the permanent
      magnets, and the south pole of the other permanent magnet will
      create a north pole. The areas of magnetization on the ferrite
      will be substantially equal and opposite due to the symmetric
      nature of the position of the ferrite core relative to the two
      permanent magnets. This torque, combined with the angular
      displacement that it causes will increase the kinetic energy of
      the system's rotor. <br>
      <br>
      When the permanent magnets are at their closest point to the soft
      ferromagnetic core, stage two is initiated by a voltage being
      applied across the coil of sufficient magnitude to cause the
      ferromagnetic core to become magnetically saturated. Magnetic
      saturation and hence the voltage applied to effect same, is a
      function of the soft ferromagnetic core material , that is to say
      that the current supplied is directly dictated by the current
      required to saturate the ferrite core in this instance in a manner
      that the ferrite core is polarized horizontally. The force of
      attraction that existed between the soft ferromagnetic core and
      the permanent magnets will now be substantially reduced due to the
      fact that in its saturated state the ferromagnetic core will be
      magnetically polarized horizontally. <br>
      <br>
      There will be no net force (and hence torque) between the
      stationary coil and the permanent magnets because the force that
      exists between the coil and each permanent magnet will be of an
      equal magnitude but opposite direction. The torque acting between
      the soft ferromagnetic core and the permanent magnets on the
      system's rotor, combined with the angular displacement will cause
      the system's rotor to lose kinetic energy. <br>
      <br>
      Due to the net magnetization vectors of the soft ferromagnetic
      core in its saturated magnetization of state two being lower than
      in state one, there is a lower net torque acting on the rotor.
      However since angular displacement in both states is the same, the
      overall result of the sequenced action of both states of the
      interaction will be an increase in the kinetic energy of the
      system's rotor. <br>
      <br>
      Due to the symmetry of the permanent magnetic arrangement on the
      system's rotor with respect to the fixed coil, there is no net
      rate of change of flux through the coil during the motion of the
      system's rotor, and hence no induced electromotive force to act
      against the voltage applied across the coil (i.e. no counter or
      back EMF). <br>
      <br>
      During normal operation the system will change from state one to
      state two when the permanent magnets are closest to the fixed soft
      ferromagnetic core and back to state one when the rotor's
      permanent magnets are furthest away from the fixed soft
      ferromagnetic core. <br>
      <br>
      The reversal of the current direction has no meaningful change on
      the angular displacement direction of the rotor as it moves
      through state one and state two. That is to say that changing the
      current will not have any significant change to the kinetic energy
      of the rotor as a positive torque component will continue to be
      added to the system by the symmetric attractive forces between the
      permanent magnets and the ferrite core. When the current is
      reversed the ferrite will again be saturated and polarized
      horizontally but with the polarity reversed. Again there is no net
      rate of change of flux through the coil during the motion of the
      system's rotor, and hence no induced electromotive force to act
      against the voltage applied across the coil. <br>
      <br>
      The current supply direction will dictate the angular displacement
      direction of the systems rotor. When the current is reversed the
      pulse motor will act like a magnetic brake. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention
      illustrated in Figs. 1-6, two permanent magnets 3 are mounted on a
      polycarbonate rotor 2. The polycarbonate disk has a diameter of
      99.5mm and a height of 11.6mm with a cavity in the center of
      diameter 12.1mm for an adapter bushing of a brass material, which
      couples the rotor 2 to the spindle 1. The adaptor bushing has a
      diameter of 12mm and is designed to restrain or couple the
      polycarbonate disk 2 to the spindle 1. <br>
      <br>
      The spindle is made of a stainless steel material and has a
      diameter of 6.25mm and a total length of 200mm. It is restrained
      in its rotational axis by a pair of passive magnetic bearings 7
      which provide axial and radial rigidity while offering
      exceptionally low friction characteristics. Each of the passive
      magnetic bearings has two axially magnetized rings, which each
      exhibit at least one pair of north and south poles. The magnetized
      rings are positioned in a manner where the poles are in a
      repulsive magnetic interaction such that the plane of symmetry
      which separates the like poles lies perpendicular to the axis of
      the rotation of a shaft and this radially constrains the movement
      of the shaft. Axial rigidity is added to the system by the use of
      ceramic bearings and related axial retaining mechanisms, as known
      in the art, on one of the ring magnets thus maintaining the
      magnetic bearing in an otherwise unstable axial plane. <br>
      <br>
      The permanent magnets 3 are of a N35H grade and cylindrical in
      shape with length and diameter of 10mm. The system consists of two
      permanent magnets 3 attached to the rotor 2 of the motor with
      opposite magnetic polarities as shown in Fig. 1. The permanent
      magnets are positioned on the rotor 2 so that they are
      symmetrically arranged with respect to the system's coil 5 and its
      soft ferromagnetic core 4 in the direction of the system's axis.
      That is, the permanent magnets exist on the x-plane with the shaft
      being positioned in the y-plane, as per the x, y plane identifier
      14 in Fig 5. A counterbalance 11 of brass material, of the same
      weight (11.8g) as the two permanent magnets 3, is added to the
      system's rotor approximately 180 degrees away from the permanent
      magnets, again positioned in the symmetric manner as the permanent
      magnets 3 with respect to the direction of the system's axis. <br>
      <br>
      The soft ferromagnetic core 4 is a sintered ferrite with a
      composition of Manganese and Zinc from Magnet Sales of Swindon,
      United Kingdom, part number RDSF01556. It is of length 9.45mm and
      it is cut down to 8.7mm to sit substantially within the
      electromagnetic coil's 5 core. The electromagnetic coil 5 is wound
      with insulated and bonded copper wire of 25 American Wire Gauge
      (AWG), with a core diameter of 9.6mm and a total of 360 turns. <br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 6 the direction of the angular displacement 12 is shown.
      As the system's rotor 2 travels on this angular displacement it
      will come into an angular range where the magnetic field of both
      permanent magnets 3 can act on the ferrite core 4. The permanent
      magnets are positioned on the rotor so that they are symmetrically
      arranged with respect to the system's coil and soft ferromagnetic
      core and as such they will act on the core in a manner that
      results in an attractive force or torque acting on the rotor. In
      turn the permanent magnets will magnetize the core in a manner
      that the two forces acting on the bodies are substantially equal
      but opposite. <br>
      <br>
      Fig. 2 illustrates the magnetization effect the permanent magnets
      3 will have when they have been allowed to rotate about an angular
      path so that they are as close as possible to the ferrite core 4.
      From Fig. 2 it can be seen that the ferrite will become magnetized
      in a manner that there are two opposite polarity magnetized
      regions vertically with respect to the rotor so that the presented
      north pole of the permanent magnet will create an opposite south
      pole on the ferrite and conversely the presented south pole of the
      other permanent magnet will create a north pole on the ferrite
      core. <br>
      In Fig. 4 the electromagnetic coil 6, with its ferrite core 4, has
      a voltage applied to it such that the current across the coil is
      approximately 4Amps and this is of sufficient magnitude to cause
      the soft ferromagnetic core 4 to become magnetically saturated.
      This firing angle, that is the angular position at which the
      voltage is applied across the coil, is represented in Fig. 4 as
      the 180 degree mark 13. The application of the voltage is switched
      by an optical reader 9, in this instance a Sunx 4EPK, having being
      activated by an optical disk 10 which has a diameter of 28mm and
      is coupled to the spindle. The optical disk and its reader
      presents a square wave signal to the system which results in an
      open and closed signal being relayed to a solid state relay 8
      depending on whether the reader is seeing the opaque or clear
      section of the disk. The disk is configured so that the current is
      only allowed to flow when the system is in State Two and no
      current flows when the system is in State One. The solid state
      relay is from Croydom, model SSC 1000-25-24 and is rated for a
      maximum output of 25 Amps based on a 24 volt feed. <br>
      <br>
      The voltage feed is supplied by an ISO Tech IPS-2303, Laboratory
      DC Power Supply. As per Fig. 4 the electromagnetic coil 5 does not
      have a voltage applied to it from 0 degrees to 179 degrees and the
      electromagnetic coil 6 has a voltage applied to it from 180 degree
      to 360 degrees. This is achieved by the optical disk having an
      open circuit setting from 0 to 179 degrees and conversely
      controlling a closed circuit, with the solid state relay and an
      applied voltage from 180 degrees to 360 degrees. <br>
      <br>
      In this embodiment Fig. 5 presents all of the system's components
      and in turn the positional relationship to one another at a
      particular angle, in this instance the 0 degree mark as set out in
      Fig. 4. <br>
      <br>
      Shown in Fig. 7, a further illustrative embodiment comprises a
      polycarbonate base 14, 200x200mm in size, of height 30mm with
      20x20mm bevelled corners. A number of cut outs and mounts are
      provided to facilitate assembly, the most notable being a 39mm
      diameter hole 15 provided in the centre of the base 14. Two
      polycarbonate stands 16, 17, both 100mm tall, 60mm wide and 28mm
      deep are mounted on the base 14 and another polycarbonate bracket
      18 is mounted across the top of stands 16 and 17. Bracket 18 is
      172mm long, 60mm wide and 30mm deep, with a 39mm diameter hole 19
      in its centre, positioned such that it is aligned with the hole 15
      in the main base 14. <br>
      <br>
      The spindle 1 is mounted and positioned through the 39mm holes 15,
      19 in the base 14 and the bracket 18, respectively, utilizing
      similar low-friction magnetic bearings 7 as described earlier.
      Additional components include a micrometer head 24 attached to the
      spindle 1 , collars 25, nuts 26, ring magnets 27, bushings 28, and
      clamp collar 29. In one embodiment the micrometer head 24 is made
      of stainless steel; the collars 25, nuts 26, bushings 28, and
      clamp collar 29 are acetal. A tungsten-carbide ball 30 rests atop
      the spindle 1. <br>
      <br>
      As shown in Figs. 8a-8d, four additional polycarbonate brackets 20
      are mounted on the base 14. These brackets 20 are broadly
      triangular in shape with squared-off edges, 70mm tall, 71mm wide
      and 30mm deep. Each of these brackets 20 is provided with a
      cut-out 21 at 41.5mm from its base, said cut-out being 15mm tall,
      27mm wide and 27mm deep. The brackets 20 are each mounted on the
      diagonals of the base 14 such that the cut-out 21 is facing
      towards the centre of the base 14. Positioned within the cut-outs
      21 of the polycarbonate brackets 20 are four toroidal coils 22.
      These coils 22 are comprised of a Magnetec M-059 torus core, with
      a 120-turn winding utilizing American Wire Gauge 27 copper wire. <br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 9, a spindle 1 has attached to it several
      components of the embodiment. The spindle 1 is of a rigid epoxy
      material and is 130mm in length, with a diameter of 12mm over the
      central 100mm, and diameter of 8.1mm for 15mm at either end. Also
      attached to the spindle is an optical disk 10. This optical disk
      10, in conjunction with similar control equipment to that
      described earlier including an optical switch 23, relay (not
      shown), and power supply (not shown) provides for four instances
      per revolution where the toroidal coils 22 are supplied with
      current. Current is supplied to the coils 22 when each of the
      pairs of magnets 3 mounted on the rotor 2 is exactly aligned with
      one of the coils 22 and then switched off until the next instance
      when the magnet pairs 3 and the coils 22 are aligned. The current
      is supplied over 25 degrees of revolution for each alignment. <br>
      <br>
      The rotor 2 is of polycarbonate and is 100mm diameter and 24mm
      tall. At each of the four principal cardinal points it is provided
      with a pair of cut-outs on its vertical exterior side, each of
      these being 10.1mm in diameter, 10mm deep. These cut-outs hold
      pairs of permanent magnets 3 for a total of 8 magnets. In this
      embodiment the magnets 3 are 10x10mm cylindrically shaped, of type
      NdFeb N38H. The magnets 3 are mounted one above the other. In this
      illustrative embodiment the upper magnet 3 of each pair is mounted
      with its North pole facing outwards and the lower magnet 3 of each
      pair is mounted with its South pole facing outward. The air gap
      between the magnet pairs 3 and the toroidal coils 22 is 10mm in
      this embodiment, although that can be adjusted by moving the
      brackets 20. <br>
      <br>
      Figs. 10-12 show alternate views of an illustrative embodiment
      with the above-mentioned components. As shown in Fig. 12, the base
      14, bracket 18, and stands 16, 17 may be assembled using machine
      screws 31 and machine nuts 32 as shown, or by using other
      appropriate fasteners, an adhesive, or solvent welding. <br>
      <br>
      While the invention has been described with reference to
      illustrative embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled
      in the art that various other changes, omissions, and/or additions
      may be made and substantial equivalents may be substituted for
      elements thereof with departing from the spirit and scope of the
      invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a
      particular situation or material to the teaching of the invention
      without departing from the scope thereof. Therefore, it is
      intended that the invention not be limited to the particular
      embodiment disclosed for carrying out this invention, but that the
      invention will include all embodiments, falling within the scope
      of the appended claims.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention is in the field of bearings systems,
      and more particularly relates to passive magnetic bearings for
      providing radial and axial restraint in rotary systems.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] This invention relates to control of rotating mechanical
      systems, specifically the requirement to restrain the relative
      movement of two or more elements of such a system. A wide variety
      of bearings exist which attempt to address this requirement,
      ranging from simple ball bearings to complex electromagnetic
      assemblies.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Ball bearings are well known in the art and are utilized in
      thousands of devices. Improvements in materials technology, such
      as the use of ceramics, and enhanced raceway designs have
      addressed many of the inherent issues with traditional bearings,
      such as friction and lubrication.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] At the other end of the spectrum, advances in magnetic
      materials and magnetic levitation technology have given rise to
      active magnetic bearings which overcome the issues associated with
      direct contact between moving parts although they present a
      different set of challenges related to their complex control
      requirements.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0005] The invention disclosed herein relates to a means of
      providing radial and axial stability using passive magnetic
      bearings in conjunction with ceramic ball bearings and associated
      structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The passive magnetic bearings disclosed herein have an
      exceptionally low friction couple whilst exhibiting radial and
      axial rigidity.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In one illustrative embodiment, passive magnetic bearing is
      made up of a large axially magnetized ring shaped magnet, and a
      less large axially magnetized ring shaped magnet. Both magnets
      have at least one pair of negative and positive poles with field
      lines which emanate in an axial manner, that is, a magnetic field
      shape which is perpendicular to an axial cross section of the
      magnets.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] When the less large magnetic ring is positioned inside the
      open area of the large magnetic ring, the field of the less large
      magnetic ring and the magnetic field of the large magnetic ring
      will rapidly produce both a restorative and repulsive force such
      that a levitation effect will be acting upon the less large
      magnetic ring compared to the large magnetic ring.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The large magnetic ring is embedded in a non-magnetic
      material and this housing is designed so that no displacement of
      the housing or the large magnetic ring is allowed. The housing
      also allows for the less large ring magnet to sit directly within
      the internal open area of the larger ring magnet. The less large
      ring magnet is restrained by the following mechanisms: two sets of
      stainless steel axial thrust bearings and a number of ceramic ball
      bearings, all of which are housed in two cages.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The resultant precise positioning of the less large ring
      magnet is such that the two ring magnets have their positive and
      negative poles aligned such that the net forces, or lines of
      force, acting between the magnetic rings are close to or equal to
      zero. Any displacement experienced by the less large ring magnet
      is mechanically corrected by the ceramic bearings in conjunction
      with a magnetic correction relating to the opposing fields of the
      two ring magnets seeking their lowest energy or force state, thus
      realigning the less large magnetic ring back to a predetermined
      home position.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] This system is of a magneto-mechanical nature and requires
      no circuitry. It has a variety of applications which require a
      friction minimizing bearing operation. The removal of friction
      through the levitation effect exhibited by this magnetic bearing
      system through the non-contact nature of the shaft and its
      attached less large ring magnet, coupled with the passive nature
      of this system, allows for non-contact rotation for both low and
      high speed systems integration.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] One of the known impediments to such a system is eddy
      current losses and to counter these, materials within the system
      are chosen for their lack of conductivity and/or are of a high
      electrical resistivity value. Another issue typical of a magnetic
      bearing system is losses due to hysteresis effects which in turn
      are due to changing magnetic fields. Such hysteresis effects are
      removed or minimized to such an extent that they are not a
      significant loss due to reduced magnetic field changes directly
      related to the fact that the large and less large ring magnets are
      radially restrained in a stable repulsive magnetic field by said
      magnetic field interaction and also that the axial movement of the
      less large ring magnet is substantially reduced, such that the
      overall magnetic bearing systems operates in a manner that allows
      for a near zero force to be acting on the two ring magnets and as
      such the system exhibits little or no magnetic field changes and
      thus little or no hysteresis effects or losses.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Due to the rigid nature of this magnetic bearing system,
      this system can be used as a single unit or in a plurality of
      implementations and the related magnetic levitation of the shaft
      allows for little or no contact on the shaft pivot points, thereby
      vastly reducing or completely diminishing pivot point friction.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0019] In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention
      a large axially magnetized ring magnet 1 and a less large axially
      magnetized ring magnet 2 are positioned inside a housing 6. The
      housing 6, manufactured from Acetal, is circular in shape with a
      diameter of 43 mm and a depth of 9 mm comes in two
      pre-manufactured parts, which are mirror images of each other.
      Each housing piece exhibits three step-down cut outs. The largest
      of these is found 8 mm from the outer diameter of the housing
      piece. This first cut out has a diameter of 30 mm, the second
      largest cut out has a diameter of 24.4 mm and the smallest has a
      diameter of 11.5 mm. It is within these cut outs in this
      illustrative embodiment that the various bearing components are
      housed.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] As shown in FIG. 2 the two ring magnets 1 and 2 exhibit at
      least one pair of north and south poles. The two magnets 1 and 2
      have the same width and are constrained within the housing such
      that the both the outer and inner edges of the ring magnets are in
      the same y plane symmetry. The magnets 1 and 2 are positioned in
      such a manner that they exert a repulsive magnetic field on each
      other. In this embodiment the outer diameter for the large magnet
      1 is 30 mm, its inner diameter is 22 mm and its depth is 6 mm. For
      the less large magnet 2, its outer diameter is 18.6 mm, its inner
      diameter is 8.2 mm and its depth is 6 mm. Both the large ring
      magnet 1 and the less large ring magnet 2 are made from NdFeB 35
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] FIG. 2. and FIG. 3 illustrate the magnetic pole positions
      of the two ring magnets, which is such that a restorative force is
      acting between the two magnetic bodies 1 and 2 so that they are
      magnetically and mechanically restrained in this predetermined
      position. This effect allows for a shaft 8 (FIG. 3), which is
      attached to the less large magnetic ring 2 by way of a stainless
      steel sleeve 7. The stainless steel sleeve 7 is made of stainless
      steel 316, and has an outer diameter of 8.2 mm, an inner diameter
      of 6 mm and is 20 mm in length.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] It follows that a levitation effect is experienced by the
      shaft 8 which is radially constrained by both the levitation
      effect and the restorative magnetic effect outlined in this
      particular embodiment of this invention. That is to say that where
      the radial displacement of the centre of the less large ring
      magnet 2 is zero from the centre of the large ring magnet 1 then
      the force acting on the less large ring magnet 2 is zero Newtons.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The radial stiffness of this system is inversely
      proportional to the air gap between the large ring magnet 1 and
      less large magnetic ring 2, and its associated stainless steel
      sleeve 7 with its attached shaft 8. That is to say that the
      smaller the air gap between the ring magnets 1 and 2, the lower
      the propensity of the less large ring magnet 2 and its associated
      stainless steel sleeve 7 with its attached shaft 8, to experience
      radial displacement. Accordingly the spring constant is at its
      most beneficial level at this air gap which is fixed consequently
      in conjunction to achievement of an invariant total system
      magnetic field whether the magnetic materials, with their inherent
      magnetic fields, of the combined fields are in a stationary
      position or rotational plane of movement. The spring constant
      deals in this particular embodiment with the relationship between
      the distance of the two ring magnets, 1 and 2, and the force
      required to restore any radial displacement of said magnetic
      rings.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Referring back to FIG. 1 the large ring magnet 1 is
      constrained in the housing 6 by a thrust bearing race 3 with
      non-magnetic ball bearings 5. The ball bearings are of a 3/32 in
      diameter and are of an aluminum oxide material, whilst the thrust
      bearing race is of a stainless steel material and has an outer
      diameter of 18.5 mm, an inner diameter of 11.5 mm and a depth of
      0.5 mm.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The ball bearings 5 are kept in place by two cages 4 of
      Acetal material, each cage 4 having a total of 10 cavities of 2.6
      mm diameter. Each cage 4 has an outer diameter of 21 mm and an
      inner diameter of 15 mm, and each of the centre-points of the
      cavities is exactly 8.5 mm from the centre-point of the cage. Each
      of the cavities has one of the ball bearings 5 free to move about
      it. The friction for such rolling or sliding of the ball bearings
      5 is facilitated by the thrust bearing race 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The configuration of thrust bearing races 3, ball bearings
      5, and cages 4 is such that the less large ring magnet 2 is kept
      in a stable axial position with respect to maintaining an
      invariant field between the large 1 and less large 2 axially
      magnetized ring magnets.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] There are a total of four thrust bearing races 3
      incorporated into the passive magnetic bearing system. Each thrust
      bearing race 3 has an outer diameter of 18.5 mm and an inner
      diameter of 11.5 mm. These are permanently affixed by adhesive to
      the two sections of housing 6. The thrust bearing races 3 provide
      the minimum surface friction for the ceramic ball bearings to
      operate to maintain the less large magnetic ring 2 and its
      associated stainless steel sleeve in 7 a stable axial position.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] For the correct operation of the ball bearings 5 there is a
      requirement for a set of thrust bearing races 3 to be utilized on
      both contact sides for the ball bearings 5. For this particular
      arrangement, a total of twenty 3/32 in aluminum oxide ball
      bearings are used.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The number of ball bearings, thrust bearing race diameter,
      and holding cage size is directly dependent on the choice of ring
      magnets, being reliant on the physical dimensions of the magnetic
      materials, the grades, the resultant magnetic field shapes and the
      required air gap to maintain the levitation effect in a radial
      manner, as presented previously. The size of any proposed rotor or
      shaft to be attached to the system is also a function of material
      and specification choice.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The retaining mechanisms, the small magnetic ring 2 and
      similar are attached using adhesive to the stainless steel sleeve
      7 of an outer diameter of 8.2 mm and an inner diameter of 6 mm. A
      shaft 8 would in turn be attached to the inner diameter of the
      sleeve, typically by welding or an adhesive of sufficient strength
      to maintain required operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Further magnetic bearing systems of the same specification
      could be added to a shaft 8, as per FIG. 5, where the components
      are set out in a dual system arrangement. Attaching more than one
      magnetic bearing system gives radial and axial rigidity which is
      such that the shaft 8 can achieve levitation and be stable in a
      permanent manner such that there is no contact between the shaft 8
      and the large ring magnet 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 6 shows the components of the axial retaining system
      for the less large ring magnet 2 and in turn the positional
      relationship of the less large ring magnet 2 with the large ring
      magnet 1. The magnetization field directions illustrate the fact
      that the two magnets are in repulsive mode and this setting has
      both retentive and restorative magnetic and mechanical
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] While the invention has been described with reference to
      illustrative embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled
      in the art that various other changes, omissions, and/or additions
      may be made and substantial equivalents may be substituted for
      elements thereof with departing from the spirit and scope of the
      invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a
      particular situation or material to the teaching of the invention
      with departing from the scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended
      that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment
      disclosed for carrying out this invention, but that the invention
      will include all embodiments, falling within the scope of the
      appended claims.<br>

      The present invention is in the field of the measurement systems
      and, more particularly, systems for measuring kinetic energy and
      torque of a rotating body.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Background</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Numerous commercial systems are available to measure the angular
      displacement, angular velocity, kinetic energy, and torque acting
      on a disk during rotation. However, most commercial systems that
      are available to perform such measurements require test sensors to
      be in physical contact with the rotating body being measured.
      Therefore, such systems detrimentally affect the dynamics of the
      system being measured.<br>
      <br>
      Previously known optical encoders use reflected laser beams to
      accurately measure the angular displacement of a body, but are not
      generally used to measure angular velocity for a given
      displacement. Such devices have been used to measure the average
      angular velocity of a body over a large angular displacement,
      typically over several revolutions, but are not generally used to
      measure the instantaneous angular velocity for rotating bodies
      during acceleration over small angular displacements or to
      associate instantaneous velocity with a particular displacement.
      Because optical angular velocity measurements have typically been
      performed using average angular velocity over a relatively large
      angular displacement, the use of such measurements to determine
      other dynamic conditions of a rotating body, such as torque or
      kinetic energy, provides average values over the large
      displacement and do not provide accurate nearly instantaneous
      information such as nearly the instantaneous torque or nearly
      instantaneous kinetic energy of a rotating body for a given
      displacement.<br>
      <br>
      Previously known systems and methods for measuring nearly
      instantaneous torque or kinetic energy of a rotating body during
      less than one revolution of the body typically employ torque
      sensors which make contact with the body, thus detrimentally
      affecting the dynamics being measured. Summary of the Invention<br>
      Embodiments of the present invention measure nearly instantaneous
      angular velocity for each of a plurality of small angular
      displacements of a rotating body using a laser measurement sensor.
      A flat graduated disk, such as a paper disk, is applied to the
      body being tested. The graduated disk is selected such that it
      will not substantially change the moment of inertia of the body
      being tested or its air resistance. A laser diode is aimed at the
      disk and laser light reflected from the disk is received by a
      photo-diode. As the disk rotates, the laser light alternatively
      reflects from graduated portions and the spaces between graduated
      portions. The different reflective properties between the
      graduated portions and the space between graduations causes the
      intensity of the reflected light to pulsate. The output from the
      photo-diode provides a series of signal pulses which are each
      associated with corresponding graduations of the disk. Each pulse
      is time-stamped so that the angular velocity of the rotating disk
      can be measured for each graduation. The kinetic energy and torque
      acting on the rotating disk is then calculated for each graduation
      of the disk. Because torque is calculated without using
      conventional torque sensors, no part of the inventive measurement
      system makes contact with the rotating object to detrimentally
      affect the dynamics being measured.<br>
      <br>
      The inventive measurement device has the capability to measure the
      kinetic energy and torque of a rotating disc without making any
      contact with the disc or anything connected to the disc during
      measurement. It does this by accurately measuring speed changes
      during angular displacement of a 360 degree rotation of a disc and
      the speed at specific positions of the disc.<br>
      <br>
      Existing non-contact Optical encoders use a reflective lasers that
      measure position use a similar type of reflective laser concept,
      from which the general speed of the disc can be calculated.
      However, the output of such existing encoders is primarily focused
      on position precision. Speed changes during a 360 degree rotation
      are not a main consideration. In such existing systems speed
      changes can only be crudely calculated on a number of revolutions
      per minute basis. If speed changes during a 360 degree rotation
      are required a torque sensor has generally been employed. Such
      torque sensors must typically come in contact with the disk being
      measured.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention overcomes the limitations of the prior art
      by using a non-contact encoder concept, recording data for
      graduation on for a disk within each 360 degree rotation. This
      data is used to determine speed changes during a rotation to
      calculate torque and kinetic energy variations which take place
      during each rotation.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      An illustrative embodiment of the invention as shown in Fig. 1
      provides a test system 10 having a light emitting device 12 such
      as a laser diode, a light monitoring device 14 such as a
      photodiode, and a graduated encoder disk 16 which is affixed to a
      rotating body 18 being measured. A time-stamping device 20 such as
      an oscilloscope is provided in communication with the light
      monitoring device 14 and receives output signals therefrom. The
      graduated disk has a radial array of graduations printed on a
      contrasting background. In the illustrative embodiment, the
      graduated disk is constructed of paper and has a white background
      with black graduations printed in a radial fashion at assigned
      intervals (typically one degree). A home position graduation 22
      that has a greater width than the other printed graduations acts
      as a reference or home position marker. The graduated disk is
      securely attached to the disk that is being measured.<br>
      <br>
      The light emitting device 12 emits a light beam that is directed
      at the rotating graduated disk 16. The light emitting device 12
      and light monitoring device 14 are aligned so that the light is
      reflected from the graduated disk into the light monitoring device
      14. The light emitting device 12 and light monitoring device 14
      are securely fixed with respect to the rotation of the rotating
      body 18.<br>
      <br>
      In an illustrative embodiment, direct current is provided to power
      the light emitting device and light monitoring device. An analog
      output signal from the light monitoring device input to a time
      stamping device such as a digital oscilloscope so that the signal
      may be digitally sampled and analyzed. Illustratively, the
      oscilloscope records a voltage produced by the light monitoring
      device and the time at which the voltage was recorded, so that all
      voltage measurements are time-stamped.<br>
      <br>
      Operation of the inventive measurement system is described with
      reference to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Light from the light emitting
      device 12 is reflected off the surface of the graduated disk<br>
      <br>
      16. The intensity of the reflected light varies depending on the
      reflective properties, (i.e. color) of the section of the
      graduated disk 16 at which the light emitting device is pointing.<br>
      <br>
      Illustratively, the light monitoring device 14 produces an output
      voltage that is proportional to the intensity of the light
      reflected by the graduated disk 16. Accordingly, if the light
      emitting device is pointing at a section of the graduated disk 16
      that is black, the light monitoring device 14 will produce a lower
      voltage than if the light emitting device 12 is pointing at a
      section of the graduated disk that is white. Hence, as the
      graduated disk rotates, the light monitoring device 14 produces a
      voltage that varies as the intensity of reflected light changes
      due to the passing of the graduations under the light emitting
      device 12. When recorded on an oscilloscope, the analog signals 24
      from the light monitoring device 14 vary as the graduations pass
      the light emitting device as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
      <br>
      The angular velocity of the disk is determined by measuring the
      time between leading edges of the analog signal 24. Illustratively
      one graduation is printed on the disk per degree of angular
      displacement. Since the angular displacement between the
      graduations is known and the time taken to travel between these
      graduations can be measured, the angular velocity can be
      determined. A system can provide a measurement of any change in
      the angular velocity during a single revolution.<br>
      <br>
      The angular displacement of the disk at any point in time is
      determined by counting the number of pulses from a known reference
      position (the "home" position). In the illustrative embodiment,
      the home position of the system is a graduation that is of greater
      physical width than the other graduations on the disk. Hence, the
      home pulse 26 recorded by the oscilloscope can be identified
      because it is of greater width than the other pulses of the analog
      signal 24.<br>
      According to illustrative embodiments of the invention, the moment
      of inertia of the disk is accurately calculated. The moment of
      inertia and angular velocity data are then used to calculate the
      kinetic energy of the disk during rotation, using the standard
      formula: Kinetic energy = &lt;1&gt;A I[omega]" where I=moment of
      inertia of the disk (Kg/m&lt;~&gt;) and [omega] is angular
      velocity (radians/second).<br>
      <br>
      Since the kinetic energy is calculated at known positions (the
      graduation markings) and the distance between these graduations is
      also known, the torque acting on the disk is calculated by
      differentiating the kinetic energy with respect to angular
      displacement. Hence, from the angular displacement, and angular
      velocity measurements, the kinetic energy and torque of the system
      can be calculated during the system's revolution. An exemplary
      plot of kinetic energy 28 and torque 30 versus angular
      displacement measured according to the present invention is shown
      in Fig. 3.<br>
      <br>
      Measurement uncertainty in the test system may be caused by
      several factors including the response time of the light
      monitoring device, the accuracy of the placement of disk
      graduations, the sampling frequency of the light monitoring device
      output signal, the accuracy of the time stamping oscilloscope and
      the accuracy of moment of inertia calculations.<br>
      <br>
      For example, a time lag in the photo-diode between the change of
      light intensity that enters the sensor and associated change in
      the output voltage level; this will lead to measurement
      uncertainty. Also, the lower the oscilloscope sampling frequency
      the greater the measurement uncertainty. Further, for a fixed
      sampling frequency, the measurement uncertainty will increase with
      an increase in angular velocity because the number of samples
      taken between the leading edges will determine the timing and
      positioning accuracy of the system.<br>
      <br>
      Since both the kinetic energy and torque values are calculated
      based upon the moment of inertia of the disk being tested,
      inaccuracies in calculating the moment of inertia of a rotating
      body will increase the measurement uncertainty of the kinetic
      energy and torque values.<br>
      <br>
      The moment of inertia can be calculated through the use of
      parametric mechanical design and modeling software. In an
      illustrative embodiment, Solid Edge &lt;rM&gt; 3D CAD software by
      Siemens PLM Software of Piano. Texas is used to calculate the
      disk's moment of inertia based on information such as the disk's
      material, dimensions, weight, density and point of rotation.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 4 illustrates a method of measuring kinetic energy and torque
      according to the invention. In an application step 40, a
      graduations are applied to the disk. While the disk is rotating, a
      first sensing step 42 is performed in which a light source such as
      a laser diode is directed to shine upon graduations. In a second
      measurement step 44, light reflected from the graduations is
      received by a sensor such as a photo-diode. The sensor converts
      reflected light into a signal having pulses which correspond to
      the passage of graduations beneath the light source. In time
      stamping step 46, signal pulses output from the sensor are time
      stamped, for example by recording the pulses on a digital
      oscilloscope. In a correspondence step 48, each of the time
      stamped signal pulse is associated with a corresponding angular
      displacement according to the angular displacement between
      graduations. In a velocity calculation step 50, the angular
      displacement between graduations is divided by the time between
      the time stamped signal pulses which correspond to the
      graduations. In a kinetic energy calculation step, the measured
      angular velocity and the disks moment of inertia are used to
      calculate the disk's kinetic energy during a specified angular
      displacement. In a torque calculation step 52, the measured
      angular velocity and the disk's moment of inertia are used to
      calculate the disk's torque during a specified angular
      displacement.<br>
      <br>
      Although illustrative embodiments of the invention have been
      described herein as using a digital oscilloscope as a time
      stamping device, persons skilled in the art should recognize that
      the use of an oscilloscope may be impractical for various desired
      implementations of a torque measurement system. Furthermore, the
      maximum sampling rate of a typical digital oscilloscope may not be
      high enough to accurately measure the projected maximum rotational
      speed of about 10,000 rotations per minute (RPM) for certain
      embodiments of the invention. It should therefore be appreciated
      that alternative embodiments of the present invention may be
      implemented without using an oscilloscope. For example, in an
      illustrative embodiment of the invention, time stamping circuitry
      includes high speed electronics which overcome the disadvantages
      of using an oscilloscope for time stamping. The high speed
      electronics can generate and capture signals from a rotating body
      capable of detecting kinetic energy and toque changes during disk
      rotation at speeds up to 10,000 RPM.<br>
      <br>
      In an illustrative embodiment, the high speed electronics for
      times stamping include a quartz crystal which outputs an
      oscillating signal having a frequency of about 2 gigahertz, for
      example. This provides a time period between time stamps in the
      output signal of about 5 x 10&lt;"10&gt; seconds which can be used
      to time the pulses from the photodiode. The high speed electronics
      detect the pulses from the photo diode when changes from black
      graduation to white graduation produces a rising edge and changes
      from white graduation to black graduation produces a falling edge.
      For each graduation, a counter in the high speed electronics
      counts the number of time stamps from the quartz crystal during
      each graduation detected by the photo-diode. After each
      graduation, the high speed electronics reads the number of pulses
      from the counter, then resets the counter to start a new count for
      the next graduation. The time stamps counted per graduation are
      summed and multiplied by the period of the oscillator signal to
      calculate the time for the measured graduation on the rotating
      body to pass the photodiode. Since, in the illustrative
      embodiment, one graduation is equal to one degree of angular
      displacement of the rotating body, the measured time period per
      pulse is readily converted to an angular velocity to provide a
      nearly instantaneous measurement of the body's angular velocity at
      any time.<br>
      In an illustrative embodiment the high speed pulse counting may be
      performed by channelling the quartz crystal output signals and the
      photodiode output signals through counting circuitry on a printed
      circuit board (PCB) having a series of high speed gates and
      providing a low speed output. The low speed output can then be
      channelled to a low speed counter. One or more microcontrollers or
      other custom hardware can perform counting of the time stamps per
      pulse on the PCB board for output to a computer.<br>
      <br>
      A Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) to Universal Serial Bus (USB)
      converter can be used to receive data from the PCB board and
      convert it into USB format for the computer.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the SPI to USB converter may be replaced by other
      custom interface circuitry. The computer may be used to execute
      software for converting the number of time stamps per pulse and
      the number of pulses to a nearly instantaneous angular velocity,
      kinetic energy and/or torque for the rotating body. Although the
      invention is described with reference to a light source such as
      laser diode, and a light monitoring device such as a photo-diode,
      persons having ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that
      various other types of light sources and light monitoring devices
      can be used within the scope of the invention.<br>
      Although the invention is described with reference to an encoding
      disk being affixed to the rotating body, it should be understood
      that encoding graduations can be printed directly onto a rotating
      body within the scope of the invention. While the invention has
      been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment, it
      should be understood by those skilled in the art that various
      changes, omissions and/or additions may be made and equivalents
      may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the
      spirit and scope of the invention, In addition, many modifications
      may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the
      teachings of the invention without departing from the scope
      thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be
      limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode
      contemplated for carrying out this invention, but that the
      invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of
      the appended claims. Moreover, unless specifically stated any use
      of the terms first, second, etc. do not denote any order or
      importance, but rather the terms first, second, etc. are used to

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to test systems, and more
      particularly to test systems for measuring energy exchanges
      involving the magnetic fields of magnetic materials.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] It may be desirable to measure the total energy exchanged
      due to the interaction of magnetic fields. It may also be
      desirable, in measuring such energy exchanges, to account for the
      magnetic viscosity of materials involved in the exchanges.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] The present invention provides an apparatus and method for
      measuring magnetic force response time due to the magnetic
      viscosity of materials and for measuring total energy exchanged
      due to relative motion of magnetic materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] According to an embodiment of the invention, a test system
      for measuring magnetic force response time comprises an
      electromagnet mounted to a test stand and a material under test
      (MUT) mounted to a force gauge such that a magnetic flux linkage
      can be created between the electromagnet and the MUT. An
      oscilloscope or other test instrument is used to measure and
      record the voltage and current through a coil of the electromagnet
      and a force reading from the force gauge or other test instrument
      with respect to time. A step increase in magnetic flux through the
      MUT is created by energizing the electromagnet. The magnetic force
      exerted on the MUT as a result of the magnetic flux is observed on
      the force gauge and observed as a function of time on the
      oscilloscope.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The system is calibrated by accounting for the
      characteristic response time of the force gauge and confirming
      that the net effect of eddy currents in the MUT is negligible.
      When the electromagnet is energized, the time elapsed before a
      maximum magnetic force is reached is measured on the MUT. The
      direction of the current applied to the electromagnet is reversed
      to measure the effect on the MUT of a magnetic field in the
      opposite direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In the illustrative embodiment, the MUT comprises a
      partially de-magnetized permanent magnet. The magnetic viscosity
      of the MUT is therefore much greater than the viscosity of the
      ferromagnetic core of the electromagnet. Accordingly, this rise
      time of measured force on the MUT is attributed almost exclusively
      to the time needed to align magnetic domains in the MUT. A pulse
      generator can be used in combination with a relay to repeatedly
      energize the electromagnet. The method and apparatus of the
      illustrative embodiment can be used to measure the rise time and
      maximum force produced upon each cycle, or upon a sampling of
      cycles of the pulse generator to demonstrate the effect of
      repeated magnetic interactions on a MUT.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] According to another embodiment of the invention, a test
      system for measuring energy exchanged due to the relative motion
      of magnetic materials comprises a permanent magnet mounted on a
      disk. The disk is revolved about its axis of rotation to establish
      a circular path of the permanent magnet. A passive electromagnet
      is mounted proximate to the circular path of the permanent magnet.
      Current that is induced in the electromagnet is measured and
      recorded for corresponding angular displacements of the permanent
      magnet around the circular path. Torque on the disk is also
      measured for corresponding angular displacements of the permanent
      magnet around the circular path. The magnetic flux density in the
      electromagnet is calculated as a function of the current for
      corresponding angular displacements of the permanent magnet. The
      mechanical energy transferred to the disk is calculated as a
      function of measured torque versus angular displacement of the
      permanent magnet for a given angular velocity of the disk. The
      electrical energy transferred to the electromagnet is calculated
      as a function of the measured current in the electromagnet for a
      given angular velocity of the disk. The absolute values of the
      transferred mechanical energy and electrical energy are combined
      to determine the total energy exchanged by interaction of the
      permanent magnet and electromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The illustrative embodiments of the invention provide a
      system and method for demonstrating that the absolute net energy
      of a ferromagnetic interaction varies as a function of the
      relative velocities of magnetic materials involved in the
      interaction. The embodiments provide a system and method for
      demonstrating that the variations of absolute net energy as a
      function of speed are due to the magnetic viscosity of the
      materials involved in the interaction. Accordingly, embodiments of
      the present invention can be used to demonstrate that the absolute
      energy of a magnetic transaction can be controlled by controlling
      the speed of the interaction.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br>
      <br>
      [0027] A system for measuring magnetic force response time 100 as
      illustrated in FIG. 1 is comprised of a number of components
      including an electromagnet 102 illustratively consisting of a core
      104 and a coil 106 having a number of turns disposed around the
      core 104. The electromagnet is a fast acting air coil
      electromagnet that can be used to generate a step change in
      magnetic flux. In an illustrative embodiment, the coil 106 has an
      external diameter of 7 mm and consists of eight turns of 1.5 mm
      diameter wire insulated by polyurethane. The electromagnet 102 is
      held rigidly in place relative to a material under test (MUT) 108
      such as a permanent magnet. In an illustrative embodiment, the MUT
      108 is a partially demagnetized neodymium magnet. The MUT 108 is
      attached to a piezoelectric force sensor incorporated in a force
      gauge 110 having an output suitable for connection to an
      oscilloscope 112. The oscilloscope 112 measures and records the
      force exerted upon the MUT 108 with respect to time.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In order to generate a step change in magnetic flux, the
      electromagnet 102 is connected in series with a resister 114, a
      direct current DC power source 116 and a first switch 118.
      Illustratively, the resister is a 2.8 ohm resister and the DC
      power source 116 is a 24 volt DC battery. A second switch 120 is
      illustratively provided to enable a repeatable step change in
      magnetic flux by connecting a pulse generator 122 and relay 124 to
      the coil 102. A voltage (V1) 126 across the coil 102 and a voltage
      (V2) 128 across the resistor 114 are measured with respect to time
      by the oscilloscope 112.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] An air gap 130 is provided between the coil 102 and the MUT
      108. Illustratively, the air gap 130 is adjustable. A typical air
      gap of 2 mm in the illustrative embodiment results in generation
      of a magnetic flux of 1.6 mT.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] A method of measuring magnetic force is described with
      reference to the process flow diagram of FIG. 2 which starts at
      step 200. A MUT such as a permanent magnet is mounted 202
      proximate to an electromagnet so that magnetic flux created in the
      electromagnet applies a force to the MUT. The MUT is connected 204
      to a force gauge for measuring the force applied to the MUT. The
      electromagnet is then energized 206. Force measurements are output
      from the force gauge to an oscilloscope which records 208 and/or
      displays the measured force versus time. Current through the
      electromagnet is also measured and recorded 210 by an
      oscilloscope. To measure the current through the coil, the
      oscilloscope is illustratively connected to measure a voltage
      (e.g., 128 of FIG. 1) across a resistor in series with the coil
      (e.g., 114 of FIG. 1) which is divided by the value of the
      resister to yield the current through the coil. The process is
      completed at step 212.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] A ring test can be performed in order to measure the
      mechanical response time of the system shown in FIG. 1. The ring
      test is performed by applying a mechanical impulse to the mounted
      MUT and recording the force versus time output by the force gauge
      or other test instrument in response to the impulse. FIG. 3 is a
      graph 300 of force versus time illustrating the results of such a
      ring test performed by applying impulses of different amplitudes.
      It is observed that the measured force versus time curves 302 have
      the same period of oscillation 304, about 2.45 ms, regardless of
      the strength of impulse applied to the MUT.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] A lag time in force registration is observed with reference
      to the graph 400 shown in FIG. 4. Current 402 through the coil of
      the electromagnet, voltage 404 across the coil of the
      electromagnet, and force 406 measured by the force gauge in
      response to the current is plotted as a function of time. A time
      lag 408 of about 52 [mu]s is observed between registration of full
      current 410 and registration of full force 412. Since the magnetic
      field created by energizing a coil propagates at the speed of
      light there is virtually no lag time associated with propagation
      of the field. Accordingly, the time lag 408 represents the
      response time of the force gauge.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] FIG. 5 is a graph showing a repulsive force applied to the
      MUT, a partially demagnetized neodymium magnet, in response to
      magnetic flux generated by energizing a coil using the system
      shown in FIG. 1. In this example, the second switch 120 is in
      position 'A' to remove the pulse generator 122 and the 124 from
      the energizing circuit. The first switch 118 is closed to energize
      the coil 102. The graph 500 shows the force 502 measured when a
      current 504 is applied to the coil. A rise time 506 of about 1.13
      ms due to magnetic viscosity in the MUT is observed from the time
      of peak current to the time of peak force.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] FIG. 6 is a graph showing an attractive force applied to
      the MUT in response to magnetic flux generated by energizing the
      coil using the system shown in FIG. 1. The polarity of the DC
      power source (116, FIG. 1) energizing the coil is reversed to
      reverse the direction of magnetic flux and thereby apply an
      opposite magnetic force to the MUT. In this example, the second
      switch 120 is still in position 'A' to remove the pulse generator
      122 and the relay 124 from the energizing circuit. The first
      switch 118 is again closed to energize the coil 102. The graph 600
      shows the force 602 measured when a current 604 is applied to the
      coil. A rise time 606 of about 1.13 ms is observed from the time
      of peak current to the time of peak force. This demonstrates that
      force lag time due to magnetic viscosity in the MUT is the same
      regardless of whether the applied magnetic field is attractive or
      repulsive.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] A repetition test is performed using the system shown in
      FIG. 1. FIG. 7 is an initial force versus time graph 700 showing
      the force lag time 702 of about 0.737 [mu]s due to magnetic
      viscosity in the MUT that will be used in the repetition test. The
      force 704 generated by the magnetic interaction is about 0.115 N.
      Once the initial lag time is measured, the system is configured
      for the repetition test by placing the second switch 120 in
      position 'B' to include the pulse generator 122 and relay 124 in
      the coil energizing circuit and closing the first switch 118. The
      pulse generator 122 provides a stream of pulses to repeatedly open
      and close the relay 124 which, in turn, repeatedly energizes and
      de-energizes the coil 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] FIG. 8 is a force versus time graph 800 acquired after
      840,000 cycles of energizing and de-energizing the coil. The graph
      800 shows a force lag time 802 of about 721 [mu]s and a force 804
      of about 0.115 N generated by magnetic interaction. A difference
      in lag time of about 16 [mu]s, or about 2%, is observed between
      the initial measurements (FIG. 7) and final measurements (FIG. 8)
      after the repetition test. No difference in the force of magnetic
      interaction is observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] A system for measuring energy exchange due to the relative
      motion of magnetic materials is described with reference to the
      illustrative embodiment shown in FIG. 9. In the illustrative
      embodiment, a permanent magnet 902 is mounted to disk 904 having
      an axis of rotation 906. The disk 904 is revolved about its axis
      of rotation 906 to establish a circular path of the permanent
      magnet 902. A passive electromagnet 908 is mounted proximate to
      the circular path of the permanent magnet 902. The passive
      electromagnet consists of a number of turns 910 of wire wrapped
      around a ferromagnetic core 912. A resistor 914 is connected
      across the coil 901 and one terminal of the resistor 914 is
      connected to ground 916.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Changing magnetic fields in the electromagnet 908 caused by
      motion of the permanent magnet 902 about the circular path induce
      current in the coil 908. The induced current versus time is
      measured and recorded by an oscilloscope for corresponding angular
      displacements 918 of the permanent magnet 902 around the circular
      path. Torque on the disk 904 is also measured for corresponding
      angular displacements of the permanent magnet around the circular
      path.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] A method of measuring energy exchange due to the relative
      motion of magnetic materials is described with reference to the
      process flow diagram of FIG. 10 which starts at step 1002.
      According to the illustrative method, a permanent magnet is
      mounted 1004 on a disk. The disk is revolved 1006 about its axis
      of rotation at a constant speed. A passive electromagnet is
      mounted 1008 proximate to the path of rotation of the permanent
      magnet. Current induced in the electromagnet versus angular
      displacement of the disk is measured 1010. Torque on the disk
      versus angular displacement of the disk is measured 1012
      simultaneously with the current measurement. In the illustrative
      embodiment, the current measurement is recorded by an oscilloscope
      and the torque measurement is measured by a torque transducer
      connected to the oscilloscope.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The magnetic flux density in the electromagnet is
      calculated as a function of the current for corresponding angular
      displacements of the permanent magnet. The mechanical energy
      transferred to the disk is calculated 1014 as a function of
      measured torque versus angular displacement of the permanent
      magnet for a given angular velocity of the disk. The electrical
      energy transferred to the electromagnet is calculated 1016 as a
      function of the measured current in the electromagnet for a given
      angular velocity of the disk. The absolute values of the
      transferred mechanical energy and electrical energy are combined
      1018 to determine the total energy exchanged by interaction of the
      permanent magnet and electromagnet. The process is completed at
      step 1020.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] As the disk is rotated at different fixed speeds, the
      torque on the disk and the flux density of the iron core are
      plotted as a function of the angular displacement of the disk.
      Illustratively, the zero degree position is defined as the
      position of the disk where the permanent magnet is furthest away
      from the electromagnet, but directly in line with it. The 180
      degree position is where the permanent magnet is closest to the
      electromagnet. In FIG. 9, the disk is shown in the 90 degree
      position.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The disk is rotated at speeds of 1, 10, 100, 1000, and
      10,000 revolutions per minute (RPMs). For each rotational speed,
      the torque on the disk and the flux density within the
      electromagnet are calculated.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] A graph of the measured torque versus angular displacement
      of the disk for each rotational speed is shown in FIG. 11. The
      graph 1100 shows the torque at rotational speeds of 1 RPM 1102, 10
      RPM 1104, 100 RPM 1106, 1000 RPM 1108 and 10,000 RPM 1110. A graph
      of the measured magnetic flux within the electromagnet versus
      angular displacement of the disk for each rotational speed is
      shown in FIG. 12. The graph 1200 shows the magnet flux at speeds
      of 1 RPM 1202, 10 RPM 1204, 100 RPM 1206, 1000 RPM 1208 and 10,000
      RPM. It is observed with reference to FIG. 11 and FIG. 12 that
      when the constant rotational speed of the disk is stepped up from
      1 RPM to 10,000 RPM, the torque acting on the disk is reduced from
      about 0.22 Nm to about 0.10 Nm. This reduction in torque is
      attributable to the finite alignment time of magnetic domains in
      the ferromagnetic core of the electromagnet, i.e. its magnetic
      viscosity. In FIG. 12, it is observed that as the constant
      rotational speed of the disk is stepped up from 1 RPM to 10,000
      RPM, the peak flux values move to the right from the 180 degree
      position, where the permanent magnet is closest to the
      electromagnet, to about the 210 degree position of the disk. Both
      the reduction in torque and the shift of the peak flux values are
      produced as a result of the magnetic viscosity of the
      electromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] FIG. 13 is a graph 1300 of torque 1302 and magnetic flux
      1304 versus angular position of the disk when the rotational speed
      of the disk is 1 RPM. A maximum torque of about 0.22 Nm and a
      maximum flux of about 0.1 Wb is observed. It is also observed that
      at about 1 RPM the peak flux value and cross over of the torque
      curve occur at the 180 degree position of the disk. This indicates
      that there is no noticeable shift of the peak flux value and no
      noticeable effect of the electromagnet's magnetic viscosity when
      the disk is rotated at a constant speed of 1 RPM.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] FIG. 14 is a graph 1400 of torque 1402 and flux 1404 versus
      angular position of the disk when the rotational speed of the disk
      is 10,000 RPM. A maximum torque of about 0.10 Nm and a maximum
      flux of about 0.0023 Wb is observed. FIG. 15. is a graph 1500
      having a scale that more clearly shows the magnitude of the flux
      1404 versus angular position of the disk. Again, it is observed
      that, due to the magnetic viscosity of magnetic materials in the
      system, the peak torque value of the magnetic transaction is much
      smaller when the disk is rotated at a constant speed of 10,000 RPM
      than it is when the disk is rotated at constant speed of 1 RPM. In
      FIG. 15 it is observed that, due to the magnetic viscosity of the
      magnetic materials in the system, when the disk is rotated at
      10,000 RPM, the flux within the electromagnet peaks at a disk
      position of about 210 degrees with a much lower peak flux value
      than was observed at 1 RPM.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] FIG. 16 is a graph 1600 showing the total absolute value of
      mechanical energy and induced electrical energy exchanged during a
      revolution of the disk as a function of the angular velocity of
      the disk. A plot of the energy calculated by measuring induced
      current in the electromagnet's coil for a corresponding disk speed
      represents the electrical energy 1602 exchanged by magnetic
      interaction during one rotation of the disk. A plot of the energy
      calculated by measuring torque on the disk for a corresponding
      disk speed represents the mechanical energy 1604 exchanged by
      magnetic interactions during one rotation of the disk. The sum of
      the electrical energy 1602 and mechanical energy 1604 represents

      The present invention relates to test systems, and more
      particularly to test systems for measuring characteristics of a
      load.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Background of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It is often desirable to measure the forces associated with motion
      of a load, such as the motion of a fly-wheel or the linear or
      rotary motion of a rotary actuator. It is also desirable, in
      measuring such forces, to eliminate extraneous forces that might
      interfere with the true measurement of the force under
      measurement.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention provides an apparatus and method for
      measuring a rotary load and provides the ability to substantially
      eliminate the affects of friction and system baseline
      characteristics from the load measurement.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, a test system for measuring a rotary
      load comprises components mounted on an aluminum frame forming a
      measurement arm. In one embodiment, a stepper motor drives a gear
      box that is mounted at one end of the aluminum frame. Adjacent to
      the output shaft of the gear box is a torque sensor which provides
      contactless measurement signal transmission. The gear box's output
      shaft is connected to one of the torque sensor's stubs by means of
      a universal joint coupling. On the other side of the torque sensor
      a second universal joint coupling connects the sensor to a
      stainless steel shaft. A low friction flange bearing is used to
      provide support for the shaft. An angle encoder is disposed on the
      end of the shaft distal to the gear box. The gear box's output
      shaft, the torque sensor's cylindrical shaft hubs and associated
      couplings are arranged such that they are directly aligned with
      the shaft. The test system has been designed to take automated
      torque and angle readings from a shaft capable of rotary motion.
      The measurement arm configuration with the stepper motor directly
      connects the torque and angle sensors to a PC based data
      acquisition card for acquisition and processing of data.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of a method according to the invention the user
      of the system defines a travel path for the shaft or a wheel on
      the shaft and an angular step for that travel path. The system
      then automatically travels the path defined in a clockwise and
      counter-clockwise direction. Since the system has a certain
      settling time after movement a delay exists between the automated
      movement of an arm and the acquisition of data. This settling time
      has been configured to be 2 seconds. It should be appreciated that
      other settling times may be appropriate. Once the system has been
      allowed to settle, five torque measurements are taken with a 100ms
      time period between them. The highest and lowest of these five
      samples are discarded and the average of the remaining three is
      taken and recorded as the torque at that angle. This
      multi-sampling approach is taken so that spikes caused by signal
      noise may be removed.<br>
      <br>
      The system in the illustrative embodiment is used to make a true
      torque measurement of a rotary actuated shaft or wheel in a
      process where a first data set is acquired with the system
      unloaded as the shaft or wheel is actuated through the defined
      travel path. The actuation force applied by the stepper motor is
      accurately controlled through a computer interface. Torque data is
      measured at each angular step as the wheel is actuated in a first
      direction (e.g. clockwise). Torque data is then measured at each
      angular step as the wheel is actuated in the opposite direction
      (e.g. counter-clockwise).<br>
      <br>
      A load is then placed on the test system, for example, a magnetic
      force applied by a fixed or electromagnet wherein it is desired to
      determine the torque on the wheel resulting from the application
      of the magnetic force or volume. With the load on the system,
      torque data is acquired/measured at each angular step as the wheel
      is actuated in a first direction (e.g. clockwise) through the
      defined travel path. Torque data is then measured at each angular
      step as the wheel is actuated in the opposite direction (e.g.
      counter-clockwise) through the defined travel path.<br>
      <br>
      Ultimately, the true torque, i.e. torque less the effects of
      friction and the system baseline mechanical profile, is determined
      by adjusting measurement data to virtually eliminate these two-
      effects. This is done so that the adjusted data represents the
      actual effects of the interaction of the load, e.g, magnetic
      field, and not changes in friction or the effect of the test
      system mechanical profile.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      The system, as illustrated in Figure 1, is comprised of a number
      of components which are mounted on an aluminum frame 10 to form a
      measurement arm 11. A stepper motor 12, such as a MDrive model
      MDIF1719, drives a gear box 13, for example a Muffett model
      M3-50/1-C mounted at one end of the aluminum frame 10. Adjacent to
      the output shaft of the gear box is a torque sensor 14 with
      cylindrical shaft stubs. In this illustrative embodiment a HBM
      T20WN unit which provides contactless measurement signal
      transmission is implemented. The gear box's output shaft is
      connected to one of the torque sensor's stubs by means of a
      universal joint coupling 16. On the other side of the torque
      sensor a second universal joint coupling 18 is employed to connect
      the sensor to a stainless steel shaft 20. In this illustrative
      embodiment the universal joint couplings 16 and IS are Yuil
      SCJA-20C couplings and the shaft 20 is of diameter 10mm and length
      255mm. A low friction flange bearing 22 is used at this juncture
      to provide support for the shaft. An angle encoder 24 is disposed
      on the end of the shaft distal to the motor 12. In this
      embodiment, the angle encoder is a Wachendorff Encoder model
      WDG58E with angular contact bearings which provide axial and
      radial alignment with the shaft. The stepper motor's output shaft,
      the torque sensor's cylindrical shaft hubs and associated
      couplings are arranged such that they are directly aligned with
      the shaft.<br>
      <br>
      The universal joint couplings 16, 18 are used to prevent the
      transmission of complex forces (such as bending forces) to the
      torque sensor 14. However, while they are highly effective at
      removing such forces, the universal joint couplings themselves
      typically contain a degree of play, or slop, as they turn. This
      characteristic of the couplings has the potential to cause
      erroneous readings being taken by the torque sensor 14. In order
      to substantially eliminate this, the universal joint couplings 16,
      18 are kept under compression, thus removing the slop in flie
      couplings. This is achieved by pressing the two sides of the
      coupling together before they are tightened onto the shaft . A
      consequence of this is that it increases the friction component of
      the measurement arm, hence the importance of adjusting for
      friction as described hereinafter. A more detailed depiction of
      the universal joint couplings 18 and low friction flange bearing
      22 is illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
      <br>
      [iota]n the illustrative embodiment, the test system has been
      designed to take automated torque and angle readings from the
      shaft 20 or a wheel on the shaft (not shown) capable of rotary
      motion. The system is essentially configured as a single
      measurement arm 11 with the stepper motor 12 and direct connection
      of the torque and angle sensors to a PC based data acquisition
      card as known in the art (not shown in Figure 1). It should be
      appreciated that more than one measurement arm can be configured
      according to the invention, as described hereinafter with respect
      to a two measurement arm implementation,<br>
      <br>
      In operation, generally, the user of the system defines a travel
      path for the shaft or wheel and an angular step for that travel
      path. The travel path, is the same in each of a loaded and
      unloaded state in the method as described. The system then
      automatically travels the paths defined in a clockwise and
      counter-clockwise direction, unloaded and loaded. Since the system
      has a certain settling time after eaeh movement in a travel path,
      a delay exists between the automated movement and the acquisition
      of data. This settling time has been configured to be 2 seconds.
      It should be appreciated that other settling times may be
      appropriate. Figure 3 shows the settling time of the measurement
      arm as captured using an oscilloscope. Once the system has been
      allowed to settle, five torque measurements are taken with a 100ms
      time period between them. It should be appreciated that fewer or
      greater than 5 measurements could be taken and a time other than
      100ms could be used. The highest and lowest of the five samples
      are discarded and the average of the remaining three is taken and
      recorded as the torque at that angle. This multi- sampling
      approach is taken so that spikes caused by signal noise may be
      removed.<br>
      <br>
      As generally illustrated in Figure 4 (overview), a true torque
      measurement of a rotary actuated shaft/wheel is determined in a
      process where first a travel path of the wheel is defined 30, in
      terms of a number of steps of the wheel through a defined angular
      path. It is desirable in measuring the true torque to decouple any
      axial or linear forces present from the rotary force in order to
      eliminate error that is introduced by the non-torque force(s).
      Thus, in application of the system described herein, an objective
      is to determine torque associated virtually exclusively by the
      load applied to the rotary actuated wheel while virtually
      eliminating the error or effects of friction and/or any baseline
      mechanical profile caused by characteristics of the system (e.g.
      tilt, asymmetry, noise, etc).<br>
      <br>
      An unloaded data set is then acquired 32 with the system unloaded
      as the shaft/wheel is actuated through the defined travel path. As
      described, in this illustrative embodiment the actuation force is
      applied by the stepper motor 12 that is accurately controlled
      through a computer interface as is well known in the art. Torque
      data is measured at each angular step as the wheel is actuated in
      a first direction (e.g. clockwise). Torque data is then measured
      at each angular step as the wheel is actuated in the opposite
      direction (e.g. counter-clockwise). Thereafter, the first data set
      is adjusted 34, as described in more detail hereinafter, to
      virtually eliminate the effects of friction and the baseline
      mechanical profile of the system. A load is then placed on the
      test system 36. The load may, for example, be a magnetic force,
      applied by a fixed or electromagnet wherein it is desired to
      determine the torque on the shaft/wheel resulting from the
      application of the magnetic force or volume. With the load on the
      system, torque data is measured/acquired at each angular step as
      the wheel is actuated in a first direction (e.g. clockwise)
      through the defined travel path. Torque data is then measured at
      each angular step as the wheel is actuated in the opposite
      direction (e.g. counter-clockwise) through the defined travel
      path.<br>
      <br>
      Ultimately, the true torque, Le. torque less the effects of
      friction and the system baseline mechanical profile, is determined
      38 as described in further detail hereinafter by adjusting
      measurement date to virtually eliminate these two effects. This is
      done so that the adjusted data represents the actual effects of
      the interaction of the load, e.g. magnetic field, and not changes
      in friction or the effect of the test system mechanical profile.<br>
      <br>
      Two adjustments are made to the test system torque data. No
      adjustments are made to the angle data since the angle encoders
      are directly connected to the measurement wheels. The first
      adjustment to the torque measurement data is to remove the effects
      of friction. The friction will vary as a function of the load
      applied to the measurement wheel.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to Figure 5 (Determine Friction and Mechanical
      Baseline), in order to compensate for friction, a set of no-load
      torque profile data is acquired. Clockwise 40 and
      counter-clockwise 42 torque measurements are taken with no load on
      the system. Due to the way that the torque sensor works, the
      difference between these measurements represents two times the
      friction component sensed (the torque sensor is always measuring
      force in the same direction while the friction component will
      change direction depending on the direction of rotation). The
      no-load friction data set is then adjusted by subtracting 44 the
      counter clockwise torque profile from the clockwise torque profile
      and dividing by 2 to get a friction data set which provides a
      measurement of friction, Le. a friction profile. The friction data
      can be stored 46 for use if and as needed. Then, taking the
      average of the clockwise and counter clockwise data sets 48
      provides an average data set which is a friction compensated
      torque data set which can be stored 50 for use in , performing
      adjustment of a torque data set taken under load as described
      hereinafter.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 6A and Figure 6B are two graphs illustrating the clockwise
      and counterclockwise torque readings for the test system
      measurement arm under different friction loads. The first graph,
      Figure 6A, shows the measurement wheel under a constant friction
      load. The second graph, Figure 6B, shows the same measurement arm
      under a varying friction load. The torque measurements of the
      system net of friction are hence the average of the clockwise and
      counter-clockwise torque measurements.<br>
      <br>
      As with any mechanical system, the measurement system according to
      the invention has a certain mechanical profile that is captured by
      the torque sensor. Typically this is due to the fact that the
      system components, e.g. measurement arm, can not ever be perfectly
      aligned or balanced. As magnets or loads are added to the
      measurement arms the wheels become even more unbalanced. The base
      mechanical profile is hence typically a Sine curve, as illustrated
      in Figure.7 which shows a graph of an unadjusted torque 60, a
      mechanical baseline profile 62 and a torque curve adjusted to
      remove the mechanical baseline 64.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to Figure 8 (Determine True Torque for Load on
      System), in order to measure torque according to this embodiment
      of the invention, it is necessary to place a load on the system
      70. Via the stepper motor, a force is applied to rotate the shaft
      in a first direction (e.g. clockwise), to a first angle 72, and
      allowed to settle 74. A torque measurement is taken at that angle
      76. This is repeated for all angles in the defined travel path 78,
      in the first direction. Data is also gathered by performing the
      foregoing in the opposite direction 80, e.g. counter clockwise.
      The average of the clockwise and counter clockwise torque profile
      data gathered gives the friction adjusted torque profile of the
      system under load 82. The data set that was acquired in
      determining the friction and baseline mechanical profile of the
      system is used, Le. including both the clockwise and
      counter-clockwise torque profile through the defined path. It is
      subtracted 84 from the friction adjusted profile (i.e. the no-load
      friction adjusted profile is subtracted from the loaded friction
      adjusted profile). This provides a representation of the true
      torque due to the load only. Accordingly, the torque is measured
      having substantially eliminated the friction and baseline
      mechanical profile of the system.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to Figure 9, in order to measure the interaction of
      magnetic loads, it is necessary to construct a test system
      comprising two measurement armslOO, 102. The second arm is
      identical in components and construction to that already described
      hereinbefore with respect to Fig. 1. The second arm's baseline
      mechanical profile and friction profile are calculated using the
      method already described herein. The second arm is mounted
      adjacent to the first measurement arm, but at an angle of 90
      degrees relative to the first measurement arm.<br>
      <br>
      The position of the two measurement arms is such that with a load
      on each arm, for example a magnetic load, the interaction of the
      loads can be measured as follows: One load is positioned at a
      user-defined point and remains stationary for the duration of the
      test. A travel path and angular step are defined for the other
      load and data is then collected as it travels that path and
      interacts with, the other load. Data adjustment is the same as
      already described herein, the result being the true torque profile
      for the travelling load based on its interaction with the
      stationary load. Any number of tests can be performed with either
      of the two arms in the stationary position and the load on the
      stationary arm in various user-defined positions.<br>
      <br>
      It should be appreciated that the two measurement arms may be
      canted relative to one another at an angle other than 90 degrees.
      The distance between them may also vary.<br>
      <br>
      Although a "wheel" is described in the embodiment herein, it
      should be appreciated that the test system according to the
      invention could be used to measure true load on other rotary
      actuated structures such as cams, bearings or the like, or on
      other geometrical forms of loaded structures. While a stepper
      motor is shown and described as an actuator force, it should be
      appreciated that the wheel or loaded structure could be actuated
      by other forces such as manually or automatedly by other types of
      motors.<br>
      <br>
      Although the invention has been shown and described with respect
      to illustrative embodiments thereof, it should be appreciated that
      the foregoing and various other changes, modifications, additions
      and deletions in the form and detail thereof may be made without
      departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set for in
      the claims that follow.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0002] FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
      <br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to a magnetic actuating
      apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0004] BACKGROUND OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0005] Electromagnets are commonly used where there is a
      requirement for a magnetic field to be actuated (turned on/off).<br>
      <br>
      [0006] An electromagnet achieves this effect by providing
      (generating) a magnetic field while electrical current is applied
      to it. To turn off the field the current is no longer applied to
      the electromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The use of electromagnets to effectuate magnetic fields
      suffers from one major drawback - the electromagnet requires a
      relatively large amount of electrical energy to operate.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Many techniques are being used to reduce the amount of
      external energy that an electromagnet requires. Primarily these
      techniques relate to the efficiency of the electromagnet and its
      components.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0009] SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0010] A low energy magnet actuator allows magnetic fields to be
      turned on and off using a small amount of energy. The magnetic
      actuator according to the invention generally includes a base
      suitable for the support of a plurality of magnets. An actuatable
      shield is positioned in relation to the plurality of magnets so
      that it effectively blocks the magnetic field when it is
      positioned over at least one of the magnets. The magnetic fields
      of the plurality of magnets interact in a manner that allows low
      energy actuation of the shield. In one illustrative embodiment of
      an actuator according to the invention, the base supports a first
      magnet mounted to the base in a first position. A second magnet is
      supported by the base in a second position relative to the first
      magnet. A shield is positioned relative to the first and second
      magnets in a configuration that enables the movement of the shield
      between two known positions. In this illustrative embodiment, each
      magnet is of similar field strength and the field that radiates
      from the ends are of the same polarity. The shield is of a
      thickness that effectively blocks the emitted magnetic field when
      positioned over one or the other of the magnets. The magnetic
      fields of the two magnets interact in a manner that allows for the
      low- energy movement of the shield. The exposed magnetic field may
      be used to perform work (e.g. interact with other magnetic fields
      to move an object).<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Advantages of the actuator according to the invention
      include low energy actuation of the shield in a manner that yields
      motion or actuation that is highly efficient. The highly efficient
      actuation of the shield results in movement that can perform work
      in a highly efficient manner.<br>

        THE INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0021] The present invention is an actuator configuration that
      involves a plurality of magnetic fields working in conjunction to
      effect motion in a highly efficient manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Referring now to Figs. 1-3, a first illustrative embodiment
      of an actuator according to the invention comprises a first magnet
      10 and a second magnet 12 disposed on a base 14. In this
      embodiment the first and second magnets are fixed to the base. The
      base 14 is disposed proximate to a linear bearing 16. The base 14
      and linear bearing 16 are configured to move relative to each
      other in this embodiment. A shield 18 is disposed in a manner to
      move relative to the first magnet 10 and the second magnet 12. The
      shield is driven to appropriate positions as described herein, by
      mechanical means (not shown), such as a linear actuator (solenoid,
      stepper motor, worm gear or the like), rotary actuator (cam,
      rotary bearing or the like) or any of various other actuators.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In Fig. 1 the actuator is in a first "closed" position.,
      i.e. with the field of the second magnet 12 effectively blocked by
      the shielded magnet holding the shield 18 in place. Hence, when
      the magnetic shield is in the 'closed' position, the magnetic
      field from the actuating magnet (i.e. the second magnet 12) is
      effectively blocked by the magnetic shield 18 (shown in detail in
      Fig. 3). There is little or no field just in front of the shield.
      Thus the second magnetic is effectively blocked and precluded from
      doing any work.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] As illustrated in Fig. 2, when the actuator is in the
      'open' position (i.e. the second magnet is not shielded) the
      magnetic field for the actuating magnet (i.e. the second magnet)
      operates as normal i.e., the magnetic field is not blocked. Hence
      this field is now 'active' in the position where it was previously
      blocked by the shield 18 (Fig. 3), and the first magnet is
      blocked.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In this manner the field from the second or actuating
      magnet (1) is effectively turned on and off. It should be
      appreciated that either of the first or second magnet can be used
      and designated as the "actuating" magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] As illustrated in Figure 1 and 2, the first magnet 10 acts
      as a "balancing magnet" and allows the movement of the shield 18
      to happen for a relatively low amount of energy. Without this
      balancing magnet 10 the force to move the shield 18 down is
      relatively high and the system is highly inefficient. The
      balancing magnet 10 substantially reduces the energy required to
      move the shield 18 over the actuating magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The positioning of the magnetic shield 18 relative to the
      balancing and actuating magnets allows for minimal energy to
      effect actuation. In the open position (Fig. 2) the bottom edge of
      the magnetic shield should be close to the top edge of the
      balancing magnet 10. In the closed position (Fig. 1) the top edge
      of the shield should be close to the bottom of the actuating
      magnet 12. Mechanical stops may be used to optimally position the
      shield or otherwise limit the movement thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Fig. 1 shows a first illustrative embodiment of a magnetic
      actuator according to the invention, comprising the first magnet
      10 fixed to the base 14 which is made of aluminum. The second
      magnet 12 in this embodiment is of substantially equal strength as
      the first magnet 10 and is fixed to the base in relative position
      to the first magnet 10. In this embodiment the second magnet 12 is
      the actuating magnet in that when it is "open" (i.e. not
      shielded), it is used to perform work such as by interaction with
      other entities (for example, other proximate magnetic fields). The
      first magnet 10 is the balancing magnet in that its primary
      function is to interact with the shield 18 providing the blocking
      method for the magnetic fields.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The shield 18 in this embodiment is positioned in
      particular relation to both magnets, and is made of a magnetic
      shield material, such as NETIC S3.6 available from Magnetic Shield
      Corporation of Bensenville, Illinois. In this illustrative
      embodiment the bottom edge of the first magnet 10 is approximately
      15mm from the top edge of the second magnet with the magnets being
      approximately 25 mm in diameter. In this embodiment the shield is
      approximately 30 mm in width and 50 mm in height. In this
      embodiment the shield is configured such that an inner surface of
      the shield is approximately 5 mm from a top (flat) surface of the
      magnets). These dimensions are illustrative and are a function of
      the size of the actuator and shield.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] It should be appreciated that more than a first and second
      magnet may be implemented in an actuator according to the
      invention. Fig. 4 shows an additional embodiment of the invention
      utilizing three magnets in the actuator. In this instance a third
      magnet 20 is substantially identical to the other two magnets in
      terms of size, strength and configuration. The third magnet 20 is
      disposed on the base 14 in such a fashion that the shield can move
      in front of it on a linear bearing as per the previous embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Fig. 5 shows the three magnet configuration of Fig. 4 with
      the shield 18 now having reached the closed position in front of
      the second magnet 12. The movement of the shield 18 along the
      linear bearing 16 from the third magnet 20 towards the second
      magnet 12 allows the magnetic field from the third magnet 20 (the
      actuating magnet) to operate as a function of its magnetic field
      being exposed.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Similarly, Fig. 6 shows the three magnet configuration of
      the actuator with the shield 18 having reached the closed position
      in front of the first magnet 10. The movement of the shield 18
      along the linear bearing 16 from the second magnet 12 towards the
      first magnet 10 allows the magnetic field from the second magnet
      12 (which now becomes the actuating magnet) to operate as a
      function of its magnetic field being exposed. It should be
      appreciated that in the three magnet embodiment that two of the
      magnets may be used as actuating magnets.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The present invention is not restricted to the above
      embodiments. In relation to the magnets and shield, all magnets on
      the base are fixed to the base, such as by an adhesive, and
      arranged such that their end portions are of the same polarity and
      the magnetic field radiates outward from the base. However, it is
      possible that the polarities of the outward end portions of the
      permanent magnets are alternately changed. The magnets may have
      different magnitudes of magnetic force. In addition the shield may
      be of varying dimensions and geometric configuration.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The system works by moving the magnetic shield in front of
      one of the permanent magnets or any of various other means of
      generating a magnetic field. Actuation of the shield in the
      foregoing embodiments is effected on a low friction linear
      bearing. The drive mechanism (not shown) for the shield is
      provided by an external force such as a solenoid, linear motor or
      the like. The addition of the balancing magnet allows actuation
      operation to be done for relatively low amounts of energy. While a
      balancing magnet, or magnets are currently viewed to be the best
      method of achieving low energy actuation, it should be appreciated
      that various other methods can produce the same or similar
      results. Use of springs, pneumatics or the like can also provide
      the balancing force. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that an
      actuator according to the invention can be implemented in a wide
      range of scales, from a miniature scale such as would be
      implemented in a micromechanical or micro electro mechanical
      structure to a large scale actuator such as implemented with large
      permanent magnets and other mechanical structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] It should be appreciate that in the foregoing description
      that the use of the terms "open" and "closed" are nominal and are
      used for illustration purposes only, as are the terms "top" and
      "bottom."<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Although the invention is shown and described hereinbefore
      with respect to illustrative embodiments thereof, persons having
      ordinary skill in the art should appreciated that the foregoing
      and various other changes, omissions and additions in the form and
      detail thereof may be made without departing from the spirit and
      scope of the invention.<br>
