            Waste Water Using Nano-Magnesium Hydroxide Particles</b></big><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Many of today's technologies, from hybrid car batteries to
      flat-screen televisions, rely on materials known as rare earth
      elements (REEs) that are in short supply, but scientists are
      reporting development of a new method to recycle them from
      wastewater.<br>
      <br>
      The process, which is described in a study in the journal ACS
      Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces, could help alleviate economic
      and environmental pressures facing the REE industry.<br>
      <br>
      Zhang Lin and colleagues point out that REEs, such as terbium — a
      silvery metal so soft it can be cut with a knife — behave in
      unique ways as super magnets, catalysts or superconductors. That
      makes them irreplaceable in many of today's tech gadgets and
      machines. Market watchers expect global demand to rise to at least
      185,000 tons by 2015. Although some of these elements are actually
      plentiful, others are indeed in short supply. According to
      reports, terbium and dysprosium supplies may only last another 30
      years. Attempts so far to recycle them from industrial wastewater
      are expensive or otherwise impractical. A major challenge is that
      the elements are typically very diluted in these waters. The team
      knew that a nanomaterial known as nano-magnesium hydroxide, or
      nano-Mg(OH)2, was effective at removing some metals and dyes from
      wastewater. So they set out to understand how the compound worked
      and whether it would efficiently remove diluted REEs, as well.<br>
      <br>
      To test their idea, they produced inexpensive nano-Mg(OH)2
      particles, whose shapes resemble flowers when viewed with a
      high-power microscope. They showed that the material captured more
      than 85 percent of the REEs that were diluted in wastewater in an
      initial experiment mimicking real-world conditions. "Recycling
      REEs from wastewater not only saves rare earth resources and
      protects the environment, but also brings considerable economic
      benefits," the researchers state. "The pilot-scale experiment
      indicated that the self-supported flower-like nano-Mg(OH)2 had
      great potential to recycle REEs from industrial wastewater."<br>

      Treatment of wastewater containing low-concentration yet
      highly-expensive rare earth elements (REEs) is one of the vital
      issues in the REEs separation and refining industry. In this work,
      the interaction and related mechanism between self-supported
      flowerlike nano-Mg(OH)2 and low-concentration REEs wastewater were
      investigated. More than 99% REEs were successfully taken up by
      nano-Mg(OH)2. Further analysis revealed that the REEs could be
      collected on the surface of Mg(OH)2 as metal hydroxide
      nanoparticles (&lt;5 nm). An ion-exchange model was proposed as a
      critical factor for both guaranteeing the reaction speed and
      maintaining the self-supported structure of the materials. In
      addition, a method was developed to further separate the
      immobilized REEs and the residual magnesium hydroxide by varying
      the solution pH. In a pilot-scale experiment, the REEs from
      practical wastewater were immobilized effectively at a high flow
      rate. We anticipate this work can provide a good example for the
      recycling of valuable REEs in practical industrial applications.<br>
