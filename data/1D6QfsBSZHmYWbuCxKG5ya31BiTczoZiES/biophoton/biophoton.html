      biochemical reactions within the tissue associated with the
      oxidative metabolic process of the organism, or is due to the
      production of reactive oxygen species and the activity of enzymes.
      Thus, the linkage between biomolecules and the metabolism of an

      an organism is closely related to the physiological or
      pathological state of the organism, And health professionals in

      a photodetector, is used for the measurement of a biophoton, which

      temperature. Each sample (1) is successively enclosed in a
      transparent quartz vessel having a pair of titanium electrodes
      (2,3) supplied with a DC potential of typically 18 volts. An
      excitation system (4) activates the sample either by energising a
      tungsten light source of controlled spectrum or by EM/sound waves
      of constant intensity and wavelength. After a definite period of
      excitation the luminescence of the sample is measured by the
      detector(s).<br>

      <br>
      A method is specified for differentiating between homozygotes,
      heterozygotes and normal cells of an organism. It is characterised
      in that the cells to be investigated are irradiated with UV light
      and/or treated with a substance which partly damages the cells and
      the intensity of the photon emission of these cells is
      subsequently measured. The method is preferably used before X-ray
      diagnosis in which the risk of inducing a disease triggered by the
      radiation is to be no greater than the probability of early
      diagnosis of a disease.<br>

      The method of diagnosing malignity of sample tissue and direction
      of the therapy selected for malignant tumours involves measuremtn
      of ultra weak photon emissions in the spectral range from infrared
      to ultraviolet. The method of diagnosis is based on the fact that
      the radiations emitted by tumours differ in intensity and other
      characteristics from those emitted by normal tissues. The
      characteristics evaluated are to be found in the documents
      referenced. The beam intensity, for example, increases with
      increasing malignity. The method fo treatment management involves
      treating sample tissue with different selected substances and
      simultaneously measuring the ultra weak photon emissions. The most
      suitable substance for treatment is that which changes the
      characteristics of the cell radiations most clearly in the

        <br>
      </div>
      Detection of microbial contamination comprises measurement of the
      intensity of photons emitted by a sample in a polar solvent. A
      voltage is applied to electrodes placed in the sample and the
      measured photon emission intensity is compared with a control to
      determine the presence or absence of contamination.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a method for the detection of microbial
      infection.<br>
      [179]<br>
      <br>
      To date, it has proved useful to detect bacteria or microbial
      infections in liquids (for example, beer) by colony formation of
      the possible germs in suitable nutrient media. The samples are
      applied to culture media and observed under favorable growth
      conditions. If, given a sufficiently large number of samples, no
      germination is observed after a sufficiently long incubation
      period of a few days, it is assumed that no germs are present.
      This method is now used almost everywhere where detection of
      microbial infections is required. A detailed description of this
      common method can be found in relevant textbooks, for example, by
      A. Koch, Growth Measurements in: American Society for Microbiology
      (ed. By Gerhardt, Murray, Costilow, Nester, Wool, Krieg, and
      Phillips) , 1981 pp. 179-206.<br>
      <br>
      This customary method offers relatively high safety, but has the
      great disadvantage that the incubation time to the reliable
      detection of existing bacteria often lasts longer than a
      manufacturer can allow germ-free products. For technical or
      economic reasons, the product produced can therefore no longer be
      tested for germ-freeness before delivery.<br>
      [1992]<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, therefore, fluorescence methods have been used
      which take advantage of the fact that bacteria can be excited by
      fluorescence or by biochemical interventions. This allows direct
      detection of certain bacteria without delay. The method is fully
      described in the literature, for example in: Wolff, LF, Anderson,
      L., Sandberg, GP, Reither, L., Binsfeld, CA, Corinaldesi, G. and
      Shelburne, CE: Bacteria Concentration Fluorescence Immunoassay
      (BCFIA) for the detection of periodontopathogens in plaque. J.
      Periodontol. 1992,63.1093-1101.<br>
      <br>
      Although the fluorescence method can detect bacteria directly
      without time delay, it has the disadvantage that it is suitable
      only for specific bacteria which can be biochemically excited to
      fluorescence. Moreover, even in favorable cases, the detection
      limit is 10 bacteria / ml. It is therefore not generally
      applicable, but relatively individual and costly.<br>
      <br>
      A process is known from the patents (European Patent EP 0430150,
      Fluids DE 44 01 169 A1, Cell Cultures P 43 08 520.2-41), which
      reduces the photon emission to a sensitivity of 10 &lt;-17&gt; W
      (corresponding to a few quanta per second And per cm 2) in the
      optical spectral range (from about 200-800 nm). This method can
      also be used to measure the recombination lights of charge
      carriers in liquids.<br>
      <br>
      Surprisingly, it has now become apparent that this process is also
      suitable for displaying at least 100 bacteria / ml in polar
      liquids. Although the high sensitivity of the method for
      distinguishing the "quality" of liquids was already surprising,
      new studies on the detection of microbial infection provided the
      additional surprising finding that all microbial infections were
      already present at such low concentrations that they could not be
      detected by the other methods More detectable by significant
      changes in photon radiation. It has proved advantageous to bring
      the sample in an aqueous solution into a 10 ml quartz glass
      cuvette. In order to bring charge carriers into the liquid, one
      can advantageously enrich with 3 mM / l of cooking salt. A DC
      voltage of 30 volts, which is switched off again after a few
      seconds, is applied, for example, to two circuit boards, which are
      immersed in a needle-like manner parallel to the liquid at a
      distance of a few millimeters.<br>
      <br>
      The sample is in absolute darkness. The intensity of the photon
      emission is measured with a light meter (which is described as a
      utility model, for example, in G 94 17 845.3).<br>
      <br>
      It is shown that the presence of microbial infection is a
      sensitive change in photon emission.<br>
      <br>
      The nature and state of the infection can be determined by a
      suitable variation of the measuring parameters (voltage, pH value,
      composition of the liquid, external excitation, spectral
      resolution), for example the question of which bacteria are
      involved and in which state (alive or Dead) the bacteria are
      present. Therefore, in addition to the first two patent claims,
      the claims 3 - 7. levied.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is surprising and novel since the high sensitivity
      of the process was not known or predictable despite the known and
      partly patented basic building blocks. This high sensitivity
      combined with sufficient reproducibility makes the process
      interesting for many commercial areas.<br>
      <br>
      The process is to be used in the beverage and brewing industry, in
      the monitoring of water, in the food industry, for example in
      dairy products, as well as in all other branches of the commercial
      economy which are dependent on the control of microbial
      infections.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example</b><br>
      Into a 10 ml quartz cuvette, two needle-shaped circuit boards are
      inserted in parallel at a distance of 5 mm and connected to a DC
      voltage source. To the cuvette are added successively 8 ml of pure
      saline solution (3 mM / l of saline), the same solution with an
      additional concentration of 10 Rhizobium japonicum 1132-2 bacteria
      / ml and the same solution with a concentration of 100 Rhizobium
      japonicum 1132- 2 bacteria / ml.<br>
      <br>
      In any case, a DC voltage of 80 volts is applied for a period of 5
      seconds. At the same time, the intensities of photon emission (in
      number of photons / 100 ms) are measured over the period of 5 s.
      The measurement is repeated three times. The mean values ​​and
      scatterings of the three measurements are formed. Table I contains
      the results. Table I<br>
      The result shows that this method can significantly detect 10
      bacteria / ml. <br>
