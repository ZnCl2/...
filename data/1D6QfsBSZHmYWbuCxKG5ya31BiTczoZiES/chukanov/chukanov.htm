      <blockquote>In this special experimental presentation, Dr. Kiril
        Chukanov demonstrates his "Angelina IV" prototype generating
        &amp; maintaining a stable ball-lightning plasmoid, which he
        claims can be used to manipulate and extract significant amounts
        of Zero Point Energy. Chukanov's research continues to attract
        interest from a number of energy-organizations such as the DOE,
        making this latest video something you won't want to miss!
        <p>Dr. Chukanov states: <i>"This prototype features a wide
            range of instrumental measurements and complex automation.
            The core of the generator contains the ball lightning, while
            circuitry and measuring instruments monitor power
            consumption, emission of heat and the energy given off by
            the ball lightning. The energetic potential of the ball
            lightning is so enormous that the energy given off by the
            quantum plasma macro-object can exceed the energy supplied
            several times fold. The output energy is adjusted to
            maintain the integrity and stability of the ball lightning,
            while the excess energy ("free energy") will be used for any
            practical purpose. Estimations based on rough calculations
            show that the energy given off is approximately 500% in
            excess of the energy supplied. This power is expressed in
            terms of high-energy photons and heat emitted by the
            macro-object."</i> -- Dr. Kiril Chukanov </p>
        <p>While skeptics have questioned the accuracy of Chukanov's
          measurements, some have also suggested that he may have
          inadvertently perfected the dream of the Farnsworth Fusor -- a
          stable, inertial-electrostatic confinement fusion generator,
          an idea which in itself merits further attention to this
          groundbreaking research. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
        <p>A material such as a gas at an initial pressure below
          atmospheric is treated with RF energy at a frequency greater
          than 1 MHz to transition to a glow discharge state and then at
          increased pressure to a new state at which the average
          internal temperature is at least an order of magnitude higher
          than in the glow discharge state but the rate or radiating
          heat is at least an order of magnitude lower than in the glow
          discharge state. The new state can be maintained for a period
          of the order of at least tens of seconds and energy can be
          extracted through contacting the gas in the new state with a
          heat conducting body. In variations, the gas pressure need not
          be below atmospheric, materials in liquid and solid phases can
          be used in place of the gas, and energizers other than RF
          energy can be used, such as high-voltage discharges and
          high-energy particle beams. </p>

          Description </p>
        <p><i>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</i> </p>
        <p>The invention is in the field of treating a substance such as
          a gas with an energizer such as RF energy to change its state
          and specifically pertains to the use of RF energy to
          transition a gas under controlled conditions to a new state. </p>
        <p>It is known that gas can be treated with energy such as RF
          energy to heat or ionize the gas, and effects such as glow
          discharge and transitioning to plasma states are known. While
          a special form of lightning called ball lightning appears to
          have some of the characteristics of gas plasma it also has
          other characteristics that appear to be different from those
          of the known gas plasmas and appear to contradict some
          accepted principles of physics. For example, it is reported
          that a naturally occurring ball in the form of a glowing
          fireball has been observed to last for many seconds, to
          persist in a shielded environment and to have other unusual
          properties. See, e.g.: Johnson, P. O., "Ball Lightning and
          Self Containing Electromagnetic Fields," Am. J. Phys. 33, 119
          (1965); Singer, S., "The Nature of Ball Lightning," Plenum
          Press, New York (1971); King, M. B., "Tapping the Zero-Point
          Energy," 1989, pp. 7-10 (Paraclette Publishing, P. O. Box 859,
          Provo, UT 84603); and Secor, H. W., "The Tesla High Frequency
          Oscillator," Electrical Experimenter 3, 615 (1916). Some
          publications discuss energy relationships that may be relevant
          to some ball lightning characteristics. See, e.g.: Puthoff, H.
          E., "Gravity as a Zero-Point Fluctuation Force," Phys. Rev.
          A39(5), 2333 (1989); Hirichi, R. et al., "Three-Dimensional
          Self-Organization of a Magnetohydrodynamic Plasma," Phys. Rev.
          Lett. 55 (2), 211-213 (1985); King, M. B., "Macroscopic Vacuum
          Polarization," Proceedings of the Tesla Centennial Symposium,
          International Tesla Society, Colorado Springs, pp. 99-107
          (1984); Boyer, T. H., "Random Electrodynamics: The Theory of
          Classical Electrodynamics with Classical Electromagnetic
          Zero-point Radiation," Phys. Rev. D11, No. 4. 790 (1975); and
          Senitzky, I. R., "Radiation-Reaction and Vacuum Field Effects
          in Heisenberg-Picture Quantum Electrodynamics," Phys. Rev.
          Lett. 31 (15) 955 (1973). </p>
        <p>While there has been a significant interest in ball
          lightning, it is believed that significant aspects of the
          nature and characteristics of the phenomenon have remained
          largely unexplained by accepted principles of physics and that
          no effective way had been found to reliably reproduce at least
          some of the unique effects of the phenomenon. The invention is
          directed to this perceived need to reproduce some of these
          effects and exploit them. </p>
        <p>In an exemplary and non-limiting embodiment of the invention,
          at least some of the effects of the ball lightning phenomenon
          are created by generating a glow discharge at the free end of
          a waveguide in a vacuum vessel containing a gas at an initial
          pressure below atmospheric by feeding RF energy at a frequency
          above about 1 MHz to said waveguide, then gradually increasing
          the gas pressure while continuing to feed the same RF energy
          to the waveguide until the glow discharge transitions to a new
          state in which the average internal temperature of the gas at
          the free end of the waveguide is at least an order of
          magnitude higher than that of the glow discharge, and
          maintaining that new state of the gas for a period of the
          order of at least tens of seconds. The initial gas pressure
          can be of the order of 10.sup.-1 mbar; it is increased
          gradually to the range of about 20-100 mbar and preferably
          20-40 mbar. The RF energy can be at about 27.12 MHz. </p>
        <p>It is believed that the process involves causing the gas
          first to transition to a glow discharge state in which the
          electron-free positive ions of the gas are above the boundary
          R.sub.k,p =(2)(10.sup.-16)/E, where R.sub.k,p is the spacial
          distance in cm between adjacent electron-free positive ions in
          the gas which is in the glow discharge state and E is the
          energy in Erg of an electron-free positive ion, and then
          causing the gas to transition to a new state in which a
          sufficient number of the electron-free positive ions are below
          the boundary R.sub.k,p to substantially increase the average
          internal temperature of the gas, and then maintaining that new
          state for a period of the order of at least tens of seconds.
          While this is the explanation of the phenomenon in which the
          inventor believes, it may turn out that a different theory of
          operation is more accurate or is the only accurate theory.
          However, the invention disclosed and claimed herein is not
          limited to or by any particular theory of operation but is
          defined only by the scope of the appended claims. </p>

        <p><i>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</i> </p>
        <p>Referring to FIG. 1, a double wall vacuum vessel 10 of a
          material such as quartz glass is connected via a conduit 12 to
          a vacuum pump and control unit 16 through a vacuum valve 14 so
          that the gas pressure in the interior of vessel 10 can be
          brought down to and kept at a desired point in the range of
          about 10.sup.-1 -10.sup.2 mbar (millibar). Water or some other
          heat transferring fluid from a source 18 passes through a
          conduit 20 controlled by a valve 22, flows through the space
          between the two walls of vessel 10, exits through a conduit 24
          controlled by a valve 26 and enters a utilization device 28
          such as a heat exchange water heater. A waveguide 30 extends
          axially into vessel 10 such that its free end is about
          two-thirds down into vessel 10. A flange 30a of waveguide 30
          presses against a flange 10a of the neck 10b of vessel 10
          through a gasket 32 to ensure a gas-tight fit. An antenna 34
          is coupled to waveguide 30 to deliver thereto RF energy
          generated by microwave generator 36 which includes an output
          tube 36a delivering RF energy to a radiating strip 36b
          transferring RF energy to an antenna 34. In an exemplary
          sequence illustrating the invention, vacuum control 16 and
          valve 14 are operated to reduce the gas pressure inside vessel
          10 to about 10.sup.-1 mbar. The gas can be room air or a gas
          such as hydrogen or helium. Generator 36 is turned on to
          output RF energy at a frequency of about 27.12 MHz. Through
          the tuned system of output tube 36a, strip 36b, antenna 34 and
          waveguide 30, this RF energy is delivered to the free end of
          waveguide 30 to transition the gas at a region 38 (which is
          not shown to scale in FIG. 1) to a reddish-pink glow discharge
          state in which an emission detector such as a
          spectrophotometer (not shown) detects light emissions from the
          glow discharge plasma which have distinct lines characteristic
          of the gas in vessel 10. This state is maintained for a minute
          or two, and then control 16 and valve 14 are operated to
          gradually increase the pressure in vessel 10 until the gas at
          region 38 changes to a new state in which a spectrophotometer
          detects emissions which have substantially less distinct
          lines, i.e., it detects essentially a continuum of light
          emission frequencies. At lower pressures in vessel 20, region
          38 when in the new state is typically red, and moves through
          yellow and green to white as the pressure is increased to
          about 40 mbar. Increasing the pressure further appears to
          increase the average internal temperature of region 38. At
          pressure of in the range of 100 mbar and above, it appears
          that region 38 becomes so hot that it melts the equipment.
          However, at pressures in the range of about 20-40 mbar, it is
          possible to maintain the region 30 in the new state for long
          periods, of the order of at least hours. Heat is transferred
          from region 38 when in the new state to waveguide 30 through
          the contact of region 38 with the free end of waveguide 30
          and, moreover, heat is transferred from region 38 to gas
          molecules that come in contact with it or pass through it.
          Waveguide 30 is made of a heat conductive material and
          radiates heat which in turn heats the internal wall of vessel
          10 and the water flowing through the space between the walls
          of vessel 10. </p>
        <p>A significant jump in transfer of heat from the gas at region
          38 to waveguide 30 and to the interior wall of vessel 10 and
          thus to the heat-transfer liquid 11 in the space between the
          walls of vessel 10, appears to take place when the gas at
          region 38 transitions from the glow discharge state to the new
          state. However, it appears that the only significant transfer
          of heat from region 38 when in the new state, takes place by
          conducting heat through the contact of the gas at region 38
          with the free end of waveguide 30 and with gas molecules in
          contact with or passing through region 38; little or no
          transfer of heat appears to take place by radiation from
          region 38 when in the new state to the walls of vessel 10 or
          to liquid 11. When all relevant parameters are the same, i.e.,
          power drawn from generator 36 and the flow rate of water 11
          through the space between the walls of vessel 10, the heat
          energy delivered by water 11 to device 28 can be approximately
          doubled. It is believed that the average internal temperature
          at region 38 in the new state is at least an order of
          magnitude higher than that of the glow discharge state. </p>
        <p>In one experimental arrangement, the external diameter of
          vessel 10 is about 160 mm and the internal diameter about 120
          mm. The space between the walls is between 10 and 20 mm, the
          internal wall is about 3 mm thick and the external wall can be
          the same or thinner. The axial dimension of vessel 10 is about
          500 mm. The material of vessel 10 is quartz glass capable of
          withstanding about 1500 degrees C. Waveguide 30 is made of a
          material such as Ni--Cr steel and is a thin wall tube about 12
          mm in diameter. Antenna 34 can be about 10-12 turns of copper
          wire, about 2 mm thick, wound such that the antenna diameter
          is about 120 mm and the axial length is about 500 mm.
          Generator 36 can be vacuum tube microwave generator having an
          input power rating of about 6 KW and an output rating of about
          quarter that, i.e., about 2 KW. </p>
        <p>It is believed that the gas at region 38 when in the new
          state has at least some of the characteristics ascribed to the
          ball lightning phenomenon. For example, it persists for
          periods of the order of at least tens of seconds (in fact many
          hours or perhaps indefinitely so long as the necessary
          conditions are maintained), it appears to have a high internal
          temperature, and it appears to transfer large amounts of heat
          through contact with a heat conducting body but very little or
          no heat through radiation. </p>
        <p>While the invention is not limited to any particular
          explanation of these effects or by any particular theory, the
          inventor's belief is that the ball lightning effects of the
          new state at region 38 are due to placing the gas at a point
          state below a quantum boundary from which it spontaneously
          moves back to that boundary and thereby gains energy from what
          some of the physics literature cited above refers to as
          zero-point energy. Referring to FIG. 2, where the vertical
          axis is the spacial distance R in cm between particles such as
          atoms, or ions, or atomic nuclei, or protons, as the case may
          be, and the horizontal axis E is the energy of a particle in
          Erg, the inventor believes that matter such as atoms which
          have their normal complement of electrons conforms to the
          currently accepted principles of physics when in the R-E space
          which is to the right of curve R.sub.d, to the left of curve
          R.sub.c and above curve R.sub.k,e, but that an atomic nucleus
          stripped of the electrons of the atom, e.g. a proton, conforms
          to these accepted laws of physics only when above the boundary
          R.sub.k,p (and between the same left and right boundaries in
          R-E space). The inventor believes that if the electrons are
          stripped away from atoms to leave only the atomic nuclei,
          e.g., only protons, in matter which starts out at a point in
          R-E space such as point 3 in FIG. 2, the matter will
          spontaneously move to the right in FIG. 2, from point 3 to the
          boundary R.sub.k,p, e.g., at point 2, and to accomplish this
          move will gain energy (delta E) which comes from a source that
          does not conform to the currently accepted principles of
          physics which cannot explain the naturally occurring ball
          lightning phenomenon. The inventor believes that the equipment
          and process described in connection with FIG. 1 is a species
          of the process of placing nuclei stripped of their electrons
          at a point in R-E space such as point 3 in FIG. 2 and
          extracting therefrom energy generated spontaneously due to the
          material's move to the R.sub.k,p boundary, e.g., to point 2.
          The inventor believes that when the gas is at the initial low
          pressure of about 10.sup.-1 mbar in vessel 10, it is at a
          point in R-E space such as point 3, at which the atoms or
          molecules of the gas have their electrons and their behavior
          conforms to the accepted principles of physics. The RF energy
          ionizes the gas in region 38 to leave some atomic nuclei free
          of electrons, but initially they are above the R.sub.k,p
          boundary because the spacial distance R between them is too
          great. As the pressure in vessel 10 rises, the distance R
          between electron-free ions decreases, and eventually
          electron-free nuclei find themselves below the boundary
          R.sub.k,p and spontaneously move to that boundary and in the
          process generate energies (delta E). Some of this energy is
          transferred as heat to waveguide 30 as well as to gas
          molecules in contact with or passing through region 38.
          Despite the high internal temperature of the gas in region 38
          due to this gain of energy, there is little or no radiation of
          heat because of the nature of the new state at region 38. In
          accordance with this hypothesis, the energy gain can be
          achieved when any suitable technique is used to place
          electron-free positive ions at a point in R-E space such as
          point 3 in FIG. 2. The inventor has conceived many embodiments
          of these principles in addition to that of FIG. 1, and has
          tested some of these different embodiments. It is not entirely
          clear at this time which may turn out to be preferred for
          particular end use, but for now the embodiment shown in FIG. 1
          is considered as the preferred embodiment for building and
          testing. Thus, the inventor believes that the invention is not
          limited to placing gas below atmospheric pressure in the new
          state in the manner described in detail above, but applies to
          producing a similar new state in the case of gas at higher
          pressure as well as in the case of substances in liquid or
          solid phase. For example, the inventor believes that a liquid
          phase substance such as liquid hydrogen can be a suitable
          replacement for the gas in vessel 10, provided that an
          energizer such as RF energy can concentrate enough energy per
          unit volume in the desired region to ionize a sufficient
          number of atoms to electron-free nuclei (protons) and maintain
          that state for a sufficient period of time to form a region
          similar in properties to region 38. When a substance such as
          liquid hydrogen is used, the liquid itself can be used as the
          heat-transfer medium and there would be no need for a separate
          heat transfer medium such as liquid 11. Similarly, a solid
          such as a crystal lattice of Palladium packed with positive
          hydrogen ions through a process such as electrolysis, can be
          used in place of the gas discussed above, in which case the
          solid can be shaped in the form of an RF waveguide
          concentrating RF energy at a selected region to cause the
          transition of the hydrogen ions packed in the solid to a new
          state such as that of the gas at region 38. In place of RF
          energy, the energizer can be a high-voltage discharge or a
          high-energy particle beam carrying out the same function as
          the RF energy discussed above: to place and maintain a
          sufficient number of electron-free ions below the barrier
          R.sub.k,p to achieve the effects discussed in connection with
          the gas in the new state at region 38. </p>

        <p><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
        <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
        <p>The present invention relates to the generation and/or
          production of energy, and in particular, to the generation
          and/or production of high-energy photons or quantum energy
          derived from the excitement of or active impact upon a quantum
          macro object produced within a controlled environment. </p>
        <p><b>2. Background of the Invention</b> </p>
        <p>The naturally occurring phenomenon known as ball lightning
          remains one of the greatest mysteries in the field of
          electromagnetism. Despite enormous contemporary advancements
          into the micro-universe (i. e. the fundamentals of the
          structure of atoms, nuclei, elementary particles, structure of
          the universe, etc. ), ball lightning remains largely
          undiscovered, although there has been significant interest in
          this phenomenon by numerous researchers and scientists. </p>
        <p>The nature and characteristics of ball lightning have
          remained largely unexplained for several reasons. First, there
          has not been found an effective way to reliably reproduce at
          least some of the unique effects of the phenomenon in a
          controlled and artificial environment. Second, its appearances
          seem to be random (other than the fact that it appears
          primarily during or after a thunderstorm), infrequent, and
          very brief, thus not providing a suitable setting in which to
          study this phenomenon even as it naturally occurs. In
          addition, most individuals that have had occasion to observe
          ball lightning have not had sufficient training in the
          sciences. As a result, the origin, properties, and nature of
          ball lightning still remain baffling to experts. </p>
        <p>Although largely misunderstood, and although several have
          experimented with trying to artificially recreate ball
          lightning in the laboratory, due to the documented instances
          where ball lightning has been observed and the events that
          have taken place during these observations, many have come to
          believe that this relatively small object contains a colossal
          amount of potential energy. </p>
        <p>This belief stems mostly from some of the rather impressive
          and strange events that have resulted from the presence of
          what was believed to be the elusive phenomenon of ball
          lightning. Although there is widespread belief that ball
          lightning comprises significant potential energy, trying to
          reproduce ball lightning in the lab in order to research and
          possibly exploit this potential source of energy has proved
          all but impossible. </p>
        <p>In the past, several attempts have been made to reproduce
          ball lightning. In one instance, ball lightning is believed to
          have been created by taking a material, such as a gas, at an
          initial pressure below atmospheric. The gas is treated with RF
          energy at a frequency greater thanI MHz to transition the gas
          to a glow discharge state, and then at increased pressure to a
          new state, wherein the average internal temperature is the
          same or an order of magnitude higher than in the glow
          discharge state, but the rate or radiating heat is at least an
          order of magnitude lower than in the glow discharge state.
          Energy only in the form of heat is extracted from
          the"new"object through contact with a heat conducting member.
        </p>
        <p>This particular method suffers in that it merely provides for
          the creation of an object in a new state, without more. This
          new state is believed to be ball lightning, but little is
          discussed regarding the availability of energy within the"new
          state"object beyond that of heat. Indeed, the new object is
          said to have an internal temperature on the order of magnitude
          higher than the internal temperature of the glow discharge
          state and that this energy may only be extracted through the
          use of a heat conducting member. </p>
        <p>However, other than heat, no energy is realized through the
          creation of the described object. </p>
        <p><b>SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>Despite the deficiencies found within the prior art,
          significant advantages would be realized from the generation
          or production of energy from an object possessing similar
          properties and characteristics as those believed to be found
          in ball lightning. This object, referred to as a"quantum macro
          object"for purposes of this description, is taught herein.
          Although the object is believed to be "artificial"ball
          lightning, any later significant advances made on ball
          lightning that distinguish the described quantum macro object
          away from ball lightning are not to be considered limiting as
          it would still be advantageous to be able to generate energy
          from an object possessing such unique properties and
          characteristics as those found in the quantum macro object as
          described and taught herein despite whether it is actually
          artificially reproduced ball lightning or some other
          phenomenon. </p>
        <p>Therefore, it is an object of the preferred embodiments of
          the present invention to provide a method for generating a
          quantum macro object. </p>
        <p>It is another object of the preferred embodiments of the
          present invention to provide a method for generating
          high-energy photon particles or quantum energy derived and
          released from the potential energy found in the created
          quantum macro object. </p>
        <p>To achieve the foregoing objects, and in accordance with the
          invention as embodied and broadly described herein, the
          present invention features a method and system for generating
          high- energy photons. These high-energy photons are believed
          to be quantum energy. The quantum energy generated by the
          process as taught herein is derived from a quantum macro
          object, which is believed to possess similar properties and
          characteristics as those of ball lightning. In particular, the
          quantum macro object possesses a positively charged nucleus
          having a definite and distinct boundary, and an electron cloud
          directly adjacent the boundary that comprises a plurality of
          quantum electrons in a quantum state, and a plurality of
          free-floating electrons not associated or connected with the
          quantum macro object. The quantum electrons within the quantum
          macro object are believed to possess an enormous amount of
          potential energy that may be converted and released as quantum
          energy. The quantum energy is also believed to be a free gift
          of nature and capable of being utilized in numerous practical
          applications. </p>
        <p>The method of generating high-energy photons, or quantum
          energy, comprises in general: (a) isolating a gaseous
          substance within a bounded area, wherein the gaseous substance
          and the bounded area contain a plurality of composition
          particles; (b) energizing the gaseous substance, and
          particularly the particles within the gaseous substance and
          the bounded area, thus causing the gaseous substance to
          transition into a glow discharge plasma state, wherein the
          particles are separated into their component atomic nuclei and
          electron parts; (c) increasing the gas pressure within the
          bounded area to transition the glow discharge plasma to a
          quantum macro object, wherein the quantum macro object
          comprises a positively charged nucleus and an electron cloud
          surrounding the positively charged nucleus, the electron cloud
          comprising a plurality of quantum electrons and a plurality of
          free-floating electrons, the quantum electrons comprising
          large amounts of potential energy; (d) energizing the quantum
          electrons by inducing an active impact upon the quantum macro
          object, wherein the quantum electrons are caused to orbit the
          nucleus of the quantum macro object such that the potential
          energy within the quantum electrons is converted and released
          in the form of high-energy photons or quantum energy. The
          bounded area is typically created by a dielectric of various
          sorts, such as within a dielectric container. Moreover, the
          potential energy within the quantum electrons is believed to
          be a free gift of nature as a result of the combination of
          atomic nuclei to form the positively charged nucleus and the
          filling of quantum energy levels by the quantum electrons
          associated with the nucleus of the quantum macro object. </p>
        <p>In a preferred embodiment, the present invention features a
          method and system of generating quantum energy comprising: (a)
          filling a dielectric container with a gaseous substance, the
          dielectric container having an identified volume; (b) placing
          the dielectric container within a radiation chamber; (c)
          energizing the gaseous substance to transform the gaseous
          substance into a plasma or glow discharge plasma state; (d)
          transforming the plasma into a new state to obtain a quantum
          macro object having a positively charged nucleus with a
          definite and distinct boundary and an electron cloud adjacent
          to and surrounding the boundary, the electron cloud containing
          a plurality of electrons in a quantum state and a plurality of
          free-floating electrons not associated with the quantum
          object, the electron cloud contained within a dielectric
          barrier created between a dielectric wall within the
          dielectric container and the nucleus of the quantum macro
          object; and (e) inducing an active impact upon the quantum
          macro object by energizing the quantum electrons with an
          electrical current, wherein the quantum electrons are caused
          to accelerate in an orbital motion around the quantum macro
          object, thereby radiating high-energy photons in the form of
          quantum energy. </p>

        <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
        <p>It will be readily understood that the components of the
          present invention, as generally described and illustrated in
          the figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide
          variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more
          detailed description of the embodiments of the systems and
          methods of the present invention, and represented in FiguresI
          through 14, is not intended to limit the scope of the
          invention, as claimed, but is merely representative of the
          presently preferred embodiments of the invention. </p>
        <p>As it is believed that the quantum macro object of the
          present invention, as discussed and explained herein,
          possesses similar properties and characteristics as the
          naturally occurring phenomenon known as ball lightning, a
          brief and general discussion of ball lightning is provided. It
          should be emphasized, however, that although it is believed
          that some or all of the properties and characteristics of the
          quantum macro object of the present invention are similar or
          identical to those of ball lightning, the inventor makes no
          claims that the quantum macro object is indeed artificially
          created ball lightning. The focus of the present invention is
          the production and generation of high- energy photons or
          quantum energy as derived and obtained from a quantum macro
          object. </p>
        <p>Therefore, whether the quantum macro object is indeed ball
          lightning, or whether it is some other body, does not affect
          the scope or substance of the invention as taught and
          described herein. </p>
        <p><b>GENERAL NATURE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF BALL LIGHTNING</b> </p>
        <p>Although several books and papers have been written on the
          subject, there seems to be a common conception regarding the
          properties and characteristics of ball lightning. Ball
          lightning is generally described as a fireball or plasmid
          observed as a glowing, self-luminous sphere moving slowly or
          floating in the atmosphere. It is usually associated with
          lightning strokes or thunderstorm activity. </p>
        <p>Natural ball lightning has been observed to have a diameter
          that typically ranges anywhere from 1 cm to several meters.
          Reported observations indicate that ball lightning is a
          luminous sphere as bright as a strong household fluorescent
          lamp that has a steady glow or shine. However, some have
          reported that the ball's luminosity pulsates. In addition,
          most balls appear to have relatively uniform surface
          brightness and appear to be optically thick. In general, ball
          color, size, and luminosity are reported to remain constant
          throughout the life of the object. The colors reported have
          ranged across the entire visible spectrum; however, green and
          violet are rare. </p>
        <p>Ball lightning has been known to last from a few seconds to
          greater than 150 seconds. These relatively long lifetimes are
          one of the most intriguing features of ball lightning as this
          may suggest that the ball possesses some inherent energy
          source independent of external sources. On the other hand,
          some balls have been reported to fade out quietly, while
          others disappear abruptly, and occasionally with an explosion
          or by breaking into small fragments. On the whole, observers
          report detection of no radiant heat from the balls, even when
          the ball passes by at close range. </p>
        <p>Ball lightning further appears to have neutral buoyancy as it
          is sometimes seen to descend relatively slowly through the
          atmosphere before striking the ground. However, it most
          frequently appears to float, sometimes hovering in one place
          at a constant distance above the ground for many seconds.
          Normally, the ball moves horizontally, but sometimes it moves
          vertically through the air with a speed of one-tenth to
          several meters per second. Ball lightning has been observed to
          move against the prevailing wind. Thus, it can be deduced that
          ball lightning may be acted upon by environmental conditions.
          However, it has also been reported that ball lightning is
          attracted to conductors and transformers, as well as moving as
          a result of the positive charge on the earth's surface during
          a thunderstorm, thus leading one to believe that ball
          lightning carries with it a considerable electric charge. </p>
        <p>Observers are usually unaware of any sound being emitted by
          ball lightning, although most observations are made at a
          significant distance from it. When it terminates, its behavior
          ranges from simply phasing out of existence with barely an
          audible popping sound, or no sound at all, to a sudden
          termination and major explosion that can do more damage than a
          hand grenade. The final disappearance of a ball is
          occasionally reported to leave a slight mist or residue. An
          odor variously described as resembling ozone, or sulfur, or
          nitrogen dioxide is sometimes associated with ball lightning.
        </p>
        <p>Despite attention by distinguished scientists over a period
          of 150 years, ball lightning remains one of the greatest
          mysteries of electrical activity in the atmosphere. </p>
        <p>The majority (approximately 80%) of ball lightning appears to
          be associated with thunderstorm activity and in many cases
          directly after a lightning flash. In many instances, the first
          appearance of the ball occurs at or close to the impact point
          of a cloud-to-ground flash. A substantial number of
          occurrences are observed inside buildings, submarines, or
          other enclosed structures, although in some of these cases the
          actual origin of the ball may be outside such structures. On
          several occasions, ball lightning has been observed moving
          down the aisle of a passenger airplane in flight after the
          plane had been struck by lightning. A surprising occurrence
          reported by many eyewitnesses is that a moving ball can
          penetrate through doors, closed windows, chimneys, and other
          apertures without causing material damage. Phenomena
          resembling ball lightning are often reported emanating from
          the funnels of tornadoes, cyclones, waterspouts, and
          hurricanes. They have also been seen during earthquakes and
          volcanic activity. In other words, their occurrence is in
          circumstances where high electric fields would be expected to
          exist. </p>
        <p>Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this phenomenon is its
          potential energy. In recent years, ball lightning has
          attracted attention because many believe it to possess a
          significant amount of potential energy. What this energy is,
          or to what degree it exists is unknown because the total
          energy and energy density of ball lightning are very difficult
          to estimate accurately. Calculations are based on
          observations, and particularly various effects or damage
          resulting from the final disappearance or explosion of ball
          lightning, followed by estimated or calculated guesses as to
          the amount of energy required to produce the observed damage.
          These investigations have shown that ball lightning may have a
          total energy content ranging from 0.01 J to values greater
          than 10 MJ. For comparison, the energy content of a hand
          grenade is approximately 1 MJ. A believed characteristic value
          for the energy content of ball lightning is approximately 10
          to 100 J. </p>
        <p>Estimates have been made not only of the energy content of
          ball lightning but also its energy density. The data fall
          along a straight line, indicating a lognormal distribution,
          with a median energy of approximately 5J/cm3 and extreme
          values ranging from less than10-3J/cm3 to values higher
          than105 J/cm3. The very high value of the energy density at
          the upper end of the distribution is significant. For example,
          the energy density of TNT, which has one of the highest energy
          contents of any solid explosive, is-2000J/cm3, far below the
          maximum observed for ball lightning. </p>
        <p>Ball lightning is observed to maintain an approximately
          constant diameter during its entire lifetime, thus suggesting
          a balance between the external atmospheric pressure and the
          net kinetic pressure of the plasma/magnetic field
          configuration inside the ball lightning. Because the external
          pressure on ball lightning is 1 atm, this places an upper
          bound on the net kinetic pressure inside the ball lightning of
          no more than 105 N/m. </p>
        <p>The observations of ball lightning suggest a plasma-related
          phenomenon with significant magnetic energy potential. </p>
        <p>Much uncertainty surrounding the existence of ball lightning,
          as well as the infrequent appearances of ball lightning, has
          resulted in the failure of scientists and/or physicists to
          perform any in depth analysis, or to devote any serious
          attention to the study of ball lightning. Moreover, although
          many have tried, it is believed that no one has yet been able
          to successfully artificially reproduce ball lightning in the
          laboratory. </p>
        <p>Several reasons exist for the lack of attention. First, many
          believe the phenomenon to be insignificant to the point that
          no one expects to realize any great benefit for humankind from
          understanding the nature of ball lightning. Many believe that
          the energy of ball lightning is negligible and comes form an
          external source, even though some recent studies have
          suggested that perhaps ball lightning does indeed contain
          significant energy potential. Second, to reproduce a natural
          phenomenon under controlled conditions first requires a clear
          understanding of what, exactly, the natural phenomenon is. So
          far, modern scientists are not clear about the nature of ball
          lightning. </p>
        <p>As explained, up to this point, observations, not
          experimentation, have been the only source of information.
          Further, this information is based simply on the statistical
          analyses of the reported sightings of ball lightning by
          members of the general public. </p>
        <p>Despite all of this, it is believed that ball lightning does
          possess significant potential energy. </p>
        <p>In addition, it is believed that the quantum macro object of
          the present invention possesses similar energy potential,
          whether the quantum macro object is ball lightning or not.
          Thus, what follows is a proposed model of the quantum macro
          object, including its properties and characteristics as they
          make possible the generation of high-energy photons or quantum
          energy. </p>
        <p><b>PROPOSED HYPOTHESIS OR MODEL OF THE QUANTUM MACRO OBJECT</b>
        </p>
        <p>As will be explained in greater detail below, the quantum
          energy generated or produced by the method and system of the
          present invention is dependent upon the creation of a quantum
          macro object. </p>
        <p>To understand the significance of the quantum macro object of
          the present invention along with its unique properties and
          characteristics, it is first necessary to propose and discuss
          the inventor's understanding of the boundaries of the ordered
          world as they currently exist, and the quantum realm that
          exists outside these boundaries. Referring to Figure 1, shown
          are several identified boundaries on a graph, where the
          vertical axis is the spatial distance R, in cm, between
          particles such as atoms, or ions, or atomic nuclei, or
          protons; and the horizontal axis E is the energy of a particle
          in Erg. The inventor believes that the ordered world and its
          matter such as atoms, which have their normal complement of
          electrons, conform to the currently accepted principles of
          physics when in the R-E space, which is to the right of curve
          Rd, to the left of curve Rc, and above the curve Rk,p. It is
          within these boundaries that the substances and materials that
          exist to make up the ordered world and the known universe are
          determined and predictable. These substances are material
          objects existing in three-dimensional space. Specifically,
          within the area limited by the quantum boundaries Rk, p,Rd,
          andEk, all of the known laws of physics, including the law of
          gravity and law of conservation of energy, are strictly
          observed. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, outside of this area, or these boundaries,
          such as below the boundaryRk, p, the physical face of the
          world changes drastically as a result of being outside the
          boundaries of the ordered world and within what may be termed
          the quantum realm. In the quantum realm, the known laws of
          physics are altered and unpredictable. Moreover, material
          objects become two-dimensional quantum objects where it is
          believed that many of the laws of physics do not apply and are
          even violated, such as with the principle of conservation of
          energy. For example, if gas (e. g. air) is forced to ionize
          very quickly(10-6 to 10-9 seconds) and completely enough so
          that the energy absorbed by the atomic nucleus is low, the
          complex ionized atomic nuclei that result could lay outside
          the determined area of existence of the substance. This is
          explained in greater detail below. </p>
        <p>The inventor believes that if the electrons are stripped away
          from their associated atoms toleave only the atomic nuclei, e.
          g. , only protons, in matter which starts out at a point in
          R-E space such as point 3 in Figure 1, the matter will
          spontaneously move to the right in Figure1, from point 3 to
          the boundary Rk, p e. g. at point 2, and to accomplish this
          move will gain energy, which comes from a source that does not
          conform to currently accepted principles of physics. The
          inventor believes that the method of generating quantum
          energy, along with the system used to generate such energy, as
          will be explained below, is dependent upon first, the process
          of placing nuclei stripped of their electrons at a point in
          R-E space such as point 3 in Fig.1 and extracting therefrom
          the energy spontaneously generated as a result of the
          material's move toward the Rk, p boundary, e. g. , to point 2,
          and second, creating an outside active impact upon the quantum
          macro object to cause the electrons to radiate quantum energy.
        </p>
        <p>The inventor also believes that gas, as it exists within the
          ordered world, is at a point in R-E space, such as point 4, at
          which the atoms or molecules of the gas have their electrons
          and their behavior conform to the accepted principles of
          physics. As commonly known, the atoms and/or molecules of the
          gas may be caused to ionize, in which some of the atomic
          nuclei are left free of electrons, but these electrons are
          initially above the Rk, e boundary because the spatial
          distance R between them is too great. As will be explained
          below, the inventor believes that the spatial distance between
          the electron-free ions may be caused to be decreased, such
          that the electron-free nuclei find themselves below the
          boundary Rk, p, during which time they spontaneously move to
          that boundary and in the process generate energy (shown in
          Figure 1 as E). Although this energy is impressive, it is only
          a start. The quantum macro object, through this process,
          coupled with the creation of an active impact upon the quantum
          macro object, will provide for the awesome generation of
          quantum energy. </p>
        <p>The quantum macro object of the present invention may be
          created from the surrounding air if certain conditions are met
          that allow existing electrons to fill quantum energy
          levels,En, where n represents the quantum number of a
          particular electron. Preferably however, the creation of the
          quantum object is facilitated through the use of a plasma
          generated from a gaseous substance exposed to high frequency
          radiation. The high frequency field and high temperature
          facilitate the release of electrons with an initial velocity
          and energy of V, and El respectively. Importantly, as
          conditions are met causing the various atomic nuclei to form
          into a macro positively charged nucleus, the associated
          electrons, because of Pauli's exclusion principle, are forced
          to jump to thehighest quantum energy levels, thereby
          becoming"quantum electrons. "In other words, these electrons
          suddenly receive additional energy, or potential energy, that
          is not derived from their immediate environment, but is a free
          gift of nature. This additional potential energy may be
          released or converted to quantum energy when these electrons
          are acted upon by some external source. Thus, the practical
          applications of being able to contain and channel this energy
          are immediately apparent. </p>
        <p>It is not possible to isolate a volume in ordinary plasma.
          Plasma particles (electrons and atomic nuclei) cannot be
          captured by a holding force. They diffuse unobstructed into
          the surrounding atmosphere. The quantum macro object of the
          present invention is a structureless nuclear component that
          forms a metastable homogenous compact body with well-defined
          section boundaries. The structureless nuclear component cannot
          mix with the atoms of the atmosphere, which are separate and
          distinguished as individuals, even though the quantum macro
          object plasma can be penetrated by atmospheric atoms. The
          quantum macro object is an autonomous body. </p>
        <p>The quantum macro object is a stable body. This stability
          results from the nuclear forces underlying
          its"destructive"strength, as well as the balance between the
          creative (nuclear) forces of attraction and the destructive
          forces of repulsion (electromagnetic forces). The radius of
          activity of the forces of attraction is only R &lt; Rk, p
          while the forces of repulsion are unlimited, meaning, of
          course, unlimited when there is no"screen"created by particles
          with opposite charges. If the quantum macro object releases
          its negative charge, or only part of it, then it will be
          destroyed under the electromagnetic forces of repulsion. If,
          for example, one electron is isolated from each atom of 1cm3
          air, and if the isolated electrons are placed at a distance
          equal to 1 cm. , an enormous force of attraction between
          electrons and positive ions will be created. The pressure
          resulting from the repulsion force between the same electrical
          charges within the charged volume will also be enormous. Thus,
          it is absolutely impossible to have considerable division
          between electric charges in ordinary plasma. However, this
          same situation becomes a possibility with the quantum macro
          object. </p>
        <p>The quantum macro object is a material continuum with no
          discrete particles. The substance of the quantum macro object
          (atoms, molecules, clusters) is not neutral. Moreover, the
          quantum macro object is a very good conductor of electricity.
          Its contact with charged conductors initiates very powerful
          emissions instantaneously. In short, the quantum macro object
          is a superconductor. If a current from an external source is
          induced from the exterior, it will circulate within the
          quantum macro object endlessly unless there is a leak. </p>
        <p>The most mysterious aspect of natural ball lightning is the
          source of its energy. Readers who are interested in the
          problem are acquainted with numerous hypotheses attempting to
          explain the source of its proposed colossal energy. None,
          however, can explain all of the peculiarities in ball
          lightning's behavior. Some hypotheses suggest that the energy
          comes from within the sphere of ball lightning-that it is
          somehow stored in the form of chemical or physical energy.
          However, evaluating the maximum value of the potential energy
          shows that it is no higher than the energy necessary for the
          complete ionization of the atoms, which is much lower than the
          destructive energy unleashed by ball lightning that witnesses
          have observed. A second set of hypotheses suggests that the
          energy source exists outside of the sphere of ball lightning
          and reaches the sphere by an electric guide or a wave-guide.
          This hypothesis is also unsatisfactory. To compensate for the
          losses received within the volume occupied by the ball
          lightning requires that the wave-guide or current channel
          possess enormous energy-about 100Wt/cm2. </p>
        <p>Like ball lightning, the quantum macro object of the present
          invention also is believed to possess enormous energy
          potential. The quantum macro object, because of the quick and
          complete ionization of its atoms, appears to be below the
          bottom quantum boundary Rk, p (point 3 in Figure I). </p>
        <p>In this state, it is"hidden, "undetermined. It has no contact
          with the surrounding, determined world and remains unnoticed.
          To escape its isolation and at the same time to preserve the
          density of its substance (R = R3) unchanged, the quantum macro
          object appears on the bottom boundary Rk, change either. The
          quantum macro object nucleus is"closed to the inside,
          "therefore, no macro- material formation can penetrate through
          the quantum surface. </p>
        <p>When observing the quantum macro object experimentally, the
          macro nucleus and the electron cloud are perfectly visible and
          distinguished from one another. In several of these
          experiments (using a quartz dielectric container and air as
          the gaseous substance), the color of the electron cloud was
          orange. The nucleus was observed as having a sharp spherical
          boundary between the orange-colored electron cloud and the
          volume of gas closed by this quantum boundary. Using various
          levels of input power, the quantum macro object may become
          transparent. In this state, the quantum macro object radiates
          a lot of heat, but no shining plasma formations are visible in
          its volume. This experiment provides a very good visual
          illustration of the two-dimensional structure of the nucleus
          of the quantum macro object. </p>
        <p>The nucleus of the quantum macro object is also impermeable
          to electrical current. In one experiment, a rather weak high
          voltage current (in some experiments: U = 15,000 volts, I =
          0.01 amps) was used to create an arc discharge between two
          electrodes. Instead of penetrating the nucleus and taking the
          shortest route between two points (the electrodes), the
          electrical current traveled around the nucleus of the quantum
          macro object, thus sort of"sliding"along the surface of the
          nucleus. </p>
        <p>Several experiments have led the inventor to formulate many
          beliefs about the quantum macro object. First, the quantum
          macro object is a giant macro atom composed of a two-
          dimensional quantum nucleonic nucleus and a three-dimensional
          electronic shelf. Second, the quantum macro object is an
          unusual material object behaving much like a material point in
          space. </p>
        <p>On the quantum surface of this two-dimensional material body,
          there are no differentiated points or areas. Third, the
          nucleus of the quantum macro object is a closed
          two-dimensional material formation, which can be deformed
          without changing the volume of the surface. Fourth, it is not
          possible to create the quantum macro object between two closed
          surfaces (like ordinary plasma). </p>
        <p>Fifth, the surface of the nucleus of the quantum macro object
          is much like a mirror in which every particle can see its
          counterpart. </p>
        <p>The quantum macro object as a source of energy has
          overwhelming advantages. It is believed that it will produce
          quantities of very cheap energy, may be used to construct very
          powerful electron accelerators, require no burning of fossil
          fuels, create no waste products, create no environmental
          hazards, be safe to use, and be technically simple to
          manufacture, maintain, and adapt to commercial and household
          use. </p>
        <p><b>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING A QUANTUM MACRO OBJECT
            AND QUANTUM ENERGY THEREFROM</b> </p>
        <p>The presently preferred embodiments of the invention will be
          best understood by reference to the drawings wherein like
          parts are designated by like numerals throughout. </p>
        <p>The present invention comprises methods and systems for
          generating quantum energy from a quantum macro object.
          Primarily, the methods of generating this quantum energy will
          be discussed in detail below, with the actual physical devices
          and systems used to carry out the steps of the present
          invention discussed to a lesser extent. </p>
        <p>Simply stated, the method of generating quantum energy
          according to the present invention is dependent upon two major
          steps, the first being the creation of a quantum macro object,
          wherein the quantum macro object possesses certain
          characteristics and properties capable of being acted upon to
          produce quantum energy; and the second being the creation of
          an active impact upon the quantum macro object to facilitate
          the conversion of the potential energy within the quantum
          macro object into useable kinetic energy in the form of
          high-energy photon particles or quantum energy. </p>
        <p>Figure 2 is a flow chart showing the general steps required
          to generate quantum energy using any embodiment. Specifically,
          Figure 2 shows step 50, that of supplying a plurality of
          electrons to a <br>
          bounded area. This may be accomplished by using a closed
          dielectric container and supplying a gaseous substance within
          the dielectric container; by using an open dielectric
          container in conjunction with an electron gun or supply that
          generates electrons when properly radiated, such as with high
          frequency microwave radiation; or without a container
          altogether, wherein the electrons are obtained from the
          surrounding air. Step 54, that of causing the electrons to
          fill available energy levels, with some filling quantum energy
          levels, may be accomplished by creating a plasma within an
          evacuated dielectric container to break down atoms into their
          electron and atomic nuclei components; or by filling an open
          container with a large number of electrons with an electron
          gun; or by supplying a very large amount of input power into a
          system containing air in a bounded area. </p>
        <p>Step 58, that of generating a quantum macro object, wherein
          the quantum macro object comprises a positively charged
          nucleus and an electron cloud surrounding the nucleus, and
          wherein the electron cloud comprises a plurality of
          free-floating and quantum electrons, may be accomplished in
          several ways. One way is to increase the gas pressure within a
          plasma filled dielectric container; another way is to
          continuously supply a large number of electrons into a bounded
          area until the quantum macro object appears. Finally, step 62,
          that of inducing an active impact upon the quantum macro
          object by energizing the quantum electrons, wherein the
          quantum electrons are caused to move in an orbital manner
          about the nucleus, thereby giving off or radiating quantum
          energy, is also accomplished several ways. Some of these
          include subjecting the quantum object to an electromagnetic
          field where a current is induced within the quantum macro
          object; another way is to use two electrodes to create an
          induced current within the quantum macro object. As can be
          seen, the quantum electrons are energized from an outside
          current. It is this current that causes the quantum electrons
          to orbit and radiate quantum energy. </p>
        <p>Figure 3 is a flow chart showing generally the steps of the
          presently preferred embodiments of the present invention
          employed to generate quantum energy. The steps in Figure 3 are
          merely intended to give a broad overview of the process
          undertaken, with the details of the equipment and device(s)
          used, the characteristics of each phase or step, and the
          details going into each step being described in greater detail
          below. Referring to Figure 3, shown is first step 70, that of
          filling a dielectric container with a gaseous substance. The
          next step, step 74, is to place the dielectric container
          within a high frequency radiation chamber that may be
          insulated and/or salable to the outside environment. Once the
          gas filled dielectric container is placed within the radiation
          chamber, the dielectric container may be evacuated, or
          partially evacuated. The next step, step 78, involves
          energizing the gas to obtain a glow-discharge state. This glow
          discharge-state is simply a plasma state obtained by ionizing
          the gaseous substance contained within the dielectric
          container to break down the atoms within the gaseous substance
          into their atomic nuclei and electron components. </p>
        <p>Following the energizing of the gaseous substance, the next
          step, step 82, involves increasing the gas pressure within the
          dielectric container to transform the plasma into a new state,
          which state is the formation or transformation of the plasma
          into a quantum macro object. The created quantum macro object
          is believed to be a two-dimensional object and comprises a
          nucleus with a definite and distinct boundary, and an electron
          cloud or shelf that is directly adjacent to and surrounds the
          nucleus. The electron cloud or shelf further comprises a
          plurality of quantum electrons and a plurality of
          free-floating electrons therein. The free-floating electrons,
          although existing within the electron cloud, are not connected
          or associated with the quantum macro object. These
          free-floating electrons are kept within the electron cloud
          because of the dielectric barrier produced between the
          positively charged nucleus and the dielectric wall of the
          container. This is discussed further below. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, the quantum electrons are connected with
          the quantum macro object much the same way the electrons in a
          micro atom are bound to the nucleus of the atom. As a result
          of their being disassociated from their atomic nuclei during
          the formation stages of the quantum object, the quantum
          electrons may not leave the electron cloud because they are
          drawn to the positively charged nucleus due to their negative
          charge. As stated, these quantum electrons possess extremely
          high-energy levels. In fact, the energy levels assumed by
          these quantum electrons are within the quantum realm (below
          the boundary Rk, p as shown in Figure 1). The extremely
          high-energy potential in the quantum electrons results from
          their obeying Pauli's exclusion principle. Specifically, the
          quantity of electrons within the electron cloud determines the
          energy level of the electrons because each electron is
          organized into energy levels. </p>
        <p>Finally, once the quantum macro object is obtained or
          generated, the next step, step 86, involves inducing an active
          impact upon the quantum macro object by energizing the quantum
          electrons in the electron cloud, wherein these quantum
          electrons are caused to move in an orbital manner around the
          quantum macro object. As the quantum electrons orbit the
          quantum macro object, they produce or radiate quantum energy.
        </p>
        <p>Figure 3 also shows optional step 90, which involves
          initially pressurizing the dielectric container and gaseous
          substance to supply and place a greater amount of gaseous
          substance within the dielectric container. Pressurizing the
          dielectric container so more of the gaseous substance may be
          used results in a more dense gaseous substance where a greater
          number of atomic particles are present within the dielectric
          container. This contributes to both the size of the quantum
          energy generator needed and strength and/or density of the
          radiated quantum energy particles. </p>
        <p>As Figures 2 and 3 have been provided to lay out the general
          and preferred process or method steps of the present
          invention, respectively, the following figures, particularly
          Figures 4-14, are presented to illustrate these several steps,
          along with some of the physical devices and systems used to
          carry out these steps, in order to create a better
          understanding of the present invention. It should be noted
          that Figures 4-11 are merely representative of one embodiment,
          a preferred embodiment, of the present invention. Therefore,
          the processes explained and the systems, devices, and/or
          equipment used to carry out the specific process steps, should
          not be taken to limit the invention in any way. Other
          embodiments, showing various processes and systems, are also
          presented herein, but these are also not meant to limit the
          invention in any way as it may be possible, as one of ordinary
          skill in the art will recognize, to achieve the results of
          generating high photon particles or quantum energy, or causing
          electrons in a highly excited state to emit or radiate energy,
          by using other techniques or methods not discussed herein, but
          that are still within the spirit of or related to the present
          invention as taught and explained herein. </p>
        <p><b><i>Step One --- Supplying a gaseous substance</i></b> </p>
        <p>Figure 4 is illustrative of the first step in the process of
          generating quantum energy. </p>
        <p>Specifically, Figure 4 shows gaseous substance 158 as it is
          contained within dielectric container 150. </p>
        <p>Dielectric container 150 is filled with gaseous substance 158
          by directing a line from inlet feed 152 directly into
          dielectric container 150. Although not shown, it is apparent
          that inlet feed 152 is coupled to some type of a storage
          medium that comprises an adequate storage of gaseous substance
          158 for later use. While explained in greater detail below,
          this storage medium may contain one or several different types
          of gaseous substances and is capable of continuously providing
          gaseous substance 158 to dielectric container 150 through
          inlet feed 152 in a normal or pressurized state. </p>
        <p>Figure 4 also shows radiating chamber 154 used to house
          dielectric container 150 and to facilitate radiating gaseous
          substance 158 in order to complete ionization of gaseous
          substance 158 during the process of generating quantum energy.
          Radiating chamber 154 is preferably a high frequency radiation
          chamber, such as a microwave chamber, that is capable of
          containing and supplying high frequency radiation within a
          defined and bounded area in a continuous manner as needed.
          Radiation chamber 154 provides an environment wherein
          dielectric container 150, and particularly the gaseous
          substance 158 within dielectric container 150, may be radiated
          with high frequency radiation. Radiating chamber 154 should be
          of sufficient size and of suitable shape so as to be able to
          house dielectric container 150 and the equipment needed to
          carry out the method of generating the quantum macro object
          and resulting quantum energy, and to absorb fully the input
          microwave radiation. As stated, radiating chamber 154 is
          preferably a high frequency radiation chamber. It is desirable
          that radiation chamber 154 also be a resonating chamber, thus
          providing complete containment of the high frequency
          radiation. Although it may be possible to use several
          different types of radiation to ionize the gaseous substance,
          such as, for example, R-F energy, microwaves, radiation from
          lasers, or electromagnetic fields, the discussion and method
          described and taught herein focuses on the use of microwaves
          generated or radiated at a frequency between about 10 MHz and
          100 GHz. </p>
        <p>One of the recognized advantages of the present invention
          lies in the material makeup of dielectric container 150. While
          the use of dielectric container 150 is not entirely necessary
          to the generation of the quantum macro object or the
          production of quantum energy, in this preferred embodiment,
          dielectric container 150 is desirable. Stated simply, the
          level of power input into the system that is used to generate
          the quantum macro object and ultimately quantum energy governs
          whether dielectric container 150 is necessary. These
          parameters are discussed in greater detail below in reference
          to one of the alternative embodiments of the present
          invention, wherein quantum energy may be created without the
          use of a dielectric container. </p>
        <p>In the event a container is employed, the container should be
          comprised of a dielectric container 150. Dielectric container
          150 is necessary as it is intended to work in conjunction with
          the bounded nucleus of the created quantum macro object to
          provide a double electron barrier, or dielectric barrier,
          whose purpose is to contain the free-floating electrons and to
          keep them within a bounded region, namely the electron cloud
          of the quantum object. Otherwise, they would be free to move
          into the surrounding environment. As mentioned above, the
          quantum electrons are naturally constrained within the
          electron cloud due to their physical properties and
          relationship to the positively charged nucleus of the quantum
          object. </p>
        <p>One side of this double electron barrier is formed within the
          wall of dielectric container 150, with the other side being
          formed by the anti-electron boundary of the positively charged
          nucleus of the quantum macro object. Essentially, the double
          electron barrier provides a shield for the free- floating
          electrons so they do not crash through the wall of dielectric
          container 150, but instead rebound, thus being able to
          continue to sustain the vitality of the quantum macro object.
          It is important to note that these free-floating electrons
          rebound from the dielectric barrier without substantial energy
          loss. </p>
        <p>A dielectric is a type of insulator or resistor that governs
          the permittivity of electric particles, such as electrons.
          Stated differently, a dielectric material is a substance that
          is a poor conductor of electricity, but an efficient supporter
          of both weak and intense electrostatic fields. If the flow of
          current between opposite electric charge poles is kept to a
          minimum while the electrostatic lines of flux are not impeded
          or interrupted, an electrostatic field can store energy. In
          practice, most dielectric materials are solid. Examples of
          good dielectric materials include porcelain, ceramic, mica,
          glass, quartz, plastics, and the oxides of various metals.
          Some liquids and gases can also serve as good dielectric
          materials. Dry air is an excellent dielectric. Distilled water
          is a fair dielectric. A vacuum is an exceptionally efficient
          dielectric. </p>
        <p>An important property of a dielectric is its ability to
          support an electrostatic field while dissipating minimal
          energy in the form of heat. The lower the dielectric loss (the
          proportion of energy lost as heat), the more effective the
          dielectric material. Another consideration is the dielectric
          constant, the extent to which a substance concentrates the
          electrostatic lines of flux. </p>
        <p>Substances with a low dielectric constant include a perfect
          vacuum, dry air, and most pure, dry gases such as helium and
          nitrogen. Materials with moderate dielectric constants include
          ceramics, distilled water, paper, mica, polyethylene, and
          glass. Metal oxides, in general, have high dielectric
          constants. </p>
        <p>Although useful in other areas, high-dielectric-constant
          substances, such as aluminum oxide, are generally not able to
          withstand intense electrostatic fields like their
          low-dielectric-constant counterparts, such as air. Thus, if
          the voltage across a dielectric material becomes too great ---
          that is, if the electrostatic field becomes too intense ---
          the material will suddenly begin to conduct current. </p>
        <p>This phenomenon is called dielectric breakdown. In components
          that use gases or liquids as the dielectric medium, this
          condition reverses itself if the voltage decreases below the
          critical point. But in components containing solid
          dielectrics, dielectric breakdown usually results in permanent
          damage. </p>
        <p>In keeping with the focus of the present invention, the
          inventor has discovered that low- dielectric-constant
          substances are advantageous because of their ability to
          withstand and maintain high or intense electrostatic fields.
          As such, dielectric container 150 is preferably comprised
          primarily of quartz, ceramics, or porcelains, as these provide
          the necessary electron layer (or dielectric) within the wall
          of dielectric container 150, thus allowing the wall of
          dielectric container 150 to serve as one side of the double
          electron barrier needed to contain the energized electrons (or
          other particles). In the event the present invention is
          performed without the use of dielectric container 150, other
          mediums, for example dry air, which is an excellent
          dielectric, may serve to create the necessary conditions for
          generating the quantum macro object of the present invention.
        </p>
        <p>Another advantage of the dielectric of the present invention
          is its ability to allow high frequency radiation to penetrate
          the dielectric wall of the container, while functioning to
          keep the free-floating electrons in, thus allowing the gaseous
          substance contained therein to be exposed and bombarded by the
          high frequency radiation. </p>
        <p>Figure 4 further shows gaseous substance 158 contained within
          dielectric container 150. </p>
        <p>Gaseous substance 158 is typically a low atomic number
          gaseous substance because of the electron composition within
          these gasses and the ability of these gasses to quickly ionize
          into a plasma. The most common types of gaseous substances
          used to create the quantum macro object are air, oxygen,
          nitrogen, helium, argon, hydrogen, with air being the
          preferred gaseous substance in this particular embodiment. </p>
        <p>Gaseous substance 158 is allowed to fill the volume of
          dielectric container 150, thereby providing sufficient
          particles and matter used to generate the quantum macro object
          and carry out the generation of quantum energy. Gaseous
          substance 158 is fed into dielectric container 150 through
          inlet feed 152 either under normal atmospheric pressure, or
          under some pressurized state where the gaseous substance is
          more dense. The effect of filling dielectric container 150
          with a gaseous substance under pressure, such that its
          composition is of a greater density than it would be at normal
          atmospheric pressure, is that there is a greater amount of
          particles present within the gas. The greater the density of
          the gas, the greater the energy potential of the quantum
          electrons as they are required to fill even higher energy
          levels, thus increasing in their potential energy. In turn,
          this directly bears upon the level and intensity of the
          quantum energy radiated from the quantum macro object. In
          addition, the type of radiation given off by the quantum macro
          object is directly related to the density of the quantum macro
          object. Therefore, if the gaseous substance is much more dense
          due to the pressure under which it is introduced into the
          dielectric container, then it follows that the plasma formed
          from the ionization of the gaseous substance will contain or
          comprise a greater number of particles in the form of atomic
          nuclei, electrons and ions. As such, the quantum macro object
          created or generated from the plasma will likewise exhibit and
          possess, or be comprised of, a much more dense makeup, which
          in turn, directly relates to the intensity of the photons or
          quantum energy radiated from the quantum electrons of the
          quantum macro object following an active impact thereon. In
          other words, the intensity and type of quantum energy produced
          is dependent upon the number of quantum electrons within the
          quantum macro object. This concept of initially providing a
          pressurized gaseous substance to dielectric container 150 is
          discussed further below. </p>
        <p><b><i>Step 2 --- Evacuating the dielectric container</i></b>
        </p>
        <p>Finally, Figure 4 shows vacuum means 156. Vacuum means 156 is
          used to evacuate dielectric container 154, either completely
          or partially prior to filling dielectric container 150 with
          gaseous substance 158. Evacuating dielectric container154
          prior to introducing gaseous substance158 therein serves to
          provide a more conducive atmosphere for ionizing the particles
          within dielectric container 150 and gaseous substance 158 into
          a plasma or a plasma state. Following its evacuation, and
          during radiation of radiation chamber154, dielectric container
          150 is allowed to fill with gaseous substance 158 according to
          the principles and procedures discussed above. As explained
          above, dielectric container 150 may be filled with gaseous
          substance 158 at any pressure. </p>
        <p>Vacuum means 158 may be any known device or system existing
          in the art, such as one or more rotary vacuum pumps. </p>
        <p>It should be noted that evacuating dielectric container 150
          is not necessary for the creation of a quantum macro object.
          As will be explained below, a quantum macro object may be
          created despite evacuating dielectric container 150. In the
          event dielectric container 150 is not evacuated, certain
          environmental conditions must be met and obtained within
          radiating chamber 154 in order to facilitate the creation of
          the quantum macro object. For example, the use of a gaseous
          substance under pressure, where no evacuation of the
          dielectric container is undertaken, is possible only if Power
          input, HF radiation into the system (i. e. microwave power) is
          large enough to generate the number of electrons needed to
          occupy quantum energy levels. This has been achieved at a
          level wherePowerinput, HF radiation is greater than 15 kW.
          Stated simply, if Power Input is small, then evacuation of
          dielectric container 150 and the creation of a plasma is
          preferred due to the ability of a plasma to facilitate the
          generation of a quantum macro object. On the other hand, if
          Power input is large enough, no vacuum is needed and no plasma
          is required to generate the quantum macro object. </p>
        <p><b><i>Step 3 --- Energizing the gaseous substance to create a
              plasma</i></b> </p>
        <p>As noted above, the quantum object of the present invention
          may be created without first generating a plasma or glow
          discharge plasma state and without evacuating the dielectric
          container 150. However, since the creation of a plasma
          facilitates the generation of the quantum object, it is
          preferred that a plasma be used. </p>
        <p>Referring now to Figure 5, shown is the transition of the
          gaseous substance 158 of Figure 4 to a plasma state. Using
          vacuum means 156, once the volume within dielectric container
          150 is evacuated, high frequency supply164 is activated to
          introduce high frequency radiation 162 within radiation
          chamber 154. High frequency 162 radiation ranges from about 1
          MHz to about 100 GHz in frequency, and is preferably in the
          form of microwave radiation ranging from about 1 GHz to about
          5 GHz in frequency. However, one ordinarily skilled in the art
          will recognize the several types of energizing radiation,
          other than RF energy, that can be used to generate or
          transform gaseous substance 158 into a plasma. For example,
          high-voltage discharges and/or high-energy particle beams, may
          be used to attain the ionizing effects required to create a
          plasma. </p>
        <p>In the preferred embodiment, as radiation chamber 154 is
          filled or bombarded with high frequency microwave radiation
          162, gaseous substance 158 is allowed to fill dielectric
          container 150, which causes gaseous substance 158 to be
          exposed to high frequency radiation 162. The particles within
          the gaseous substance must be energized. In order to properly
          energize the particles, high frequency generator 164 must be
          able to concentrate enough energy per unit volume in the
          desired region to ionize a sufficient number of atoms to
          electron-free nuclei (protons) and maintain that state for a
          sufficient period of time. Such exposure causes gaseous
          substance 158 to transition or transform to a normal plasma or
          glow discharge plasma state 166, with its component atomic
          nuclei 170 and electron 174 particles. </p>
        <p>Transforming a gas into a plasma is well known in the art,
          and one ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize the
          various ways this specific process may be carried out.
          However, a brief description of a plasma is thought to be
          necessary as its component parts play a major role in the
          composition and makeup of the quantum macro object. </p>
        <p>Plasma consists of a collection of free-floating electrons
          and ions-atoms that have lost electrons. Plasmas are generated
          by transforming a gaseous substance from a neutral state using
          energy to cause the formation of charge carriers. Electrons
          and ions are produced in the gas phase when electrons or
          photons with sufficient energy collide with the neutral atoms
          and molecules in the feed gas (electron-impact ionization or
          photo ionization). There are various ways to supply the
          necessary energy for plasma generation, such as with thermal,
          electrical, or light/radiation energy --- energy in the form
          of ultraviolet or intense light from a laser or microwave. One
          possibility is to supply thermal energy, for example in
          flames, where exothermic chemical reactions of the molecules
          are used as the prime energy source. Adiabatic compression of
          a gas is also capable of heating the gas to the point of
          plasma generation. Yet another way to supply energy to a gas
          reservoir is through the introduction of energetic beams that
          moderate in a gas volume. Any volume of a neutral gas always
          contains a few electrons and ions that are formed. These free
          charge carriers may be accelerated by an energy source, such
          as high frequency microwave radiation, so that new charged
          particles are created when the charged carriers collide with
          the atoms and molecules in the gaseous substance. This leads
          to an avalanche of charged particles that is eventually
          balanced by charge carrier losses, so that a steady-state
          plasma develops. In addition, this energy is required to be
          sustained in order to maintain the plasma state. In the event
          the energy is lost or discontinued, the plasma reverts back to
          or recombines into its neutral gaseous form. </p>
        <p>Referring back to Figure 1, if a gaseous substance (e. g.
          air) is forced to ionize very quickly and completely enough so
          that the energy absorbed by the atomic nucleus is low and the
          energy is transferred or channeled into the electrons instead
          of the atomic nuclei, the complex ionized atomic nuclei that
          result could lay outside the determined area of existence of
          the substance. The protonic (nucleon) gas component of the
          atomic nuclei can become a structureless unit quite easily,
          while achieving such a state is very hard for an electron
          component. A structureless unit is simply one way of
          describing a particle outside the ordered world and within the
          quantum boundaries. </p>
        <p>Normal proton (nucleon) matter occurs predictably in a
          determined region of matter in the universe. A homogeneous
          gas, such as hydrogen for example, when subjected to gradual
          heating, becomes completely ionized at a certain temperature
          (Ts-105 K). Its atoms disassociate, thus disintegrating to
          their component electrons and atomic nuclei. The result of
          this disintegration is ordinary hydrogen plasma. It occupies a
          position above the quantum boundary Rk, p because the initial
          gas volume has expanded (that is, the distance R between the
          neighboring particles-nuclei has increased) or the average
          energy per particle has increased. The plasma is at point 4 in
          the determined quantum region as shown in Figure 1. </p>
        <p>If as stated, however, the hydrogen gas is forced to ionize
          very quickly and very completely, so that the energy absorbed
          by the atomic nuclei is low, the atomic nuclei that result
          could lie outside the determined region, such as at point 3 in
          Figure 1. Experiments carried out by many scientists have
          established with certainty that ordinary (determined) plasma
          cannot initiate stable plasma states/formations, but abnormal
          (undetermined) plasma can. </p>
        <p><b><i>Step 4 --- Transforming the plasma into a quantum macro
              object</i></b> </p>
        <p>As the quantum macro object of the present invention is
          believed by the inventor to possess and exhibit similar
          properties and characteristics as the naturally occurring
          phenomenon ball lightning, and according to documented
          observations and many popular opinions that ball lightning has
          stored therein, and is capable of expending, extremely large
          amounts of energy, it follows that the quantum macro object of
          the present invention also is believed to possess a great
          amount of potential energy. Through the creation of the
          quantum macro object, generation of quantum energy becomes
          possible as this potential energy is converted and released as
          high-energy photons. </p>
        <p>Upon reaching a suitable plasma or plasma state 166 according
          to the process described above, the next step involves the
          transformation or transition of plasma 166 into a quantum
          macro object. As mentioned, dielectric container 150 is not
          required to be evacuated prior to the creation of a quantum
          macro object. However, in the event vacuum means 156 is used
          to facilitate the <br>
          formation of plasma 166, once plasma 166 is formed, vacuum
          means 156 is turned off in order to allow the gas pressure
          within dielectric container 150 to be increased. </p>
        <p>Figure 6 illustrates the"new"state quantum macro object 176
          of the present invention as generated from plasma 166 of
          Figure 5. Quantum macro object 176 is shown contained within
          dielectric container 150 and radiation chamber 154. </p>
        <p>The process of transforming plasma 166 to a "new" state or
          into a quantum macro object 176 involves several steps. It
          should be noted that during this process and throughout the
          maintenance of the quantum macro object and generation of
          quantum energy, radiation 162 is required to be continuous and
          ongoing within radiation chamber 154 for the purpose of
          providing the required conditions to sustain quantum macro
          object 176 for the duration of the generation of quantum
          energy. After plasma 166 is generated, the gas pressure in
          dielectric container 150 is increased at a calculated rate. In
          one experiment, the gas pressure was increased over a time
          span of approximately two minutes to a pressure of 1 atm.
          Increasing the gas pressure within dielectric container 150
          causes plasma 166 to begin to transition to quantum macro
          object 176. As the gas pressure is increased, the more visible
          and defined quantum macro object 176 appears. Specifically,
          the component particles or atomic nuclei in the plasma (shown
          as 170 and 174 in Figure 5) separate and "melt" together.
          During this process, the atomic nuclei 170 essentially lose
          their individuality or identity. What results is a autonomous
          and homogenous positively charged nucleus 178 and an adjacent
          electron cloud 186 surrounding positively charged nucleus 178
          to form a quantum macro object 176. The two major components
          of quantum macro object 176 --- the positively charged nucleus
          178 and electron cloud or shelf 186-along with quantum macro
          object 176 itself, possess unique properties and
          characteristics. </p>
        <p>First, electron cloud 186 contains a plurality of highly
          excited electrons (quantum electrons) 188 within the quantum
          realm (i. e. above the minimum energy level 198 in Figure 7),
          as well as a number of free-floating electrons 190. Quantum
          electrons 188 are associated directly with quantum macro
          object 176, while free-floating electrons 190 are not
          associated with quantum macro object 176. It is believed that
          quantum electrons 188 have enormous potential energy as a
          result of their unique quantum state, and that this potential
          energy may be released and converted into useful kinetic
          energy (quantum energy). Moreover, it is important to note
          that since quantum electrons 188 obtained this energy as a
          free gift of nature, the quantum energy radiated from quantum
          electrons 188 is continuous and ongoing, without loss, as long
          as the conditions are maintained that enabled the creation of
          quantum object 176. </p>
        <p>Second, positively charged nucleus 178 has no definite
          internal structure. Its individual nuclei are
          undistinguishable. As a result, forces of attraction between
          the nuclei weld them together, thus creating a relatively
          stable and structureless nuclear formation. The nuclei have
          "melted" and disappeared, ceasing to be individual nuclei. </p>
        <p>Moreover, positively charged nucleus 178 is similar to and
          has similar properties and characteristics as the nucleus of
          micro atoms. Therefore, positively charged nucleus 178
          comprises or possesses a distinct and identifiable boundary
          182 and an electron cloud 186 directly adjacent boundary 182
          of nucleus 178. In addition, it is believed that positively
          charged nucleus 182 is a two-dimensional object, while
          electron cloud 186 exists in three-dimensional space. </p>
        <p>The nuclear forces causing cohesion among the nuclei of the
          quantum macro object have the same nature as those in the
          ordinary atomic nuclei as explained above. Referring again to
          Figure1, on passing beyond the quantum boundary Rk, p the
          electromagnetic forces of repulsion between the atomic nuclei
          of the same, positive charge become even more powerful forces
          of attraction. </p>
        <p>The nuclear forces of cohesion provide the stability of the
          quantum macro object, just as in naturally occurring ball
          lightning. The nucleons in the nucleus lose their
          individuality because the average distance (R) between them is
          less than Rk, p, forming a structureless quantum macro object.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, each electron in the quantum macro object is
          distinguishable and individual, has its own value parameters,
          and helps form the electron-determined cloud component of the
          quantum macro object. </p>
        <p>One significant advantage of the quantum macro object of the
          present invention is that it is believed by the inventor to be
          a giant macro atom, thus possessing similar properties and
          characteristics as those micro atoms existing within the
          boundaries of the ordered world and as commonly understood.
          Because the quantum macro object is an enormous atom, Pauli's
          principle is operational within the electron cloud of the
          quantum macro object-it is impossible to have two or more
          electrons that exist in the same quantum state. </p>
        <p>Briefly, an atom consists of an electron cloud surrounding a
          dense nucleus of protons and neutrons. Because of the opposite
          charges of an electron and the particles (protons) in the
          nucleus, there is an attraction between the electrons and the
          nucleus. It is this attraction that holds the atom together. </p>
        <p>It is commonly accepted that electrons in an atom behave as
          both particles and waves, a characteristic called
          wave-particle duality. Wave-particle duality affects all
          particles and collections of particles, including protons,
          neutrons, and the atoms themselves. In regards to the atom, it
          is accepted that the wavelike structure of the electron is
          most important, with these electrons occupying orbitals having
          determined levels of energy in the form of kinetic and
          potential energy. Moreover, in a stable atom, the orbitals in
          the atom just occur at certain distances from the nucleus. </p>
        <p>As shown in Figure 7, the number of half-wavelengths that an
          orbital allows is known as the orbital's principal quantum
          number (abbreviated n), which in general, determines the size
          of the orbital. When electrons collect around an atom's
          nucleus, they fill up orbitals in a definite pattern. </p>
        <p>In short, the electrons seek the first available orbital that
          takes up the least amount of energy to occupy. Generally, it
          takes more energy to occupy higher level orbitals (e. g.
          quantum levels --- those within the quantum realm). Therefore,
          those electrons that occupy high levels will possess high
          amounts of potential energy. As an atom fills orbitals with
          electrons based upon availability, once the lower levels are
          filled an electron has no choice but to occupy the next
          highest level. Therefore, a sufficient number of free floating
          electrons are available within the dielectric container 150,
          which occupy the lower levels. The amount of electrons which
          can occupy the "n" energy level is: n-1, 1=03 (21+1) = n!,
          where l, n are the main quantum numbers. According to the
          principle of economy, the quantum macro object, and
          particularly quantum electrons 188, occupy quantum energy
          levels, shown as 198. </p>
        <p>Moreover, each electron in an atom possesses a particular
          energy. This energy depends upon the electron's speed, the
          presence of other electrons, the electron's distance from the
          nucleus, and the positive charge of the nucleus. Atoms gain
          energy in various ways. When an atom absorbs energy, one or
          more of its electrons moves to a higher, more energetic
          orbital. When electrons drop back down to their original
          energy states, they release their extra energy in the form of
          photons. Those electrons in the lower orbitals release much
          greater amounts of energy due to their attraction to the
          nucleus and difficulty in being excited. If quantum electrons
          188 radiate some energy then this energy can be only its full
          quantum energy. After this radiation, the quantum energy of
          the electron is restored instantaneously. Quantum energy
          cannot be divided in smaller parts. In other words, the energy
          spectrum of the radiating energy is discontinuous. </p>
        <p>Referring back to Figure 6, these basic principles are
          equally applicable to quantum macro object 176 of the present
          invention as this quantum macro object is believed to be a
          giant macro atom. As mentioned, the proton (nucleon) component
          of the gaseous substance can become a structureless quantum
          plasma body quite easily, while achieving such a state is
          impossible for the electrons because the boundary Rk, e is
          much lower than the boundary Rk, p (as shown in Figure 1). </p>
        <p>However, as this state is achieved, a plasma may be
          transitioned or transformed into a"new"state, which state is
          believed to be similar to that existing within naturally
          occurring ball lightning. The "new" state of the present
          invention is believed to possess similar properties and
          characteristics as a micro atom. This is the proposed state of
          quantum macro object 176. The plasma generated from the
          gaseous substance provides the necessary matter and particles
          needed to generate quantum macro object 176, with its
          associate plurality of particles 194, free-floating electrons
          190, and quantum electrons 188 that are in a highly excited
          quantum energy state and that are contained within electron
          cloud 186. </p>
        <p>One advantageous characteristic of the present invention,
          made possible through the creation of quantum macro object
          176, is its ability to generate and maintain a highly intense
          electrostatic field, without experiencing dielectric
          breakdown. When two objects in each other's vicinity have
          different electric charges, an electrostatic field exists
          between them. An electrostatic field also forms around any
          single object that is electrically charged with respect to its
          environment, such as positively charged nucleus 178 of quantum
          macro object 176 as surrounded by the negatively charged
          electron cloud 186 in combination with the plurality of
          free-floating electrons 190 that are not associated with
          quantum macro object 176, but remain between nucleus 178 of
          quantum macro object 176 and dielectric wall 210 present
          within dielectric container 150 (see Figure 9). </p>
        <p>An object is negatively charged (-) if it has an excess of
          electrons relative to its surroundings. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, an object is positively charged (+) if it
          is deficient in electrons with respect to its surroundings.
          Electrostatic fields bear some similarity to magnetic fields.
          Objects attract if their charges are of opposite polarity
          (+/-); objects repel if their charges are of the same polarity
          (+/+ or- /-). The lines of electrostatic flux in the vicinity
          of a pair of oppositely charged objects are similar to lines
          of magnetic flux between and around a pair of opposite
          magnetic poles. Electrostatic fields arise from a potential
          difference or voltage gradient, and can exist when charge
          carriers, such as electrons, are stationary. The intense
          electrostatic field created by the present invention results
          from the relatively small distance between highly excited
          quantum electrons 188 in the quantum level and positively
          charged nucleus 178. This is evident from Figure 8. </p>
        <p>Figure 8 illustrates positively charged nucleus 178, which
          may be considered a material point without spatial dimensions,
          and a single quantum electron 188 at a distance of r, njn 222.
          Positively charged nucleus 178 has a velocity 238 and Feu !
          226. Quantum electron 188 also has a velocity 234 (v = c), and
          also has an orbital velocity 242 and Center 230. These
          conditions serve to create an intense electrostatic field
          within quantum macro object 176. </p>
        <p>Referring to Figure 9, this field is made possible as a
          result of several factors, such as the use of low-dielectric
          constant materials and mediums or substances that are used to
          generate quantum macro object 176, the current and resulting
          voltage across these dielectric materials or substances, and
          the double electron barrier created between dielectric
          container 150 and positively charged nucleus 178. Shown in
          detail in Figure 9, dielectric container 150 comprises a
          container wall 202 having a thickness 203 sufficient to
          support the intense electrostatic field generated by the
          present invention. Container wall 202 is comprised of a
          dielectric wall 210. Dielectric wall210 comprises a plurality
          of charged electrons 212 that form to make up electron layer
          214 within thickness 203 of dielectric wall 210. Electron
          layer 214 is naturally adjacent inside edge 204 of dielectric
          wall 210. </p>
        <p>Also shown in detail, is quantum macro object 176 and its
          component parts, nucleus 178 and electron cloud 186. Nucleus
          178 is shown as being positively charged 218 at boundary 182.
          In addition, electron cloud 186 is shown having a number of
          free-floating electrons 190 therein that interact with each
          other, nucleus 178, and dielectric container 150.
          Specifically, free-floating electrons 190, and quantum
          electrons 188 that exist to make up electron cloud 186 are
          contained within the double electron or dielectric barrier
          created between electron layer 214 of dielectric wall210 and
          positively charged nucleus 178. This barrier serves an
          important and advantageous purpose in this particular
          embodiment by confining free-floating electrons 190 to a
          specific area where they may sustain the vitality of quantum
          macro object 176. Without dielectric wall210 and the
          dielectric barrier created between this wall and positively
          charged nucleus 178, free-floating electrons 190 would be free
          to move about unconstrained. In essence, this same principle
          is at work in nature when naturally occurring ball lightning
          is created. Given the proper environmental conditions, a
          natural plasma state (e. g. charged air) may be achieved that
          is confined within a dielectric wall or barrier formed by the
          charged air. The particles, and particularly the electrons,
          are confined within this barrier, meaning the electrons are
          prohibited from freely floating as they normally would. In
          this condition, the confined electrons may be actively
          impacted (e. g. typically by lightning), wherein ball
          lightning may be created. This explains why most recorded or
          observed instances of ball lightning have occurred during
          thunderstorms. </p>
        <p><b><i>Step 5 --- Inducing an active impact on the quantum
              macro object to generate quantum energy</i></b> </p>
        <p>Stated simply, there is an enormous amount of potential
          energy existing within quantum macro object 176, and
          particularly within quantum electrons 188, that may be
          released in the form of high-energy photons or quantum energy.
          This quantum energy is potential energy converted into useful
          kinetic energy and is believed to be free energy provided by
          nature. </p>
        <p>The realization of quantum energy is predicated upon the
          generation of quantum macro object 176 (in this embodiment,
          quantum macro object 176 is created within a dielectric
          barrier). </p>
        <p>However, although in a highly excited quantum energy state
          (see Figure 7), quantum electrons 188, without more, do not
          radiate energy or quantum energy. Rather, they must be
          appropriately acted upon and energized before the potential
          energy existing within each electron is released and converted
          into kinetic energy. Only then do they begin to radiate
          various heat and light emissions. </p>
        <p>Once a suitable quantum macro object exists, this further
          step of inducing an active impact upon quantum macro object
          176, and particularly quantum electrons 188, is required to
          convert potential energy into useful kinetic energy. It is
          this active impact upon quantum macro object 176 that provides
          the appropriate active impact needed to energize quantum
          electrons 188 and cause them to radiate quantum energy. </p>
        <p>The process or step of inducing an active impact upon quantum
          macro object 176 is illustrated in Figures 10 and 11. As
          before, these illustrations are merely presented as examples
          of two possible methods (and systems) that may be used to
          induce an active impact upon a created quantum macro object,
          and one ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that
          other methods and systems may exist to accomplish the intended
          result. </p>
        <p>The active impact used to energize quantum macro object 176
          stems from the movement of the electrons and other particles
          within the quantum macro object, namely quantum electrons 188,
          and free-floating electrons 190. Movement of the electrons is
          accomplished by inducing a current across quantum macro object
          176 as generated from some power source. Power input dictates
          the amount of electrons present. Various levels of Power input
          are presented below in the several examples. It should be
          noted however, that the excitement current must be at least 2
          amps, and preferably greater than 5 amps, with a voltage of at
          least 2,000 volts. To create a larger, more intense quantum
          macro object, one would simply increase Power input of the
          high frequency radiation to a greater level as the level of
          Power input determines the properties of quantum macro object
          176 and the quantum energy produced therefrom. </p>
        <p>Figure 10 shows radiation chamber 154 being inundated or
          bombarded with high frequency radiation 162 as provided by
          high frequency supply 164. As stated, high frequency radiation
          must be continuous to sustain the life of quantum macro object
          176. this is because as quantum electrons 188 radiate energy,
          they are instantaneously renewed by the conditions existing
          within quantum macro object 176. Also shown in Figure 10 is
          the type of system or device used to induce the active impact
          upon quantum macro object 176. Specifically, shown is an
          electromagnetic field generator comprising a dipole of
          magnetic source 250 (shown as upper electromagnet) and
          magnetic sink 254 (shown as lower electromagnet). Lead 258 is
          used to connect magnetic source 250 to magnetic sink 254, and
          power supply 246 is used to generate and supply the necessary
          power to magnetic source 250. Electromagnetic fields are well
          known in the art, therefore, they are not discussed in detail
          herein. However, it should be noted that the electromagnetic
          field is preferably supplied by a pulse electromagnetic field
          supply in order to reduce the size of the equipment in the
          system. A pulse electromagnetic supply is capable of inducing
          very strong electrical currents in electron cloud 186. </p>
        <p>Basically, when power supply 246 is turned on, magnetic
          source 250 causes to be produced magnetic flux 262, which
          carries an identified voltage and current that are used to
          actively impact quantum macro object 176. However, due to the
          characteristics and properties of quantum macro object 176,
          magnetic flux 262 is unable to penetrate nucleus 178 because
          of its two-dimensional nature. As a result, magnetic flux 262
          is forced to move without boundary 182 of nucleus 178, which
          causes magnetic flux 262 and the current being carried
          therein, to directly and actively impact quantum electrons 188
          and free-floating electrons 190 in electron cloud 186. This
          active impact energizes quantum electrons 188 and causes them
          to begin to move about quantum macro object 176 in an orbital
          manner, with these orbiting electrons being represented by
          lines 266. Movement of quantum electrons 188 is in an orbital
          or circular manner around positively charged nucleus 178, and
          within electron cloud 186, as they are not allowed to
          penetrate positively charged nucleus 178 due to its nature. It
          is this orbital movement about quantum macro object 176 that
          converts the enormous potential energy existing within quantum
          electrons 188 into kinetic energy. Essentially, the orbital
          motion causes quantum electrons 188 to begin to radiate
          high-energy photons, thus expelling the quantum energy derived
          from these electrons. </p>
        <p>Specifically, once a sufficient level of current is applied
          such that free-floating electrons are not allowed to serve as
          carriers to the induced current, quantum electrons 188 take
          over and act as carriers of the induced current. Every quantum
          electron 188 has two states. The first state is when it exists
          having quantum energy En. The second state is when it acts as
          a carrier to the induced current and begins to radiate
          high-energy photons. In this state, when acting as a carrier,
          quantum electron 188 orbits with kinetic energy, Ek. The
          kinetic energy Ek is equal to the potential quantum energy En
          existing within or possessed by quantum electron 188.
          Moreover, orbiting around positively charged nucleus 178,
          quantum electrons 188 radiate high-energy photons due to the
          centrifuge acceleration ac. The radiated high-energy photons
          possess energy En (quantum energy), which cannot be divided in
          smaller portions. After this initiated radiation, quantum
          energy is restored instantaneously within quantum object 176,
          again due to the Pauli's exclusion principle. As such, quantum
          object 176 provides an inexhaustible reservoir of energy. </p>
        <p>In order to properly energize quantum macro object 176, the
          input power level, and specifically the voltage and current
          used generated by power supply 246, must strong enough so that
          quantum electrons 188 carry the induced current and not
          free-floating electrons 190. This may be defined as the impact
          threshold. This impact threshold is typically overcome by
          supplying a minimum input power of about1, 000 watts, having a
          minimum input current of about 2-5 amps. If the input current
          is weak, then quantum macro object 176 will not be properly
          energized and the current will simply be picked up and carried
          by free-floating electrons 190. The power introduced does not
          have to be immediately above the impact threshold value. It
          may start below the threshold and then be gradually increased
          until it is of sufficient strength to energize quantum
          electrons 188. </p>
        <p>Having said this, it should be noted that the greater the
          current in the power level the greater the amount of quantum
          energy that will be produced or radiated. Thus, by simply
          increasing the level of current input from power supply 246,
          the intensity and amount of quantum energy produced is also
          increased. </p>
        <p>Figure 11 shows another way that may be used to create the
          active impact upon quantum macro object 176. Specifically,
          Figure 11 shows a first and second electrode 270 and 274,
          respectively attached to power supply 246. Unlike the
          electromagnetic field produced by the method and system
          described in Figure 10, an electric current is generated
          between first electrode 270 and second electrode 274. Again,
          due to the properties and characteristics of quantum macro
          object 176, the resulting current is unable to penetrate
          nucleus 178 of quantum macro object 176 because of its
          two-dimensional nature, but instead travels without boundary
          182. If the current is of sufficient strength so as to
          overcome the impact threshold needed to properly energize
          quantum electrons 188, quantum electrons 188 will begin to
          move about positively charged nucleus 178 in an orbital manner
          as shown by lines 266, at which time they will begin to
          radiate quantum energy as described above. </p>
        <p>The high-energy photons or quantum energy of the present
          invention may exist in several forms depending upon the
          conditions satisfied in creating the quantum object and
          inducing an active impact thereon. Basically, the high-energy
          photons emitted may cover the entire energy spectrum. </p>
        <p>For example, as the intensity of radiation is increased and
          the induced current is strong, the resulting high-energy
          photons will possess a higher level of energy and cover a
          different range of the energy spectrum than if the same
          happened at lower input levels. </p>
        <p>Figure12 is illustrative of another embodiment wherein
          dielectric container 150 may be in the form of other shapes
          besides the spherical one used in description above. In this
          embodiment, dielectric container 150 is cylindrical in shape.
          From this, one ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize
          that the present invention may be carried out using various
          sized and shaped systems. </p>
        <p>Figure 13 depicts the creation of a quantum macro object 176
          within a pressure vessel 290. </p>
        <p>Pressure vessel 290 serves to provide a more dense and
          compact environment, wherein a significantly greater number of
          particles are initially present within the gaseous substance.
        </p>
        <p>Increasing the initial pressure that the gaseous substance is
          under during the beginning stages of generating a quantum
          macro object provides several benefits. One advantage is that
          it allows the physical system or apparatus used to generate a
          quantum macro object to be smaller because the same number of
          particles that may be required to produce a desirable amount
          of quantum energy in a larger system operating at atmospheric
          pressure may be packed into a compact unit to produce an
          equivalent amount of quantum energy. Furthermore, significant
          costs may be cut, as well as being able to produce relatively
          small high power quantum energy generators. Other advantages
          not recited herein may also be realized by those skilled in
          the art. </p>
        <p>Figure 14 illustrates an alternative embodiment, wherein
          quantum macro object 176 may be generated using an open
          dielectric container 330 instead of a closed one as described
          above. In this embodiment, the process is similar, only open
          dielectric container 350 is not evacuated, and not plasma is
          required to create quantum macro object 176. </p>
        <p>In this embodiment, dielectric container 330 is open to the
          atmosphere as present within radiation chamber 154. As such,
          the process of creating quantum macro object 176 and quantum
          energy does not include the step of evacuating dielectric
          container 330. Instead of facilitating the transformation of
          the gaseous substance to a quantum macro object using a
          plasma, the gaseous substance (in this case air) is
          transformed into a quantum macro object plasma state by
          filling open dielectric container 330 with particles 352,
          namely electrons. To fill open dielectric container 330 with
          electrons, particle source 340 is placed within open
          dielectric container 330. High frequency radiation 162 is
          activated and caused to bombard or radiate radiation chamber
          154. A portion of this radiation 162 comes in direct contact
          with particle source 340, which in turn produces a plurality
          of particles, namely electrons 252, that fill open dielectric
          container 330. As shown, in this embodiment particle source
          340 comprises a tungsten coil 344 supported by support member
          348. </p>
        <p>Tungsten is used because of its superior resistivity to
          breakdown as opposed to other common metals. One ordinarily
          skilled in the art will recognize other types of metals or
          substances that may be used to perform the similar function as
          the tungsten coil, thus this should not be considered limiting
          in any way. </p>
        <p>Once supplied to open dielectric container 330, quantum macro
          object 176 begins to form possessing the properties and
          characteristics as described above. Quantum macro object 176
          may then be actively impacted to energize quantum electrons
          188 within electron cloud 186 to the point where they radiate
          quantum energy using the processes previously described. These
          various processes are not shown in Figure 14 as they are
          sufficiently described above. </p>
        <p>Finally, the quantum macro object of the present invention,
          and ultimately quantum energy, may be generated within a
          system that does not utilize either an open or closed
          container. In this embodiment, the quantum macro object is
          created within a radiation chamber just as before, but is
          created within a dielectric formed from the air within the
          system. Just as before, the radiation chamber provides a
          sufficient bounded area. Generating a quantum macro object
          without a container is achieved by creating a dielectric
          within the radiation chamber. As mentioned above, air is a
          good dielectric if sufficiently energized. The dielectric is
          created by providing a significantly increased amount of power
          input into the system, and particularly, the energizing
          medium, such as the input power used to generate the high
          frequency radiation. Thus, by providing enough input power,
          the air within the radiation chamber will form a dielectric
          barrier that functions just as the dielectric barrier created
          by the dielectric container of earlier described embodiments.
          Within this dielectric barrier, the air is also transformed
          into a plasma state, after which the plasma is transformed
          into the quantum macro object of the present invention by
          increasing the gas pressure within the system. Once the
          quantum macro object is formed, an active impact may be
          induced upon the quantum macro object to generate quantum
          energy. This is discussed in detail above. </p>
        <p>The power required to create the dielectric from the
          surrounding air is at least 15kW. The power required, however,
          depends upon whether the air is under pressure, or is simply
          at atmospheric pressure. This embodiment is particularly
          useful when large amounts of quantum energy are to be
          produced. A dielectric container is unable to withstand
          extremely high levels of input power (greater than 15 kW) and
          will be destroyed. In this case, the quantum object must be
          free-floating (i. e. created without a dielectric container
          and without contact with any solid wall). </p>
        <p>Again with this embodiment, as in all others, one ordinarily
          skilled in the art will recognize the various methods and the
          various equipment and devices that may be used to carry out
          the processes described herein. </p>
        <p>The present invention further features a system for
          generating high-energy photons. The system comprises a gaseous
          substance having a plurality of composition particles therein;
          means for containing said gaseous substance within a bounded
          area; means for energizing said gaseous substance, and
          particularly said particles therein, to transform said gaseous
          substance into a glow discharge plasma state, wherein the
          particles are separated into their component atomic nuclei and
          electron parts; means for increasing the gas pressure within
          the bounded area to transition the glow discharge plasma to a
          quantum macro object, wherein the quantum macro object
          comprises a positively charged nucleus and an electron cloud
          surrounding the positively charged nucleus, the electron cloud
          comprising a plurality of quantum electrons and a plurality of
          free-floating electrons, the quantum electrons comprising
          large amounts of stored potential energy; an energizer for
          energizing the quantum electrons by inducing an active impact
          upon the quantum macro object, wherein the quantum electrons
          are caused to orbit the nucleus of the quantum macro object
          such that the potential energy stored within the quantum
          electrons is converted and released in the form of quantum
          energy. </p>
        <p>The means for containing the gaseous substance may comprise
          various different types, such as an open dielectric container,
          a closed dielectric container, or a dielectric formed by
          charged air. A dielectric serves to provide a barrier for the
          free-floating electrons to keep them within the electron cloud
          of the quantum object in order that they may be present to
          sustain the vitality of the quantum object with smaller input
          power levels. </p>
        <p>The means for energizing said gaseous substance may also
          comprise various types of generators, such as a high frequency
          supply, an R-F generator, a high-voltage discharge generator,
          or a high-energy particle beam generator. These are not meant
          to be limiting in any way. Their specific function, that they
          be capable of energizing the gaseous substance to transform it
          into a plasma state, is the most important aspect. However,
          preferably, the energizer is a high voltage current supply
          assembly including its associated components, such as an
          assembly comprising two <br>
          electrodes coupled to a power supply, or an electromagnetic
          supply comprising upper and lower electromagnets coupled to a
          power supply and capable of inducing current through a created
          electromagnetic field. </p>
        <p>The detailed explanation above presents the preferred methods
          and systems used for generating quantum energy. However, other
          systems and methods may be employed to produce the intended
          results. While merely illustrative, the following examples
          represent theories of possible experiments, and several
          actually conducted experiments, along with the results
          obtained from these experiments. These examples are only
          illustrative and are not intended to be limiting in any way as
          one ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize various other
          procedures or methods, or various other components, devices,
          or systems, that may be implemented or utilized with the
          technology described and taught herein, but that are not
          specifically discussed in this disclosure, shown in the
          Figures presented, or illustrated in these several examples.
          As such, it is intended that all other methods and/or systems
          used to produce quantum energy or its equivalent are to be
          within the scope of the invention as claimed and taught
          herein. </p>
        <p><b><i>EXAMPLE ONE</i></b> </p>
        <p>This example represents the method of generating quantum
          energy as conducted within the constraints and with the system
          of the preferred embodiment as discussed above. </p>
        <p>In this method or experiment, a quartz container having a
          diameter of three and one half inches, and a wall thickness of
          0.4 cm, can be filled with air at normal atmospheric
          pressure(1 atm). </p>
        <p>Quartz may be used because of its ability to create a high
          temperature dielectric within its wall. </p>
        <p>The container is placed in a radiation chamber capable of
          emitting high frequency microwave radiation. Once in place,
          the volume of the container is evacuated using vacuum means.
          Once the container is sufficiently evacuated, the high
          frequency supply is activated, causing the radiation chamber
          to be filled with microwave radiation, thus in turn, radiating
          the air within the container. </p>
        <p>The power level generated by the high frequency supply and
          input into the system is kept constant at 2,000 watts, with
          the microwaves being radiated at a frequency of 2.48 GHz. The
          microwave radiation is continuously supplied via a waveguide
          at a constant frequency throughout each successive phase of
          the experiment, with antennas serving to provide a smooth
          radiation field. </p>
        <p>Activating the microwave radiation causes the air within the
          container to ionize and turn to a plasma state. At this time,
          the gas pressure within the container is increased slowly over
          a time period of about 2 minutes, and brought to a final
          pressure ofI atm. Increasing the gas pressure within the
          container at this rate had the effect of causing the plasma to
          transition to or transform into a"new"state. It is
          this"new"state that the inventor terms a quantum macro object.
          This quantum macro object is observed to comprise a positively
          charged two-dimensional nucleus and an electron cloud
          containing a plurality of free-floating electrons, and a
          plurality of quantum electrons occupying quantum states of
          energy. The free electrons within the electron cloud are
          observed to be confined within the dielectric barrier formed
          between the dielectric wall of the container and the
          positively charged nucleus. Moreover, the positively charged
          nucleus is observed to have a definite and distinct boundary.
          Although undetermined, the properties and characteristics of
          the quantum macro object are believed to behave as a giant
          macro atom, possessing similar properties and characteristics
          of micro atoms. </p>
        <p>The creation or generation of the quantum macro object is
          necessary for the production of quantum energy as explained
          above. However, the quantum macro object, and particularly the
          quantum electrons within the quantum macro object, do not
          radiate energy without being acted upon. </p>
        <p>As such, there must be an active impact induced within the
          quantum macro object to properly energize the quantum
          electrons to the point where they are caused to radiate
          energy. This active impact must be strong enough to overcome
          the impact threshold of the quantum electrons such that these
          electrons carry the induced current instead of the
          free-floating electrons contained within the electron cloud. </p>
        <p>In this experiment, the active impact may be created by
          inducing a high voltage electrical current upon the quantum
          macro object using an electromagnetic supply and a pair of
          electromagnets placed opposite one another without and
          adjacent the container. Once activated, the electromagnetic
          supply induces an electromagnetic field between the two
          opposing electromagnets. As is well known in the art, an
          electromagnetic field produces magnetic flux capable of
          inducing a current within a suitable carrier. In this case,
          the carrier is the quantum macro object, and particularly the
          quantum electrons within the electron cloud. </p>
        <p>An input power level produced by the electromagnetic supply
          at approximately 1600 watts, with the current being
          approximately 8 amps, and the voltage being approximately
          2,000 volts (dropping to approx. 200 watts after current is
          induced), should yield an output of about 7,000 watts. </p>
        <p>The particular power level (i. e. current and voltage)
          introduced in this experiment is enough to overcome the impact
          threshold and energize the quantum electrons. If the impact
          threshold is not overcome (i. e. the power level is
          insufficient), the current introduced would simply be carried
          by the free-floating electrons, thus merely creating an
          electrical discharge across the boundary of the nucleus and
          not energizing the quantum electrons. In short, no quantum
          energy is produced because the quantum electrons would not be
          sufficiently energized. As a result, the power level is
          determined to be extremely important. The input current level
          is discovered to have a direct effect upon the amount and
          intensity of the quantum energy generated. This is true for
          each of the examples provided herein. </p>
        <p>Once activated, the induced high voltage current excites or
          energizes the quantum electrons, thus causing them to move
          about the nucleus of the quantum macro object in an orbital
          manner. In doing so, the quantum electrons emit large amounts
          of high-energy photons, or quantum energy. </p>
        <p>The quantum energy in these particles is measured using a
          photometer. The measured power produced by these highly
          energized particles should be about 5,000 watts. In addition,
          the radiation produced by these highly energized quantum
          electrons in the form of heat should be about 2,000 watts, for
          a total power output of about 7,000 watts. </p>
        <p>The following table represents a summary of the system, and
          the theoretical results that should be achieved (i. e. quantum
          energy generated) from the present experiment. <br>

        <p><b><i>EXAMPLE TWO</i></b> </p>
        <p>The following example is identical to that of Example One,
          except the active impact is created using a high voltage
          electrical current generated by two opposing electrodes as
          shown in Figure 11. </p>
        <p>In this experiment, two electrodes made of tungsten material
          were placed within the dielectric container a distance apart
          from each other. These electrodes were coupled to a power
          supply that generated an input power level of approximately 1,
          600 watts, with a current of approximately 8 amps and a
          voltage of approximately 2,000 volts. </p>
        <p>Tungsten was used because of its superior resistance to the
          high-energy quantum electrons over other common metals, such
          as copper, or brass and their alloys. These other materials
          were quickly destroyed by the high-energy quantum electrons
          and the quantum high-energy photons radiated from these
          electrons. Once destroyed, the system lost its ability to
          actively impact the quantum macro object. As a result, the
          quantum electrons were no longer energized and the production
          or generation of quantum energy ceased. However, although
          tungsten is more resistive, eventually the electrodes are
          destroyed and must be replaced to continue the production of
          quantum energy. </p>
        <p>Like the electromagnetic field, if the high voltage current
          is insufficient to overcome the impact threshold of the
          quantum electrons to where they were energized, the high
          voltage current would merely be carried by the free-floating
          electrons within the electron cloud producing an electric
          discharge between the two electrodes. Although the creation of
          an electric discharge meant the quantum electrons were
          insufficiently energized and no quantum energy was being
          generated, this discharge led to an important observation.
          Instead of traveling in a straight line from one electrode to
          another through the nucleus of the quantum macro object (as
          would be the least resistive pathway for an electric current),
          the electric discharge was observed as traveling around or
          outside the nucleus. This phenomenon bolsters the contention
          by the inventor that the quantum macro object is a
          two-dimensional object with no interior volume, and that the
          quantum macro object is a giant macro atom. </p>

        <p><b><i>EXAMPLE THREE</i></b> </p>
        <p>In this experiment, the closed dielectric container described
          in Example One was replaced with an open container similar to
          the one shown in Figure 14 for the purpose of determining
          whether the quantum macro object could still be generated
          under without having to evacuate the container. </p>
        <p>Indeed, due to the openness of the container, it was
          impossible to evacuate the container. In this respect, the
          quantum macro object would be created under conditions closer
          resembling those in which natural ball lightning is created.
          Again, air was used as the preferred gaseous substance. In
          addition, the container was made of quartz to allow for the
          creation of a high temperature dielectric within its walls. </p>
        <p>Similar to Example One, the input power level of the high
          frequency radiation was generated at 2,000 watts, and at a
          frequency of 2.48 GHz. This level of power was required to
          ionize the air and to generate the quantum macro object within
          the container. The high frequency radiation was microwave
          radiation generated from a high frequency supply. </p>
        <p>The main difference between the present experiment and the
          first two examples or experiments is that the present
          experiment utilized an electron gun in the form of a tungsten
          coil to create the necessary particles (e. g. electron
          components) within the container. The tungsten coil was placed
          directly beneath the opening of the container. To fill the
          open container, high frequency radiation was activated. This
          radiation directly contacted the tungsten coil, which produced
          a plurality of electrons within the open container. See Figure
          14 and corresponding explanation. </p>
        <p>As the power was continuously supplied, the quantum object
          began to appear. Once the quantum macro object was produced,
          an active impact, similar to the one described in Example One,
          was introduced upon the quantum macro object, wherein quantum
          energy was generated. </p>
        <p>The following table represents a summary of the system used,
          and the results achieved (i. e. quantum energy generated) from
          the present experiment. <br>

        <p>Kiril Chukanov presents an experimentalist's dream come true:
          a detailed guide to creating ball-lightning for free-energy
          related applications, something that he's never before
          revealed to the public. Download our exclusive MS-Word
          overview for the photos, schematics, and instructions to begin
          your own experimentation today! </p>
        <p>Kiril notes that before starting work on this problem you
          must be willing to fight and overcome in yourself the
          scientific mentality which you received during your
          conventional university education. In other words, be very
          open-minded to ideas which considerably differ from the
          currently accepted scientific dogmas. </p>
        <p><b>Some Notables:</b> </p>
        <p>1. Ball Lightning is not Plasma; Ball Lightning is a
          Two-dimensional Macro Quantum Unit; </p>
        <p>2. Quantum Free Energy is not a bond energy ( chemical or
          nuclear); Quantum Free Energy is a result of a Violation of
          Law of Energy Conservation in some particular quantum
          conditions; Quantum Free Energy is not ZPE; ZPE is science
          fiction based on the ignorance and scientific ambitions of
          some free energy researchers; </p>
        <p>3. Plasma and nuclear scientists do not understand the nature
          of ball lightning and the nature of Quantum Free Energy; they
          cannot judge (from their scientific positions) the reality of
          this great scientific and technological discovery  do not
          take seriously their opinion and advices, avoid to discuses
          with them (this will be waste of time for you) this matter. </p>
        <p><b>The Next Step in Energy Generation</b> </p>
        <p>Kiril Chukanov provides additional detail into the

          questions that arose from Lesson #1. Click here for the

        <p>"The present paper is not a scientific article intended for
          publication in Nature magazine or any other respected
          scientific journal. This is a Gift from me to all people
          (scientists or laics) who are willing to replicate some of my
          experiments on Quantum Free Energy. All of the following
          presented facts on QFE are verified by experiment. </p>
        <p>I thank all people who sent their comments (majority of them
          directly to my e-mail address) on Lesson #1. In next lessons I
          will seriously take their critiques and recommendations. Most
          comments are amicable and encouragable. Other comments are
          critical and humiliating. Some people focus their critiques on
          my imperfect grammar and style. O.K., I agree  this is
          important for better understanding, but dont forget that I am
          an adopted son of America  my English cannot be as perfect as
          yours. Some critics are skeptical about the reality of the
          presented facts. Well, if you are skeptical, you can verify my
          claims in an experimental way  you have full information for
          that. In Lesson #1, I dont claim that ball lightning nucleus
          has temperature 10,000 K. What I want to say is: if considered
          as a plasma formation, ball lightning nucleus must have this
          temperature (corresponding to the observed color  white-sky
          blue). However, ball lightning nucleus is not a plasma
          formation (plasmoid), it is a Two-dimensional Macro Quantum
          Closed Material Contour. For more information you can see my
          scientific reports posted on my web-site. As explained in
          these reports, the source of energy of this very bright
          (white-sky blue formation) quantum object is the synchrotron
          free energy photon radiation. And, so on. If you want to
          understand this unusual natural phenomenon you just must
          change your plasma- nuclear mentality." </p>

          <b><font size="+1">Background of Dr Kiril Chukanov</font></b></center>
        <p>&nbsp;Dr Kiril Chukanov was born and raised in Bulgaria. In
          1963, Kiril Chukanov graduated with BS in Architecture and
          Civil Engineering from Sofia Architectural College, which is
          located in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. He then studied
          Civil Engineering from 1963-1965 in the Sofia Civil
          Engineering Institute. In 1965, Kiril Chukanov transferred to
          St Petersburg Civil Engineering Institute, which is located in
          St Petersburg, Russia, where, in 1969, he received his
          Masters Degree in technology.&nbsp; Dr Chukanov then
          continued his education in Moscow, Russia, where, in 1977, he
          received a PhD in thermodynamics. Some period of
          time(1969-1988) Dr K. Chukanov worked on different positions:
          production manager, research scientist, University professor.
          Since 1988 to date Dr K.Chukanov works exclusively on Quantum
          Energy research. In Bulgaria, 1988-1990, Dr Chukanovs QE work
          was mainly funded by the governamental organization NISA (now
          non-existing). During this period of time got a technical help
          from different persons, to whom he is very grateful. In 1990,
          Dr K.Chukanov was invited to a California based small company
          MPI in the USA, where he continued his research, obtained his
          first US patent on Quantum Energy. Between 1990 and 1992 Dr
          Chukanov worked on his Quantum Free Energy project in the
          Silicon Valley located company Genmark Automation. His work
          was supported by Genko Genov  owner of this company (Genko
          Genov died in accident in 1998). </p>
        <p>Dr Chukanov is not implemented in the USA and managed by
          some secret person (out of the USA) as some, obviously
          mentally ill people, are claiming. Dr Kiril Chukanov is not
          connected or supervised by any persons or organizations in,
          and out of the USA. </p>
        <p>During some short period of time (1992-1993) Dr Kiril
          Chukanov worked on the problem of Cold Fusion in the
          University of Utah. </p>
        <p>In 1993, Dr Kiril Chukanov founded company General Energy
          International located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Later, 1996,
          Dr Chukanov founded another research company Chukanov Quantum
          Energy, LLC which exists now. </p>
        <p>In the USA Dr Kiril Chukanov published three books: Final
          Quantum Revelation (General Quantum Mechanics-Part I,1994),
          General Quantum Mechanics -Part II (2001), and General Quantum
          Mechanics  Part III (2005). Dr.Chukanovs intellectual rights
          on Quantum Energy are protected by two patents. </p>
