          style="font-style: italic;">
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      A team of scientists from the University of Southampton have
      developed a revolutionary ultrasonic attachment for taps, which
      massively enhances the ability of water to clean.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, industry uses excessive water, power and additives for
      cleaning. For example, it can take up to 100 tonnes of water to
      produce 1 tonne of clean wool after shearing. Many industrial
      processes also generate large quantities of contaminated run-off.
      The water from hosing down an abattoir represents a real health
      risk and cannot be allowed to enter the water supply. Purifying
      run-off is costly -- each cubic metre of water used for cleaning
      in the nuclear industry can cost around £10,000 to subsequently
      treat.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Tim Leighton and Dr Peter Birkin's device works with
      cold water, minimal additives and consumes as much electrical
      power as a light bulb. Its application will be wide -- licenses
      have already been sold to a number of industries to look at
      cleaning in food preparation, hospitals, manufacturing and the
      home. The new technology consumes less water and power than the
      established competitor technologies.<br>
      <br>
      Talking about the need for such a technology, Professor Leighton
      says: "Society runs on its ability to clean. Ineffective cleaning
      leads to food poisoning; failure of manufactured products such as
      precision watches and microchips; and poor construction -- from
      shipbuilding to space shuttles -- since dirty surfaces do not
      bond. The impact in healthcare is huge -- hospital-acquired
      infections, from instruments that aren't properly cleaned, cost
      the NHS £1 billion per year. There's a very obvious need for
      technologies that improve our ability to clean while saving on our
      most important resources, water and energy."<br>
      <br>
      In recognition of their invention, Professor Leighton and Dr
      Birkin were awarded the Royal Society Brian Mercer Award for
      Innovation 2011 on Nov. 10.<br>
      <br>
      Using the £250,000 award from the Royal Society, the team will
      develop products based on an ultrasonic nozzle which can fit on
      the end of a tap or hose. The device uses less water and power
      than the equivalent pressure washer (approximately 2 litres/minute
      compared to 20 litres/minute and less than 200 W compared to 2kW).
      It is also far less damaging as the stream pressure is less that
      1/100th that of a pressure washer. Another advantage is that it
      generates far less runoff and aerosol (tiny atmospheric particles
      of water that can carry contaminates into the air to then settle
      and contaminate other surfaces). As it is able to use cold water,
      energy is saved on heating water.<br>
      <br>
      Power washing generates large volumes of contaminated run-off and
      aerosols, presenting a hazard when used e.g. cleaning sewage
      systems or nuclear contamination. One of the main pieces of
      equipment currently used for industrial cleaning, ultrasonic
      cleaning baths, can only clean objects small enough to fit in them
      and the devices to be cleaned sit in a soup of contaminated
      liquid. Neither power washing (high-power pressure washing) nor
      ultrasonic cleaning baths can easily be scaled up and neither can
      be used on delicate materials such as hands or salad.<br>
      <br>
      The new nozzle generates both bubbles and ultrasound. Both travel
      down the water stream to the dirty surface and there the bubbles
      act as microscopic 'smart scrubbers', seeking and entering
      crevices to remove dirt there using shear forces in the same way
      that currents in a babbling brook can strip off riverbank soil .
      The device can be used at a high-power and a low-power setting --
      the latter being suitable for delicate products like hands and
      foodstuffs.<br>
      <br>
      Licences to enable companies to bring the technology into their
      product lines have been negotiated with a number of companies to
      explore cleaning products for hospital hygiene, dentistry, food
      preparation, manufacturing and the power industries.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Birkin says of the award: "The Brian Mercer award represents a
      significant milestone for the development of this technology and
      its possible exploitation. There is a clear gap in the funding
      system with ground breaking technology produced by universities,
      unexploited by industry. It is also difficult to find other
      suitable sources to take the technology further. It is in this
      situation that our invention found itself.<br>
      <br>
      "In these trying times for innovative research, the foresight of
      the Royal Society to regularly sponsor and support these
      initiatives, should be congratulated. It is also pleasing that a
      significant 'blue skies' research effort within our team, over the
      last 10-15 year time period, has led to an understanding of the
      basic physical and chemical processes that underpin this
      technology. The Brian Mercer award, as well as being timely, will
      significantly enhance the chances of this novel technology making
      the leap from the lab and into wider society."<br>
      <br>
      Professor Leighton adds: "Support for step changing innovation is
      vital if we are to have marketable technology to address the
      problems that will face society on the 10-50 year timescale,
      rather than just responding to today's problems."<br>
      <br>
      The Brian Mercer Awards for Innovation were established by the
      Royal Society in 2001 following a bequest from the late Dr Brian
      Mercer, an enthusiastic inventor and entrepreneur. The awards aim
      to encourage these qualities in the next generation of scientists
      and provide a grant of £250,000 to develop an already proven
      concept or prototype into a near-market product.<br>

      for cleaning a surface, the apparatus comprising a body defining a
      chamber, an inlet for liquid flow into the chamber, an outlet for
      liquid flow from the chamber, a nozzle connected to the outlet for
      generating an output flow of liquid for cleaning a surface, an

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a cleaning apparatus and to a
      cleaning method, and to a method of monitoring cleaning.<br>
      <br>
      Cleaning is an essential part of many research, commercial and
      public service processes, three obvious examples being
      manufacturing, healthcare, and laboratory work. Cleaning is often
      not simple: the object to be cleaned may be complicated, with many
      inaccessible crevices or chambers, and the potential contaminant
      very hazardous (a good example being the biopsy endoscope). The
      object to be cleaned may also be delicate (a good example of this
      being salad and vegetable matter, microchips, flesh, forensic
      material etc.) or tolerate minimal levels of scratching and damage
      (such as optical lenses, jewelry, prestige watch glasses and faces
      or prestige car finishes). Often the time available for cleaning
      is limited, as there is an imperative to move the object along to
      the next stage of processing or usage after it is cleaned (either
      because the number of units available for use is limited - as with
      the endoscope -, or because retardation of through-put cuts
      profile - as in the salad example).<br>
      <br>
      Cleaning uses up huge amounts of water, even for 'natural'
      products: the production of 1 tonne of wool currently requires use
      of around 500 tonnes of water. When one considers the biohazardous
      waste of a hospital or abattoir, or the cleaning associated with
      chemical and nuclear plants, water conservation becomes a very
      major concern. The requirement for thorough cleaning is often in
      conflict with the requirements not to damage the target to be
      cleaned, not to use excessive water, not to contaminate the
      environment with chemical run-off, and not to use excessive energy
      or manpower or time.<br>
      <br>
      Ultrasonic cleaning has been known in the art for many years, by
      the use of 'ultrasonic cleaning baths', whereby inertial
      cavitation and the generation of high speed liquid jets through
      bubble involution causes the removal of surface contaminants. The
      exploitation of cavitation in ultrasonic cleaning baths has for
      decades provided ultrasonic cleaning facilities that are suitable
      for those applications which have had robust objects to be cleaned
      (i.e. where cavitation erosion damage is not an issue), and where
      the size of the object to be cleaned is small enough to be
      immersed, and where the cleaning lacks the urgency which would
      necessitate a portable decontamination unit to supply on-the-spot
      cleaning resulting from, say, accidental contamination. In many
      instances of such cleaning, samples are either cleaned prior to
      further processing or dispersed within a suitable media as part of
      a larger methodology. Cleaning or processing is then facilitated
      by the employment of an ultrasonic bath. This invariably involves
      the immersion of a suitable container within the bath.<br>
      <br>
      The cleaning action is often attributed to the generation of
      violent cavitation within the vessel itself and the interaction of
      these phenomena with the walls of the object in question. Cleaning
      action is attributed to cavitation events where the inertia of the
      liquid has had a dominant effect on the bubble dynamics, e.g. when
      a high-speed liquid jet passes through the bubble as a result of
      involution of the bubble wall and generates a blast wave on impact
      with liquid or solid; when bubbles collapse with almost spherical
      symmetry in 'transient' or 'inertiaP cavitation events, generating
      shock waves in the liquid and highly reactive chemical species
      such as free radicals; and when clouds of bubbles collapse in a
      concerted manner to magnify these effects to become greater than
      would be expected without the cloud effect. Hence the exact
      mechanism is often associated with 'transient cavitation' or more
      precisely inertial cavitation where the violent collapse phase
      results in the local generation of these extreme conditions.<br>
      <br>
      However, such ultrasonic cleaning systems may suffer from one or
      more problems of surface damage, poor cleaning, particularly of
      three dimensional surfaces, e.g. crevices, and an inability to
      clean larger objects or surfaces. Furthermore the insertion of the
      object to be cleaned into an ultrasonic cleaning bath may disturb
      the sound field in a manner which degrades its ability to cause
      cleaning.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention aims at least partially to overcome these
      problems of known surface cleaning processes, particularly
      ultrasonic cleaning.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides an apparatus for cleaning a
      surface, the apparatus comprising a body defining a chamber, an
      inlet for liquid flow into the chamber, an outlet for liquid flow
      from the chamber, a nozzle connected to the outlet for generating
      an output flow of liquid for cleaning a surface, an acoustic
      transducer associated with the body to introduce acoustic energy
      into the liquid within the chamber whereby the acoustic energy is
      present in the liquid flowing out of the nozzle, and a gas bubble
      generator for generating gas bubbles within the liquid flowing out
      of the nozzle.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the bubble generator comprises electrodes which are
      adapted to generate gas bubbles electrolytically within the
      liquid. Typically, the electrode comprises an array of
      electrically conductive wires extending across a direction of
      liquid flow.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, the gas bubble generator is located within the nozzle.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus may further comprise a first controller for the gas
      bubble generator which is adapted to control the gas bubble
      generator to generate pulses of gas bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus may further comprise a second controller for the
      acoustic transducer which is adapted to control the acoustic
      transducer to generate pulses of acoustic energy. Preferably, the
      second controller is adapted to switch the acoustic transducer on
      and off intermittently to produce pulses of acoustic energy. The
      apparatus may further comprise a modulator to provide an amplitude
      or frequency modulation of the pulses of acoustic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the first and second controllers are coordinated so
      that gas bubbles and pulses of acoustic energy are generated with
      a mutually controlled time relationship.<br>
      <br>
      This coordination ensures that sound and bubbles can occur at the
      same time at a surface location to be cleaned. Their relative
      on/off timings at the nozzle can be varied to achieve this
      occurrence by taking into account the different travel times of
      sound and bubbles down the liquid, which may be a stream, and this
      depends on the length of liquid between the nozzle and the surface
      to be cleaned. The sound travels through the liquid at a velocity
      of over 1 km/second whereas the bubble velocity is related to the
      flow rate of the liquid. Once the sound is on, it can then also be
      amplitude or frequency modulated. Accordingly, in accordance with
      this particular preferred implemenation, it is possible to
      coordinate in timing of the two effects: the sound field is turned
      off entirely while the bubble swarm is generated and transferred
      to the surface. Once the swarm has reached the surface the sound
      field is activated. This sound field can be continuous or
      amplitude or frequency modulated.<br>
      <br>
      The sound field is off whilst the bubbles travel down the stream
      in order to prevent colaescene of bubbles whilst they travel. This
      is the simplest implemenation to control the sound. However, for
      some applications (e.g. with small volumes of water and the
      correct higher levels of surfactant) it may not be necessary to
      turn the sound field off entirely whilst the bubbles travel down
      the stream, and other implemetations may be used, e.g. switching
      the sound to much higher frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the body includes a rear wall on which the acoustic
      transducer is mounted and a substantially conical element
      extending forwardly therefrom to form a relatively small radius
      end thereof communicating with the outlet, the rear wall and the
      substantially conical element defining a substantially conical
      chamber of decreasing radius extending from the transducer towards
      the outlet. The substantially conical element may be geometrically
      conical, or alternatively may have a non-geometric shape, such as
      being horn-shaped or bell shaped. The substantially conical
      element may be formed, for example, of cellular foam or rubber.
      Other materials may be employed. The choice of material is
      determined by the requirement to match (as closely as practicable)
      the acoustic wall boundary conditions within the cone to those in
      the nozzle and liquid stream once it leaves the nozzle, so as to
      avoid sharp impedance mismatches between cone, nozzle and liquid
      stream that would hinder the passage of acoustic energy along the
      stream.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, a design principle employed by the chamber and nozzle
      used in the preferred embodiments of the present invention is that
      the acoustic boundary condition on the inner wall of the chamber
      and nozzle should match the acoustic boundary condition that will
      occur in the stream of liquid once it leaves the nozzle. The
      embodiments disclosed herein produce a stream of liquid in free
      air, and hence the inner wall of the chamber needs to be
      pressure-release, and so a pressure-release material such as
      cellular foam or rubber has been used to provide such a
      pressure-release boundary. If, however, in accordance with an
      alternative embodiment of the present invention a cleaning jet of
      liquid (e.g. water) was not directed into air but instead squirted
      into another article to be cleaned, for example up a pipe, e.g.
      for cleaning an endoscope of narrow internal diameter, that
      embodiment would use a chamber with an internal wall condition
      matched to the respective acoustic boundary condition of the
      article, and a pressure-release characteristic may not be
      required.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus may further comprise an inlet manifold which
      comprises a plurality of inlet passages each connected at an inlet
      end to the inlet and at an outlet end to the body and/or an
      acoustic isolation device in the inlet.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus may also include a device for adding surfactant to
      the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention further provides a method of cleaning a
      surface, the method comprising the step of: directing towards the
      surface a liquid flow from a nozzle, the liquid flow including
      acoustic energy and entrained gas bubbles within the liquid
      flowing out of the nozzle.<br>
      <br>
      The surface may be an external surface or an internal surface, for
      example of a cavity. The liquid flow may be directed against the
      surface or into the vicinity of the surface, for example by
      squirting the liquid up the inside of a tube (e.g. an endoscope)
      or pipe, such as a drinks dispenser nozzle.<br>
      <br>
      The method may further comprise the step of generating gas bubbles
      electrolytically within the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the gas bubbles are generated within or at a distance
      from a free end of the nozzle. For example, it was found that if
      the gas bubble generator, e.g. electrolytic wires generating the
      gas bubbles, was positioned a small distance, such as about 1 cm,
      from the nozzle tip, the stability of the fluid stream was
      increased.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the gas bubbles are generated intermittently.<br>
      <br>
      The method may further comprise the step of generating pulses of
      the acoustic energy. Furthermore, the acoustic energy within the
      pulses may be frequency or amplitude modulated.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the liquid flow impacts the surface with waves of
      bubbles and pulses of acoustic energy which substantially
      simultaneously reach the surface.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the acoustic energy is introduced into the liquid by
      an acoustic transducer as the liquid flows through a substantially
      conical chamber of decreasing radius extending from the transducer
      towards the nozzle.<br>
      <br>
      Such a conical chamber is not essential, and other chamber shapes,
      for example of constant cross-section, formed by a body such as a
      cylindrical pipe, may be used in certain applications.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, a liquid input flow into the chamber is divided into a
      plurality of parallel flows by an inlet manifold which comprises a
      plurality of inlet passages each connected at an inlet end to the
      inlet and at an outlet end to the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      The method may further comprise acoustically isolating an inlet
      conduit of the chamber from the acoustic transducer.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention further provides a method of cleaning a
      surface, the method comprising the step of providing gas bubbles
      at the surface and employing modulated acoustic energy to generate
      surface waves in the bubbles to cause non-inertial collapse of the
      bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the bubbles and acoustic energy are in a liquid flow
      directed towards the surface.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, the surface includes at least one cavity, recess or
      pore and the bubbles are dimensioned to be able to enter at least
      one cavity, recess or pore. Preferably, the acoustic energy
      excites the surface of the bubbles when the bubbles are located in
      the at least one cavity, recess or pore.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the bubbles and acoustic energy are directed to the
      surface as pulses so that the pulses of bubbles and acoustic
      energy are incident on the surface substantially simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is at least partly predicated on the finding
      by the present inventors that when ultrasonic cleaning is carried
      out, it is not necessary for cleaning that inertial cavitation is
      generated. The preferred embodiments of the present invention
      provide a cleaning apparatus adapted to achieve surface cleaning
      (decontamination) by the employment of bubble action on a surface
      (or within a crevice within a surface) driven by acoustic
      stimulation. This avoids inertial collapse at the interface and
      hence the associated parasitic erosion mechanisms of known
      ultrasonic cleaning systems and methods. However, it is possible
      optionally to generate inertial cavitation in accordance with some
      embodiments of the present invention if the surface to be cleaned
      is sufficiently robust.<br>
      <br>
      Without being bound by theory, it is believed that in accordance
      with the preferred aspects of the present invention, the motion of
      the bubble process is dominated by the pressure within the gas
      phase which results in non-inertial cavitation, rather than the
      converging inertia of the liquid which results in inertial
      collapse. The cleaning can be further enhanced by the
      establishment of surface waves on the bubble wall (also sometimes
      referred to as bubble shape oscillations). Therefore the apparatus
      and method of the present invention are preferably adapted to
      produce bubbles remote from, but close to, the solid/liquid
      interface of the object to be cleaned and then to drive them
      against that surface with an appropriate sound wave sufficient to
      produce non-inertial collapse and, if applicable, surface waves on
      the bubble wall.<br>
      <br>
      However, as described above, for some particularly robust surfaces
      inertial collapse may additionally be achieved at the surface
      which may provide enhanced cleaning without excessive damage to
      the surface. A further feature of the preferred embodiments of the
      present invention is to deliver such cleaning ability, using
      non-inertial cavitation, through a liquid stream or hosepipe/tap
      output, which avoids the need for immersion, and so makes the
      apparatus portable. This may be achieved by a suitable adaptation
      of exisiting cleaning systems which currently use hosepipes or
      taps to deliver a flow of cleaning fluid. Such an apparatus of the
      preferred embodiments of the present invention system may also
      conserve water and/or power compared to a known immersion system.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred embodiments of the present invention can provide
      apparatus and methods which employ a novel application of the
      excitation of gas bubbles within liquids with the ultimate aim of
      surface decontamination. Substantially any surface may be cleaned
      in accordance with the invention, ranging from internal or
      external surfaces, hard or soft surfaces, inorganic objects (e.g.
      an endoscope), organic or living bodies, including foodstuffs,
      (e.g. wrinkles on a lettuce), the human skin (e.g. under the
      fingernails of a surgeon), using portable or fixed hoses and taps
      (e.g. for forensic, autopsy, archaeological examinations). The
      surface for decontamination might include buildings, facilities,
      infrastructure (e.g. abattoirs, hospital wards, surgeries), and
      associated objects contained within those (personnel, keyboards,
      telephones etc.), or used outside. In particular, those apparatus
      and methods employ targeted excitation of bubbles at the surface
      of an interface or within a pore, cavity, recess, crevice, pipe,
      tube or chamber. These bubbles have been shown to do useful work
      including the cleaning the surface, pore, cavity, recess or
      crevice within the surface, or cleaning in a pipe, tube or
      chamber. As such this represents a new and powerful method to
      clean a wide variety of surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, the present invention is at least partly based on
      the findings by the present inventors that surface cleaning may be
      achieved through the generation of bubble oscillation (including
      surface waves) driven by appropriate acoustic excitation. Also,
      crevice cleaning may be achieved through bubble capture into pores
      and other surface features, including, but not restricted to,
      capture through processes of flow, hydrodynamic effects, or
      acoustic radiation forces. These bubbles oscillate and remove
      material from the crevice. The acoustic excitation of these events
      may be achieved along a flowing stream of liquid. Bubble
      population effects may be harnessed to allow transmission of sound
      down through the liquid to the surface to be cleaned. The flow
      apparatus, geometry, materials and acoustic characteristics of the
      bubble population may allow efficient acoustic transfer to the
      surface to be cleaned. Relatively low flow rates may be deployed,
      minimising cleaning solution wastage.<br>
      <br>
      As an additional preferred mechanism to generate bubbles,
      electrochemical bubble seeding technology has been developed and
      exploited. Pulsed bubble generation (creating a bubble swarm) in
      tandem with pulsed acoustic excitation may generate 'active'
      bubbles on the surface to be cleaned. An amplitude or frequency
      modulated sound field, coupled with the acoustic energy optionally
      being switched on and off, may be employed to maximise the
      acoustic pressure delivered by the apparatus to the interface in
      the presence of a suitable bubble swarm. Pulsed bubble generation
      and pulsed acoustic excitation may be independently controlled so
      that at the nozzle bubble generation is independent of the
      generation of a pulse of the acoustic excitation, and such
      independent control can vary the bubble pulses and the acoustic
      energy pulses independently so that at the surface to be cleaned
      the bubbles and the acoustic energy pulse can be incident on, or
      in the vicinity of, the surface substantially simultaneously to
      enable efficient cleaning of the substrate by the acoustic energy
      causing non-inertial cavitation of the bubbles at or in the
      vicinity of the surface.<br>
      <br>
      Such pulsing of the acoustic energy does not need necessarily to
      turn the sound field off between pulses, but instead may modulate
      the acoustic energy, by amplitude or frequency modulation, it to
      provide high energy acoustic pulses separated by low energy
      background.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the sound is turned off as the bubble swarm
      travels down the stream (to prevent acoustically-induced bubble
      coalescence), and then the sound is turned on to provide a
      modulated acoustic energy pulse once the bubble swarm reaches the
      surface to be cleaned. Once these bubbles have undertaken some
      cleaning and started to disperse in the flow, the sound is turned
      off and another swarm of bubbles is generated at the nozzle and
      the process is repeated. The independent control can be achieved
      by taking into account the fact that sound travels down the liquid
      stream at a different speed to the bubbles. The timing of the
      current supplies used to generate bubbles and sound is such as to
      ensure both bubble swarm and ultrasound arrive at the surface at
      the same time. Given this criterion, the different transit times
      of bubbles and sound down the tube dictate the timing for the
      activation of the currents which generate sound and bubbles, such
      that their activations may be staggered if the timing so dictates.
      The underlying technical concept is to utilise their different
      transit times down the liquid stream to ensure that the bubbles
      and acoustic energy occur at the same time at the surface which is
      to be cleaned.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, novel electrochemical techniques may be used to
      monitor the degree of in situ cleaning as a result of fluid flow
      and bubble action on the surface. The invention may also include
      apparatus for monitoring the efficacy of the cleaning through the
      use of sensors close to the location where the surface to be
      cleaned is to be placed, or embedded in that surface.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the cleaning apparatus may further comprise a device
      for monitoring the cleaning of the surface, the device comprising
      first and second electrodes, forming an electrochemical cell,
      adapted to be respectively located at a portion of the surface and
      interconnected by a resistance measuring apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention further provides a method of monitoring the
      cleaning of a surface, the apparatus comprising locating first and
      second electrodes, forming an electrochemical cell, at
      respectively portions of a surface to be cleaned and measuring the
      resistance therebetween.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, the first electrode is located in a cavity, recess or
      pore to be cleaned and the second electrode is located on an
      external portion of the surface.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the method comprises determining a decrease in the
      resistance to indicate cleaning of the cavity, recess or pore. For
      the apparatus of the preferred embodiments of the present
      invention, the nozzle material and shape, and the driving acoustic
      frequency, may be chosen such that at least one mode is not
      evanescent in the liquid stream. The nozzle may be designed to
      prevent a strong impedance mismatch between the sound field in the
      conical body and the sound field in the liquid stream. For some
      applications (for example if the liquid stream is surrounded by
      gas once it leaves the nozzle) a specific (but not exclusive)
      preferred manifestation of this is in use of materials which are
      exactly (or nearly) pressure-release in the construction of the
      nozzle and/or conical body. The flow rate and nozzle design may be
      chosen so that the liquid stream does not lose integrity before it
      reaches the target surface to be cleaned (e.g. break up into
      drops, entrain unwanted bubbles, etc.) to the extent that it
      hinders the transmission of sound from the nozzle to the target.
      The shape of the conical body may be designed to assist the
      transmission of sound from the cone to the liquid stream and
      subsequently through the nozzle. An amplitude or frequency
      modulated sound field may dramatically improve pressure
      transmission within the fluid flowing through the apparatus to the
      target substrate.<br>

      <br>
      Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a cleaning apparatus in
      accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The cleaning apparatus, designated generally as 2, comprises a
      hollow body 4 defining a central chamber 6. The body 4 has a rear
      wall 8 and a substantially conical element 10 extending forwardly
      away therefrom which terminates in a forwardly-located orifice 12.
      Typically, both the element 10 and the wall 8 are rotationally
      symmetric, i.e. circular, although other geometric shapes may be
      employed. In this specification the term substantially conical"
      should be interpreted broadly to encompass structures which are
      not only geometrically conical, but also structures which for
      example are bell-like, having a concave inner wall as seen from
      inside, as shown in Figure 1, or have a constant half-angle as
      shown in Figure 2, or are horn-like as shown in Figure 4 (i.e. has
      a convex inner wall as seen from the inside). Accordingly, the
      element 10 forms a conical body such as a bell- or horn-like
      structure, and for brevity may be referred to hereinafter simply
      as a ,,horn".<br>
      <br>
      A nozzle 14 extends forwardly from the orifice 12 and defines a
      liquid outlet 16. A liquid inlet 18 is located at or adjacent to
      the rear wall 8. A liquid supply conduit 20, typically in the form
      of a flexible hose, communicates with the inlet 18. An acoustic
      transducer 22 is mounted on the rear wall 8. A controller 23
      controls the operation of the transducer 22. Typically, the
      transducer 22 is mounted on an outer surface of the wall 8 and
      extends over a substantial proportion of the surface area of the
      wall 8. Alternatively, the transducer may be embedded into the
      chamber on or through the rear wall. Indeed to achieve a
      pressure-release condition in the chamber walls (e.g. the stream
      was to be squirted into a cavity, such as into the internal bore
      of an endoscope) then the appratus may employ either a rear-wall
      transducer or alternatively make the inner surface of the horn
      comprise a transducer. It should be noted that the transducer
      could be mounted elsewhere such as on the walls of the horn or the
      nozzle, providing that it was not required, for the particular
      application, to match to a pressure-release boundary condition
      once the stream has left the nozzle (e.g. if the stream was being
      used to clean the inside of an endoscope).<br>
      <br>
      In use, liquid flows continuously through the supply conduit 20
      into the central chamber 6 and then outwardly through the outlet
      16 of the nozzle 14 to form a stream 24 of liquid which is
      directed against the surface 26 of a substrate 28 to be cleaned.
      The surface 26 may, in particular, be provided with three
      dimensional surface features, such as a crevice 30 shown in an
      exaggerated form in Figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      A bubble generator 32 is located within the nozzle 14 upstream, in
      the direction of fluid flow, from the outlet 16. The bubble
      generator 32 generates gas bubbles within the liquid stream so
      that the liquid stream impacting on the substrate surface 26
      includes not only acoustic energy from the transducer 22 but also
      gas bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      There are several options for seeding gas bubbles into the liquid
      flow, including gas injection and in situ electrochemical gas
      bubble generation by electrochemical decomposition of water in the
      liquid. For in situ electrochemical gas bubble generation, the
      incorporation of electrodes into the structure allows controlled
      seeding, and is preferably achieved by threading 50-100 [mu]m
      diameter Pt wires through the nozzle of the jet (~ 1 cm before the
      exit). Other options including use of one or more electrodes in
      the liquid flow, or in the wall of the nozzle.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Figure 2, in this modified embodiment, the rear wall
      40 consists of a plate, for example of plastic or a metal such as
      aluminium or stainless steel, having the liquid inlet 42 therein
      and the acoustic transducer 44, which may itself incorporate a
      truncated cone 46 is bonded or otherwise held on to the rear
      surface of the plate 40. The substantially conical element 48,
      comprising a horn, extends forwardly of the plate 40 and forms an
      integral nozzle 50 at which the bubble generator 52 is located.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment of Figure 1 the hollow body 4 may be made
      integral and made of a single material, with the rear wall 8 being
      integral with the horn 10. In this embodiment, the horn is
      composed of material that can function as a pressure release
      interface when fluid is directed thereagainst, so that acoustic
      energy in the material of the horn is effectively and efficiently
      transmitted into the flowing liquid at the inner surface of the
      horn. The aim of the apparatus of this embodiment is to introduce
      acoustic energy into the flowing fluid stream and then to direct
      that stream through the outlet onto the surface to be treated by
      using the conical shape of the horn to concentrate both the
      acoustic energy and the fluid flow while minimising acoustic
      losses or frictional loses against the conical surface.<br>
      <br>
      The embodiment discussed above is directed to the specific
      application of introducing sound energy into the liquid stream
      when the liquid is surrounded by air after leaving the nozzle.
      That is applicable, for example, for cleaning under a surgeon's
      fingernails or cleaning a letttuce. However for other applications
      in which the liquid stream is directed into the article to be
      cleaned (such as cleaning up an endoscope) the liquid stream on
      leaving the nozzle may not have a pressure-release boundary
      condition, and for that embodiment a horn made of different,
      non-pressure release, material may be employed.<br>
      <br>
      The nozzle and the outlet are shaped and dimensioned to allow for
      acoustic transmission along the fluid stream. It is advantageous
      to form a smooth flow of the stream. It is well within the
      abilities of a person skilled in the art to produce a suitable
      combination of shape and dimensions for the horn, the outlet and
      the inlet to achieve the desired smooth flow of liquid containing
      acoustic energy from the transducer.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, novel electrochemical techniques may be used
      to monitor the degree of in situ cleaning as a result of fluid
      flow and bubble action on the surface.<br>
      <br>
      In this embodiment, the cleaning apparatus further comprises a
      device for monitoring the cleaning of the surface, the device
      comprising first and second electrodes 200, 202, forming an
      electrochemical cell, adapted to be respectively located at a
      portion of the surface and interconnected by a resistance
      measuring apparatus 204. In the method of monitoring the cleaning
      of the surface, the first electrode 200 is located on an external
      portion of the surface and the second electrode 202 is located in
      a cavity or recess to be cleaned. The resistance therebetween is
      measured using the resistance measuring apparatus 204 to determine
      a decrease in the resistance to indicate cleaning of the cavity or
      recess. As show in Figure 9, an initial resistance value A changes
      according to value B by decreasing significantly when the
      monitored surface portion has been cleaned.<br>
      <br>
      In this aspect of the invention, electrochemical cleaning
      measurements under the tip of the ultrasonic horn, using either
      flat, recessed or cannular electrodes, made use of an
      electrochemical cell consisting of two or more electrodes. The
      cleaning liquid acted as an electrolyte. The resistance of the
      fouled working electrode was monitored such that when the cavity
      or recess was unclean, the working electrode would have no or only
      poor electrical contact with the liquid electrolyte and so a
      relatively high resistance would exist between the two electrodes,
      whereas when the cavity or recess was cleaned and therefore the
      working electrode came into contact with the solution, a at low
      resistance would be measured. This provides a very effective
      method for quantifiably measuring the cleaning time. This method
      relies on the measurement of the uncompensated resistance of the
      system.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, if the uncompensated resistance of the system can be
      monitored as a function of time, it is possible to use this method
      to detect the cleaning of the cavity, recess or pore. This method
      is able to give quantifiable data on the cleaning of the cavity,
      recess or pore. In order to remove the effect of capacitance of
      the electrode a low amplitude high frequency (100 kHz, 200 mV zero
      to peak amplitude) alternating voltage signal was applied between
      the working electrode (for example a 0.5 mm diameter Pt recessed
      electrode) and reference electrode (normally a large piece of
      metallic material, for example a Cu plate). The current passed can
      then be used directly to determine the resistance of the system as
      a function of time. Using this system the only chemical required
      is a supporting electrolyte to make the solution conducting such
      as potassium chloride (KCl) or common salt (NaCl) both of which
      are relatively cheap and easy to dispose of. This method is used
      to monitor the cleaning of a surface with a variety of features
      designed to investigate the efficiency of targeted ultrasonic
      cleaning.<br>
      <br>
      If the monitoring component is not needed for a particular
      application when carrying out the cleaning method of the
      invention, and only cleaning is required, then an electrolyte such
      as KCl or NaCl or equivalent is not necessary within the cleaning
      liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Figure 3, in an alternative embodiment, the inlet
      conduit 60, in the form of a hose, is connected to a manifold 62
      which divides the inlet liquid flow into a plurality of different
      inlet flow passages each in a respective secondary inlet conduit
      64, each secondary inlet conduit 64 connecting the inlet conduit
      60 to a respective inlet 66 on the rear wall 68 conected to the
      horn 70. The assembly of the rear wall 68 and the horn 70, and the
      manifold 62, may be connected together within a common housing 72.
      The horn 70 is connected to an outlet 74.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Figure 4, an alternative shape for the horn 80 is
      disclosed, in which the horn 80 has a cylindrical downstream
      portion 82 and a hyperboloidal (or some other horn- shape, such as
      parabolic, catenoidal, etc.) outwardly flaring upstream portion
      84.<br>
      <br>
      It may be seen from all of Figures 1 to 4 that various different
      shapes of configurations for the horn may be employed, provided
      that the horn is shaped to provide a constant fluid flow outlet
      minimising both loss of acoustic energy and frictional losses.
      This would provide optimal acoustic and flow properties in the
      stream of fluid which impacts the surface to be cleaned.
      Furthermore, such a horn-shaped structure is not essential for
      some applications and the chamber may have any other shape, and be
      defined by any material of the body, that permits acoustic energy
      to be introduced into the fluid flow and exit from a nozzle.<br>
      <br>
      If the liquid stream is to flow through gas on leaving the nozzle,
      and therefore the inner walls of the horn need to be
      pressure-release, then a particularly preferred material for the
      horn is a cellular foam material or a rubber which can avoid an
      impedance mismatch between the sound field in the horn and the
      sound field in the liquid stream flowing therethrough. The flow
      rate and nozzle design are selected so that the liquid stream does
      not lose integrity before it reaches the surface to be cleaned.
      The shape of the horn is designed to assist the transmission of
      sound from the horn to the liquid stream flowing through the
      nozzle. For example, when the horn is a cellular foam material the
      horn is formed by moulding a conical cavity within a solid foam
      block (although other manufacturing processes, such as cutting
      from a block, may be used).<br>
      <br>
      Most typically, the horn and nozzle are rotationally symmetric.<br>
      <br>
      In any of the embodiments, the inlet may be provided with an
      acoustic isolation device which prevents acoustic energy being
      transmitted back along the liquid supply conduit 20. The acoustic
      isolation device, shown schematically as 25 in Figure 1, may
      comprise an acoustic filter, optionally having a selected
      frequency range, and/or a venturi narrowing in the conduit 20,
      and/or an expansion chamber, and/or by control of the diameter of
      the conduit to provide that the driving frequency is below the
      cut-off frequency of all modes for the inlet (as would happen for
      sufficiently small-bore manifold inlets made of pressure-release
      material).<br>
      <br>
      In these embodiments, the apparatus size can be varied to provide
      varying volumes of the liquid stream. Smaller or larger volumes
      can be achieved by scaling the flow rate, nozzle size and the
      driving acoustic frequency, in line with the provision that at
      least one mode is not evanescent in the liquid stream, thereby to
      provide a cleaning solution stream impacted onto the surface
      accompanied by a suitable sound field and active bubbles. This
      mode may be the plane wave mode if the acoustic boundary
      conditions at the wall allow. In order to achieve the required
      volumetric flow rate, as well as enabling the flow to project to a
      sufficient distance beyond the free end of the nozzle, a small
      outlet aperture is required. Except for the plane wave mode (if
      the acoustic boundary conditions permit it to propagate, which is
      not the case if the liquid stream flows through air), then for
      each mode the sound transmission down the liquid jet will be
      undesirably restricted below a characteristic "cut-off frequency
      (Fco). If the stream were to be passed into a solid tube, such
      that solid wall would surround the stream, then the lowest
      frequency mode would be plane wave and there would be no cut-off
      frequency for that mode, although higher order modes would have
      their own cut-off frequencies. In the particular case where the
      liquid stream flows through a gas space on leaving the nozzle,
      then the boundary condition at the curved walls of the stream
      would be pressure-release, and for such a condition the cut-off
      frequency (Fco) for the lowest mode is calculated according to the
      equation<br>
      Fco = 2.4048c (Equation 1)<br>
      <br>
      2[pi]a where c represents the velocity of sound in the fluid and a
      represents the liquid stream radius. For example, for a flow
      outlet of around 10 mm internal diameter, and assuming a speed of
      sound in the liquid of 1500 m/sec, the cut-off frequency of the
      liquid stream for the lowest mode would be on the order of 114 kHz
      (modes of higher order would have higher cut-off frequencies).
      However, fluid properties and any entrapment of bubbles, as
      discussed hereinafter, would affect this cut-off frequency.
      Bubbles, for example, may reduce the sound speed in the liquid,
      and hence reduce the cut-off frequency of the mode.<br>
      <br>
      The bubble generator 32 is adapted to generate gas bubbles which
      are then acoustically excited and impact on the surface to be
      cleaned. The bubbles are driven into oscillation by the acoustic
      energy and can get into crevices and pores on the substrate to be
      cleaned, so that they effectively clean the substrate surface.<br>
      <br>
      The bubble generator 32 may act directly to inject gaseous bubbles
      into the fluid flow, for example through a needle, the needle
      optionally vibrating. Other options for bubble generation include
      through use of cavitation (hydrodynamic or acoustic) or
      free-surface bubble entrainment, or chemical gas production, or by
      a more preferred route of electrochemical in situ generation of
      gas bubbles by electolytic decomposition of the water in the
      liquid flow. The bubble generator 32 adapted for electrochemical
      bubble generation comprises an electrode comprising an array of
      electrically conductive wires, for example platinum wise having a
      diameter of 50 [mu]m, extending across the outlet. The electrode
      is connected to a source of electrical energy (not shown) and,
      when electrically powered, the electrical energy electrolytically
      decomposes water in the fluid flow to generate streams of bubbles
      of both oxygen and hydrogen gas which are entrained in the flowing
      fluid and directed towards the target surface to be cleaned.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 5 shows a sequence of steps in a cleaning cycle for a
      respective bubble swarm.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Figure 5 (a), the bubble generator is controlled by a
      controller 98 so that bubbles are formed intermittently to form
      intermittent swarms 100 (or waves) of bubbles which successively
      impact against the surface 102 to be cleaned. When the bubbles
      impact the surface 102 to be cleaned, the bubbles are driven to
      oscillate by the acoustic energy, thereby penetrating crevices
      which are cleaned by the acoustic energy.<br>
      <br>
      As also shown in Figure 5, the amplitude or frequency modulated
      acoustic energy from the transducer is pulsed intermittently. This
      produces pulses of acoustic energy, which interact with the
      intermittent bubble swarms 100 described above, in a concerted
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 5(b) shows that when the acoutic transducer is switched
      off, the bubble swarm 100 travels downstream together with the
      liquid flow directed towards the surface 102. The bubble swarm 100
      reaches the surface 102, as shown in Figure 5(c). Figure 5(d)
      shows that as the bubble swarm 100 reaches the surface 102, the
      acoustic transducer is switched on, to generate a sound field
      pulse, optionally amlitude or frequency modulated, which is
      transmitted towards the surface 102 at the speed of sound through
      the liquid. The acoustic energy of the pulse activates the bubbles
      of the swarm at the surface 102 to effect enhanced cleaning, by
      non-inertial collapse of the bubbles at the surface, and
      optionally generating surface waves in the bubbles, and/or
      optionally causing higher energy cleaning events (e.g. inertial
      collapse of bubbles, jetting etc.). This completes a cleaning
      cycle for a single bubble swarm. A next cleaning cycle for a
      subsequent bubble swarm is then initiated by generation of the
      subsequent bubble swarm as shown in Figure 5 (a).<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Figure 6, at the nozzle there is a particular phase
      relationship between the generation of the sound pulse and the
      generation of the pulse of bubbles. The phase relationship changes
      as the sound and bubbles are transmitted away from the nozzle
      through the liquid since the acoustic energy and the bubbles are
      transmited at different velocities through the liquid towards the
      surface to be cleaned. The aim is to provide a phase relationship,
      which typically involves a delay time td betwen bubble generation
      and generation of the pulse of the acoustic energy, so that the
      acoustic energy and the bubbles reach the surface to be cleaned in
      phase and at the same time. In the example illustrated, a delay
      time td is provided which would vary with flow rate and distance
      to the target.<br>
      <br>
      In this embodiment the sound is turned off during bubble
      generation and bubble transfer to the surface to be cleaned. The
      excitation of these bubbles is intermittent, and in synchronism
      with the intermittent on/off nature of the electrochemical bubble
      generation. In the embodiment of Figure 6, the bubbles may be
      generated for a generation period, typically 10 milliseconds, with
      a periodicity of 100 milliseconds. After the termination of each
      bubble generation, there is a delay, typically 30 milliseconds,
      after which the sound is turned on (or, in other embodiments,
      modulated to provide a high energy pulse) for a period of 60
      milliseconds. The sound is then turned off and simultaneously the
      bubbles are turned on, in a subsequent cleaning cycle.<br>
      <br>
      These values apply to one particular device, but would be longer
      or shorter if the device was larger or smaller in size
      respectively. This delay is flow rate and distance dependant. It
      can be variable and, for example, if a long pipe (endoscope) is
      the cleaning target, the delay can be varied to achieve cleaning
      at different positions along the liquid flow direction.<br>
      <br>
      Within each acoustic energy pulse, the acoustic energy is
      amplitude or frequency modulated, as also shown in Figure 6
      (amplitude modulation being exemplified by varying the driving
      voltage of the transducer). The modulation period, which is
      frequency dependent, is typically 1 millisecond.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Figure 7, the pulsed generation of such bubble swarms
      causes modulated pressure to be applied to the cleaned surface by
      each bubble swarm when the respective bubble swarm impacts the
      surface to be cleaned. Such modulated presssure typically occurs
      every 100 milliseconds. As explained earlier, each bubble swarm is
      oscillated by the acoustic energy which produces a cleaning
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 8 shows pressure at a hydrophone for a constant drive
      acoustic field, either in continuous mode or modulated mode. As
      shown by Figure 8, when a constant acoustic energy impacts on the
      surface, the pressure generated at the surface is relatively low
      and constant, whereas when modulated waves of acoustic energy
      impact the surface, the maximum energy released at the surface by
      each wave is significantly greater.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore by employing pulsed bubble generation and pulsed
      generation of acoustic energy in a coordinated manner, bubbles are
      excited at the surface so that bubbles are present at the surface
      when the acoutic energy is also at the surface, and furthermore
      the cleaning impact achieved by both the bubbles and the acoustic
      energy is increased by additionally providing that the acoustic
      energy is amplitude or frequency modulated at a higher frequency
      that the pulses, greatly improving cleaning efficacy. The presence
      of a bubble swarm formed between a pair of acoustic energy pulses
      separates those acoustic energy pulses. Each bubble swarm is
      independently impacted on the surface to be treated and
      independently excited by the acoustic energy of the succeeding
      acoustic energy pulse.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with a further aspect of the apparatus and method of
      the present invention, it has been found that the addition of a
      surfactant to the liquid can afffect the bubble size achievable
      without bubble coalescence. Sufficient surfactant may be added, if
      necessary, to prevent coalescence of bubbles as they flow down the
      stream if, without surfactant, such coleascence produces bubbles
      too large for approprite cleaning; but not so much surfactant that
      the bubbles are too small for cleaning when they reach the site.
      The following Table 1 shows how the bubble size (estimated from
      high-speed camera experiments) is affected by the surfactant
      loading, and how the activity, defined as erratic bubble motion
      across a surface, which is indicative of bubble oscillation by
      acoustic energy, varies with bubble diameter.<br>
      <br>

    The range of total surfactant volume of from 150 to 750 [mu]l to
    give a surfactant concentration of from 0.003 to 0.015 % by volume
    resulting in a bubbble diameter of from about 40 to 45 [mu]m
    provided the conditions where highest cleaning activity was
    observed. The particular total surfactant and surfactant
    concentration values to achieve the desired bubble activity may be
    dependant on the type of surfactant employed.<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <br>
      Without being bound by any theory, nevertheless the present
      inventors have found that a number of phenomena are relevant to
      achieving effective ultrasonic cleaning.<br>
      <br>
      First, when bubbles were observed within a pore, cavity or crevice
      of a surface to be cleaned, the bubbles were noted to oscillate in
      the ultrasonic field, and such oscillation is believed to play a
      key role in the decontamination of these more complex surfaces.
      Athough such pulsation oscillations may have a cleaning effect,
      the present invention is additionally, and importantly, predicated
      on using surface waves on the bubble wall to provide a cleaning
      effect. Second, it was found that the sound field plays an
      important role in trapping bubbles in such a pore, cavity or
      crevice, because although bulk flow can transport bubbles from one
      region of the liquid towards the solid surface, the acoustic
      excitation causes the additional benefit of attracting the bubble
      into the crevice and trapping it there by radiation forces, and
      furthermore of inducing net size increase of appropriate bubbles
      in pores though degassing and rectified diffusion. As such, the
      use of acoustic fields offers a significant advantage over the use
      of flowing liquid alone.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, ultrasonic cleaning has been in use for many years in
      'ultrasonic cleaning baths', whereby inertial cavitation and the
      generation of high speed liquid jets through bubble involution
      causes the removal of surface contaminants.<br>
      <br>
      However, in accordance with the preferred aspects of the present
      invention and as found by the inventors in their experimental
      studies, the cleaning does not occur as a result of such a bubble
      phenomenon, which in normal room conditions requires zero-to-peak
      acoustic pressures of order 1 bar in order to cause inertial
      cavitation, but instead, lower amplitude acoustic fields are used
      to generate non-inertial bubble pulsations and optionally surface
      waves on the walls of some bubbles. It is these surface waves and
      the associated liquid motion which is utilized in the pore
      cleaning employed in the preferred aspects of the present
      invention. However, the present invention further provides that,
      in addition to cleaning using non-inertial cavitation, inertial
      cavitaion can additonally be achieved as well as non-inertial
      cavitation to put the power of a cleaning bath, which would
      include inertial cavitation and jetting, onto the end of a
      hosepipe stream of water and clean from a distance (e.g to power
      clean the nooks and crannies of an aircraft engine that cannot be
      immersed in a cleaning bath or to decontaminate a hospital ward).
      That is an immensely powerful cleaning method.<br>
      <br>
      As discussed further below, the invention can nevertheless be
      modified additionally to provide such inertial collapse on
      particularly robust surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the preferred aspects of the present invention,
      the bubbles are independently generated at a location remote from
      the surface to be cleaned, driven towards the surface to be
      cleaned within a fluid flow, and excited by acoustic energy at the
      surface so as to provide enhanced cleaning efficacy over the
      surface, particularly when the surface has a three dimensional
      characteristic, including pores, recesses, cavities or crevices,
      and inside pipes and tubes.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the preferred aspects of the present invention,
      a sufficient acoustic pressure amplitude is developed at the
      surface in question without the requirement for generation of
      inertial collapse on the interface, although the invention can be
      modified additionally to provide such inertial collapse on
      particularly robust surfaces. This will drive surface waves and
      suitable bubble oscillation to clean the interface and associated
      structure without causing the damage and erosion which can
      potentially occur when inertial cavitation or the generation of
      high-speed jets through bubbles are excited very close to or at a
      solid surface. Any bubble entrapment into crevices aids cleaning:
      the sound field used in the embodiments aids transport of bubbles
      from the bulk liquid to the target surface, and then attracts
      suitable bubbles into the crevice as a result of acoustic
      radiation forces. Having been trapped in the pore, these bubbles
      effectively empty/clean the cavity in question. A sufficient
      bubble population should be provided or delivered to the surface
      of the materials for cleaning. This is to enable bubble excitation
      at the solid/liquid interface driven by the targeted acoustic
      field of the apparatus in question.<br>
      <br>
      Considering the acoustic transmission for a flow system, it is
      desirable to match the boundary conditions at the nozzle (and
      horn) with those in the stream once it has left the nozzle. In the
      specific example where the liquid stream passes through a gas
      space on leaving the nozzle, it is desirable to achieve a pressure
      release condition over the walls of the flow system and to operate
      above the 'cut off frequency of at least one mode (which cannot be
      the plane wave mode because this mode is evanescent at all
      frequencies for pressure-release walls), and that cut-off
      frequency being determined by the aperture, but is different for
      each mode even though all have the same aperture. However, the
      plane wave mode (which cannot propagate in a liquid stream flowing
      through gas but can propagate down an enclosed tube) can exist at
      all frequencies in a rigid walled tube. It has been found that
      sound transmission down a suitable liquid stream can be
      facilitated in several ways. First, the frequency of the sound
      field applied is chosen to be greater than the cutoff frequency of
      at least one propagating mode (preferably more) for acoustic
      propagation along the liquid stream. Second, bubble induced
      perturbation of the system can enable sound transmission through
      the liquid stream. Third, amplitude or frequency modulated sound
      can be used to increase acoustic pressure at the surface of the
      object to be cleaned and hence achieve bubble oscillation.<br>
      <br>
      The flow rate and nozzle design are preferably chosen so that the
      liquid stream does not lose integrity before it reaches the target
      (e.g. break up into drops, entrain bubbles etc.) to the extent
      that it hinders the transmission of sound from the nozzle to the
      target. Symmetrical nozzle designs and low flow rates are one
      preferred way of achieving this objective. Although the chamber
      upstream of the nozzle is, in the preferred embodiments,
      substantially conical in shape, in other embodiments the chamber
      may ave a different shape provided that the acoustic energy is
      imparted into the liquid flow at the desired boundary condtition
      for the particular cleaning application.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the apparatus is adapted electrochemically to generate
      a swarm of appropriately sized bubbles, and then to transfer that
      swarm, through the fluid flow in the stream, to the surface to be
      cleaned in the absence of acoustically driven bubble coalescence.
      Then, the acoustic energy is provided to acoustically excite
      motion/surface waves on the bubbles in the swarm at the target
      substrate.<br>
      <br>
      The seeding of bubbles into the flow assists cleaning by:
      perturbing the system to facilitate sound transmission into the
      liquid stream; perturbing the sound speed to facilitate sound
      transmission into the liquid stream; perturbing the acoustic
      impedance in the liquid to facilitate sound transmission into the
      liquid stream; perturbing the fluid loading to facilitate sound
      transmission into the liquid stream; providing bubbles which are
      transported to the target where those bubbles undertake cleaning;
      and addition odf surfactant to the liquid which can affect the
      achievement of a stable bubble diameter without bubble
      coalescence.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred embodiments of the present invention can provide
      enhanced cleaning of items or objects such as, for example,
      surgical equipment and prostheses, tools, product components (e.g.
      microchips), foodstuffs, packing, moulds, materials and packaging
      for pharmaceuticals, laboratory equipment, and forensic equipment.
      Infrastructure and facilities (e.g. hospitals ward rooms and their
      keyboards, telephones; abbatoirs; nuclear and chemical dacilities
      etc.) and personnel (e.g. under fingernails for surgeons, for
      cleaning of personnel or vehicles contaiminated by biologial,
      chemical or nuclear hazard etc.) are also suitable applications.<br>
      <br>
      Examples of items which would particularly benefit from the
      'liquid stream' manifestation of the preferred embodiments of the
      present invention (e.g. fitted to a hose or tap) include:
      vehicles, domestic products (in the home and in the show-room or
      factory), human hands; optical lenses; surfaces with specialised
      and delicate coatings, e.g. Teflon (Registered Trade Mark)
      coatings on non-stick frying pans or optical coatings on lenses;
      and for cleaning (e.g. through biofilm removal) without damage of
      items before surgical implantation, such as implants, prostheses,
      organs, etc..<br>
      <br>
      Such cleaning can be achieved without any abrasive particles, just
      a stream of liquid containing gas bubbles. Abrasion and damage
      degrade components and make subsequent contamination (e.g. growth
      of biofilms) more likely and furthermore make subsequent cleaning
      more difficult.<br>
      <br>
      The portability and conservation characteristics of the cleaning
      apparatus of the preferred embodiments of the present invention
      make it particularly convenient for the decontamination and
      cleaning of buildings (or other facilities where the target cannot
      be immersed, or where it is preferably not to transport it to a
      specialist cleaning facility), either as part of the scheduled
      cleaning routine (e.g. for abattoirs, hospitals, factories etc.)
      or as a tool for the decontamination of large facilities (e.g. in
      the decommissioning of chemical and nuclear plants, or areas
      contaminated as a result of terrorist or military action).<br>
      <br>
      A liquid stream technology as employed in the preferred
      embodiments of the present invention is particularly attractive
      for cleaning rooms, corridors, and fixed installations. Living
      material (personnel, animals) could also be decontaminated using
      this invention, where portability (or the incorporation of the
      invention into existing shower or hose facilities) eliminates the
      delay which would be incurred transporting a contaminated person
      to a non-portable decontamination facility.<br>
