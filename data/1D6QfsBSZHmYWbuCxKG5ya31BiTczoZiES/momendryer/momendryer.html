      <div align="center"><b>Novel Ultra Low-Energy Consumption
          Ultrasonic Clothes Dryer</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The development of the ultrasonic clothes dryer at Oak Ridge
      National Laboratory is a prime example of collaboration among
      various divisions at the lab — drawing upon the expertise
      necessary no matter where a scientist sits to transform a
      well-researched idea into a great invention.<br>
      <br>
      When researchers in the Energy and Transportation Science Division
      (ETSD) decided to turn the experiments they had been conducting —
      on the use of ultrasonic transducers to nebulize water—into a
      demonstration of how the technology could be applied to drying
      clothes, their mechanical engineering background was key to
      achieving success.<br>
      <br>
      The process involves piezoelectric transducers placed in direct
      contact with wet fabric, generating high frequency vibrations that
      atomize water, turning it into a mist. Taking thermal heat out of
      the drying process could result in significant energy savings
      compared with conventional clothes dryers that rely on heated air.<br>
      <br>
      But scaling the project up from an experiment on a tiny square of
      fabric to a demonstration of a full-size press-style dryer
      required more sophisticated electronics and controls.<br>
      <br>
      That’s when the Electrical and Electronics Systems Research (EESR)
      Division answered ESTD’s call for assistance. Both organizations
      are part of the Energy and Environmental Sciences Directorate.<br>
      <br>
      After examining the setup by principal investigator Ayyoub Momen
      and researcher Viral Patel in ETSD’s Building Equipment Research
      Group, the electrical engineers and other researchers in EESR’s
      Sensors and Embedded Systems (SES) Group assisted with the
      electronics and some of the physics aspects of the transducers.
      They designed and built a series of amplifiers and electronic
      drivers as the researchers tested various frequencies, wave
      shapes, amplitudes, and voltage levels to help determine the best
      kind of piezoelectric transducers to use in the demonstration.<br>
      <br>
      EESR also had students available who were able to work on the
      project — with guidance — on such tasks as drawing up schematics
      and producing needed equipment, noted Roger Kisner, who led the
      SES group effort. Participating were Christi Johnson, a staff
      member currently working on an MS in Electrical Engineering;
      Frederick Kyle Reed, pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering; and
      Evan Schlenker, who holds a BS in Electrical Engineering and who
      will begin pursuing a degree in the same area in the fall of 2016.<br>
      <br>
      Later, SES called on Reed’s services to develop, simulate, mount,
      and test circuits.<br>
      <br>
      Momen said that about 80% of the work on the prototype dryer was
      performed in Kisner’s lab space.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;“From the first day, the SES group was very impactful on the
      project,” Momen said, adding that SES identified the correct
      commercial amplifier for the prototype and later designed and
      built three custom amplifiers that significantly boosted the
      efficiency of the demonstration.<br>
      <br>
      “That’s what we do in this group: We get so involved that
      sometimes you can’t distinguish us,” Kisner said. “We want these
      projects to succeed. And so we’re not just a support technician
      who comes in; we become a researcher with the original team and
      drive the work forward.”<br>
      <br>
      “We tend to have a very wide background in our group, with
      expertise in electronics, electrical systems, optics, whatever
      needs to be brought to bear,” Kisner said. “We tend to do a lot of
      rapid prototyping of things.<br>
      <br>
      “Someone might come to us and say, ‘I’m building a new
      whatever-it-is, and no one’s ever done this before. Can you
      quickly put together something that would achieve the following
      things?’ And then we might respond, ‘Oh, I’ve never heard of it.
      Let’s do it.’ And then we step out and do what it takes to make it
      work,” said Kisner, who is a Distinguished R&amp;D Staffer and
      Distinguished Inventor at ORNL.<br>

      Next up for the dryer project is studying the feasibility of
      moving to a drum-type application typical in residential dryers.
      One challenge to that scale-up is the requirement that the clothes
      and the transducers come in contact with each other. Momen said
      coupling can be accomplished through several means, from relying
      on the weight of the clothes to adding a bit more centrifugal
      force or backing reinforcement.<br>
      <br>
      The energy savings potential is enormous because conventional
      clothes dryers using thermal heat currently consume about 1% of
      the energy used in the United States, Momen noted.<br>
      <br>
      Using an ultrasonic process instead could cut drying time in half
      and use perhaps one-tenth of the power, with resulting savings in
      energy, cost, and time, Kisner said.<br>
      <br>
      The invention can be scaled up to industrial applications, with
      the potential for collaboration with the pulp and paper industry
      for use in drying tons of pulp at a time or with carpet
      manufacturers in fiber drying, the researchers said.<br>

      </b><b>Building Energy Efficiency Frontiers and Incubator
        Technologies (BENEFIT) - 2014 (FOA DE-FOA-0001027) Project
        Objective</b><br>
      <br>
      DOE’s Building Technologies Office is seeking new clothes dryer
      technologies that can increase the energy factor (EF) from 3.7 to
      5.43 lb/kWh without increasing drying time by more than 20% over
      baseline units. The goal of this project is to develop a clothes
      dryer prototype, using ultrasonic transducers, with an EF above 10
      lb/kWh. Drying time is predicted to be ~20 minutes. This project
      aims to make the process of drying clothes very energy efficient.
      Parting from conventional heat-based drying methods, the technique
      used here relies on using piezoelectric transducers to generate
      high frequency mechanical vibration to mechanically extract
      moisture from the fabric as cold mist.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PROJECT IMPACT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This project can potentially revolutionize the clothes dryer
      industry. Being able to remove impurities in the water contained
      in clothes might lead to softer and higher-quality dried clothes,
      which is good for marketability of the final product. Eliminating
      the need for a high flow rate, high temperature air will minimize
      issues with lint in the air processing system. At the end of the
      project, appliance manufacturers including GEA will be ready to
      invest in this technology and commercialize it. This will result
      in the U.S. becoming the leader in the clothes drying industry and
      generate new jobs and innovative applications of the technology.
      This technology also has the potential for 0.4 quads of energy
      savings.<br>

      Application No. 62/158,562, filed May 8, 2015, titled "Clothes
      Dryer Using Ultrasound Phenomena", which is herein incorporated by

      </b><br>
      [002] This invention was made with United States government
      support under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 awarded by the United
      States Department of Energy. The United States government has
      certain rights in the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Technical Field.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [003] This disclosure relates to high frequency drying and more
      specifically to systems and processes that improve drying
      efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Related Art.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [004] Conventional clothes dryers use an energy source such as
      natural gas or electricity to dry clothes. A gas or electric
      heater heats air that passes through the clothes as they tumble
      and turn. Moisture is removed from the clothes via the heated air
      by converting the water retained in the clothes into vapor, which
      requires a substantial amount of continuous energy. The heat that
      dries the clothes is then removed and exhausted from the dryer.<br>
      <br>
      [005] Besides the inefficiency and the cost of converting cold air
      into hot air, water into vapor, and venting hot wet air,
      conventional clothes dryers also pose safety hazards. When the
      temperature exceeds a safe operating threshold, the dryers can
      overheat, damaging the clothes, the dryer, and the structures near
      them. Such failures can occur when airflow is restricted or when a
      dryer's thermal cutoff switch fails. There is a need for a system
      and process that provides a more efficient, less expensive, and a
      safer process to dry clothes. A technical challenge addressed by
      this disclosure is that of improving the efficiency of the drying
      process so that it may be used safely in vented and ventless
      systems. BRIEF <br>

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [020] The disclosed high frequency technology is clean, efficient,
      and environmentally friendly. The collection of systems and
      processes disclosed are herein referred to as "the systems". The
      systems may be adapted to existing dryers including blower and
      lint filter dryers, drum shroud dryers, and integrated drum shroud
      dryers. The systems may also be adapted to new innovative dryer
      designs including wringer type dryers and sandwich press/iron
      dryers. The innovation overcomes technical problems in the
      clothing industry, paper industry, food industry, mining industry,
      environmental industry, and in chemical manufacture, to name a
      few. It is used in stand-alone systems and large-scale enterprise
      systems. The systems' high frequency mesh transducers convert
      electrical signals into high frequency mechanical waves. They also
      convert ultrasound and mechanical waves into electrical signals
      when not powered by electrical signals. The technology makes use
      of high frequency transceivers that both (a) sense pressure and
      high frequency signals and (b) transmit pressure and high
      frequency signals. High frequency signals include ultrasonic
      signals that generate waves having a frequency above twenty
      thousand cycles per second.<br>
      <br>
      [021] One or more high frequency generators (also known as a high
      frequency controller, controller, amplifier, driving power driver,
      or drive controller) control the duty cycle and resonant
      frequencies that drive the high frequency transducers/transceivers
      (herein referred to as high frequency piezoelectric transducers).
      A drying effect is achieved by vibrating an article through
      piezoelectric and substrate elements and one, two, or three or
      more separate meshes within about a 100 Hz to 400 kHz range with a
      preferable irradiation frequency of about 130 kHz. Other
      frequencies for irradiation are also possible including about 50
      kHz to about 90 kHz, about 100 kHz to about 1 MHz and about 500
      kHz to about 2 MHz. The separate spaced apart meshes comprise a
      plurality of distinct mechanically actuated grids formed by the
      intersection of wires, polyester lines, or nylon lines, (or a
      combination) for example; where each mesh is flexible and capable
      of independent movement. The high frequency
      transducers/transceivers are driven at a duty cycle within a range
      of substantially 1% to substantially 30% or more. The transducer
      duty cycle may be varied throughout the clothes drying cycle
      process as a function of moisture level. Higher duty cycles are
      possible including about 40% or about 50%, and up to about 90%
      approaching 100%. During a drying process, capillary waves form on
      the surface of liquid retained in an article. The wavelength of
      the capillary waves depends on the irradiation frequency of the
      high frequency transducers/transceivers. When oscillated with
      sufficient intensity (amplitude), the water pinches off into
      droplets that pass through the spaced apart meshes that partially
      overlay an open inner annular area bounded by the piezoelectric
      and substrate elements and passes through a cylindrical shroud
      outlet. The water then passes through collector channels that
      terminate at a reservoir or a drain. Unlike conventional dryers
      that rely on heat energy to evaporate fluid retained by an article
      into vapor, the disclosed high frequency transducers use
      mechanical energy and vibrational energy. The term article in this
      disclosure refers to the object being dried such as a fabric.
      [022] Figure 1 and 2 illustrate dryers. The dryers have a
      substantially rectangular shape and have a top 102, a bottom 104,
      a front (not shown), a rear (not shown), and two opposing sides
      106. The dryers include a substantially hollow rotary tumbler drum
      108 wherein a user places articles such as clothes prior to
      activating the dryer. The dryer may be in electrical communication
      with an optional dryer timer (not shown). The timer is activated
      upon activation of the dryer.<br>
      <br>
      [023] In Figures 1 and 2 a plurality of mist collectors overlies
      piezoelectric high frequency mesh transducers 100 (one
      piezoelectric high frequency mesh transducer is labeled in Figure
      1) in the hollow rotary tumbler drum 108. In some systems, mist
      collectors are not used. Instead, only the piezoelectric high
      frequency mesh transducers 100 (hereinafter referred to as high
      frequency mesh transducers 100) are used and like the mist
      collectors they are a unitary portion of a rotary tumbler drum
      108. In Figure 1 and 2, the concave surfaces of the high frequency
      mesh transducers 100 come in contact with the articles as the
      articles tumble within the rotary tumbler drum 108. When contact
      occurs some high frequency mesh transducers 100 alert an high
      frequency generator by generating and transmitting a voltage
      proportional to the force that is applied by the articles to the
      high frequency mesh transducers 100 (a.k.a. the feedback signal).
      Once the feedback signal is detected at the high frequency
      generator via an electrical/data bus or monitoring line, the high
      frequency generator powers up the high frequency mesh transducers
      100 that transmitted the alert which cause the transducers' mesh
      surfaces to vibrate at a resonant frequency. The vibration causes
      the radial outward ejection of liquid droplets from the article
      through the high frequency mesh transducers 100 through the open
      inner annular area bounded by the piezoelectric and substrate
      elements. The curved shape of the high frequency mesh transducer
      surfaces cause the irradiated liquid to coalesce in the annular
      space and flow downward through the piezoelectric and substrate
      elements into the collector channels 110 through the aide of
      gravity, and when the hollow rotary tumbler drum 108 is rotating,
      through centrifugal force induced by rotation. The liquid that
      passes through the high frequency mesh transducers 100 are
      collected in a reservoir or pass through to a drain. In these
      systems, the drying process occurs only when there is direct
      contact between one or more articles and the high frequency mesh
      transducers 100. [024] In some alternative systems the duty cycles
      of the actuated high frequency mesh transducers 100 are determined
      by the rotational rate of the hollow rotary tumbler drum 108 and
      the proportional feedback signal generated by the force that is
      applied by the articles against the high frequency mesh
      transducers 100. In these alternative systems, as the articles dry
      the weight of the articles and the proportional feedback voltage
      signals generated by the high frequency mesh transducers 100
      decrease. In turn, this causes the burst-width modulated signal
      delivered by the high frequency generators to increase. Notably,
      the power consumed by some high frequency systems is inversely
      related to the level of moisture retained in the articles or the
      article's weight and may be used to calibrate the high frequency
      generator when the articles are first loaded within the rotary
      tumbler drum 108. In operation, when articles are initially
      loaded, high frequency generators drive the high frequency mesh
      transducers 100 at their resonant operating efficiency based on
      the detected moisture or weight. As the articles eject the liquid
      or a predetermined amount of the liquid, some high frequency
      generators proportionally increase the power sourced to the high
      frequency mesh transducers 100 by increasing the duty cycle
      sourcing the high frequency mesh transducers 100 as shown in
      Figure 3 until the feedback signal falls or fades below a
      predetermined threshold that is determined from empirical
      evidence. When the level of the feedback signal falls below the
      threshold, the high frequency generator shuts off the high
      frequency mesh transducers 100 completely and in some systems the
      rotation of the hollow rotary tumbler drum 108 and/or dryer. The
      system shut down may prevent the over drying of articles, which
      causes the majority of damage to fabric coming out of conventional
      dryers. Some or all of the systems may draw in or inject hot air
      into the hollow rotary tumbler drum 108 to complete the drying
      process or when the drying period ends to provide warm articles
      before the dryer shuts down. When fabric is cooler coming out of a
      dryer, some users incorrectly assume that the articles are still
      wet and require more drying even when most of the moisture that
      was in the fabric had been extracted. The addition of hot air at
      the end of the drying cycle merely enhances the operator
      experience of unloading the articles from the dryer.<br>
      <br>
      [025] While each of the systems described in this disclosure are
      shown in vent-less systems, other systems incorporate the high
      frequency technology in vented systems. For example, when
      retrofitted to a conventional blower lint filter dryer, the high
      frequency systems may alternatively or additionally couple a lint
      filter that overlies an array of high frequency transducers or
      high frequency mesh transducers 100 that include a series of
      meshes serially aligned, stacked, and spaced apart in an array.
      When the liquid droplet sizes in the irradiated mist are of
      appropriate size, they are entrained in the airflow and
      transported out of the hollow rotary tumbler drum 108 through the
      lint filter and other meshes serially stacked and aligned that
      make up part of the high frequency mesh transducers 100. The
      liquid droplets coalesce into larger droplets that are then
      collected in collector channel 110 that terminates at a reservoir
      or passes to a drain and the dehumidified airflow is exhausted
      through a vent. In Figures 1, 2 and 4 the collector channel 110 is
      annular shaped and concentric with a portion of the hollow rotary
      tumbler drum 108 and terminates in a reservoir shown as a
      collector. In this system the lint filter is multi-functional
      element as it catches the dust and lint discarded from the article
      during the drying process and further dehumidifies substantially
      all of the moisture ejected from the article suspended in the air.
      Further, the connection between the lint filter and the high
      frequency mesh transducers 100 is not limited to a mechanical or
      physical coupling; rather it is a connection that may include
      intervening parts to the extent they do not substantially impeded
      air flow intended to pass through the lint filter and high
      frequency mesh transducers 100 and a vent during operation of the
      dryer.<br>
      <br>
      [026] While the number of meshes, opening size, and materials used
      to manufacture the meshes used in the high frequency mesh
      transducers 100 depend on the application and the type of liquid
      being extracted from an article, polyester mesh with opening size
      of about 0.84 x 0.84 mm are effective when operating in
      environmental conditions common to consumer clothes dryers. The
      opening size of the mesh is similar to that of a lint filter and
      the optimum number of spaced apart, directly adjoining meshes
      stacked in series (overlying each other above the piezoelectric
      and substrate elements spaced apart by only by a flat ring made of
      metal or plastic such as O-rings) is three, which results in a
      moisture collection efficiency of about 50%. As additional meshes
      are added in series the cumulative airflow pressure drops along
      with the moisture collection efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [027] Because drying occurs when direct contact occurs between an
      article and one of the mesh layers of the high frequency mesh
      transducers 100, the high frequency mesh transducers 100 are not
      activated or powered-up continuously resulting in an energy
      consumption that is between two to five times less than the energy
      consumed by conventional dryers. In operation, when the high
      frequency mesh transducers 100 are activated, the high frequency
      mesh transducers 100 push the article upward away from the high
      frequency mesh transducers 100. When contact is lost, power is not
      sourced to the high frequency mesh transducers 100, meaning that
      the power is delivered only in bursts when contact occurs between
      the article and the high frequency mesh transducers 100. After a
      finite amount of time, the article falls back into contact with
      the high frequency mesh transducers 100 due to gravity, and in
      some cases centrifugal force. While direct contract with the high
      frequency mesh transducers 100 reoccurs, detection occurs when the
      articles mechanically stress the high frequency mesh transducers
      100. In other systems passive sensors such as passive infrared
      sensors detect direct contact between the articles and the high
      frequency mesh transducers 100. The term passive in this instance
      refers to the fact that sensors do not generate or radiate any
      energy during the detection process.<br>
      <br>
      [028] The energy consumed per unit mass of water is calculated as:<br>
      <br>
      Energy per Unit of Mass = Drying Time x Duty Cycle x Rated Power
      of Transducer<br>
      <br>
      Mass of Water<br>
      <br>
      When applying different duty cycles and frequencies, exemplary
      high frequency mesh transducers 100 which typically operate at
      resonance frequency of 130 kHz and modulated by modulation
      frequency of about 600 Hz at about a 60% duty cycle. The minimum
      energy consumption per unit mass of water is about 0.198 kWh/kg,
      which is about half the energy consumed when the high frequency
      mesh transducers 100 were powered up continuously. This is about
      115thof the energy that is used in the conventional electric
      dryers.<br>
      <br>
      [029] As shown in Figure 5, high frequency generators supply power
      to the high frequency mesh transducers 100 through a binary
      modulated signal. Power is supplied only when the modulating
      signal is active (high). The resulting mixing of the power wave
      and the modulated signal renders the power supplied to the high
      frequency mesh transducers 100. As explained, in some alternative
      systems the modulation signal may vary with the rate of rotation
      of the hollow rotary tumbler drum 108 when the hollow rotary
      tumbler drum 108 is used and contact is detected between an
      article and one or more high frequency mesh transducers 100. In
      other alternative systems the duty cycle of the modulation signal
      varies with the amount of mechanical stress that occurs in the
      high frequency mesh transducers 100 that may be detected by the
      proportional voltage generated by the high frequency mesh
      transducers 100 that is monitored by the high frequency
      generators.<br>
      <br>
      [030] To deliver power, the driver and power distribution
      architecture may use a slip- ring, a rotary electrical joint, a
      collector or an electric swivel. The slip ring keeps continuous
      connections with the high frequency mesh transducers 100 that are
      part of the hollow rotary tumbler drum 108 as shown in Figure 6.
      The power delivered through the slip ring sources individual high
      frequency mesh transducer drivers. The individual high frequency
      mesh transducer drivers provide substantially uniform operation
      despite the distinctive operating responses of each of high
      frequency mesh transducers 100. The resonant frequency spread of
      the high frequency mesh transducers 100 are minimized by this
      individualized automated control. Due to the reduction in water
      content during the drying process and differing fabric densities
      in a single load, a wide variation of loading across a population
      of high frequency mesh transducers 100 can cause radical shifts in
      the high frequency mesh transducer 100 resonance that is
      compensated by the individual or pairwise control via the power
      distribution architecture. The system compensates for a wide and
      variable spectrum of resonant frequencies at any moment during the
      drying process via the driver and power distribution architecture
      that makes up the high frequency generators by monitoring the
      feedback of the high frequency mesh transducers 100 at the high
      frequency generator. Each driver-transducer pair is substantially
      driven to the high frequency mesh transducer 100 resonance (100 Hz
      to 400 kHz, preferably 130 kHz) even under load that may render
      the form of the modulation shown in Figure 5 and bursts shown in
      Figure 7. This means that power delivery to the high frequency
      mesh transducers 100 is not uniform but varies with the tolerances
      of each of the high frequency mesh transducers 100 and the current
      drying conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [031] Figures 8 and 9 show the high frequency generator
      functionality and the modulated amplification of the signal
      sourcing the high frequency mesh transducers 100. In Figure 8, the
      resonant frequency oscillator is automatically adjusted to the
      resonant frequency during the drying process by one or more
      controllers, one or more microprocessors (CPUs), one or more
      signal processors (SPU), and one or more graphics processors
      (GPUs), monitoring the output of the high frequency mesh
      transducers 100. The resonant frequency oscillator generates a
      square wave that is modulated by the modulation adjustment signal.
      The mixing of the square wave and modulation signal (e.g.,
      multiplier) generates a burst output that drives the high
      frequency mesh transducers 100 at the resting and active state.
      When bipolar drivers drive the high frequency mesh transducers
      100, the bipolar output is amplified via an amplifier to the
      operating voltage of the high frequency mesh transducers 100. In
      some circuits a variable transformer is used to adjust the DC
      power rail of the desired peak output voltage.<br>
      <br>
      [032] Figure 10 shows the high frequency system within a sandwich
      press/iron. The high frequency mesh transducers 100 are a unitary
      part of the base of the press. The base is the structure that
      supports the other elements of the sandwich press/iron is
      supported and mounted. In use, as wet article such as a fabric is
      placed on the upper most surface of the base such that it overlies
      the high frequency mesh transducers 100. A lid composed of both
      rigid and compressive material conforms to the irregular shape of
      the article. In some systems a heating element is integrated into
      the lower surface of the top lid to warm the article after the
      drying process ends. As the lid is closed, the high frequency mesh
      transducers 100 are activated; moisture is radially ejected
      through the high frequency mesh transducers 100 toward the bottom
      of the sandwich press/iron in response to the control of the high
      frequency generator.<br>
      <br>
      [033] Figure 11 shows a wringer high frequency dryer. The high
      frequency dryer includes two rotating tumblers, which have high
      frequency mesh transducers 100 (two are labeled) integrated within
      them. As the wet fabric is passed through the gap between the
      tumblers, it comes into contact with the high frequency mesh
      transducers 100 and moisture is removed. The tumblers are
      multifunctional as they hold articles such as clothes and further
      mechanically extract water by feeding articles between the top
      rotary tumbler and the bottom rotary tumbler. The top and bottom
      rotary tumblers roll smoothly when the rotary tumblers are
      manually or automatically driven. When the rotary tumblers are
      engaged (rotating), the high frequency mesh transducers 100 in
      contact with the article are activated; moisture is then ejected
      radially inward in response to the control of the high frequency
      generator. In some examples two or more pairs of rotating tumblers
      are arranged in series.<br>
      <br>
      [034] Figure 13 shows a method for drying a wet article. The
      method may be, for example, implemented using any of the systems
      described with respect to Figures 1 - 12. The systems may provide
      two or more piezoelectric (high frequency mesh) transducers 100
      having one or more resonant frequencies that are driven by one or
      more amplifiers or one or more high frequency generators at 1302.
      The method detects and selects the piezoelectric transducers in
      contact with the article at 1304; sources an electric signal that
      drives selected piezoelectric transducers to dry the wet
      article(s) without circulating heated air at 1306; and resonates
      the selected piezoelectric (high frequency mesh) transducers
      non-continuously at their respective resonant frequencies only
      when the selected piezoelectric (high frequency mesh) transducers
      are in direct contact with the wet article at 1308. Alternatively,
      or optionally, the method also injects hot air into the enclosure
      drying the wet articles after the wet article is substantially dry
      at optional 1310.<br>
      <br>
      [035] While each of the disclosed high frequency technology
      described may stand alone they also may be encompassed within
      other systems and applications. Other alternate systems may
      include any combinations of structure and functions described
      above or shown in one or more or each of the figures. These
      systems or methods are formed from any combination of structure
      and function described. The structures and functions may process
      additional or different high frequency mesh transducers 100 and
      may be supported by other drying structures than a hollow rotary
      tumbler drum 108, for example. Other high frequency mesh
      transducers 100 that may be used for example, may apply several
      widely different frequency signals to one or more articles to
      affect the drying process include those that have separately tuned
      piezoelectric and substrate mediums aligned in a stack as shown in
      Figure 12. Different frequency ranges will vary the effects on the
      drying process. A high-frequency signal will cause cavitation and
      nebulization of the water entrained in an article such as a
      fabric. A lower mid frequency signal (relative to the
      high-frequency signal) acts to drive clusters of water away from
      the article. An even relative lower frequency signal (relative to
      the mid-frequency signal) can act to move one section of fabric
      away from a transducer so that another wetter fabric section can
      come in contact with the high frequency mesh transducers 100
      stack.<br>
      <br>
      [036] Other systems include variations of the spaced apart meshes
      that comprise a plurality of distinct mechanically actuated grids
      having penetrations that allow various types and viscosities of
      liquids to pass there through. Some, all, or combinations of the
      perforated meshes shown in Figure 14 are stacked in the high
      frequency mesh transducers 100 as described above. The spaced
      apart holes, slots, random perforations, and radial slots with
      perforated and/or solid reinforcement bars and all combinations
      thereof are preferred because various meshes and combinations draw
      water from various articles more effectively and efficiently than
      others. The combinations and piezoelectric elements provide means
      to remove nebulized water droplets from a working side of an
      article. A working side is the side of the article in direct
      contact with one of the meshes of a high frequency mesh transducer
      100. When part of the mesh transducer is in contact with a wet
      article, a nebulized liquid flow path is established for
      continuous liquid removal. When solid transducers are used in
      other alternative systems a flow path is provided to channel
      nebulized liquid droplets away from the articles.<br>
      <br>
      [037] In each of the systems described meshes are excited by the
      piezoelectric-medium fixed to a substrate. When powered, the
      contraction and expansion of the piezoelectric- medium subjects
      the substrate into bending vibrations. The bending of the
      substrate excites the mesh vibrations substantially perpendicular
      to the piezoelectric-medium vibrations. In these systems, the
      piezoelectric medium and substrate is optimized to a vibration
      frequency of about 100 Hz to about 400 kHz, preferably 130 kHz and
      its shape is matched to the deflection shape of the substrate. To
      ensure the irradiation fluid passes through the high frequency
      mesh transducers 100, the piezoelectric medium may comprise a
      piezoelectric-actuator annulus and the substrate may comprise an
      annulus concentric with the piezoelectric-actuator and coupled at
      least one mesh along an inner radial portion of the substrate. The
      meshes are separated preferably by about a one-eighth of an inch
      open annual O-ring on the upper and lower mesh surface. The mesh
      surfaces are positioned with the piezoelectric-actuator annulus
      and the substrate annulus within a hollow right circular cylinder
      shroud.<br>
      <br>
      [038] All or parts of the high frequency generator may include or
      be controller by one or more controllers, one or more
      microprocessors (CPUs), one or more signal processors (SPU), one
      or more graphics processors (GPUs), one or more application
      specific integrated circuit (ASIC), one or more programmable media
      or any and all combinations of such hardware including ultrasonic
      generators, ultrasonic controllers, ultrasonic microprocessors,
      ultrasonic SPUs, ultrasonic GPUs, ultrasonic ASICs, etc. All or
      part of the logic, specialized processes, and systems may be
      implemented as instructions for execution by multi-core processors
      (e.g., CPUs, SPUs, and/or GPUs), controller, or other processing
      device and stored in a tangible or non-transitory machine-readable
      or computer-readable medium such as flash memory, random access
      memory (RAM) or read only memory (ROM), erasable programmable read
      only memory (EPROM) or other machine-readable medium such as a
      compact disc read only memory (CDROM), or magnetic or optical
      disk. Thus, a product, such as a computer program product, may
      include a storage medium and computer readable instructions stored
      on the medium, which when executed in an endpoint, computer
      system, or other device, cause the device to perform operations
      according to any of the process descriptions or hardware
      descriptions above.<br>
      <br>
      [039] The term "coupled" disclosed in this description may
      encompass both direct and indirect coupling. Thus, first and
      second parts are said to be coupled together when they directly
      contact one another, as well as when the first part couples to an
      intermediate part which couples either directly or via one or more
      additional intermediate parts to the second part. The term
      "substantially" or "about" encompass a range that is largely
      (ninety five percent or more), but not necessarily wholly, that
      which is specified. It encompasses all but a significant amount.
      When devices are responsive to or occur in response to commands
      events, and/or requests, the actions and/or steps of the devices,
      such as the operations that devices are performing, necessarily
      occur as a direct or indirect result of the preceding commands,
      events, actions, and/or requests. In other words, the operations
      occur as a result of the preceding operations. A device that is
      responsive to another requires more than an action (i.e., the
      device's response to) merely follow another action.<br>

      art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible
      within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is
      not to be restricted except in light of the attached claims and
