      <br>
      Cymatic therapy or "cymatherapy", is a scientifically unsupported
      alternative medicine technique using acoustic waves which was
      developed in the 1960s by Sir Peter Guy Manners.[1]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Cymatic therapy is based on the notion that human cells, organs,
      and tissues each have a natural resonant frequency which changes
      when perturbed by illness. Cymatic therapists apply different
      audible frequencies and combinations of sound waves which they
      claim entrain malfunctioning components back to their healthy
      vibratory state and promote natural healing.[2] The American
      Cancer Society states: "Available scientific evidence does not
      support this claim. ... Relying on this type of treatment alone,
      and avoiding or delaying conventional medical care for cancer, may
      have serious health consequences."[1]<br>
      <br>
      Cymatic therapy is operationally, historically, and
      philosophically distinct from the many medical uses of ultrasound
      and from the more mainstream practice of music therapy.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Cymatherapy: A New Wave in Sound Techniques</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Sound therapies of many varieties are becoming more widely
      accepted every day. Music therapy, for example, is commonly used
      for reducing stress, for pain management, and in delivery and
      operating rooms as well as to treat the elderly, the mentally
      challenged, and those with special learning needs and emotional
      issues. Ultrasound is another example. Practitioners now prescribe
      ultrasound to diagnose tumors, clean wounds, pulverize kidney
      stones and alleviate pain in sore muscles and backs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How Sound Supports Natural Healing</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Scientists now know that the human body is a dynamic energy system
      and that the body itself as well as each of our cells, organs and
      tissues have their own vibratory nature. They have a natural, or
      resonant, frequency that can become upset or imbalanced.
      Cymatherapy International has developed an instrument that
      delivers precise combinations of frequencies (or "commutations")
      associated with healthy tissue and organ systems. When applied to
      the body, these sound waves help to normalize imbalances and
      synchronize the cell's frequency back to its natural healthy state
      of vibrational resonance.<br>
      <br>
      Like other holistic techniques, Cymatherapy supports the body's
      natural ability to heal itself.<br>
      <br>
      Building on prior research, Cymatherapy International has created
      a range of new products that use a special, patent-pending
      delivery system. These breakthrough instruments combine sound and
      magnetics—two powerful and natural restorative agents—to enhances
      results.<br>

      </b><b>A Re-Soundingly Successful Experiment </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Recently, in Germany, researchers took the DNA of a 17-year-old
      boy, recorded its sound frequencies, and saved them. The boy was
      accidentally killed, but the scientists still had his DNA
      frequency patterns. Later, the DNA frequencies of the 17-year-old
      were transmitted into the body of a man in his late thirties. And
      the man almost became the young boy. His skin became youthful, he
      became slim, his hair went back to its natural color. Today he's
      in his forties and he still looks like a much younger man. --Sir
      Peter Guy Manning, M.D.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cymatics As Science</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the early 18th century, the German physicist Ernst Chladni, the
      ''father of acoustics,'' covered plates with thin layers of sand,
      set them vibrating, and observed the patterns that were made in
      response to different sound stimuli.<br>
      <br>
      In 1967, nearly three hundred years later, Hans Jenny, a Swiss
      doctor, artist, and researcher, published Cymatics - The Structure
      and Dynamics of Waves and Vibrations. In this book, published in
      both German and English, Jenny, like his precursor, showed what
      happens when one takes various materials like sand, water, or iron
      filings, and places them on vibrating metal surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      When this is done, shapes and motion-patterns appear. Some of
      these patterns are nearly perfectly ordered and are stationary.
      Others develop in a turbulent, organic fashion, and are constantly
      in motion.<br>
      <br>
      Jenny used crystal oscillators, and invented what he called a
      ''tonoscope'' to set his plates and membranes vibrating. One of
      the most fascinating discoveries he made was that the vowels of
      Hebrew and Sanskrit, when toned into his media, formed the actual
      patterns of the letters themselves! Modern languages did not have
      this effect. All of which leads to the speculation that there may
      be some truth in the concept of a ''sacred language'' - an actual,
      physical reason why the recitation of sacred mantras and texts may
      have real healing properties.<br>
      <br>
      Jenny thought that evolution was a result of vibrations, with the
      vibrations of one level of organization, such as that of cells,
      each one unique, combining to create glands and organs and so on,
      each new level being a harmonic of the previous one. Jenny saw
      that we could heal the body with sound by understanding how
      different frequencies influence the genes, cells, and organs of
      the body.<br>
      <br>
      Out of Jenny's work, and that of other scientists in the late
      fifties, came the reality of using sound to transmute diseased
      cells into their healthy counterparts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Enter the Age of Miracles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It was Sir Peter Guy Manners, British medical doctor and
      osteopath, who collated the work that had been done in cymatics
      research and developed from it the therapy of Cymatics. Stated
      most simply, Cymatics therapy uses a toning device to transmit
      into diseased areas of the body the signature vibrations of
      healthy organs and tissues.<br>
      <br>
      We called Dr. Manners at his academy in Bretforton, England. He
      told us that he had started off in ordinary medicine, but that a
      couple years into his training he'd reached a startling
      realization. As part of my training, I and my fellow students
      would observe doctors in the process of treating their patients.
      And so we are sitting there with this doctor, and some patient
      comes in with a headache, and the doctor says, 'Take these two
      tablets.' And the patient goes off. But he comes back in a
      fortnight or so, a couple weeks, and he says, 'Those tablets did
      the trick, but now I've got a little tummy upset.' And we watch
      the doctor give him some different tablets, and he goes off. And
      then later this same patient is back again, 'Oh, those tablets
      were wonderful, but now I've got a bit of diarrhea, you see.'<br>
      <br>
      ''And I realized, we started out with one patient, and now we've
      got three!''<br>
      <br>
      Knowing that there had to be a better way of healing than what was
      taught to him in medical school, Dr. Manners traveled all over the
      world seeking to find out what other options existed for treating
      patients. He spent time studying with scientists in Germany (''I
      liked the kind of research they were doing''), Russia, and the
      United States.<br>
      <br>
      Somewhere in his travels, Manners met up with Hans Jenny. ''He was
      interested in making forms and shapes with sound, and these
      coincided with the forms and shapes of anatomy and physiology,''
      Dr. Manners said. Out of this observation came Cymatics, or
      Bioresonance, therapy - the use of sound to transform diseased
      tissue into its healthy counterpart.<br>
      <br>
      Cymatics probes are used to transmit bioresonance energy, in the
      form of electronic pulses, from the Cymatics instrument directly
      to human tissue. Another method of application is through fluids.
      Water or a homeopathic preparation is placed on a Bioresonance
      Energizer, which imprints the bioenergetic patterns into the
      solution. Also, there are units which can transmit bioenergy
      patterns into a bathtub or hydrotherapy unit. Yet another unit
      combines bioenergetic frequencies with color.<br>
      <br>
      You can see how all of this works by realizing that there is no
      difference between the energetic pattern of an object and the
      object itself. We are made of energy. If we transmit a healthy
      frequency into diseased tissue, we cause it to take on the
      frequency - and thus, the actuality - of healthy tissue.<br>
      <br>
      When asked what brings people to Cymatics therapy, Dr. Manners
      said, ''They choose it because a tremendous percentage want to
      move out of the drug scene.'' And he stresses that, at least in
      the U.K., Cymatics has earned scientific recognition. "Scientists
      like it because its techniques can be explained and quantified,
      and the results are predictable. We know scientifically what will
      happen,'' Manners said, ''if we transmit a certain combination of
      frequencies into the tissue.''<br>
      <br>
      The instrument that is used to transmit sound vibrations into the
      human body is currently known as the Mark VI. It has replaced Mark
      I through V. ''This instrument,'' Dr. Manners says, ''holds up to
      390 commutations of frequencies, sounds which will regenerate
      organs and tissues in the body.''<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cymatics and the Fountain of Youth</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Perhaps the most exciting possible application of Cymatics, as we
      indicate in the story that leads off this article, is its
      potential to reverse the aging process.<br>
      <br>
      ''When you're born,'' Dr. Manners said, ''every cell multiplies.
      Then, at puberty, the frequency patterns of the cells change, and
      instead of multiplying, cell replaces cell. As we age, cells still
      replace each other, but the tempo slows down.<br>
      <br>
      ''Within a few years of time we will be able to prevent this
      slowing down of cell replacement. And this can all be done with
      sound. If we take a frequency sample of your DNA at age 18, and
      save it, then later, if we transmit this frequency to your cells,
      they will rejuvenate.''<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Future of Advanced Medicine</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Sir Peter Guy Manners is an M.D. ''But I don't administer drugs,''
      he says. Drugs, he claims, are destructive. The type of medicine
      he practices is constructive. And although in the United States
      constructive healing modalities go under the name of ''alternative
      therapy,'' in the United Kingdom they are referred to as Advanced
      Medicine. And the doctors who practice Advanced Medicine, instead
      of being hounded by professional and governmental organizations,
      may even aspire to knighthood.<br>
      <br>
      ''It used to be, when doctors didn't know how to heal an arm or a
      leg, they just amputated it,'' Manners said. ''By the year 2010,
      medicine as it's known today will be as out of date as chopping
      off limbs. Prepare to accept the wonders of technology as
      established, scientific fact. Miracles will become the natural
      thing.<br>
      <br>
      ''Miracles,'' concludes Dr. Manners, ''were simply things people
      didn't understand. Today, we can explain miracles. Miracles fit
      right in with advanced technology.''<br>

      <div align="center"><b>A Brief History of Cymatic Therapy</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Starting in the sixth century BC, Greek philosopher Pythagoras was
      the first to use music to heal a person’s body and emotions.
      During the eighth century, German scientist Ernst Chladni proved
      that sound does affect matter. Chlandi, the father of acoustics
      showed that as he drew a bow across the edge of a metal plate
      covered with sand, the sand moved and formed geometric patterns.<br>
      <br>
      In the 1960s, a Swiss scientist, Dr. Hans Jenny produced more
      sophisticated experiments with sand, fluids and powders on metal
      plates, using a frequency generator to move the material forming
      beautiful intricate geometric patterns. He coined the term
      cymatics from the Greek word kyma, which means wave, to describe
      the study of wave phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      It was Sir Peter Guy Manners a British medical doctor, who
      collated the work that had been done in cymatics research by Dr
      Jenny and others and developed the therapy of Cymatics. Stated
      most simply, Cymatics therapy uses a toning device to transmit
      into diseased areas of the body the signature vibrations of
      healthy organs and tissues. Dr. Manners designed a machine, the
      Mark I that would deliver frequencies directly to the body using
      an applicator, through use of advancing technology Dr. Manners
      machine matured to the Mark VI which could deliver 390 commutation
      frequencies, sounds which will regenerate organs and tissues in
      the body.<br>
      <br>
      Building on everything that has been done in the past,
      Cymatherapy® International has developed a unique, internationally
      patent-pending system that supports the body’s natural
      self-healing abilities and delivers to the body the precise
      combinations of frequencies associated with healthy tissue and
      organ systems. The over 700 commutation frequencies that are
      transmitted through this new tool help to normalize imbalances and
      synchronize the cells' frequencies back to their natural, healthy
      state of vibrational resonance. Mandara Cromwell, President of
      Cymatherapy® International met with Dr. Manners in 2001 where she
      first learned about his work. It was 2002 when Dr. Manners passed
      the baton to Mandara and through her efforts the new Cyma® 1000
      was launched. The development of the Cyma® 1000 and Cymatherapy
      has truly brought sound therapy into the 21st Century.<br>
      <br>
      Cymatherapy is a computerized form of combined sound and magnetic
      therapy applied directly to the body. It uses subtle audible
      sounds that simultaneously works on an energetic and physical
      level. Cymatherapy supports the body’s natural ability to heal
      itself by providing precise combinations of frequencies that are
      associated with healthy tissue and organ systems. Cymatherapy
      assists your body to provide itself with effective and gentle
      relief for stress, injury, chronic pain and many other conditions.
      This therapy is also highly effective when combined with many of
      the other available therapies offered by Natural Holistics, such
      as massage, chiropractic or nutritional medicine.<br>

            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>This invention relates to an improvement in methods of
          handling and processing information, energy and matter. It was
          developed initially to make use of potentials of new
          technologies, science and industrial art to problems of
          non-chemical purification, with little or no chemicals added
          beyond water, of pre-combustion inputs and post-combustion
          outputs in thermoelectric power generation. The invention
          extends their application to new, nonobvious and useful
          systems of methods and apparati for the production,
          transformation and distribution of matter, energy and
          information.<br>
          <b><br>
            PRIOR ART<br>
            <br>
          </b>[0002] With respect to the system of methods and apparati
          which is the subject of this application, and embodiments
          therefor, the work of the following, their predecessors and
          experimentally, clinically or epistemologically near
          neighbours, form the principal precedent contributions drawn
          on by this writer: Viktor Schauberger (Austria), Theodor
          Schwenk (Germany), Hans Jenny (Switzerland), Lawrence Edwards
          (England), Shafica Karagulla (Canada, United States), Marcel
          Vogel (United States), Fritz-Albert Popp (Germany), Thomas E.
          Bearden (United States), Ernst von Bezold (Canada) and William
          A. Tiller (Canada, United States). The following discussion
          outlines those contributions applicable to this work as
          understood by this writer and builds on them to show their
          relationship to novel, nonobvious and useful aspects of the
          invention here disclosed.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] Viktor Schauberger was an Austrian forester and
          technologist whose works are now also widely available in
          English (1). He observed that when a current in a flowing
          stream winds centripetally and then centrifugally with an
          opposite sense of spin, at the turning point of the change of
          direction of rotation, oxygenation occurs and from this place
          also there is an energetic flow transverse to the direction of
          the current, into the stream banks, stimulating the growth of
          vegetation in those areas. Working with this and similar
          observations Schauberger was able to invent and frequently to
          patent 'naturalesque' technologies for diverse applications
          including trans mountain lumber transport and for
          transportation; for water purification, energy production,
          which he identified as environmentally healthier and therefore
          sustainable in comparison with still-prevalent environmentally
          destructive mechanistic technologies.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] The centripetal-centrifugal spiral effects he reported
          (see figure) and made use of ('Schauberger effect') have been
          applied here in guiding the development of the invention, in
          light also of observation in the human being's energy field by
          numerous independent, highly sensitive and skilled observers,
          of major chakras (see for example S. Karagulla), whirling
          energetic flexible cones extending well beyond the physical
          body, situated at and through major glandular centres and
          aligned in pairs tip-to-tip pointing in opposite directions
          from the front and back of the body (e.g., B. Brennan and
          others) set along a central energy channel (called Sushumna in
          the orient) which runs vertically coincident with the human
          spine.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] Theodor Schwenk's work on water as a spiraling and
          projective-geometrically characterisable cosmic sense organ
          demonstrated, by wheat germination trials using shaken water,
          the existence and rhythms of cosmic, i.e., extraterrestrial,
          atmospherically significant Zeitgeber environmental rhythms,
          and therefore the importance of taking into account not only
          the use of vortices but also the significance of
          macroenvironmental rhythms in cleaning and enlivening water
          organisms to function harmoniously with the syntropic
          potential of the biospheric macroenvironment.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] Hans Jenny was a physician living in Dornach,
          Switzerland who developed the field of Cymatics, creating and
          filming steady and moving three-dimensional standing waves
          generally produced with fluid agitated to a standing wave by
          sound through a loudspeaker base, based on Ernst Chladni's
          acoustically produced two-dimensional standing wave figures
          and on an appreciation of the contribution of vibration to the
          creation of form. Hans Jenny patented a device for making
          speech visible [ca. 1968; reference].<br>
          <br>
          [0007] In a Chladni figure such as that formed by sprinkled
          fine sand vibrating on the back of a bowed horizontally held
          violin, the distribution of nodes and antinodes in the
          particular mode of vibration of the substrate medium, i.e.,
          the violin back, at the frequencies at which it is being
          excited, may be displayed by the redistribution of the
          scattered sand in a pattern corresponding to the position of
          nodal and or to antinodal points and boundaries, evidently
          dependent primarily on the size and density of the sand
          particles. This acoustically mediated resonance has been
          researched by Jenny, Armin Husemann, Sherry Edwards and others
          as one of a number of formative principles in the human body.
          A formative faculty (classically, the facultas formatrix) was
          cited by Johannes Kepler to explain snow crystal form
          variation (the body of formative forces of the Earth); was
          researched in embryology by Erich Blechschmidt; and considered
          more broadly, has been studied as a phenomenon of internal
          communication demonstrable optically and functionally e.g.,
          electrically, in all living organisms, by Fritz-Albert Popp
          and coworkers.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] These examples of energetic formative processes in
          whole systems, i.e., in bodies of connected parts, demonstrate
          a formative paradigm which is applied and extended with
          multimodal energy flows or activity sources, e.g.,
          electro-magneto-gravitic-(/levitatory)-]optic-acoustic and
          scalar, as well as psychoenergetic, for application in the
          invention.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] Lawrence Edwards, an English mathematics teacher and
          biology researcher, showed that tree buds breathe, or
          fluctuate rhythmically, in winter around an ideal middle form
          whose projective geometric path curve is related to the golden
          mean. His vortex spiral calculation methods and examples are
          cited here as prior art for the production of vortices and
          their energetic as well as material products which will
          enliven nature functionally, in the sense Schauberger
          described and demonstrated, rather than degrading nature.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] Dr. Shafica Karagulla left the Montreal Neurological
          Institute to do research on higher sense perception,
          eventually founding with Viola Neal the Higher Sense
          Perception Foundation in Los Angeles. Karagulla's clinical
          reporting of the correlation between chakra structure and
          activity on the one hand, and physiological health status such
          as patient endocrinology on the other (1965), provide along
          with the work of V. V. Hunt (UCLA) and other investigators
          such as R. Steiner a reliable modern base of published
          observation of some typical human psychoenergetic anatomy and
          its corresponding function.. This enables those less skilled
          in the art of such observation to make better use of
          transitory or fragmentary experimental data and to apply with
          greater confidence, along with those not making such
          observations, the findings of others as a source of design
          modeling information.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] Marcel Vogel, a solid state chemist was instrumental in
          developing the first magnetic memory disk drive coating for
          IBM. Vogel published work (1973) demonstrating that
          psychoenergetic telekinetic phenomena become reproducible with
          sufficient experimenter self-training of the mind which is the
          instrument of manifesting such psychoenergetic phenomena.
          Taken together with the contribution of Tiller, Vogel's work
          exemplifies a shift to scientific knowledge and ordinary
          technical application of human capacities which have become a
          part of the state of the art in healing and are applied in the
          invention for process control enhancement of which water
          purification, energy production and telecommunication are
          three examples.<br>
          <br>
          [0012] Fritz-Albert Popp founded the International Institute
          of Biophysics (Neuss, Germany, a collaborative research
          undertaking of dozens of scientists globally. His paradigm
          shifting discoveries have shown that the activity of a
          quantitatively small amount of energy, as light, directs and
          maintains the organisation of the body's biochemical activity,
          and that essentially all measured bioenergetic functions of
          organisms, e.g., skin electrical resistivity as measured in
          humans at hundreds of points on the hands, demonstrate an
          internal coherence predictive and therefore indicative of
          health. Normative self-validating measurement of coherence
          (cf. L. Edwards) in the functioning of cymatic structures is
          therefore incorporated as a monitoring and feedback control
          criterion of a preferred embodiment of the invention. Popp

          [0013] Thomas E. Bearden, a career research scientist (US
          Army, retired), wrote the book on Energy from the Vacuum
          (2002). His paper on Giant Negentropy from the Common Dipole
          provides a physical science foundation for the Schauberger
          effect which in its higher order gauge symmetry application
          appears consistent with W. A. Tiller's description of a
          second, more psychoenergetically malleable level of the
          physical world access to which depends on an engineerable
          coupling function. Bearden's presentation of a corrected and
          extended physics, taken together with technology which
          demonstrates it (Patrick et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,362,718, MEG)
          provides with Schauberger's work the basis in the present
          invention justifying a the strategic objective of a water
          cleaning design for power plants which can be upgraded and
          modified functionally over time to increase net energy
          production process efficiencies so as to enable combustibles
          to be reduced and eventually phased out. Bearden's
          scientific-historical apparatus also provides a point of
          comparison with Tiller for quantitative modeling of
          conditioned space effects incorporated as a functional energy
          control option within the invention.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b>[0014] Ernst von Bezold published on the BDnow!
          Agricultural email list (2001), a description which then was
          archived by colorado.edu, of a class of technologies, i.e.,
          using shapes combined with rhythmitized materials, based in
          part on L. Edwards' work on shapes applied to the functional
          renewal, by applying a thin coating of rhythmitized copper
          ointment (a therapeutic preparation manufactured by, e.g.,
          Wala or Weleda in Europe, and Merkhur Laboratories in Canada,
          whose detailed experimental scientific basis is referenced by
          R. Hauschka), of cow horns used in bio-dynamic agriculture,
          e.g., in making manure or powdered quartz preparations. The
          principle of cohering shape and material, intensified by
          rhythmical treatment of the material (treatment such as may
          also be found in N. Tesla's purple plates, evidently in the
          Austrian Johannes Grander's water treatment technology, or in
          more recent "scalar"-resonant liquid treatment vessels and
          jewelry) has a parallel in the technology of the great pyramid
          at Giza and an extension in the biogeometry of A. Kareem as
          and as presented by R. Gilbert, et al. As described earlier in
          relation to Edwards' work, this principle is applied here with
          respect to optimised vortex shaping (cf. Edwards) and
          material, in this case water, formed and controlled
          cymatically, with psychoenergetic system control enhancement,
          and eventually, generation.<br>

          [0015] William A. Tiller, former department chair and
          professor emeritus of material science and engineering at
          Stanford University, wrote Psychoenergetic Science as a
          simplification and compilation of three previous related
          volumes documenting 30 years of paradigm-shifting experimental
          science on the demonstrable, potential, and instrumentally
          engineerable enhancement of, the integral functional
          contribution of consciousness to the matter-energy equilibrium
          of the object-oriented physical science paradigm presently
          being transformed by the more interactive understanding of
          reality shown in quantum physics being applied in such diverse
          fields such as cryptography, quantum computing and
          psychoneuroimmunologic therapies. Tiller's empirical work on
          space conditioning for process modulation, together with his
          work and that of Vogel on experimenter training for
          replicability (cf. Charles Tart, "state-specific science")
          applies and extends the implications of the Indian preceptor
          Patanjali (ca, 8thcentury) in a unique and distinctly
          instrumentally modern, scientifically verified and
          technologically accessible form. The invention applies both
          the trained-operator effect and the instrument-mediated
          spacial conditioning effects to control and enhance multimodal
          cymatic processing and to and anticipate its transformative
          progression in part as an operator-initiated and controlled
          activity with corresponding strategic extension of options of
          scope and scale of application.<br>

            BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>[0027] Essentially, and without limitation of this
          description to its application in an illustrative preferred
          embodiment, a cymatic (3- or higher-dimensional Chladni
          figure-generating) resonant vibrational process is used to
          induce a rotating standing wave figure in a fluid, such as
          water, air, plasma, or a slurry including solids, producing a
          centripetal vortex or vortex of vortices which passing inward
          through the focus of the tip unwinds from its tip in the same
          or by induction in an opposite rotation, or meets another
          incoming vortex tip or tips, at the juncture comprising the
          tip(s) focus producing differentiable active and potential
          energetic outputs, and from the focus a likewise
          differentiable outflow of materials in directions primarily
          other than that of the axis of tip focus, such as transverse,
          of least resistance as shaped and sorted within transporting
          flows of standing waves e.g., whose node-antinode frequencies,
          amplitudes and spacial configurations are appropriately
          resonant with selected materials and material-energetic
          configurations. The forming and modulation of the form may be
          by external or internal, direct or interferometrically
          induced, multimodal electro-magneto-gravitic-opto-acoustic and
          scalar potential drivers controlled by feedback of functional
          parameters of the manipulated material flow and feedback of
          the driving energy inputs and their energetic transforms, and
          having regard to macroenvironmental conditional-probability
          fluctuations, e.g., in turbulent flow, and, in early
          embodiments, being fine tuned-later, consequent on operator
          learning based on feedback with the system as an instrument of
          learning, increasingly being generated-by operator interaction
          directly (Vogel), or indirectly using conditioned space effect
          technology (Tiller) amplification-modulation or other higher
          gauge broken symmetry operations (Bearden), to bias threshold
          condition probabilities favourably in respect of intended
          states of the system.<br>

            "built" complex vortex structures which may be characterised
            as dynamically stable n-dimensional "standing wave"
            structures. The example is of a collinear pair of complex
            vortices shown in oblique cross-section; to the left in the
            figure is appended a dotted-line indicator of a contiguous,
            expansion-contraction vortex figure such as may be found in
            FIG. 1 with a second point of maximal vortex centripetal
            concentration, as may also be seen in FIG. 4(f). This vortex
            meeting, or transition, point is a focal region of energy
            concentration and release which as a focal point of
            modulation (depending also on vortex spin directions) can be
            used to amplify the modulating signal's effect in the
            centrifugal or expansive phase or, respectively depending on
            vortex spin directions, to modulate energy released along
            another vector from the focal region; for a naturalesque
            example; see FIG. 1.<br>
            <br>
            [0034] FIG. 4 note: Such sets of vortices can be
            concatenated in various geometries-linearly, in rings,
            nested, etc.-as information energy and materials handling
            and transformation structures, e.g., in the processing of
            water of whatever phase, and gases or other materials, of
            energy, and of information, associated with combustion, of
            coal, etc; with other manufacture of energy and of material
            substance in preferred composition, form, state, and the
            production of purposed information-rich structures or forms
            and structures or forms for processing information; with the
            sensing or other collection, processing, communication of
            information and associated energetic and material entities,
            e.g., as information carriers, viz., modulating and as
            modulators, locally and nonlocally, for example using
            functionally entrained (i.e., resonantly tuned) nonlocally
            paired single or doubled (for energetic balance) sets of
            more or less triple vortices, e.g., three-dimensionally
            depending on intended function, which are monitored and
            modulated at the origin (see 4(e) below), e.g., using one or
            more members of the class of modulators listed above,
            especially operator- or user-specifiable modulators, to
            enable transfer of informational, energetic, material
            pattern momentum between the nonlocally paired vortex sets,
            in order to facilitate convenient transfer of
            process-related patterning for the effective replication of
            data, of energy states, or transfer under competent
            operation conditions of low-dimensional-number patterns that
            act as localizing carriers for higher-dimensionally-resonant
            homeostatic structural fields and their associated states,
            i.e., principally in living organisms. The same principle
            can be applied reflexively to enhance holotropic pattern
            stability of organisms with respect to an
            operator-programmable template field; e.g., as two examples
            among many, for conservation and improvement of biotic
            function and its patterned energetic basis using an
            algorithmically-controlled amplifier to enhance food
            stability and therefore conservation or to support healing
            based on modulation of a resonantly shaped and directed
            energy flow using a reflexively applied template which is
            functionally operator-enhanced.<br>

            DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>[0036] The present invention now will be described more
          fully with reference to the general inventive concept, and to
          illustrate embodiments of the invention. As this invention may
          be embodied in many different forms, its scope should not be
          construed as limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth;
          rather, the examples are provided to indicate a scope of
          potential preferred embodiments to those skilled in the art.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] The present invention of a system of methods to handle
          information, energy and materials and to modify their
          properties relates to the modification by manipulation
          iteratively (including but not limited to, in particular,
          recursively; the term "iteratively" is so used throughout),
          simultaneously and prospectively or retrospectively, of the
          potential and manifest energetic, temporal and spacial
          coordinate, motional and orientational, coherence and
          informational or entropic status, dimensionality including but
          not limited to metric (dimensional curvature), combination or
          dissociation, of materials in amounts and states ranging from
          particle to compound and bulk mass, including but not limited
          to plasma, gas, solid and liquid states singly, intermixed or
          combined, making use of one or a coordinated combination
          (including but not limited to, as the case may be, ordered
          combination, i.e., permutation; "combination" is so used as an
          inclusive term, throughout) of more than one structure and
          system of vibration and resonance of material or energetic
          shape, including but not limited to environmental Zeitgebers
          or related factors or their artificial analogues, in a
          feedback or resonance-controlled manner permitting dynamically
          active, i.e., reflexively, iteratively and synchronically
          varying differentiation, integration, transformation including
          but not limited to metamorphosis or conversion from one state
          to another, of informational, energetic and associated
          material states, systems, forms and entities.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] The invention consists of a unimodal or multimodal
          integrated system of methods as outlined here to handle
          information, energy and material and modify their properties,
          including but not limited to local and nonlocal interaction,
          patterning and coherence.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] An example of a class of embodiments is as it relates
          to communication of information, energy and material,
          particularly between the holographic sub-quantum and
          quantum-level entrainment and cross-modulation of
          asymptotically and hyperbolically n-dimensionally
          pattern-matched, e.g., including but not limited to in
          particular functionally synchronous nonlocal, systems of
          information, energy and material.<br>
          <br>
          [0040] Another example of a class of embodiments is as it
          relates to holotropically "self"-similar precursorial
          re-equilibration of organisms and entities, including but not
          limited to in particular their energetic (viz. their
          persisting or durable sub- and quantum-resonant) template or
          formative pattern in a range of applications from medicine to
          physical device and structures maintenance, to re-establish a
          proximal functional and structural wholeness at a higher level
          of holistic functional coherence, in particular also therefore
          to re-tune them optimally with and to a resonant pattern of
          macro-environmentally current syntropy with its accessible
          dimensional and nondimensional substates. "Vis medicatrix
          naturae per facultatem formatrix": i.e., re-tune organism to
          their archetypal (basic, healthy) formative patterns in
          harmony with the macrobiosphere, "The healing life of nature
          [accessed] through the formative faculty".<br>
          <br>
          [0041] An example of a class of embodiments preferable for
          their obviously immediately beneficial and pertinent
          application relates principally to the energies and material
          substance associated with solids, with liquid and gaseous
          fluids and solids associated with them; to plasma, and
          associated quantum-energetic (viz., respectively,
          subquantum-energetic, i.e., including but not limited to, in
          particular, ["quantum"-]nonlocally entrained
          energetic-potential such as so-called zero-point) states.<br>
          <br>
          [0042] A specific application in this class of embodiment is
          its use for the pre-, real-time ongoing, and post-treatment of
          fluids, in particular, water and gases including but not
          limited to related particulates, associated with combustion,
          in the processing, particularly the cleaning, of pre-,
          combusting and post-combustion gases, in particular,
          respectively, gaseous/ified combustants, products and proximal
          energy, materials and energetic patterns associated with
          combustion of e.g., hydrocarbons such as coal; by the use
          singly and in combinations; continuously, and discontinuously,
          through design-resonant, or forced pulsation inducing
          turbulence, pulsation, cavitation; of physical-structurally,
          or energetically, e.g., acoustically; magnetically; etc.;
          functionally spiraling, e.g., spirally-fluted piping, pathways
          which may be used to induce or facilitate; optionally with 2,
          3 or more dimensional Chladni-figure, i.e., cymatic,
          dynamically shifting resonance/feedback-controlled
          electro-magneto-gravitic-levitatory-opto-acoustic-temporal-spacial
          standing-wave patterns, including but not limited to scalar
          Whittaker fine structure signaling particularly for thermal
          behaviour control of materials, and application of Grander and
          Tiller field-effect systems; and also, optionally with a class
          of directly operator-driven phenomena, e.g., Keely-effect,
          Vogel-method or "Hutchison-effect" induction;<br>
          <br>
          [0043] to condense or rarefy and drive spacially, i.e., to
          segregate, mix, react, shape, etc., said fluids, viz. gases
          and their constituent and included substances including but
          not limited to precipitates, elements and compounds to be
          formed or dissociated, fractionated out, otherwise modified,
          and to assist in the production of energy; especially, in
          particular, where certain forms are approached or striven for
          or referenced, such as the mean as well as ideal value cycloid
          space curve families described by Lawrence Edwards in the life
          of nature, materials in these forms being evidently energizing
          resonant transducers of water quality renewal and related
          effects; and forms such as the bio-geometrically-analysed
          designs-e.g., concavities in structures, such as, e.g. a
          gradual half-degree indentation of each of the outer upper
          surfaces of the Great Pyramid at Giza used to induce
          "horizontal negative green", and other, cone-pendulum-response
          states as presented and described by A. Kareem, R. Gilbert and
          others-which may be favourable or conducive to the improvement
          of informational content, energy and material, e.g., i.e., in
          this case of quality of water and gases and their forms and
          behaviours, especially combustion-associated gases and water
          in whatever phase, and of their environment, and of related
          cleansing, reactive or structural-energetic-chemical including
          but not limited to biochemical stabilizing activity in this
          setting as well as in other settings such as biochemical
          cleansing, stabilisation, renewal of living organisms, their
          environment and precedents including but not limited to inputs
          and succedents including but not limited to outputs.<br>
          <br>
          [0044] Modulation preferentially may be varied in feedback,
          resonantly simultaneous with, or preceding (e.g., within
          entrainment parameter values range) synchrony with,
          environmental Zeitgebers and their measures, e.g., using
          rhythmitized shapes (rhythmitised shaping functions in classes
          such as that of the Great pyramid, cow horns and other natural
          structures as resonators, described as mathematical function
          classes by L. Edwards), with respect to the patterns shown by
          astronomical ephemerides, and the mathematical descriptions
          of, in particular, planes and other shapes or figures formed
          among massive bodies during their transits, by astronomically
          related variations in the values of the tensor Tau sub jk and
          associated described functions including but not limited to
          those identified by G. Unger of Dornach, Switzerland, and by
          associated indicators; to optimise negentropic as well as
          entropic functions severally and in combination.<br>
          <br>
          [0045] A specific class of instances of this kind of
          embodiment would utilise rotating multimodal fields and
          resonant "radiative" and "field" effects, whether by gross
          energetic induction as described or by resonant rhythmitised
          shaping or by indirect Tiller-type or directly
          operator-programmed tuning or combinations to induce
          essentially, preferably by means without moving parts,<br>

          water;<br>
          <br>
          [0047] pre-cleaning and conditioning of gases; including but
          not limited to, for both water and combustion-related gases,
          electrical or other energetic charging or programming, e.g.,
          magnetic induction of appropriate coherent spin and precession
          of particles and other structures, e.g., hydrogen proton
          precession;<br>

          based on the work of Viktor Schauberger, Theodor Schwenk and
          others, centripetal as well as, as may be useful or conducive
          in application, centrifugal, and alternating
          centripetal/centrifugal, with "braiding" of flows to
          facilitate blending-respectively separation of succedent
          materials and states-of spiraling gases and water; leading to
          improved mixing, modification and separation of materials, and
          improved control of energy production, improved cleansing and
          production of associated materials in usable higher quality
          lower cost form than might otherwise be the case;<br>

          seq., especially for real-time process- and flow-control

          [0050] modification of the foregoing and of other processes,
          states and conditions through operator-controlled intent and
          concentration of energies, indirectly by programmable-unit
          Tiller "field effect" action, viz. gauge-symmetry level
          modulation, as well as directly, including but not limited to
          Keely-technology and Vogel-methodology effects.<br>
          <br>
          [0051] An example of a design which preferably embodies
          elements of the foregoing in an application to facilitate
          production of clean combustion by-products of coal and of
          other combustibles or pre-combustible feedstocks and their
          combustion processing materials and systems, the materials
          being principally water and air, with an optimal net
          production of environmentally life-enhancing (i.e., also
          therefore, minimally life-degrading) quality and quantity of
          energy, material and information especially bioinformation, is
          as follows:<br>
          <br>
          [0052] Iteratively, and by resonance including but not limited
          to pre-emptive or pattern-anticipatory entrainment-leveraging
          e.g., phase-lock, signaling,<br>
          <br>
          [0053] 1. Form water and gas flows architecturally, i.e.,
          physical-structurally using the patented and unpatented built
          as well as the designed examples from among: R. Steiner;
          especially, V. Schauberger with numerous illustrations of
          examples in patents and other literature to be cited; T.
          Schwenk; J. Grander; and for informational, energetic and
          materials modulating effects using shaped rhythmitised
          materials, E. von Bezold (2001); and, by means of a "complex"
          vortex, i.e., a set of complex vortices each comprised of
          multiple vortices arranged in groups as dynamically stable
          standing-wave "cells", the focal point of each of which may
          centre on and be contiguous with the focal point of a
          corresponding collinear vortex whose mouth is pointed in the
          opposite direction to the first, or with the focal points of a
          number of vortices dynamically balanced energetically and in
          space, all with one another.<br>

          approximation as exemplified in the foregoing paragraph,
          vibrationally by tuned coherent energetic induction and
          modulation magnetically/diamagnetically,
          opto-acoustically-thermally using dynamic Chladni-figure
          standing-wave vortices, i.e., after the cymatics of H. Jenny
          et. al.-also approached by the flow forms of Wilkes,
          articulated by A. Husemann and others, also alluded to
          mathematically by G. Adams, by P. Forchheimer, later by T.
          Schwenk (1954) who cites I Prigogine in the context of
          sensitive control-response; discussed mathematically by R.
          Abram and concurrently and subsequently especially in the work
          of L. Edwards-in the classes of shapes expressed
          mathematically by L. Edwards (1993) who provides calculation
          methods, computer software and diagrammatic illustrations:
          oscillating, varying, within and around syntropic, life optima
          "antenna" shapes, e.g., mean as well as ideal shapes, tuned
          over time to work with principal macro-environmental
          (Zeitgeber) rhythms; and transformed (e.g., by rotation and by
          translation in flow, e.g., induced acoustically or by
          optically-tunnelled electromagnetic radiation, e.g.,
          amplitude-, frequency- and waveform-specific light, such as
          squeezed light or other coherent as well as incoherent light)
          metrically and physico-chemically, pulsated, and otherwise
          modulated to induce enhanced laminar flow, controlled
          turbulence, and cavitation-reformative collapse cycles,
          including but not limited to cycles that are rhythmically-
          i.e. resonantly-enhanced; and further to modulate the
          sensitive, cf. T. Schwenk, non-equilibrium, cf. I. Prigogine,
          self-organising activity.<br>
          <br>
          [0055] 3. Concurrently, modify the processes locally and
          globally, in part and in whole, using as appropriate the means
          described in 1. and 2., and other available signalling
          energizing systems as modulators for the above control systems
          and as net additional inputs and, as appropriate, use
          energetic outputs to be fed back into the system as
          controlling modulators; including but not limited to, as
          examples, electrostatic dispersion; complementary electrical
          charging; electrolysis; magnetic, endo/exothermal, other emf
          or energetic treatment including but not limited to
          macroenvironmental signals, unamplified and amplified; to,
          e.g., increase, maintain or reduce solubility; flow formation,
          as described above, to enliven fluids; centripetal cyclones,
          compression vortex mixing and transformation of inputs, e.g.,
          vortical compression wave precipitation threshold
          modification; space state, time state and information

      acupuncture) and electrical (thermal, laser, electromagnetic and
      magnetic).<br>
      <br>
      The basis of the method is the normalization of neuroendocrine
      activity and directed the development of immuno-protective
      properties of the body's local and general character.<br>
      <br>
      The method has a wide range of preventive and curative actions,
      efficient, creates preconditions for the treatment of various
      diseases by following local impacts on the affected organs and
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      This method is taken as a prototype.<br>
      <br>
      However, its disadvantage is that the diameter of the biologically
      active points is changed depending on the person.<br>
      <br>
      So, while you sleep and extreme fatigue point of a diameter of
      less than 1 mm, and when the person wakes up, the diameter of the
      points is increased to 1 cm in a state of emotional stress and
      acute illnesses area so the individual points increases, which
      results in the entire areas with high conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      And if in acute pain syndromes even near miss needle produces a
      therapeutic effect, that in chronic diseases should be very
      careful to look for the desired points.<br>
      <br>
      Another approach to the development of processes for the impact of
      reflexology, free from the above drawbacks, based on the
      representation of ancient Oriental physicians that all the
      constituent bases of functioning of the body are connected by a
      system of so-called "meridians" (channels) that combine the "main
      bodies" to all parts of the body and "outer bodies" including
      skin.<br>
      <br>
      This communication system is manifested in the exchange of energy
      between the internal and external bodies, which flows along
      well-defined paths are referred to as internal and external paths
      meridians and collaterals.<br>
      <br>
      This concept was laid in ancient principles of treatment, with the
      "main bodies" were seen as a cause of disease, and the skin as an
      arena of foreign symptoms.<br>
      The doctrine of the meridians reflects the understanding of the
      ways in communication structures and functions of the whole
      organism both in normal and in disease, and is closely associated
      with the doctrine of vital energy.<br>
      <br>
      According to ancient Eastern concepts, the body contains 14 "core"
      of the meridians with a strict localization and perform the
      following functions: providing a link between man and the
      environment, control the flow of blood and vital energy,
      revitalize the muscles and bones, joints facilitate the work,
      carry out the harmony of yin and yang, pass energy from an
      internal organ to cover the body, so that the internal signals of
      the disease reaches the surface of the body. 14 main meridians
      form 14 permanent functional community, ensuring the harmony of
      yin (inner core syndrome) and yang (the surface of the main
      syndrome).<br>
      However, in the case of chronic disease processes are
      significantly reduced when the body's defenses, impaired
      circulation of energy in several regular meridians in the body are
      formed path of excretion of excess energy capacity and reduce the
      severity of harmful stress on the skin covered by the damaged
      eight major meridians non-permanent meridians, so-called "vessels
      may" ("miraculous meridians").<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the 14 "core" and 8 "wonderful" meridians there are
      another 12 muscle-tendon or muscle-joint meridians.<br>
      <br>
      They bring together the muscles and tendons, all of them connected
      to the main meridians, the trajectory of which he more or less
      repeats.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast to the main meridian muscle-tendon meridian has a
      wider "path" that runs superficially.<br>
      <br>
      However, some of the muscle-tendon meridians, and have inner
      portions of its trajectory, even though they are not related to
      the internal organs.<br>
      <br>
      Topography of muscle-tendon meridians, and how to influence them
      in the medical and therapeutic purposes, one of which was the
      prototype of the method of the invention are presented in the book
      Gavaa Luvsan "Essays on the eastern methods of reflexology",
      Novosibirsk, Nauka, 1991 p 55-178.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 and 2 are examples of the passage of two muscle-tendon
      meridians.<br>
      <br>
      Acting through massage on reflex caused by changes in the skin,
      muscles, tendons, we can normalize the functioning of the internal
      organ.<br>
      <br>
      When massaging the proposed use special sticks of wood, metal,
      ivory, metal hook with rubber or cloth tip (when massaging
      pixels), a glass jar (with a massage the skin).<br>
      <br>
      However, any of the types of massage excluded acute inflammatory
      phases of any location that limits the range of preventive and
      therapeutic effect of this method.<br>
      The aim of the invention to provide a method with a wide range of
      preventive and therapeutic effect, increase therapeutic effect,
      reducing procedure time.<br>
      <br>
      This goal is achieved by determining the path musculo-tendinous
      meridian responsible for the pathological process wetted surface
      area of ??skin onto which the meridian selected and carried out on
      the combined effect of the acoustic and he magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The starting premise of the method is the existence of a body of
      biologically active complex multi-loop automatic control system
      (Basar) of his life (see prototype), morphological substrate,
      which is the connective tissue.<br>
      <br>
      The method consists in the stimulation of receptors and receptor
      zones and focused reflex reactions occur, i.e. the external
      acoustic effect and the magnetic field is converted into a signal
      for Basariya.<br>
      <br>
      Basar operates in conjunction with the nervous, circulatory and
      lymphatic systems, supporting gomeostatokinez in subsystems in
      accordance with the functions carried out by these subsystems.<br>
      <br>
      In the case where the disturbance of external or internal
      temperature exceeds the ability of regulatory systems mentioned
      above, there is a pathological process in a first subsystem, and
      then its associated embryogenetic topographically physiologically
      and subsystems associated with these or other areas of activity.<br>
      <br>
      Through the combined effect of the acoustic pressure and the
      magnetic field in the area of ??muscle-tendon meridians is setting
      and the introduction of a regime of self-subsystems Basar,
      regulatory capabilities have been violated by any pathology.<br>
      <br>
      The method is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      Based on preliminary examination in laboratory and clinical
      specificity is determined that the patient's complaints of 12
      musculotendinous meridians, which is directly connected to the
      main meridian is responsible for the pathological process, and if
      a prevention is promising to produce a therapeutic effect.<br>
      <br>
      You can use the recommendations given in Chapter 3 of the book G.
      Luvsan "Essays on the eastern methods of reflexology", page
      181-198.<br>
      <br>
      The surface of the skin, which is the projection chosen for the
      impact of muscle-tendon meridian, wetted with liquid (water, drug
      solution).<br>
      <br>
      Next, the surface of the skin touch the radiator forming a complex
      acoustic and magnetic radiation and smooth stroking movements, it
      is moved along the muscle-tendon meridian.<br>
      <br>
      The dosage and time of exposure is determined by the purpose for
      which produce effects or prevention, in the absence of any
      clinical signs or treatment of any disease process.<br>
      <br>
      As the source of the combined acoustic and electromagnetic
      radiation can be used for reflexotherapy device which is the
      subject of the present invention according to claim 2.<br>
      <br>
      The proposed method was tested in a clinical setting and its
      effectiveness can be demonstrated by the following examples.<br>
      <br>
      Prevention sessions were conducted (2 to 10 a duration of 10 min)
      in the absence of any physical changes and the emergence of
      irritability, insomnia, tearfulness, heaviness in the head and
      weakness in the hands of the computer operators at the age of 25
      to 30 years (10 people ), whose work is associated with prolonged
      stress of the hands combined with eye strain and exposure to
      external radiation.<br>
      <br>
      All 10 people was conducted on the impact zone of muscle-tendon
      meridian according to the scheme shown in Fig. 1.<br>
      <br>
      Six patients, operating at elevated physical activity in
      combination with thermal effect in dry air with reduced oxygen
      content (foundry) developed the so-called&nbsp; "fatigue syndrome"
      in the absence of any physical changes.<br>
      <br>
      In order to effect removal of the syndrome performed by the
      musculo-tendinous meridian in accordance with the diagram in Fig.
      2 for 5-10 sessions of 20 minutes. In the first and second case,
      relieves stress in the joints and muscles, improved sleep, mood,
      attention and increased efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Recurrence of deterioration of health for six months were
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      The application of a magnetic acoustic stimulation method has also
      been established that he has a good therapeutic effect in other
      diseases of the peripheral nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      Noted the positive effect of anemia (hemoglobin rises, normal
      blood counts).<br>
      <br>
      The advantages of this method is its effectiveness as a result of
      penetrating effect and stability of exposure, no contraindications
      in acute stages of inflammatory processes, easy to use, since it
      does not require the use of specially equipped facilities, such as
      in laser reflex.<br>
      <br>
      The above method development and maintenance of adaptive
      environmental factors shared by the impact of acoustic and
      magnetic field radiation on muscle-tendon meridians may be used
      alone or in combination with other methods of therapeutic
      intervention, as well as enter in the framework of systemic method
      to reveal the mechanism and treatment of many diseases .<br>
      <br>
      The implementation of the proposed method is possible using the
      claimed in claim 2 devices reflexology forming the necessary range
      of radiation exposure to the biological object.<br>
      <br>
      A method and apparatus are interconnected by a single inventive
      idea and therefore a group of inventions united.<br>
      <br>
      The closest to the type of reflex action and achieved therapeutic
      effect of acupuncture is a device that is protected by copyright
      certificate N 1215699, MKIA 61 H 39/00, which is taken as a
      prototype.<br>
      <br>
      It includes a sensor, amplifier, magnetic interference (external
      oscillator), a body which has a frame with a coil and a magnetic
      core, which is a working body, a comparator, the delay unit and
      the switch, as well as a gas source connected to the unit of
      magnetic influence through air hoses, with This switch is
      connected to the comparator unit and the solenoid-magnetic
      interference.<br>
      <br>
      Working body in the hollow core unit is placed inside the frame to
      the coil.<br>
      <br>
      The device provides a point of impact on the acupuncture pulse
      magnetic field and the gas pressure.<br>
      <br>
      The described device is cumbersome because it requires a fixed or
      portable gas source and auxiliary communications as Pneumohoses as
      different sources of magnetic interference and pressure.<br>
      <br>
      The aim of the invention to provide a compact device for
      reflexotherapy having a wide range of reflex effects due to the
      combined effects of the biological object acoustic pressure and a
      magnetic field whose frequency can be selected from a wide range.<br>
      <br>
      This object is achieved in that the device for reflexotherapy
      comprising a housing mounted in a coil with a core and a control
      circuit comprising a power source introduced two additional
      permanent magnet, one of which is movably mounted, the core is a
      rod of magnetostrictive material, as in the scheme Control
      administered serially connected frequency synthesizer coupled to
      the power source and a power amplifier whose output is connected
      to the coil and a second input of the power supply.<br>
      <br>
      In order to cover the entire frequency range of the acoustic
      radiation, to allow individual selection of the optimal frequency
      of exposure rod is replaceable, but to ensure optimal mechanical
      output power is adjustable mode magnetostrictive rod by an
      additional bias, which introduced two permanent magnets, one of
      which is movable .<br>
      <br>
      The invention consists in that the working device body - rod of
      magnetostrictive material, placed in an alternating magnetic
      field, the action it can excite the longitudinal vibrations of
      sonic frequency band having the waveform of the rod relative to
      the face.<br>
      <br>
      This is a known position is confirmed by the test report device.<br>
      <br>
      It was also noted that the emission of acoustic band accompanied
      by a magnetic radiation, since the magnetic flux flowing in the
      rod broken.<br>

      <br>
      The apparatus schematically shown in Fig. 3 consists of one
      frequency synthesizer, a power amplifier 2, 3 remote transmitter
      and a power source 4.<br>
      Yield synthesizer 1 is connected to a first input of a power
      amplifier 2, the output of which is connected to the input
      transducer.<br>
      <br>
      Keyboard entry to 1 and a second input of the power amplifier 2 is
      connected first and second outputs of the power supply 4.<br>
      <br>
      The frequency synthesizer 1 may be the circuit shown in FIG. 4 and
      consists of a highly stable pulse generator 5 formed on the chip
      type quartz-stabilized K531LA12 ZQ, frequency divider and a buffer
      stage 7.<br>
      <br>
      The requirement of high stability is determined by the fact that
      the magnetostrictive response in the working body has a very
      narrow band.<br>
      <br>
      Frequency divider is made by a standard scheme for chips and
      K531TM2 K555IE7 with divider ratio varies from 1 to 1000, on-chip
      buffer stage K531LA12 and transistor emitter follower mode.<br>
      <br>
      The power amplifier made on a double-ended emitter follower.<br>
      <br>
      The power supply converts the primary voltage of the power supply
      units with the ability to adjust.<br>
      <br>
      Remote transducer 3 formed in the body 8 comprises a working body
      9 is a rod of magnetostrictive material (nickel alloy R37,
      permendyus, alsifer ferrite etc.) of an arbitrary cross section
      (circle, ellipse, square, rectangle).<br>
      <br>
      Rod length determines the frequency of the magnetostrictive
      resonance and therefore he made interchangeable.<br>
      <br>
      In order to avoid influence on the radiation power of radial
      pressure on the rod side fasteners loosely accommodated in the
      housing 8 and the coil 10 is fixed on the loss elastic sleeve 13
      and the longitudinal movement of the elastic stop 14.<br>
      <br>
      As the elastic material can be used latex, rubber, sponge rubber,
      etc.<br>
      <br>
      The inductor 10 generates an alternating magnetic field, and fixed
      11 and 12 movable permanent magnets create the radiator variable
      dc magnetic field. The moving magnet provides an optimal bias.<br>
      <br>
      In order to create a uniform magnetic field of the magnets have an
      annular shape.<br>
      <br>
      Operation is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      When activated, the master oscillator generates a sequence of 5
      pulses, repetition rate which is determined by the selected
      quartz.<br>
      <br>
      The pulses are supplied to divider where their frequency reduced
      to 1-1000 times, amplified in a power amplifier and input to the
      transmitter (the input coil).<br>
      <br>
      Under the influence of the current flowing in the coil, an
      alternating magnetic field whose magnetic field lines cross the
      longitudinal direction of the rod of magnetostrictive material,
      the resonance frequency is defined by its geometrical parameters
      coincides with the pulse signal frequency.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, the free end of the rod having a non-bound
      mechanical vibration acoustic frequency range, which are
      accompanied by a magnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic field, and consequently, the power of mechanical
      vibration is determined by the current flowing in the coil and can
      be adjusted, first, by displacement along the longitudinal axis of
      the permanent magnet body, and secondly varying the amplitude of
      the pulse voltage by adjustment of the amplifier capacity.<br>
      <br>
      When changing its working body also produced the change in
      frequency of the master oscillator.<br>
      <br>
      Turning the device is turning on the power supply. Start-up time
      unit for work no more than 1 min.<br>
      <br>
      Use of the device for implementing reflex action in accordance
      with the description of the method according to claim 1.<br>
      <br>
      When you touch the surface of the skin of the patient butt working
      body device is acoustic impact, similar to the impact of the
      method of massage with the simultaneous effect of a magnetic
      field.<br>
      <br>
      The proposed device has a high effect of reflexology therapeutic
      effects by combining the effects of two types of action.<br>
      <br>
      By setting the amount of exposure accuracy and stability.<br>
      <br>
      Also, due to the possibility of individual selection of the
      optimal frequency of exposure.<br>
      <br>
      The device is compact, easy to use, simple to manufacture.<br>
