          <h4><big>Notes from Count Stefan Walewski's Manuscript</big></h4>
        </span></div>
      <span class="contentsText"><big> </big>The method used in Ancient
        Egypt for strengthening energy flows within a human body is
        shown on the figures demonstrating the second Master-Arkan (see
        diagram below). Two rods are clutched in the hands of this
        standing figure.They are clutched with strength, creating an
        electrical conduit. The hands, holding the rods tightly, free
        this energy within the body to gather it in unipolar knots and
        in spinal fluid. The renewal of energetic potential is one 100%
        and continues for 24 hours. <br>
        <br>
        There were two rods with different chemical compositions. The
        first one was usually made for the right hand (the Sun Rod) and
        another one for the left hand (the Moon Rod). The Moon rod
        serves as a catalyst which strengthens the activity of the Sun
        rod. These rods of power were known long ago, yet the secret of
        their construction was known only to a few initiates. <br>
        <br>
        The Rods, which records indicate that the Pharaohs held during
        their entire life, harmonized their two main energetic streams,
        Yin and Yang. Yin-Yang are two energy flows or principles,
        opposite and unified, different and homogenous at the same time.
        In constant association and interaction within the person,
        Yin-Yang are the two sources of vital energy. When they are
        properly interacting, the body's vital functions are supported
        and a person exists without any special problems. The Ancient
        Egyptians used the Rods with different fillings to regulate the
        energetic balance of one's body.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span class="italic">We offer you the paragraphs from his
        facsimile manuscript: <span style="font-style: italic;">The

      <h4>Restoration of Nervous Energy</h4>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"> "IX L ARCANE. Recharging
        nervous energy.</span> A way used in ancient Egypt for
      strengthening of currents of energy within the body. It was shown
      in the figures, using the second Master Arcane exercise. Two rods
      clasped in the hands of standing figures, were the grips of
      tremendous power, akin to electricity (secondary electricity),
      which when the grips were held in the hand released this energy
      into the body, to be stored in unipolar ganglias, and spinal
      fluid, raising the potential of energy 100%, and lasting for a day
      and a night, 24 hours.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="italic">"The rods were two in number and of different
        compositions. One generally to be used in the right, another in
        the left hand. One having the power of the Sun, another the
        power of the Moon. </span><br>

      'The Sun rod of Power is composed of hard coal (carbon) specially
      hardened, in which the structure of the molecules is changed the
      way the molecules of iron are changed when converting iron into
      magness. (To convert iron into magness, the structure of iron
      moecules is changed by re-crystallization process, hardening, then
      it will retain the magnetism.) The process of hardening is heating
      to high temperature and then instantly cooling by submerging in
      water. (The rods of bard coal prepared for the electric arc lamps
      are excellent as Sun rods of Power.)<br>
      <br>

      The mysterious metal (bronze) auricalcum has tremendous power, and
      is composed of five metals, each having a definite color, white,
      black, red, blue and yellow. It is radioactive, and it hides the
      mystery of immaculate conception. Proportion of the metals is
      even. Then comes electron, composed of gold and silver, (40% and
      60% silver), then a combination of silver 75% and zinc 25%;
      combination of copper and zinc, and also copper and tin. (Many
      combinations of bronze you can make figuring out planets and their
      relations and properties. Sun, gold; Moon, silver; Saturn, lead;
      Jupiter, tin; Mars, iron; Venus, copper; Mercury, mercury. Also
      minerals, coal, lode-stone, beryl, amber, tourmaline, rock crystal
      , hematite, etc. (Here text contains drawing of two figures rods,
      one figure is standing with a rod in each hand, one is sitting in
      the Egyptian meditation position, on a chair, back erect, feet
      flat on floor, hands on knees, with rods on knees. MM) The
      Egyptian master system postures for recharging the nervous energy,
      one should be relaxed and following the direction of the Sun.
      Objects shaped in different symbolic forms are also used
      throughout the world, like Babylonian maies (iron with silver
      inlay, with horned human head and head of the bull). In Tibet is
      used dorgee, etc."<br>

      This sculptural group symbolically reflects this phenomenon. The
      Yang cylinder is in the right hand of the god Horus. The male
      figure symbolizes the flow of Yang energy (the male principle).
      The deity is an embodiment of the energy plane. The Yin cylinder
      is in the left hand of the goddess Hathor, who represents the
      female principle, that is, the flow of Yin energy. In the center
      is the pharaoh with two energy-giving hands directed towards him.
      The use of these Rods considerably helped the pharaoh to correct
      his nervous system energy thereby benefiting the immune system.
      The Rods had a beneficial effect on his health and physical
      condition. The correct use of the Rods also enabled the pharaoh,
      or other user, to prepare himself for "Communion with the Gods".<span
        class="contentsText">
        <p>The cylinder for the right hand was made from copper and
          associated with the Sun (Yang). The cylinder for the left hand
          was made from zinc and associated with the Moon (Yin). To
          reinforce the properties of the cylinders, gold was added to
          the copper in the appropriate proportion, which is why the
          "Sun Cylinder" was also called the "Gold Cylinder". Silver was
          added to the "Moon Cylinder", which was accordingly called the
          "Silver Cylinder". These cylinders were produced in the
          proportions of the <em> Golden Section</em>. And their
          dimensions were based on the status of the given person's
          energy system, their health and also on the tasks being
          pursued.</p>

        <p>Placed within the Rods were minerals, often quartz crystals
          of different sizes, that were changed as the pharaoh made
          advances in the process of self-perfection or depending on the
          goal, health and energetic balance of the person working with
          the Rods. The filling in the initial phase was a fine-grained
          quartz, a special kind of white sand. The cylinders with white
          sand positively affect and activate a person's energetic
          streams. Next, the cylinders were filled with middle and
          coarse-grained quartz to achieve higher level of abilities.
          (These type of Rods we manufacture as "Rods Quartz") The next
          type of Rods contained quartz mono-crystals and were made for
          Priests, the masters of healing. The Rods would create a
          powerful energetic shield around the user, influencing the
          patient, harmonizing his energetic streams and allowing for
          coordination with signals from the master's mind. This type of
          the Rods we have named "Rods Crystal"<br>

      1. The Rods are two hollow cylinders, made of copper (for the
      right hand, Sun ) and of zinc (for the left hand, Moon ) with
      specific fillings for each type of Rod. The Rods' construction is
      based upon the manuscript of Count Walewsky.<br>
      <br>
      2. All of the outer and inner Rods' dimensions are produced
      according to the proportions of the Golden Section.<br>
      <br>
      3. The copper and zinc used for producing the cylinders are of
      very high quality.<br>
      <br>
      4. To improve efficiency of The Rods, all of the components used
      in manufacturing the cylinders are conditioned inside the Pyramid
      for a minimum 12- day cycle. The Pyramid creates a powerful
      structural field able to correct inter-atom distances.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- FIELD :
      medical and biological equipment, applicable for influence on the
      processes of human vital activity, as well as for treatment of
      various diseases by untraditional methods. <br>
      <br>
      SUBSTANCE : the stimulator has two electrodes made as hollow metal
      capsules of a permanent cross-section with a filter placed in the
      inner cavities, the cathode body is made of a copper alloy, and
      the anode is made of a zinc-containing alloy, containing nickel
      with silver, the proportion of nickel and silver contained in the
      alloy is selected from a series of relations 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 2:3,
      2:5, 3:2, 3:5, 3:8, 5:2, 5:3, 5:8, 8:3, 8:5. Each electrode may be
      made in the form of a regular prism. Both electrodes in
      cross-section are made round in the outer and/or inner contour, or
      have the shape of regular polygons, or have an elongated
      ellipsoid-like shape. The cathode contains coal as a filler in the
      form of a one-piece rod, or coal in large fractions. The anode
      contains as a filler a rod of iron or an alloy of iron and nickel.
      Both electrodes may contain as fillers crystals of quartz of
      different shape-monocrystals in the form of cylinders, prisms,
      crystals in the form of regular pyramids, flat prisms. <br>
      <br>
      EFFECT: expanded store of technical components used for correcting
      influence on the human organism, as well as enhanced efficiency of
      the effect of the stimulator on the human organism due to
      selection of the stimulator characteristics individually for every
      patient.<br>

      A study of the effectiveness of the Rods was carried out in April
      1993 and December 1995. Using modern equipment and the most
      advanced methods, a group of medical scientists from the
      Dzhanelidze First Aid Scientific Research Institute, St
      Petersburg, led by Dr. M.A. Nikulin, that were put forward for the
      Nobel Prize in 1990. A computer monitor displayed the data,
      received from the points, indicated the current internal organs'
      condition. The information was taken from the bio-active palm
      zones with the help of diagnostic methods. There were three
      stripes on the monitor: green - "organs' condition in order", red
      and blue - "disorder". For sure, everybody has it own particular
      dispersedness of these points: some of them are in the green zone,
      another outside it, thus it shows, that all of us have their
      disorders. Some minutes later people, holding the cylinders,
      experienced a little miracle: all of the points started to move
      towards the green zone.<br>
      <br>
      "...During the first few minutes people under test, holding the
      cylinders, experience a powerful pulse wave from the left side to
      the right one. A sensation of the vessels filling with blood is
      registered that has been named "the vascular stage" by
      researchers. Infrared radiation increases from the right upper
      limb, and then the thermal field at the limbs evens out. Together
      with these changes in the subject's organism, a general rise in
      activity is observed, accompanied by an 8-10 beats per minute
      increase in pulse-rate. By the second minute a warming of the
      cervico-thoracic section of the spinal column with increased
      infrared radiation was observed. It follows, then, that the whole
      of the vegetative nervous system is drawn into the process, and
      there is an energetic activation of the tissues of both the upper
      limbs, and the body as a whole. As a consequence the headache is
      alleviated and blood pressure tends towards the norm." -from the
      experimental record<br>
      <br>
      Dr M.A. Nikulin concluded the following: "When any pathologies
      within a human body are detected we observe a thermal asymmetry
      between the ill and healthy parts of the body. Held in hands, the
      cylinders equalize this thermal asymmetry, thus showing their
      therapeutic effect."<br>
      <br>
      The cylindrical Rods can be recommended for people suffering from:<br>
      <br>
      cardio-vascular diseases<br>
      early phase hypertension<br>
      neurotrophic disorders<br>
      diseases of the excretory systems<br>
      insomnia (and also as a means stress reduction &amp;
      arteriosclerosis prevention)<br>
      <br>
      When carrying out a number of targeting experiments, Dr. M.A.
      Blank, specialist of the Oncological Center in Pesochny,
      discovered that the influence of the Rods creates a special
      condition in the organism making it more efficient at
      self-healing. According to the researches' conclusions the
      cylinders' influence "transfers" the organism to such a harmonized
      state, when it is much easier for it to cope up with all the
      troubles within. "There is a parameter that characterizes the
      functioning of cells - the respiratory waves of cells. Oncological
      condition of the organism suppresses those respiratory waves, but
      the cylinders, on the contrary, improve that parameter. But cancer
      is an extremely serious "citadel"; you won't seize it with such
      gentle means. Perhaps, it is worth using like a preventive
      measure, but this conclusion requires additional researches. One
      thing is clear: where cancer makes things bad, the cylinders try
      to make them a little better." Dr. Blank sugge sts that the Rods
      be recommended as a preventive remedy for people with
      transcontinental syndrome, whose business is connected with
      flights from one time zone to another (pilots, sportsmen,
      tourists, long-distance drivers, etc.) and when asynchronous modes
      of internal and external organism work causes headache and
      weakness.<br>
      <br>
      The research, carried out in June 2000 by Polish bio-energetic
      doctors under the leadership of Marek Stavisky, showed that: "A
      surface of the zinc Rod radiates the ultraviolet spectrum. I use
      this spectrum for splitting the structures of malignant tumors and
      for freezing their activity. Another spectrum, that appears on the
      butt-end of the zinc Rod, is used for radiating the malignant
      tumors before operating." His studies show that the radiation
      provided only by the single zinc Rod can be successfully used for
      treating cancer. The set of the Rods-QUARTZ used in pair, provides
      the radiation that is effective for curing and for use by ill
      people for self-immune therapy.<br>
      <br>
      The complex research carried out by the International Shaping
      Federation in March-June 2000 discovered that the Rods can be
      effectively used for quick reduction of physical and nervous
      tension and physical and spiritual power recovery after working or
      training hard.<br>
      <br>
      Daily work with the Rods has a beneficial effect in cases of: - <br>
      <br>
      over-agitation and nervous disorders<br>
      problems with arterial pressure<br>
      vegeto-vascular disorders<br>
      normalize the functioning of the heart in cases of arrhythmia and
      neuroses<br>
      improve circulatory processes, with a beneficial effect on blood
      vessels<br>
      each pain in the joints in cases of arthritis and gout<br>
