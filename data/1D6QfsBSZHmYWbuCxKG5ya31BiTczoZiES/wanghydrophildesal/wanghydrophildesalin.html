          separate salt from water</b><br>
        <b>by Nick Lavars</b><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Current approaches to water desalination are tremendously
      expensive and energy-intensive, so the search is very much on for
      new technologies that can get the job done more efficiently.
      Scientists in Melbourne have put forward one rather promising
      solution, developing a new kind of system that heats up and
      purifies water using only the power of the Sun.<br>
      <br>
      The device was developed by scientists at Australia's Monash
      University, who say that water treatment accounts for around three
      percent of the world's energy supply. Like other researchers
      around the globe, they have turned to sunlight to try and lighten
      the load, this time directing it toward what is known as a solar
      steam generator.<br>
      <br>
      In simple terms, these devices concentrate sunlight onto a body of
      water, heating it up and causing it to evaporate. The resulting
      steam can then be used to drive turbines that produce electricity
      in concentrated solar power plants, perhaps sterilize medical
      equipment cheaply for the developing world, or simply to separate
      salt from water.<br>
      <br>
      But one problem with the lattermost application is that the salt
      tends to gather on the surface of the material, which makes it
      difficult to produce pure water. The Monash University researchers
      worked around this problem with an intricately designed solar
      steam generator that prevents the salt from spoiling the broth.<br>
      <br>
      It consists of a disc crafted from super-hydrophilic filter paper,
      a material that attracts water, which is coated with a layer of
      carbon nanotubes that convert sunlight into heat. Water is fed
      into the center of the disc via a simple cotton thread, where the
      heat turns it into steam that builds up on the disc while pushing
      the salt to the edge.<br>
      <br>
      In this way, the device removes almost 100 percent of salt from
      the water, a level that leader of the team Professor Xiwang Zhang
      assures us is "high enough for practical applications." The salts
      that accumulate at the edges, meanwhile, can also be harvested for
      use.<br>
      <br>
      Zhang and his team tested out the device using salty water from a
      bay in South Australia, and found that it absorbed 94 percent of
      the light across the solar spectrum. It worked whether wet or dry,
      with light exposure heating up the device from 25 to 50° C (77 to
      122° F) when dry and from 17.5 to 30° C (63.5 to 86° F) when wet,
      within just one minute.<br>
      <br>
      "This device can produce six to eight liters (1.6 to 2.1 gal) of
      clean water per square meter (of surface area) per day," Zhang
      tells New Atlas. "We are working to further improve the water
      production rate."<br>
      <br>
      Zhang and his colleagues hope that with further work, the device
      could be put to use providing clean water to remote communities
      that are currently without access. But its value mightn't end
      there. The technology could be used in other areas where more
      efficient water purification methods might come in handy, such as
      mining and wastewater treatment.<br>
      <br>
      We hope this research can be the starting point for further
      research in energy-passive ways of providing clean and safe water
      to millions of people, illuminating environmental impact of waste
      and recovering resource from waste," says Zhang.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Solar panel generates fresh water and
          electricity</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A new system for removing salt from seawater using the waste heat
      from solar panels has been created by Peng Wang and colleagues at
      King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi
      Arabia. The team installed a multistage membrane distillation
      (MSMD) device directly underneath the solar panels so that the
      system occupies the same footprint as the solar panels.<br>
      <br>
      Energy and water are two crucial resources that are often
      connected. Creating freshwater from seawater consumes about 15% of
      electricity generated in Arab countries, for example, and finding
      carbon-free sources of energy for desalination is a huge challenge
      facing countries in the driest regions of the world.<br>
      <br>
      Wang’s team have answered this challenge by creating a
      desalination system that uses waste heat produced by solar power
      plants. While solar cells can convert about 20% of sunlight into
      electricity, the remaining 80% simply heats up the solar panels.
      The team’s MSMD device comprises three stacked layers of water
      distillation channels that run parallel to solar panels. Each
      layer is separated by porous hydrophobic membranes and heat
      conduction layers.<br>
      Evaporation and condensation<br>
      <br>
      Within each layer, seawater in the uppermost channel is evaporated
      by waste heat from the solar panel, and then condenses to
      freshwater inside a second channel on the other side of the
      membrane. This desalinated water then flows into a storage
      container, while the remaining seawater, along with the rest of
      the waste heat, pass down to the layer below, where the process
      repeats.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Salt-free drinkable water comes at a cost</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Wang and colleagues show that the MSMD device can be installed
      directly underneath existing solar panels; requiring no
      specialized mounting equipment, and no extra requirements for land
      use. While previous attempts at this technique came at the cost of
      overall solar panel performance, the researchers observed
      virtually no decrease in power generation efficiency in their
      system. At the same time, the MSMD device was able to desalinate
      up to 1.64 l of fresh water per square metre per hour. According
      to team member Wenbin Wang, this is more than double the water
      output of traditional solar stills, which use a one-stage design.<br>
      <br>
      The team points that new technology could encourage energy and
      water companies to work together in dry regions. Furthermore, they
      point out that creating fresh water offers a way of mitigating the
      inherent low efficiency of solar panels and could make their
      deployment more attractive.<br>
      <br>
      As a next step, the team wants to study how the system could be
      used in an agricultural setting – with the water used for
      irrigation.<br>

          from water evaporation for continuous solar steam generation
          and salt harvesting</b><br>
        <b>Yun Xia, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>As a low-cost green technology, solar steam generation using
      nanostructured photothermal materials has been drawing increasing
      attention in various applications, e.g. seawater desalination, and
      zero liquid discharge of industrial wastewater. However, the
      crystallisation of salts on the surface of photothermal materials
      during steam generation leads to a gradual decline in the water
      evaporation rate. Herein, this challenge was overcome by a novel
      design involving controlled water transport, edge-preferential
      crystallisation and gravity-assisted salt harvesting. The
      crystallisation sites of the salt were spatially isolated from the
      water evaporation surface, achieving continuous steam generation
      and salt harvesting in over 600 hours of non-stop operation. The
      study provides new insights into the design of solar steam
      generators and advances their applications in sustainable seawater
      desalination and wastewater management.<br>

      <i>Monash University researchers have developed technology that
        can deliver clean water to thousands of communities worldwide.</i><i><br>
      </i><i>This solar steam generation system produces clean water
        from salty (ocean) water with almost 100 per cent salt removal.</i><i><br>
      </i><i>It provides a solution to water shortages in regional areas
        where grid electricity isn’t available. &nbsp;</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      An estimated 844 million people don’t have access to clean water,
      while every minute a newborn dies from infection caused by lack of
      safe water and an unclean environment.<br>
      <br>
      Seawater desalination and wastewater recycling are two ways to
      ease the problem of water shortage, but conventional approaches
      are energy-intensive and based on the combustion of fossil fuels.
      In fact, water treatment uses about 3 per cent of world’s energy
      supply.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at Monash University have developed energy-passive
      technology that’s able to deliver clean, potable water to
      thousands of communities, simply by using photothermal materials
      and the power of the sun.<br>
      <br>
      Led by Professor Xiwang Zhang from Monash University’s Department
      of Chemical Engineering, researchers have developed a robust solar
      steam generation system that achieves efficient and continuous
      clean water production from salty water with almost 100 per cent
      salt removal. Through precisely controlling salt crystallisation
      only at the edge of the evaporation disc, this novel design also
      can harvest the salts.<br>
      <br>
      The feasibility and durability of the design have been validated
      using seawater from Lacepede Bay in South Australia. This
      technology is a promising solution to water shortages in regional
      areas where grid electricity isn’t available.<br>
      <br>
      The findings were published in the international journal Energy
      &amp; Environmental Science.<br>
      <br>
      “Water security is the biggest challenge the world faces in the
      21st century, especially as population grows and the effects of
      climate change take shape. Developing and under-resourced
      communities feel the effects of these factors the most,” Professor
      Zhang said.<br>
      <br>
      “Utilising solar energy for water treatment has been widely
      considered as one of the sustainable solutions towards addressing
      the scarcity of clean water in some communities, without
      sacrificing our environment or resources.<br>
      <br>
      “Despite the significant progress achieved in material
      development, the evaporation process has been impeded by the
      concentration of salt on the surface, which affects the quality of
      water produced.”<br>
      <br>
      Researchers created a disc using super-hydrophilic filter paper
      with a layer of carbon nanotubes for light absorption. A cotton
      thread, with a 1mm diameter, acted as the water transport channel,
      pumping saline water to the evaporation disc.<br>
      <br>
      The saline water is carried up by the cotton thread from the bulk
      solution to the centre of the evaporation disc. The filter paper
      traps the pure water and pushes the remaining salt to the edges of
      the disc.<br>
      <br>
      The light absorbance was measured to 94 per cent across the entire
      solar spectrum. The disc also exhibited a rapid temperature
      increase when exposed to light in both dry and wet states, rising
      from 25C to 50C and 17.5C to 30C respectively within one minute.<br>
      <br>
      This technology has also great potential in other fields, such as
      industry wastewater zero liquid discharge, sludge dewatering,
      mining tailings management and resource recovery. Future studies
      will look to extend the technology to these applications with
      industry support.<br>
      <br>
      “Our study results advance one step further towards the practical
      application of solar steam generation technology, demonstrating
      great potential in seawater desalination, resource recovery from
      wastewater, and zero liquid discharge,” Professor Zhang said.<br>
      <br>
      “We hope this research can be the starting point for further
      research in energy-passive ways of providing clean and safe water
      to millions of people, illuminating environmental impact of waste
      and recovering resource from waste.”<br>

      Professor Zhang is the Director of the ARC Research Hub for
      Energy-efficient Separation (EESep), which aims to develop
      advanced separation materials, innovative products and smart
      processes to reduce the energy consumption of separation processes
      that underpin Australian industry.<br>

          electricity via multistage solar photovoltaic membrane
          distillation</b><br>
        <b>Wenbin Wang, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      The energy shortage and clean water scarcity are two key
      challenges for global sustainable development. Near half of the
      total global water withdrawals is consumed by power generation
      plants while water desalination consumes lots of electricity.
      Here, we demonstrate a photovoltaics-membrane distillation (PV-MD)
      device that can stably produce clean water (&gt;1.64 kg·m−2·h−1)
      from seawater while simultaneously having uncompromised
      electricity generation performance (&gt;11%) under one Sun
      irradiation. Its high clean water production rate is realized by
      constructing multi stage membrane distillation (MSMD) device at
      the backside of the solar cell to recycle the latent heat of water
      vapor condensation in each distillation stage. This composite
      device can significantly reduce capital investment costs by
      sharing the same land and the same mounting system and thus
      represents a potential possibility to transform an electricity
      power plant from otherwise a water consumer to a fresh water
      producer...<br>
      <br>
      In this work, we report a strategy for simultaneous production of
      fresh water and electricity by an integrated solar PV
      panel-membrane distillation (PV-MD) device in which a PV panel is
      employed as both photovoltaic component for electricity generation
      and photothermal component for clean water production. In a
      typical solar cell, 80–90% of the absorbed solar energy is
      undesirably converted to heat, and thereafter passively and
      wastefully dumped into the ambient air32. In this work, a MSMD
      device is integrated on the backside of a commercial solar cell to
      directly utilize its waste heat as a heat source to drive water
      distillation. Under one Sun illumination, the water production
      rate of the PV-MD is 1.79 kg m−2 h−1 for a 3-stage device, which
      is three times higher than that of the conventional solar stills.
      At the same time, the PV panel generates electricity with energy
      efficiency higher than 11%, which is the same as that recorded on
      the same PV panel without the back MD device and which is at least
      9 times higher than those achieved in the previously published
      works. The undoubted benefit of the integration of PV and water
      distillation is the highly efficient co-generation of clean water
      and electricity in one device at the same time on the same land,
      which directly reduces land area requirement and the cost of the
      mounting system as compared to two physically separate systems (PV
      and solar distillation). Moreover, working directly with
      commercial solar cells makes the PV-MD device close to practical
      applications. This strategy provides a potential possibility to
      transform an electricity generation plant from otherwise a water
      consumer to a fresh water producer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Structure of the MSMD device...</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Each stage of the MSMD device was composed of four separate
      layers: a top thermal conduction layer, a hydrophilic porous layer
      of water evaporation layer, a hydrophobic porous layer of MD
      membrane for vapor permeation, and a water vapor condensation
      layer. Aluminum nitride (AlN) plate was used as the thermal
      conduction layer because of its extremely high thermal
      conductivity (&gt;160 W m−1 K−1) and its anti-corrosion property
      in salty water34. The hydrophobic porous layer was made of an
      electrospun porous polystyrene (PS) membrane. The water
      evaporation layer and condensation layer were of the same
      material, a commercial hydrophilic quartz glass fibrous (QGF)
      membrane with non-woven fabric structure.<br>
      <br>
      In each stage of the MSMD device (Supplementary Fig. 2), the heat
      is conducted through the thermal conduction layer to the
      underlying hydrophilic porous layer. The source water inside the
      hydrophilic porous layer is thus heated up to produce water vapor.
      The water vapor passes through the hydrophobic porous membrane
      layer and ultimately condenses on the condensation layer to
      produce liquid clean water. The driving force for the water
      evaporation and vapor condensation is the vapor pressure
      difference caused by the temperature gradient between the
      evaporation and condensation layers. In each stage, the latent
      heat of water vapor, which is released during the condensation
      process, is utilized as the heat source to drive water evaporation
      in the next stage. The multistage design ensures the heat can be
      repeatedly reused to drive multiple water evaporation–condensation
      cycles. In a traditional solar still, the heat generated from the
      sunlight via photothermal effect only drives one water
      evaporation–condensation cycle, which sets up an upper theoretical
      ceiling of the clean water production rate, ~1.60 kg m2 h−1, under
      one-Sun condition in such a system. The multistage design makes
      possible to break the theoretical limit as demonstrated very
      recently by two groups27,28.<br>
      <br>
      In this work, two source water flow modes, namely, dead-end mode
      and cross-flow mode, are designed for the MSMD device (Fig. 1). In
      the dead-end mode, the source water is passively wicked into the
      evaporation layer by hydrophilic quartz glass fibrous membrane
      strips via capillary effect. In this case, the concentration of
      salts and other non-volatile matters in the evaporation layer
      keeps increasing till reaching saturation in the end. A washing
      operation is indispensable to remove the salts accumulated inside
      the device for this mode, as reported in the previous works28.
      However, the passive water flow reduces the complexity of the
      device and gives a high water production rate in the early stage
      for this operation mode. In the cross-flow mode, the source water
      flows into the device driven by gravity or by a mechanical pump,
      and, it flows out of the device before reaching saturation. In
      this case, the outgoing water flow will take away a small amount
      of sensible heat, leading to a slight drop in clean water
      productivity in the early stage. However, it solves the salt
      accumulation problem and avoids the need for frequent cleaning and
      salt removal operation, which makes the device suitable for
      long-term operation.<br>
      <br>
      In some experiments, a commercial spectrally selective absorber
      (SSA) (ETA@Al, Alanod Solar) was used to replace the PV panel for
      clean water production performance evaluation. This material can
      decrease the radiation heat loss during operation because it
      possesses a much smaller emissivity than PV panels, and that is
      why it was adopted in both of the previous works on solar membrane
      distillation28. We use the SSA-MD device to confirm that the
      multistage MD device we fabricated in this work is comparable with
      the state-of-the-art solar membrane distillation devices...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Synthesis of the polystyrene membrane</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The hydrophobic polystyrene membrane was fabricated by
      electrospinning method. Polystyrene was firstly dissolved in DMF
      by mild stirring for 6 h to obtain 25 wt% homogeneous solution.
      The solution was placed in three 5-mL syringes equipped with metal
      needle of 0.52 mm inner diameter and then ejected with a feeding
      rate of 5.0 mL h−1. The voltage was set at 30 KV and the distance

      <b>Device assembly</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The QGF, PS membrane and AlN were assembled as shown in
      Supplementary Fig. 1a. To avoid blocking the wick of the dead-end
      device by PU foam, the wick was firstly wrapped by plastic film.
      The PU foam precursor was obtained by mixing the part A and part B
      of the PU system as 1:1 weight ratio and then was painted on the
      side of the device. The device was kept at 50 °C for 12 h to
      complete the foaming. The assembly of cross-flow MSMD was similar
      to that of the dead-end MSMD, except that the wick was replaced
      with the silicon tube with the diameter of 1 mm.<br>

      The device was put on the top of a square heat sink with a length
      of 5 cm which was immersed in bulk water. Water was transported
      from bulk water to the device by capillary effect and
      transpiration effect via a small QGF membrane belt which was
      connected to the distillation layer. In a practical scenario, the
      flow rate of the source water in the cross-flow PV-MD can be
      controlled by a flow control valve or flow meter. In our
      experiments, an ISMATEC tubing pump was used to control the flow
      rate of the source water more precisely. Solar irradiation was
      provided by a solar simulator (Newport 94043A) with a standard AM
      1.5 G spectrum optical filter. A 100 mL cup was used to collect
      clean water and the amount of water collected was monitored and
      recorded real-time. To reduce the evaporation of the collected
      clean water in the cup, a funnel was put on the top of the cup.
      The square photothermal material or square solar cell with the
      length of 3.9 mm was put on the top of the device. Photovoltaic
      responses (J–V curves) of the solar cell were measured by a
      Keithley 2400 series source meter. For the cycling test, after
      each cycle, 3 pieces of Kimwipes tissue (11 × 21 cm) were
      connected to the inlets of the dead-end devices and stayed there
      for 3 h to extract the concentrated water remaining in the QGF
      membranes. For each new cycle, salt water was wicked into the QGF
      membrane and extracted by the tissue again. This procedure was
      repeated at least for 3 times to ensure that the QGFs were
      cleaned....<br>
