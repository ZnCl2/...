          anti-ageing compound in plant</b><br>

      <br>
      In Japan, the slightly bitter leaves of the Ashitaba plant have
      long been considered healthy, and a new study has found the
      traditional belief may have good scientific grounds.<br>
      <br>
      A natural substance in the plant appears to induce a key process
      that helps remove the "cellular garbage" that can build up as
      cells age and cause a range of diseases and disorders.<br>
      <br>
      "It is always nice to find a scientific rationale for traditional
      medical folk tales," said Frank Madeo, a professor at the
      University of Graz's Institute of Molecular Biosciences, in
      Austria.<br>
      <br>
      Madeo, who helped lead the research, said the substance known as
      4,4'-dimethoxychalcone or DMC, which occurs naturally in Ashitaba
      plants, induces a process called autophagy.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a cleansing and recycling process," he told AFP. It
      removes "superfluous material, especially cellular garbage like
      aggregated proteins."<br>
      <br>
      That "cleaning" process is key to sustained good health as the
      body ages. When cells fail to promptly and efficiently remove
      damaged parts, they can build up and that can lead to diseases
      including cancer.<br>
      <br>
      There are already a handful of compounds known to scientists that
      work to stimulate the cleaning process. Fasting also appears to
      naturally encourage cells to undertake spring cleaning.<br>
      <br>
      But in a bid to expand the field of compounds able to protect
      cells and turn back the hands of time, the team of researchers
      turned to a class of substances called flavonoids.<br>
      <br>
      Many flavonoids have already been shown to have a range of
      beneficial effects, ranging from anti-inflammatory properties to
      protecting against brain degeneration and cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The team reasoned that they might find flavonoids that could also
      help prevent destructive ageing in cells.<br>
      <br>
      They screened 180 compounds representing various subcategories of
      flavonoids, looking for candidates that might have the natural
      ability to "counteract age-related cell demise."<br>
      <br>
      <b>- Cell-protective capacity -</b><br>
      <br>
      After initial screening, they settled on DMC and started by
      testing how the substance affected yeast cells.<br>
      <br>
      They discovered it was indeed helping to protect the yeast cells
      from the effects of ageing, and that the substance performed as
      well or even better than some existing compounds prized for their
      cell-protective capacity like resveratrol, which occurs in grape
      skin, among other places.<br>
      <br>
      The team then tested DMC's effect on cells in both worms and fruit
      flies -- common test subjects in medical research.<br>
      <br>
      "Remarkably, chronic DMC treatment... prolonged the median
      lifespan of both model organisms by approximately 20 percent," the
      study published Wednesday in the Nature Communications journal
      says.<br>
      <br>
      Additional tests showed the compound helped protect cells in mice
      hearts through the autophagy process, and even protected against a
      kind of liver damage caused by ethanol intoxication.<br>
      <br>
      The team also tested DMC's effect on several types of human cells
      and found that there too the substance worked to slow ageing.<br>
      <br>
      "The experiments indicate that the effects of DMC might be
      transferable to humans, although we have to be cautious and wait
      for real clinical trials," said Madeo.<br>
      <br>
      The research is still in the early stages and Madeo said next
      steps will include testing whether the positive effects of DMC in
      mice hearts extend more broadly to protect mice against ageing and
      age-related diseases.<br>
      <br>
      "Eventually, clinical trials on humans are needed," he added.<br>

      Angelica keiskei, commonly known under the Japanese name of
      ashitaba (アシタバ or 明日葉), literally "tomorrow's leaf", is a species
      of flowering plant in the carrot family. It is native to Japan,
      where it is found on the Pacific Coast.[1] It is endemic to the
      area of the Bōsō Peninsula, Miura Peninsula, Izu Peninsula, and
      the Izu Islands. It has been widely cultivated outside its natural
      range. <br>

      Species: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A. keiskei<br>
      Binomial name<br>
      Angelica keiskei<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description</b><br>
      It is a perennial, with a typical growth height of 50–120 cm. Like
      most other members of the carrot family, it produces large umbels
      of white flowers and has dissected leaves.<br>
      <br>
      Angelica keiskei closely resembles Angelica japonica, but can be
      distinguished by its blooming period, which lasts from May to
      October, whereas A. japonica's blooming period lasts only between
      May and July. Another indicator is the characteristic color of its
      sap.[2]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Taxonomy</b><br>
      This species is named in honor of Keisuke Ito, a Japanese
      physician and biologist. A named cultivar of this species,
      "Koidzumi", refers to botanist Gen'ichi Koizumi. The Japanese name
      of Angelica keiskei, "ashitaba", stems from the above-average
      regenerative capabilities it exhibits after injury. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Cultivation</b><br>
      Many Japanese plant ashitaba in herb gardens, flower pots, and
      backyards. This is due to the modest conditions for cultivation
      and fast rate of growth. This is a cold hardy plant, with optimal
      temperatures ranging between 12 and 22 °C. Harvesting a leaf at
      the break of day often results in a new sprout growing overnight,
      being visible the following morning. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Uses</b><br>
      <b>As food</b><br>
      The main use of their stipes, leaves, and taproots is in regional
      cuisine, where they are prepared as soba, tempura, shōchū, tea,
      ice cream, pasta, etc. The 'Mikura-jima' variety might excel in
      this regard as it is reputed to be less bitter than others.[3]<br>
      <br>
      <b>As medicine</b><br>
      A. keiskei has been claimed to exhibit cytotoxic, antidiabetic,
      antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, and
      antimicrobial properties via in vitro studies, but the efficacy of
      these qualities have not been confirmed in vivo.[4]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Historical use</b><br>
      Traditionally, it is seen as a major contributor to the supposedly
      healthier, extended lives of the local residents, possibly due to
      the chalconoids that are unique to this species of Angelica. At
      one point in Edo period, the haulm's yellow sap was effectively
      used in the external treatment of smallpox, which prompted Kaibara
      Ekken to describe the herb in his Yamato honzō (大和本草), under the
      name of ashitagusa (鹹草), as "a powerful tonic drug." In folk
      medicine, it is claimed to be diuretic, tonic, to improve
      digestion, and when applied topically, to speed wound healing and
      prevent infection. Also, its nutritive qualities are said to be
      the factor behind the internal exiles and their families' never
      waning stamina in the face of their arduous compulsory labor.<br>
      <br>
      For similar reasons, it very widely serves as pasture for cattle,
      reckoned to improve the quality of milk, as well as the yield and
      to maintain cattle health at the same time. Most of these claims
      have yet to be proven in trials, while studies have substantiated
      the presence of furocoumarins in several of these plants'
      components. Furanocumarin is known to increase skin sensitivity to
      sunlight and may cause dermatitis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Claims of vitamin B12 source</b><br>
      Although it is often suggested that A. keiskei is a vegetable
      source of vitamin B12 (cobalamin), recently published,
      peer-reviewed scientific investigations of pharmacology and
      phytochemical constituents of interest report nothing that
      substantiates this claim.[5][6] Traditional methods for measuring
      vitamin B12 in foods are compromised by contaminants (e.g. soil,
      bacteria, etc.) that contain detectable concentrations of inactive
      B12 analogs, which may explain the origin of this belief.[7] More
      recent studies reveal certain mushrooms and algae as the only
      naturally occurring sources of B12 outside of the animal
      kingdom.[8] Of these, only Chlorella has demonstrated the ability
      to reduce methyl malonic acid (MMA) levels (a product of B12
      deficiency) in human subjects.[9]<br>

      Synonyms :Archangelica keiskei. Miq.<br>
      Habitats : Cultivated Beds;<br>
      Edible Parts: Leaves;&nbsp; Root;&nbsp; Stem.<br>
      Leaves - raw or cooked[105, 116, 177]. Root - cooked[105]. It is
      often pickled[177]. The root is short and thick[275].<br>
      Medicinal Uses: Plants For A Future can not take any
      responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.
      Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant
      medicinally.<br>
      Other Uses: None known<br>
      <br>
      Cultivation details: We have very little information on this
      species and do not know how hardy it will be in Britain, though
      judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors at least in
      the milder parts of this country. The following notes are based on
      the general needs of the genus. Requires a deep moist fertile soil
      in dappled shade or full sun[200]. Plants are reliably perennial
      if they are prevented from setting seed[200].<br>
      <br>
      <b>Propagation</b><br>
      Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe since the
      seed only has a short viability[200]. Seed can also be sown in the
      spring, though germination rates will be lower. It requires light
      for germination[200]. When large enough to handle, prick the
      seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold
      frame for their first winter, planting them out into their
      permanent positions in the spring. The seed can also be sow in
      situ as soon as it is ripe.<br>

      method for purifying and rapidly extracting chalcone from fresh
      leaves of the future.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background technique</b><br>
      Chalcone refers to a class of natural compounds containing
      1,3-diphenylpropenone structure, which are abundant in the roots,
      leaves and skin of various medicinal plants such as licorice and
      safflower. The structure is flexible, can be combined with a
      variety of receptors, and exhibits various biological activities.
      It has been reported to have anti-tumor, anti-parasitic, anti-HIV,
      anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet aggregation and
      the like.<br>
      <br>
      Angelica keiskei Koidzumi, also known as Aspergillus, Minguecao,
      Bazhangcao, etc., is native to Japan's Hachijojima, Miura and
      other peninsulas. It is a kind of sylvestris herb with anti-aging,
      blood sugar lowering and blood pressure lowering. , anti-tumor and
      other multiple effects. The leaves of tomorrow are mainly composed
      of flavonoids and coumarin compounds, and the flavonoids are
      mostly composed of chalcone. As a kind of abundant natural plant
      resources of natural chalcone, there are reports on the extraction
      and utilization of chalcone in tomorrow.<br>
      <br>
      At present, the method for extracting chalcone from the leaves of
      tomorrow is mainly an organic solvent hot dip method, and the
      extraction solvent is mostly an organic solvent such as methanol,
      acetone or ethyl acetate, and the crude extract is obtained by
      multiple extraction of the above solvent. Chromatography
      purification to obtain chalcone. For example, the patent
      CN201010299189.0 uses dry leaves as raw materials, and is
      subjected to multiple extractions of ethanol, ethyl acetate,
      chloroform-methanol mixture and two column separations to obtain
      chalcone. This method not only has a large amount of organic
      solvent, but also has a large amount of organic solvent. The two
      column separations result in low yield, time consuming and low
      efficiency. The patent CN201010127425.0 uses dry day leaf powder
      as raw material, and is extracted by organic solvent such as
      isoamyl alcohol, acetone, chloroform and diisopropyl ether, and
      recrystallized. In the production process, flammable and explosive
      organic solvents such as acetone, chloroform and diisopropyl ether
      are selected, which not only has large pollution, but also has
      high safety hazard; patent CN201110218657.1 uses petroleum ether,
      acetone, ethyl acetate and The extraction of chalcone by inorganic
      salts such as ammonium sulfate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate and
      potassium phosphate is not only long in process, but also has many
      organic solvents, and the discharge of a large amount of
      phosphorus-containing wastewater will also cause eutrophication of
      water bodies; the invention patent CN200910266615.8 directly
      adopts bright day The leaf is used as raw material, which
      simplifies the process steps, but the preparation process still
      uses organic solvents such as ethyl acetate, acetonitrile and
      dimethyl sulfoxide, and the pollution problem has not been solved.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the invention</b><br>
      In order to solve the above problems in the prior art, the present
      invention proposes a method for extracting chalcone from fresh
      leaves of the present day. The extraction method of the present
      invention does not use an organic solvent, and the chalcone pure
      obtained by the method is pure. The product has been proved to
      have a purity of over 96% and a yield of over 93%.<br>
      <br>

      d. The filtrate obtained in the step c is subjected to
      chromatographic separation on a polyamide column, eluted with
      ethanol, and dried at a low pressure of 55 to 60 ° C to obtain
      chalcone.<br>
      As a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the complex
      enzyme in the above step b is composed of cellulase, glucanase and
      phytase, and the mass ratio of the above cellulase, glucanase and
      phytase is 5~. 8:2~5:1~2.<br>
      Further, in the above step c, the volume ratio of the
      (1-ethyl-3-methyl)imidazole tetrachloroaluminate solution to the
      filtrate one is 2.5 to 3.5:1.<br>
      The mass ratio of the above three components of cellulase,
      glucanase and phytase is 7:3:2.<br>
      In the above step a, water is added for homogenization, and the
      amount of water added is 3 to 5 times the volume of fresh tomorrow
      leaves.<br>
      In the above step d, the flow rate in the chromatographic
      separation is controlled at 1.5 to 2.0 mL/min.<br>
      The beneficial technical effects brought by the invention:<br>
      <br>
      The invention utilizes fresh Asuka as raw material, effectively
      degrades cell wall tissue by adding a composite enzyme
      preparation, greatly reduces the extraction temperature and
      relatively shortens the extraction time, and the energy saving and
      emission reduction effect is very significant; since the composite
      enzyme includes phytase, the effective degradation The composite
      network structure formed by hemicellulose, phytic acid and
      calcium-magnesium ions in the cell wall of tomorrow leaves not
      only improves the extraction rate, but also facilitates the
      concentration, purification, shortening of the process and
      improving the production efficiency of chalcone.<br>
      <br>
      The use of a complex enzyme consisting of cellulase, glucanase and
      phytase eliminates the need for acetone, chloroform, diisopropyl
      ether, petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, isoamyl alcohol, acetyl
      cyanide, and dimethyl The multi-stage extraction step of toxic or
      flammable and explosive organic solvents such as sulfoxides also
      avoids the problems of eutrophication by phosphorus-containing
      inorganic salts.<br>
      <br>
      The use of tetrachloroaluminate (1-ethyl-3-methyl)imidazole has a
      pH value consistent with the optimum pH conditions of the complex
      enzyme of the present invention (pH 5.0 to 6.0), and can be used
      in combination with a complex enzyme. The strong polarity of the
      tetrachloroaluminate (1-ethyl-3-methyl)imidazole solution is
      closer to the polarity of the chalcone in the leaves of the next
      day, and the selectivity is better, and the extract is also
      excluded. More impurity components can significantly increase the
      extraction rate of chalcone, and facilitate the subsequent
      separation and purification of chalcone in tomorrow's leaves; in
      addition, non-volatile tetrachloroaluminate (1-ethyl-3-methyl) As
      a new type of green extractant, imidazole solution can effectively
      replace the traditional volatile organic solvent, minimize the
      harm of volatile organic solvents, eliminate safety hazards, and
      achieve one-step extraction at room temperature. The energy has
      greatly shortened the process flow and improved the production
      efficiency by 2-3 times, achieving the purpose of cleaning and
      quickly extracting chalcone.<br>
      <br>
      The use of polyamide chromatography column to separate chalcone
      has higher selectivity, better separation with pre-order process,
      higher yield, simple operation, low cost, and is more suitable for
      industrial production.<br>
      <br>
      The pure chalcone prepared by the method of the invention has
      experimentally confirmed that the purity is above 96%, and the
      yield is above 93%.<br>

      <b>Technical field</b><br>
      The invention belongs to the technical field of chemical component
      extraction, and in particular relates to a process for extracting
      chalcone components in the leaves of tomorrow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background technique</b><br>
      Tomorrow leaves are a kind of vegetables native to Hachijojima and
      Izu seven islands in Japan. The source is the roots, stems and
      leaves of the genus Asteraceae (Umbelliferae, Latin name
      Umbelliferae). The Latin name is Angelica Keiskei Koidzumi.<br>
      <br>
      The main components in the leaves of tomorrow are chalcone and
      coumarin compounds, of which the content of chalcone yellow
      compound is the highest. Yellow pigment is a mixture of various
      water-soluble active ingredients in the leaves of tomorrow,
      belonging to the effective part of chalcone, soluble in polar
      solvents such as water and dilute alcohol, insoluble in anhydrous
      ethanol, acetone, ether and petroleum ether. Good anti-tumor,
      anti-cancer, anti-ulcer, anti-thrombotic, antihypertensive,
      anti-allergic, anti-AIDS, anti-dementia, anti-diabetes and many
      other effects, especially 4-hydroxyderrcin and xanthoangelol .<br>
      <br>
      At present, domestic research on chalcone only stops by using
      organic chemical synthesis method to prepare chalcone (as an
      intermediate of flavonoids), and the obtained product has many
      side reactions, which takes a long time, is cumbersome to operate,
      and is not easy to post-treat. At the same time, the product is
      low in purity and has many disadvantages such as enantiomers.
      However, there are few studies on food and medicine for extracting
      chalcone active ingredients from tomorrow leaves, and there is no
      relevant literature after searching.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the invention</b><br>
      The object of the present invention is to provide a process for
      extracting chalcone components from the leaves of tomorrow, which
      can effectively reduce the activity of chalcone enzyme by using
      ethanol as an extraction solvent, avoid decomposition of chalcone
      during extraction, and improve chalcone. The extraction rate, as
      well as the extraction rate of 4-hydroxyderrcin
      (4-hydroxydisincin, 4HD for short) and xanthoangelol (xanthohumol,
      abbreviated as XA) in the chalcone.<br>
      <br>
      The technical solution adopted by the invention:<br>
      <br>
      A method for extracting chalcone components from the leaves of
      tomorrow, is to select dried stems and leaves of the genus
      Umbelliferae, Angelica Keiskei Koidzumi, and pulverize, and use
      9-11 times by weight to 40% to 60% ethanol by weight ratio. The
      extract is hot-dipped at 65 ° C to 75 ° C for 2 to 4 times, each
      time for 2 to 3 hours, and the extracts are combined, and the
      ethanol is recovered under reduced pressure until the alcohol-free
      taste is obtained to obtain a flow extract; 7 to 9 times by weight
      is used. The water is dissolved in the extract twice, and the
      water extract is combined, and then extracted with ethyl acetate
      for 5 to 7 times. The extract is combined, and the ethyl acetate
      is recovered under reduced pressure to obtain an extract, which is
      a crude product of chalcone. AB-8 macroporous adsorption resin
      column, using distilled water as eluent, resin particle size 30
      mesh, flow rate of 15ml/min, separation and purification,
      collecting eluate, eluate and then separated by 100 mesh silica
      gel column Purified to obtain chalcone.<br>
      <br>
      The above chalcone was eluted with a gradient of
      chloroform-methanol (100:1?30:1), and the target 4HD and XA were
      collected by HPLC, and then recrystallized twice with 50% ethanol
      to finally obtain 4HD and XA. Pure.<br>
      <br>
      The chloroform-methanol mixture was mixed at a ratio of chloroform
      to methanol in a volume ratio of chloroform:methanol = 100:1 to
      30:1.<br>
      <br>
      The advantages of the invention are:<br>
      <br>
      The reaction conditions are mild and the key process parameters
      are easy to control.<br>
      <br>
      The use of ethanol in the extraction of chalcone can effectively
      extract chalcone from tomorrow's leaves. The advantage is that the
      chalcone enzyme in the plant decomposes the chalcone during the
      extraction, making it free and reducing its water solubility.
      Sexually, the use of ethanol can reduce the activity of the enzyme
      in the enzyme, so that the chalcone is extracted as completely as
      possible, and the extraction rate is improved.<br>
      <br>
      The separation and purification were carried out on a 100-mesh
      silica gel column, and the gradient elution was carried out with a
      chloroform-methanol mixture eluent. The separation efficiency of
      the chalcone was good, the product purity was high, and the final
      product extraction rate and product purity were relatively high.<br>
      <br>
      Recrystallization from 50% ethanol at low temperature (0 ° C), the
      product obtained is of higher purity, avoiding the transformation
      of the target product configuration caused by recrystallization of
      other organic solvents (eg, xanthohumol is prone to thermal
      isomerism above 50 ° C) The yellow ketone is produced to reduce
      the target product).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Detailed ways</b><br>
      The invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting
      examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Embodiment 1</b><br>

      Angelica Keiskei Koidzumi, pulverize, extract twice with 50 times
      of 50% ethanol and 70 °C hot dip for 2 h, combine the extracts,
      and recover the ethanol under reduced pressure. To the

      special drying method such as lyophilization, spray drying or
      reduced pressure drying, and can be dried and solidified by a
      usual drying method It was found that the solid matter can be
      easily prepared in a fine powder form by grinding according to the
      usual method, and furthermore, it was confirmed that such a method
      can be similarly applied to the solvent extract of the leaf
      tomorrow. Further, the present inventors confirmed that chalcones
      in yellow juice used as a raw material can be recovered with high
      yield in the fine powder obtained by the above method. The present
      invention has been accomplished based on this finding.<br>
      [0006]<br>

      [0008]<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </b><br>
      The tomato leaf yellow juice or solvent extract solution to which
      the present invention is directed is represented by the formula
      (1)<br>
      [0010]<br>
      <br>
      4-hydroxyderricin represented by the formula (2)<br>
      [0012]<br>
      <br>
      So-called chalcones having a chalcone skeleton such as
      Xanthoangelol (hereinafter collectively referred to as "chalcone")
      represented by the following formula.<br>
      ) As a main component.<br>
      [0013]<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the tomorrow's leave juice or solvent extract used in
      the present invention is not limited at all depending on the site
      to be obtained and the method of obtaining as long as it contains
      the chalcone.<br>
      <br>
      For example, juice or juice collected from tomorrow leaves stalks
      or rhizomes as tomorrow leaf yellow juice can be used, and if
      necessary, these are further subjected to filtration treatment and
      washing treatment to remove contaminants such as dust Or it can be
      sterilized by heating or filtration treatment or the like. As a
      solvent extract of tomorrow's leaves, it is preferable to subject
      the whole grass of tomorrow's leaves or a part thereof (leaves,
      stems, roots, etc.) to a solvent extracting operation as it is or
      as a crushed product, or, after drying, pulverized powder It can
      be prepared by subjecting to solvent extraction operation as a
      body.<br>
      [0014]<br>
      <br>
      Examples of the extraction solvent include water; lower alcohols
      having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and
      butanol; lower alkyl esters such as ethyl acetate and the like;
      esters such as ethylene glycol, butylene glycol, propylene glycol,
      glycerin Glycols; other known organic solvents such as polar
      solvents such as ethyl ether, acetone, and acetic acid;
      hydrocarbons such as benzene and hexane; and nonpolar solvents
      such as ethers such as ether and petroleum ether. These solvents
      may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds in any
      combination. For example, if necessary, an appropriate amount of
      water can be added to the above-mentioned organic solvent to use
      it as a water-containing organic solvent. As such a solvent, a
      mixed solvent of water and alcohol is preferable. In the present
      invention, water, alcohol (for example, ethanol etc.), or a
      mixture of water and alcohol is more preferable.<br>
      [0015]<br>
      <br>
      As a method for extraction, commonly used methods can be adopted,
      and widely include extraction methods used for preparation of
      various preparations such as extract, elixir, infusion /
      decoction, flow extract and tincture. There is no limitation, for
      example, a method in which tomorrow leaves whole grass or a part
      of leaves (as it is or coarse, shredded), or a dry crushed
      material thereof (powder etc.) is immersed in cold infiltration,
      digestion etc. A method of extracting with hot stirring and
      filtration to obtain an extract, or a percolation method and the
      like. If necessary, the obtained extract can be used as it is
      after filtration or centrifugation to remove solid matter, or it
      can be used as a concentrate by distilling off the solvent. After
      concentration, the concentrated solution may be purified by
      washing with a non-dissolving solvent, or it may be dissolved or
      suspended in an appropriate solvent and used. It is also possible
      to obtain and purify fractions containing chalcones such as
      4-hydroxyderricin and Xanthoangelol by using commonly used
      purification methods such as countercurrent distribution method,
      liquid chromatography, etc. .<br>
      [0016]<br>
      <br>
      To simplify the acquisition, tomato leaf yellow juice is
      preferably used.<br>
      [0017]<br>
      <br>
      There is no particular limitation on the cyclodextrin used as a
      mixture with the above-mentioned juice of the leaves of tomorrow
      or a solvent extract solution, and conventionally known
      cyclodextrin can be broadly cited.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, it is a cyclodextrin without branching. Although
      either cyclodextrin having branch or cyclodextrin without branch
      can be used to solidify and powder the tomato leaves juice or
      solvent extract, cyclodextrin without branching is used Since it
      can be prepared as a solid with high dryness, it can be pulverized
      easily and there is an advantage that it can be prepared into a
      uniform fine powder which is smooth by pulverization. Furthermore,
      in the present invention, a-cyclodextrin, ß-cyclodextrin and
      ?-cyclodextrin containing glucose in a ratio of 6 to 8 molecules
      can be used. Preferable are ß-cyclodextrin and a-cyclodextrin,
      particularly preferably ß-cyclodextrin.<br>
      [0018]<br>
      <br>
      The compounding ratio of the juice of the leaves of tomorrow or
      the solvent extract and the above cyclodextrin is not particularly
      limited as long as it does not interfere with solidification and
      powdering of the leaves juice or solvent extract tomorrow, And can
      be prepared by suitably selecting so that a desired amount of
      chalcone is contained in the powder composition. For example,
      cyclodextrin is usually added in a proportion of 30 to 300 parts
      by weight, preferably 50 to 200 parts by weight, more preferably
      60 to 150 parts by weight, still more preferably 70 to 100 parts
      by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of yellow juice of
      tomorrow leaves Can be blended.<br>
      [0019]<br>
      <br>
      When tomorrow's leaves juice or solvent extract is mixed with
      cyclodextrin as described above, tomorrow leaves juice or solvent
      extract which was in a viscous liquid is probably based on the
      inclusion phenomenon of cyclodextrin , Heat changes and changes in
      the form of clay (paste). In mixing these two, it is preferable to
      coexist with water in order to accelerate the inclusion reaction
      of cyclodextrin and to efficiently proceed the reaction. The
      mixing ratio of water is not particularly limited, but it can be
      exemplified in the range of about 5 to 100 parts by weight,
      preferably 20 to 70 parts by weight, and more preferably 40 to 50
      parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of
      cyclodextrin .<br>
      [0020]<br>
      <br>
      The chalcone-containing powder composition derived from the
      tomorrow's leaf of the present invention can be prepared by drying
      the clay-like material (paste) and then pulverizing the obtained
      solid material.<br>
      [0021]<br>
      <br>
      The drying method is not particularly limited, and any of cold
      drying, normal temperature drying and warm drying, natural drying
      and air drying can be adopted.<br>
      Preferably, it is a method of blowing air dry from room
      temperature to warming. Specifically, there can be mentioned a
      method in which air drying is carried out under heating at about
      40 to 60 ° C., preferably about 50 ° C.<br>
      [0022]<br>
      <br>
      The pulverization method is also not particularly limited, and it
      can be prepared in powder form to fine powder form using a
      commonly used pulverizer such as a mortar, a mixer, a cutter mill
      and a hammer mill according to a conventional method.<br>
      [0023]<br>
      <br>
      The powder composition of the present invention thus obtained
      contains as an active ingredient chalcone derived from tomorrow's
      leaves (for example, 4-hydroxyderricin, Xanthoangelol), itself as
      a food, quasi-drug or pharmaceutical, Further, it can be
      effectively used as a raw material (bulk) for preparing these
      various formulations.<br>
      <br>
      The powder composition of the present invention may be suitably
      prepared so that the above-mentioned chalcone is contained in a
      total amount of 2 to 30% by weight, preferably 4 to 10% by weight
      according to the content ratio in tomorrow leaves of yellow juice
      Good.<br>
      [0024]<br>
      <br>
      The powder composition of the present invention may contain other
      carriers and additives pharmaceutically or food hygienically
      acceptable as other ingredients as long as the effect of the
      present invention is not hindered. For example, (Eg, starches such
      as dextrin, saccharides such as lactose etc.), excipients,
      lubricants, binders, corrigents, odor control agents and
      sweeteners.<br>
      [0025]<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES </b><br>
      The present invention will be explained in more detail with
      reference to the following examples, but the present invention is
      not limited to these examples at all.<br>
      50 g of yellow juice collected by cutting the tomorrow's leaf stem
      with sterilized boiled water was used as raw material (stock
      solution), and it was put in a round bottom flask together with
      67.1 g of 99.5% ethanol, and it was kept at room temperature for 1
      hour Followed by stirring. The resulting mixture was filtered with
      a Nutsche filter, and the filtrate was concentrated under
      atmospheric pressure to obtain 47.1 g of a brown oily liquid. 21.1
      g of water and 51.5 g of ß-cyclodextrin were added to and mixed
      with 37.4 g of the obtained oily liquid, and sufficiently stirred
      and mixed until the whole became a paste. The obtained paste-like
      mixture was spread on a stainless steel vat and dried in an air
      dryer (50 ° C.) to obtain 58.9 g of a pale yellow brittle solid
      mass. This solid was pulverized with a mixer to prepare a pale
      yellow fine powder (33.9 g). The content of 4-hydroxyderricin and
      Xanthoangelol contained in the obtained fine powder was analyzed
      by high performance liquid chromatography under the following
      conditions.<br>
      [0026]<br>
      <br>
      Apparatus: Shimadzu LC-6A, Shimadzu CR7A chromatography pack
      Column: COSMOSIL 5C18-AR (4.6 f × 250 mm) Mobile phase:
      methanol-water (7: 3) Temperature: 50 ° C Flow rate: 0.9 ml / min
      Detection: UV 330 nm Sample volume: 2 µl.<br>
      [0027]<br>
      <br>
      As a result, 4-hydroxyderricin was contained at 2.29% and
      Xanthoangelol was included at 4.60%.<br>
      These contents correspond to 96.2% and 89.1% of 4-Hydroxyderricin
      and Xanthoangelol contained in the yellow broth of the ashi leaf
      used as a raw material, and from this it can be seen that in the
      powder composition of the present invention , It was confirmed
      that 4 - Hydroxyderricin and Xanthoangelol in the yellow broth of
      the leaf tomorrow were recovered with a yield as high as about 90
      to 96%.<br>
      [0028]<br>
      <br>
      Comparative Example 21.1 g of water and 51.5 g of dextrin (Pain
      Index No. 3: manufactured by Matsutani Kagaku KK) were added to
      and mixed with 37.4 g of the oily liquid obtained in the same
      manner as in Example 1, and the mixture was sufficiently stirred
      and mixed at room temperature. As a result, unlike the case of
      Example 1 using ß-cyclodextrin, a heterogeneous mixture with low
      viscosity was obtained. This mixture was spread on a stainless
      steel vat and dried in an air dryer (50 ° C.), but it turned into
      a candy shaped brown solid and could not be powdered.<br>
      [0029]<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, chalcone (4-Hydroxyderricin
      and Xanthoangelol) having pharmacological activities such as
      bactericidal action (anti-gram-positive bacterial activity),
      antacid action, antiulcer effect, It is possible to easily
      solidify and powderize the tomorrow's leave juice or solvent
      extract contained therein without any complicated methods such as
      freeze-drying or spray drying. The powder composition thus
      obtained is useful not only as a food, a quasi-drug, a medicine
      per se, but also as a raw material (bulk) used for formulation of

      <b>Technical field</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention belongs to the technical field of plant cultivation,
      and relates to a technique for tissue culture and rapid
      propagation of leaves of tomorrow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background technique</b><br>
      <br>
      The use of medicine and food in tomorrow's leaves, especially in
      the medicinal field, is a new vegetable that is widely recognized
      as a development potential. China introduced the Japanese leaves
      from Japan more than 20 years ago. At present, only a few
      companies in China have just introduced seeds, and the cultivation
      area is very small. The raw materials are expensive in the
      international market and the demand is large. In the production
      process, the plants of tomorrow's leaves usually enter the
      breeding period 1-2 years after planting, and die immediately
      after flowering and fruiting. The flowering period of the leaves
      of the next day is longer, the fruit set rate is lower, the seed
      maturity is different at harvesting, and the fruit is
      double-suspended fruit, which causes the seed germination rate of
      the leaves of the next day to be extremely low, and it is
      difficult to cultivate on a large scale. Nowadays, the breeding
      and cultivation techniques of seedlings of tomorrow's leaves have
      become a bottleneck restricting the development of tomorrow's
      leaves and their processed products. However, there are few
      reports on the breeding and cultivation of tomorrow's leaves,
      which leads to the price of tomorrow's leaves and their products.
      No high.<br>
      <br>
      In order to expand the industrial production scale of tomorrow's
      leaves, there have been some research reports on the tissue
      culture of tomorrow's leaves. At present, the published research
      results are divided into three types: First, Li Jia and other
      studies have found that the petiole and leaves of tomorrow's
      leaves are not suitable for tissue culture as explants, but the
      callus induction is carried out by using the bud stem segments.
      Differentiation and other cultures; the second is Lu Xiuli and
      other reports on the use of seeds of the next day to obtain
      sterile seedlings for differentiation and proliferation; third,
      Guo Zhiyou et al reported the use of petioles and leaves as
      explants for tissue culture.<br>
      <br>
      Compared with the above three studies, this study is the same as
      the use of tissue culture to construct the breeding system of
      tomorrow's leaves, but it is very different from the three. First,
      compared with Li Jia and other studies, this study broke the
      conclusion that leaves could not be induced as explants, and the
      material with bud stems was significantly restricted compared with
      the leaves selected in this study. Compared with Lu Xiuli and
      other studies, the material limitation of this study is greatly
      reduced. Finally, compared with the results of Guo Zhiyou and
      others, although the results are similar, the results of this
      study show that MS as a basic medium works better, and Guo Zhi The
      friend's report believes that the N 6 basal medium is suitable for
      culture, so the basal medium used for the two is very different.<br>
      <br>

      The present invention relates to a cultivation method of
      Escherichia Columbus, which is characterized by sowing seeds
      between trees having root roots and collecting a large amount of
      vitamin B group and vitamin E-containing algae by the action of
      root nodules . The Ashitaba of this invention naturally breeds to
      the southern part of the Izu Peninsula, Oshima, Hase Island etc.
      and it is said that it is effective for health when we eat the
      leaves and stems, and the people of the land used for edible use,
      It is said that cultivation is very difficult, cultivation has
      never been tried on the scale of management. Also, the tree having
      a root knob used in the present invention, such as alder, is known
      as a land improvement tree for cultivation of nodules, sandy
      lands, nonfabricated lands and the like as being useful for
      maintaining and strengthening the ground power, but regarding the
      formation and composition of the root gang Has not been fully
      elucidated yet. <br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, various studies are made on
      the relation between trees having rootsroot roots and Ashitaba
      according to the above-mentioned ginseng. When seeded between
      trees having root roots, when this is grown, the vitamin B group
      and Vitamin E It was possible to collect rich albatross soil by
      cultivation, and led to the development of this invention.
      Regarding the enhancement of the ground force of the root knot, it
      is thought that it is due to the fixation of nitrogen in the air,
      but the vitamin l1tt in the root knot has not been investigated at
      all. <br>

      study Vitamin E causes an aging phenomenon as an antioxidant
      vitamin which suppresses the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acid
      in the body It has been announced that it is possible to prevent
      the formation of coalescence of fatty acid overgrowth and protein
      and to prevent the pigment from depositing on cardiac tissue,
      nerve, adrenal gland and other cells, and have a remarkable effect
      on prevention of aging O Next, an embodiment of the present
      invention will be described. A ridge of about 10 cm in height is
      formed between alderous trees planted at an interval of about 5
      meters, and at the interval of about 30 cm at the end of 2 Fi I
      sow seeds of Ashesha Ba. About 10 days after sowing the seeds
      started to germinate. Although Ashitaba is a perennial, - years
      are growing to about 50 centimeters, the second year is about 100
      centimeters, and the priestess grows to about 150 centimeters, but
      after that it is naturally revealed. Then, when the lower leaf of
      Ashitaba comes into contact with the ground, we reap this and
      improve the ventilation. Also from the sun from the east, if you
      try to hit half a day Xiyang will grow well growing well around
      the end of August flowers will bloom and you can harvest seed
      until mid-ninth. As required, the present invention succeeds in
      cultivation of Ashitaba cultivated conventionally as impossible to
      cultivate as described above, and by using a tree having a root
      root, the vitamin B group and vitamin l are abundantly added It is
      one that succeeds in collecting a new kind of high-nutritious

      </div>
      <br>
      Ashitaba is a part of the Izu Peninsula that is wild in the Izu
      Peninsula, especially on the Izu Islands, it is used as an ancient
      meal, and it is also used as an agriculture pasture to promote
      lactation of milk cows and improving milk quality . In recent
      years, flavor and richness like Mitsuba and celery combined and
      vitamins D1, B2, B6, B1. , Vitamin E 1 Lutcolin e glucos'ide,
      Isoquercitrin. Due to the abundance of nutritional components such
      as Psoralen, Angelicin, Xantbotoxin germanium, etc., demand for
      Ashitaba is increasing. Therefore, establishment of an effective
      cultivation method of Ashitaba at the scale of management was
      keenly desired. The present invention aims at establishing
      cultivation method of cultivation of Ashitaba, stabilizing
      cultivation, enabling production according to market demand, and
      cultivation method of Ashitaba with abundant component content
      from nutritional and livestock breeding . The present inventors
      established a technique relating to the present invention as a
      result of years of research on cultivation techniques and plant
      physiology. That is, when cultivating Ashitaba, it is necessary to
      sow and cultivate Ashitaba during the planting of this tree every
      5 to 6 m after examination of the forest of trees belonging to the
      subgenus Yoshapushi belonging to the birch genus. It is the
      feature of the above. In the present invention, trees belonging to
      the subgenus Yashagushi are effectively used as "1st", such as
      Yashagushi, Okayama Yabushi and Kiln Oysterbush. The purpose and
      results of blending trees belonging to subgenus Yershushi and
      Ashitaba are summarized in the following items. In other words, it
      is possible to cultivate full-year Ashitaba by avoiding direct
      sunlight by moderately concealing the cultivation surface of
      Shishitaba by branches and leaves of trees. Due to avoiding direct
      sunlight, in Ashitaba in July and August of midsummer it is
      possible to obtain the cultivation yields of habitual. Because it
      avoided direct sunlight, transpiration of moisture from the
      cultivation area is suppressed and it is possible to cultivate
      Ashitaba also in the Shimane gorge where the rainfall is not
      enough. Tree belonging to subgenus Yershushi is a root nodule
      plant that secretes compound nitrogen from the ovine nodule or the
      root system into the ground. As a result of secretion of compound
      nitrogen, the nitrogen compound is absorbed by the roots of
      Ashitaba, resulting in favorable results for growth. The trees
      belonging to the subgenus Yashapushi showed a 2 to 3 times
      increase in the production of carbon dioxide compared to other
      non-nodular plants, so that the carbonation anabolism of Ashitaba
      was made active and the water retention of the soil accordingly As
      a result, to promote the growth of Ashitaba.<br>
      <br>
      The trees belonging to subgenus Yoshabushi are deciduous leaves
      with a high amount of fallen leaves and high nitrogen content,
      decomposed on the cultivation floor and reduced to the soil,
      increase the humus, increase the physical, chemical and
      microbiological conditions of the soil As a result of improvement
      Improve the cultivation of Ashitaba. <br>
      <br>
      Ashitaba is cultivated surrounded by trees belonging to subgenus
      Yashapushi, this tree has the effect of protecting the growth of
      Ashiba as a windbreak forest, especially during the season when
      wind is strong, the growth of Ashitaba in the Shimane region To be
      promoted. <br>
      <br>
      The root system and root collapse of trees belonging to subgenus
      Yashagushi has a large nitrogen content compared to other plants,
      and as a result they are reduced into soil and promote the growth
      of Ashitaba. Ashitaba cultivated with mixed trees belonging to
      subgenus Yushabushi by a total effect of 0 or more has increased
      crop yield per unit area and increased nutritional and domestic
      feeding active ingredients, namely vitamin B 1, B 2, B 6 ,
      Luteolin-7-glucoside, I ', B12, V, E, chlorophyll, xanthophyll,
      folic acid, choline, pantothenic acid, biotin, niacin, carotene,
      inositol, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, so-quercitrin,
      Psoralen, Angelicin, Bergapten. Increased contents of Xanthotoxin,
      Angelic acid, Behenic acid, germanium compounds, energy, proteins,
      lipids, carbohydrates, etc. There are two lines of green grasses
      and spring grasses in Ashitaba, but the present invention can be
      effectively applied to any of these. As a method of raising
      seedlings of Aschitiba, a method of seeding in a field that is
      well-grounded between the forests of the subgenus Yashapushi and
      growing it for 4 to 5 years as it is or a method of nursing the
      original size and planting the plant after leaves come out Any of
      these methods can be effectively applied to the present invention.
      For fertilization to Ashitaba, organic matter such as poultry
      feces and slow release chemical fertilizer etc are effective. As
      cultivation control of Ashitaba, once seeded, it has a tropism of
      3 to 4 years. The growing stocks will bloom in the second year and
      become major stocks, so there is a way to change this and repeat
      the sprout from the root again and prolong the harvest. For
      harvesting, shoots and soft things are cut by hand from the root,
      and edible. Shipment is done by aligning well with the leaf tip,
      cutting off the stem, weighing and packaging it. It can also be
      used as a green leaf or a diver, or it can be used as a powder by
      drying and crushing.<br>
      <br>
      Next, the present invention will be described by examples. <br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES </b><br>
      <br>
      Three fields are used, each of which is hereinafter referred to as
      1.2. 3, field. As the first field used palm oil shavings and
      forests of Pleurotus albopictus, we used a slope south facing
      southerly with 3 to 5 'm intervals irregularly planted with Pear
      and Oysters. The remaining weeds and the other mushrooms were
      plowed and then partly plowed, and there were transplanted the
      seedlings of Ashitaba (5 to 6 pieces of trees) and planted them in
      the B 0 sub interval. When the strain grew with growth and the
      lower leaves got densely, the lower leaves were discarded and the
      ventilation was kept well. No fertilizer was used and pesticides
      were not used at all Q The 2nd field was a field used as a taro
      field, mixed with a freshwater fish and a cabbage shark, and used
      a field planted as a windbreak forest around the larvae did. The
      size of the field was 6 tn × 22 tn, and there were windproof
      forests in the circumference. Planting and cultivation of
      seedlings of Ashitaba conformed to the conditions of the field -
      field. In the 3 rd field, we used a large well-grounded field. The
      size of the field was 18 m × 43 m. Trees were totally around the
      surroundings. Characteristic values on cultivation in each field
      are shown in the following Table 1. Table 1 * (1) Exposure
      coefficients of the ground surface were calculated as follows.
      That is, the solar illuminance (Lux) of the ground surface in each
      field was measured. Then, the solar illuminance of the third field
      without shading was taken as 100, and the converted value was
      taken as the exposure coefficient. * (2) Wind speed coefficient of
      the ground surface was calculated as follows. That is, the wind
      speed (Th / sec) of the ground surface in each field was measured
      with a Robinson anemometer. Next, the wind speed of the third
      field without shading was taken as 100, and the converted value
      was taken as the wind speed coefficient. Next, the results of
      cultivation of Ashitaba in the first to third field are as shown
      in Table 2. Table 2 * (3) Yield factor of the field was calculated
      as follows. In other words, the yield of adults of each plot was
      measured in increments of 9 for 10 ares. Then, the yield factor of
      the third field was converted to 100, and the result was taken as
      the yield coefficient. As shown by the above results, it was
      observed that the yield of the Erythrabania increased by the
      method of the present invention. The third field is an example of
      comparison.<br>

      The invention discloses a preparation process of seaweed ashitaba
      tea, belongs to the technical field of tea preparation and mainly
      solves the technical problem that seaweed is fishy, ashitaba tea
      is low in chalcone dissolution and nutritional healthcare value is
      low in the prior art. The preparation process includes steps:
      selecting and picking; freezing and stem opening; soaking in ice
      to keep green; dehydrating to fix humidity; spraying enzyme for
      chain opening; high-temperature deactivation; twisting and
      shaping; drying and setting; parching to enhance aroma; cooling
      and aging; blending tea with seaweed; baking for the second time
      to improve aroma; cooling and large packing; aging and
      uniformizing aroma; inspecting and calibrating; sub-packaging. The
      preparation process can modify aroma of ashitaba tea and bring
      synergistic healthcare effect of the ashitaba tea and the seaweed
      and has the advantages that the preparation process is high in
      mechanical level, conducive to large-scale and standard production
      and especially capable of effectively improving dissolution of
      chalcone and seaweed polysaccharide which are healthcare
      ingredients during brewing and drinking of the ashitaba tea; the
      seaweed ashitaba tea prepared by the process has no stink odor
      that the seaweed has and is conducive to fully utilizing medicinal
      active ingredients and improving healthcare effect.<br>
