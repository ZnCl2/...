      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> An aircraft provided with airfoils of the
        non-rotating type that are configured and arranged to provide
        greater lift while at the same time offering stable flight at
        ultra-low airspeeds. The airfoils are arranged as a biplane and
        consist of a fixed wing and a movable wing which are designed so
        as to permit a much steeper takeoff and landing angle as well as
        offering more efficient flight at higher speeds with greater

        <p><b><font size="+1">"Short Wing Vacuplane Gets Lifting Power
              From Vacuum Cells"</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The "Vacuplane", a strange new type of airplane, has made its
        appearance at the University of Miami, Florida. Its abbreviated
        wing, open at the top, is lined with hollow chambers or "suction
        cells". These are said to make its lifting power equal to a
        conventional plane of greater wingspan. Several planes of this
        type have been constructed under the direction of Prof. Fred H.
        Givens, head of the university's aviation department, following
        in general the original design of E. H. Lanier, Cincinnati
        inventor. More than 15 successful flights have been made. In the
        latest model, illustrated here, round "tip-loss boards" at the
        ends of the wing increase the lifting force by preventing the
        formation of air vortexes. Ailerons that control the plane's
        banking are mounted on the fuselage behind the propeller. </p>

      <p>Named by its designer, a research professor at the University
        of Miami, the "vacuplane", an airplane of unusual appearance has
        been successfully flown. Two types thus far have been developed,
        but both have the distinguishing features of extremely short
        span and a hollow airfoil with baffle fins replacing the usual
        top covering. The wing in horizontal section has a shape
        somewhat like that of a bird in flight, but is fitted at the end
        with disks to reduce the wing-tip vortex and to add to lateral
        control. The cabin of the ship is highly streamlined with
        resulting low resistance. Lateral balance in the earlier tests
        was obtained through "flipper" controls placed in the propeller
        slipstream, but the later type was equipped with ailerons. The
        hollow character of the wing, with its open and baffled top, is
        said to add greatly to the lifting power of the airfoil vacuum
        and allow the plane to take off and land at low speeds.
        Performance in the air was considered good enough to warrant the
        statement by the pilot that the plane virtually flew itself. </p>

      <p>A modified and improved design of his "vacuplane", differing
        markedly from its predecessors (P. S. M., Jan. '32), was
        recently demonstrated by its inventor, E. H. Lanier, at Miami,
        FL. This odd craft is provided with suction cells on its upper
        surface, which are said to increase the lift and reduce the
        required wing area. The new model weighs 360 pounds, is only 16
        feet long, and is reported to have a speed of 96 mph. The plane
        is shown above with its inventor, at left, comparing notes with
        his pilot on the machine's performance. </p>

          (March 11, 1930)</p>
      </center>
      <p>My invention relates to the art of aerial navigation and it
        particularly has to do with the heavier-than-air type of craft.
      </p>
      <p>Primarily, the invention has for its object to provide an
        aeroplane that will, by its own fixed construction and design
        and without the pilot's aid, maintain an even keel while in
        flight and will volplane on an even lateral keel without the aid
        of a pilot or the motor. </p>
      <p>Further, it is an object to provide a machine that will not
        nose dive, side slip or tail spin under ordinary circumstances,
        but should this happen, the machine will right itself without
        the pilot's aid. </p>
      <p>A further object is to provide such a machine which adheres
        strictly to the same theory of flight, the same general
        construction, ailerons, rudder and elevators as used on present
        time planes. </p>
      <p>Further, it is an object to provide an aeroplane of great
        inherent stability which will be particularly useful for aerial
        school student passenger flights around aerial fields, and will
        be especially useful to develop confidence in those afraid of
        the present high speed planes. </p>
      <p>Other objects will in part be obvious and in part be pointed
        out hereinafter. </p>
      <p>To the attainment of the aforesaid objects and ends, my
        invention consists in the novel features of construction,
        connection, and arrangement of parts, hereinafter more fully
        described, and then pointed out in the appended claims. </p>

      <p>In the drawings in which is disclosed a preferred embodiment of
        the invention, 1 represents the keel extending in a stream line
        and comprising the backbone of the vehicle. Located beneath the
        keel is a suitable cabin 2 which may contain the controls (not
        shown) for the various operating instrumentalities (engine,
        ailerons, elevators, rudders). The cabin has floor 3, a front
        wall 4 extending downwardly and rearwardly from the keel and of
        V-shape in horizontal section, thereby offering but little wind
        resistance, a rear wall 5 similar inform to the front wall, and
        side walls 2 which diverge downwardly from the keel to the
        floor. </p>
      <p>Suitable landing gear is provided and comprises legs 6
        diverging from keel 1, braces 8 extending from the front end of
        the cabin adjacent the floor downwardly and outwardly to the
        legs 6, wheels 9 mounted at the bottom of the legs, and a tail
        skid 13. </p>
      <p>It will be noticed that the keel extends forwardly to overhang
        the cabin and the forward end is provided with an engine base 10
        for the engine 11 which drives the propeller 12. </p>
      <p>Above the keel is a fuselage composed of a suitably braced
        framework with walls covering the sides, ends and part of the
        top. The side walls are continuous from the front to the rear in
        stream lines and diverge upwardly from the keel. The fore part
        18 of the side walls extends forwardly and upwardly above the
        cabin to constitute the sides of a nose whose front wall 24
        inclines upwardly and forwardly from the keel adjacent the front
        of the cabin and rearwardly to comprise the short top wall 21.
        That portion of the fuselage body above the cabin is open at the
        top to constitute what I shall hereinafter term a vacuum chamber
        20. </p>
      <p>To the rear of the chamber 20 the fuselage body is closed by
        the side wall portions 19, a top wall 34, rear wall 44 and
        partition wall 43, the latter being inclined upwardly and
        rearwardly from the keel toward the top of the fuselage body. </p>
      <p>Along the upper edge of the outer wall which extends along the
        sides of the chamber 20 are flanges 22 whose purpose is to
        deflect the air away from the upper side edges of the chamber 20
        and prevent its curling over those edges into the chamber. </p>
      <p>The fore end of the fuselage body is braced to the extended end
        of the keel and motor base by struts 23, and an air stream
        splitting and laterally diverging member 25 is provided between
        the base 10 and the surface 24. </p>
      <p>Wigs 26 have spars 27 extending from the keel, the adjacent
        edges of the wings being spaced from the fuselage body and keel
        and are provided with vertical air channel vanes 29 for a
        purpose presently to be explained. </p>
      <p>The wings are braced at 7 to the legs 6 of the landing gear and
        at 28 to the vanes 29 and to the fuselage frame. </p>
      <p>The machine is provided with horizontal stabilizers 14,
        elevators 15, a vertical stabilizer 16 and rudder 17, all being
        of any approved construction. </p>
      <p>Mounted on the fuselage and preferably on top thereof is a
        tailspin check vane 30 which is hinged at 31 and has a stop 32
        to engage a fixed stop 33 when the vane opens up. The vane
        normally lies parallel to and in close juxtaposition to the
        fuselage body but it is spaced slightly therefrom by strips 36
        of rubber, wood or other suitable material to prevent air
        suction under the same. </p>
      <p>The vane may also be notched as a t 37 to straddle the adjacent
        stabilizer. </p>
      <p>The top wall 34 of the fuselage body is slotted at 35 to
        receive the pivoted end of the vane 30 and brace rods 38 are
        pivoted to the vane and pass through ears 39 on the side walls
        of the fuselage so as to cooperate with the stops 32 and 33. the
        rods 38 have rubber bumpers 40 and stop nuts 41 as indicated. </p>
      <p>The usual ailerons 42 may be provided on the wings. </p>
      <p>In order to prevent rainwater form accumulating in the chamber
        20, a suitable drain 45 is provided and in order not to break
        the vacuum in the chamber during the normal operation of the
        plane the drain 45 may be provided with a back check valve 46. </p>
      <p>The wings 26 are preferably inclined upwardly from their inner
        toward their outer edges or tips as best shown in Figure 3. </p>
      <p>The novel form of the fuselage body of the plane has a vacuum
        chamber in the front part, upwardly and outwardly inclined side
        walls longitudinally parallel with the stream line its full
        length, the air channel vanes attached to the inner ends of the
        wings longitudinally parallel with the central vertical
        longitudinal plane of the fuselage and no covering to the wings
        between the fuselage and air channel vanes, provides a
        construction which creates longitudinal air channels adjacent
        the middle of the machine when the machine is traveling on an
        even keel. When volplaning towards the earth, or should the
        machine go into a nosedive, the air currents will flow through
        the air channels more vertically. In either case this flow of
        air creates a powerful vacuum or upward pull in the vacuum
        chamber and in conjunction with the air pressure on the outside
        of the fuselage has great stabilizing effect. </p>
      <p>Another important advantage of the vacuum chamber is that the
        vacuum chamber is located at the highest point, bringing the
        center of gravity in a vertical line directly beneath the vacuum
        chamber. </p>
      <p>The arrangement of the wings at an angle with their outer end
        higher than in the center also has great stabilizing effect,
        especially as the adjacent ends of the wings are separated from
        the fuselage body and keel, which permits a current of air to
        pass through. </p>
      <p>Wings which extend entirely across the wing span without a
        break in the center balance very delicately; an opening in the
        center, however, permits a current of air to pass through and
        greatly reduce the tendency of the wings to fight compression
        and get out of balance. </p>
      <p>When the machine for any reason goes into a tailspin the tail
        vane opens. This vane is hinged at its forward end only and when
        the plane is in the forward flight it lies on the fuselage
        entirely neutral, and does not in any way affect the machine in
        flight, but should the machine stall and go into a spiral spin
        backwardly this vane will immediately open and throw the tail of
        the machine to the right or left, thus bringing the front of the
        machine down partially sideways and as it begins to volplane it
        will right itself. At the same time the tail vane will
        immediately close down on the fuselage body in its normal
        position. </p>
      <p>While I have located this tail vane on the top of the fuselage
        body in a horizontal position, it could be located on the sides
        of the fuselage in a vertical position with the same mechanical
        construction. </p>
      <p>The tail vane at this point of the fuselage will exert great
        force on account of the leverage; assuming the nose of the
        machine to be the fulcrum, pressure at the back will be very
        great and easily bring the tail to the right or left from the
        center of travel in falling. In a tail spin the machine does not
        fall in a true line with the center of gravity but spins around
        in a corkscrew fashion, the tail inscribing a circle. It is this
        motion that would cause air to get under the tail to the right
        or left of the line of fall, thus bringing the wings and front
        of the machine over on its side to a volplane. </p>
      <p>As shown, the vane 30 is of greater width than that of the
        fuselage wall adjacent to which it flies. </p>
      <p>In Figures 6 and 7 is shown a modification of the invention in
        which the fuselage and cabin structure are a part of the same
        body and the vacuum chamber is mounted above the cabin as a
        separate body. In this embodiment the cabin is indicated by 47,
        the rear portion of the fuselage by 48, the vacuum chamber by
        49, the wings by 50, the air channel vanes by 51, the tail vane
        by 52, the engine by 53, the stabilizers by 54, the elevator by
        55 and the rudder by 56. </p>
      <p>It is to be noted that in both embodiments of the invention the
        width of the cabin is less than the space between the adjacent
        ends of the wings. This is of importance or the reason that if
        the machine is volplaning or settling the air currents will pass
        up vertically through the air passages along the side of the
        vacuum chamber to create a vacuum or area of low pressure over
        the chamber even though the burbling point has been reached on
        the top surface of the wings. In other words, when the plane is
        in forward motion, volplaning or settling down vertically, a
        vacuum will be formed in the air chamber. The wings only create
        a vacuum in the forward motion of the machine. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing description, taken in connection with the
        accompanying drawings it is thought the construction, operation
        and advantages of my invention will be clear to those skilled in
        the art, it being understood, however, that I do not limit
        myself to precise details of construction, changes in which may
        readily be made without departing from the scope of the
        invention and the spirit of the appended claims [not included
        here]. </p>

      <p>My present invention which relates to the art of aerial
        navigation has for its primary object to improve the aeroplane
        which constitutes the subject matter of my Letters Patent #
        1,750,529, issued march 11, 1930. </p>
      <p>Further, it is an object to provide an aeroplane of a design
        and construction which is especially adapted for large machines
        of the commercial or passenger transport type and particularly
        to improve the lines, distribution of weight and propeller
        thrust. </p>
      <p>Further, it is an object to provide an improved construction
        wherein adequate provision is made for visibility in front,
        sides and top of the cabin for the benefit of the pilot. </p>
      <p>Further, it is an object to provide an aeroplane of the king
        disclosed in my patent aforesaid, in which provision is made for
        more flare at the top outer sides of the vacuum chamber in order
        to create greater lifting force vertically and more balancing
        force laterally, always bearing in mind a true streamline design
        longitudinally. </p>
      <p>A further object is to provide a convex or angled up floor for
        the vacuum chamber which may also constitute the roof of the
        cabin, thereby at the same time providing for more head room in
        the cabin and enabling the air to be drawn out of the vacuum
        chamber more freely than when a flat floor for the vacuum
        chamber is used. </p>
      <p>Further, it is an object of the invention to provide the vacuum
        chamber with a set of air buffers or partitions which may be
        rigid, or preferably, hinged so that they may be swung up to
        close the top of the vacuum chamber when desired, means being
        provided under control of the pilot for actuating the
        buffer-partitions at will to open or close the chamber. </p>
      <p>Other objects will in part be obvious and in part be pointed
        out hereinafter. </p>
      <p>To the attainment of the aforesaid object and ends, the
        invention still further resides in the novel details of
        construction, combination and arrangement of parts, all of which
        will be first fully described in the following detailed
        description, then be particularly pointed out in the appended
        claims, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, in
        which: --- </p>

      <p>In the drawings, in which like numerals of reference indicate
        like parts in all of the figures, 1 represents the keel which
        has a forward extension 2 on which the motor is mounted. The
        landing gear is represented by 3 and the tail skid by 4. 5 is
        the usual vertical fin while 6 designates the rudders and 7 the
        horizontal stabilizers. </p>
      <p>The fuselage includes the long runs 8 which are suitably braced
        transversely and 9 represents the wing beams which carry the
        wings 10, the latter being braced as at 11 as shown. The
        construction of the wings may be the same as in my patent
        hereinbefore mentioned. </p>
      <p>The roof 13 of the cabin in this embodiment of the invention
        also constitutes the floor of the vacuum chamber that is located
        above the cabin. In the preferred embodiment of the invention
        herein illustrated, the cabin is built into the fore part of the
        fuselage, the after part 37 constituting the tail assembly. </p>
      <p>The vacuum chamber which is located above the cabin has a front
        wall 14 and side walls 15, the outer surfaces 16 of which are
        flared outwardly and upwardly laterally from the cabin. The side
        walls of the vacuum chamber have their upper edges convexed as
        at 17. The rear wall 18 of the vacuum chamber is preferably
        slightly inclined upwardly and rearwardly from the floor 13. </p>
      <p>The cabin 19 has side walls 20 which merge with the side walls
        of the vacuum chamber and it has a front wall 21 which
        constitutes the lower wall of the nose of the machine. This
        front wall 21 extends upwardly and forwardly from the floor of
        the cabin to the tip 22 of the nose, and from that tip there is
        an upwardly and rearwardly extended (preferably curved) wall 23,
        the rear edge 32 of which overlies the wall 14. </p>
      <p>The front wall of the cabin is provided with windows 24 and the
        wall 23 is likewise provided with windows 25. As illustrated
        best in Figure 5 of the drawings there is a space left between
        the front wall 14 of the vacuum chamber and the tip 22 of the
        nose so that the pilot on the seat 39 may have vision through
        the windows 25 as well as through the windows 24 and will thus
        be able to see above as well as in front and below. </p>
      <p>The cabin 19 is also provided with widows 27 in its sides and a
        door 28 for the usual purposes. </p>
      <p>Air buffers 29 are mounted in the vacuum chamber and these air
        buffers may be held fixed in position or, preferably, they are
        hinged at 30 and are provided with heels 31 so that when the
        buffers are moved on the hinges upwardly the heel 31 of one
        buffer to the rear will overlie the free edge of the next buffer
        and thus enable the buffers to act as a closure for the top of
        the vacuum chamber when desired. The fore buffer 29, when in
        closed position, underlies the projection 32 of the wall 23,
        which projection acts also as a stop. The heel 31 of the rear
        buffer, when in the closed position, engages the upper edge of
        the wall 18 as a stop. </p>
      <p>Suitable stops 33 on the floor of the vacuum chamber are
        provided to limit the downward movement of the buffers to their
        maximum working position where they function as air buffers or
        deflectors. </p>
      <p>In order to operate the air buffers at the will of the pilot I
        may provide a winch 35 on which is wound an operating cable 36
        that passes over suitably located idler pulleys 34 and is
        connected to the several buffer lugs 29a whereby when the winch
        35 is turned in one direction the buffers 29 may be moved to the
        closed position (see dotted lines in Figure 5), and when moved
        in the other position they are brought to the position indicated
        in full lines I Figure 5. </p>
      <p>It will be noted that the tail assembly is closed at the top as
        well as at the sides, bottom and rear end, the top closure being
        indicated by 38. </p>
      <p>The motor or engine 40 is preferably located on the extension 2
        of the keel while the propeller 41 is preferably mounted on a
        shaft projecting from the nose tip 22 and is driven from the
        motor 40 by a sprocket and chain drive 42. </p>
      <p>In the modified form of the invention illustrated in Figure 8
        the front portion 43 of the keel is substantially parallel to
        the long runs 8x while the rear portion 44 of the keel extends
        from the rear of the cabin upwardly and rearwardly. Furthermore
        in this embodiment the vacuum chamber has its nose 45 forwardly
        extended to overlie the motor 46 which is mounted to approximate
        alignment with the horizontal plane containing the long runs,
        the propeller 47 in this instance being directly mounted on the
        motor shaft. </p>
      <p>The wings 10 of the aeroplane may be, as before intimated, of
        the same construction as in my patent aforesaid, and the channel
        vanes 48 are also provide to leave the air channels between
        those vanes and the sides of the fuselage and vacuum chamber. </p>
      <p>It will be noted by reference to Figure 7 that the keel 1 is
        widest from the front end of the cabin and from the rear end it
        tapers toward the tip of the tail. Furthermore, the keel where
        it extends in front of the cabin is narrowed. </p>
      <p>The cabin and vacuum chamber side walls are relatively parallel
        longitudinally and the air channel vanes are relatively parallel
        with th4 keel longitudinally to reduce drag to a minimum and
        allowing a free flow of air through the air channel to the tail
        assembly. </p>
      <p>A large proportion of the weight of the entire plane is located
        at the lowest level below the wing lift and the vacuum chamber
        forces. The propeller thrust is approximately on a line with the
        wing supporting lift and the vacuum chamber forces. </p>
      <p>In the preferred arrangement the engine is located on the keel
        and the propeller on the nose of the vacuum chamber and
        connected with the engine by a suitable power transmitting
        connection (either chain or shaft drive). While some power may
        be lost by this method of driving there is a distinct advantage
        in having the engine located at a low point of gravity and the
        propeller thrust on a line with the supporting wing lift and the
        vacuum chamber forces. However, the engine and propeller unit
        can be mounted on the nose of the plane if desired and if more
        than one engine is used the engines may be mounted to the right
        and left of the vertical center as is done in planes now in
        common use. </p>
      <p>It will also be observed that by virtue of the construction
        shown and described, vision for the pilot is amply provided for
        by windows constructed of any suitable material and located to
        the right, left, front and above the pilot. </p>
      <p>When the plane is moving at slow speed or the engine is
        throttled down, there is a tendency for the air to flow down
        into the vacuum chamber from above. The provision of the air
        buffers, however, causes this air to be deflected upwardly and
        rearwardly, thus preventing it from entering the vacuum chamber
        to any considerable extent. One or more buffers may be used
        though I prefer to use a plurality of them, particularly where
        they are of the hinged kind and are also employed for the
        purpose of closing the top of the vacuum chamber. </p>
      <p>It will be noted that the buffers do not extend to the bottom
        of the vacuum chamber as this would create pockets and prevent a
        free easy suction of air from the chamber. </p>
      <p>By building up the top longitudinal edges of the vacuum chamber
        side walls in oval form they prevent, in a very effective way,
        air currents from curling over into the vacuum chamber. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing description, taken in connection with the
        accompanying drawings, it is thought that the construction,
        operation and advantages of my invention will be clear to those
        skilled in the art to which it relates. </p>

      <p>My invention relates to the art of aerial navigation and it
        particularly has to do with the heavier-than-air type of craft.
      </p>
      <p>The primary object of the invention is to produce great lateral
        and longitudinal stability in a plane by its own fixed
        construction, thus preventing side slips, spins or nose dives,
        but should these perchance happen, the plane will right itself
        into a volplane slowly descending to earth. </p>
      <p>Other object will in part be obvious and in part be pointed out
        hereinafter. </p>
      <p>To the attainment of the aforesaid objects and ends, the

      <p>Figure 5 is a front elevation of the invention. </p>
      <p>In the drawings in which like numerals of reference indicate
        like parts in all of the figures, 1 represents the fuselage
        which may be of any approved construction, and it contains in
        its fore part the cabin door for the passengers and crew,
        suitable doors 2 being provided for ingress and egress and
        suitable windows 3 being provided for vision. </p>
      <p>An engine 4 is mounted on the nose of the fuselage and to its
        shaft is attached the usual propeller 5. 6 designates the front
        landing gear, 7 the tail skid, 8 the elevators, 9 the vertical
        fins and 10 the lateral steering rudders. </p>
      <p>All of the aforesaid parts may be of any approved design and
        construction. </p>
      <p>Extending laterally above the fuselage are the side wings 11,
        the inner ends of which are spaced apart and from the fuselage
        to leave vertical air channels between the ends of the winds and
        the fuselage, the ends of the wings providing vertical side
        walls 16. The wings are mounted on the fuselage by suitable
        cross beams and bracing 12 of any approved construction. </p>
      <p>Running longitudinally above the fuselage and extending between
        it and a top wing 13 is a partition 14, the side walls of which
        curve laterally upward at 17 and merge with the bottom surfaces
        18 of the top wing 13, the bottom surface 18 extending upwardly
        and outwardly from the center toward the sides of the wing,
        thereby defining a dihedral angle. </p>
      <p>The front edge of the top wing is straight across at its top
        and curves downwardly and inwardly as at 15, thus providing for
        the front edgeof the top of the wing to overhang the front edge
        of the side walls and also to overhang the motor. The wings 11
        also have their leading edge straight across the top, and their
        under surfaces incline upwardly and outwardly as at 19. </p>
      <p>The top wind is designed with a high lift factor and of thick
        camber in the middle. Across the top of the wing the line is
        straight from tip to tip with a pronounced dihedral form on the
        underside, being thickest in the center and tapering upwardly at
        the wing tips. Also in plan view the top wing preferably has its
        side edges converging rearwardly as shown best in Figure 3. </p>
      <p>It will be observed that the partition 14 runs longitudinally
        along the center of the fuselage midway between the adjacent
        ends of the side wings 11 and along the center of the top wing
        13. This provides tow channels, one at each side of the
        fuselage, and prevents the air from one channel crossing the
        fuselage laterally, the partition separating the air in air
        channels, and producing pressure on the sides of the partition
        and the dihedral undersides of the top wing to insure lateral
        stability especially when aided with the low center of gravity.
        And the upward pull of the high lift wing. </p>
      <p>By extending the nose of the top wing over the engine great
        leverage to lift the plane pout of a nosedive into a volplane is
        obtained. </p>
      <p>The front end of the partition 14 is rounded to offer as little
        head resistance as possible. </p>
      <p>It will also be noted from Figure 3 that the side wings along
        the chord are widest at their inner ends and narrowing toward
        the wing tips. The purpose of this is to produce the greatest
        lift near the center of gravity. By tapering the top wing from
        the front edge toward the back edge as shown in Figure 3, a
        greater lift of that wing is obtained forward and the lift is
        reduced at the rear end so as not to affect the tail of the
        plane. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing it will be seen that while planes with a top
        wing will not ordinarily produce good results, yet by providing
        the partition between the adjacent ends of the side wings it
        becomes possible for the top wing effectively to function when
        the plane over-balances laterally. This combination of the side
        and top wings with the center partition and air channels
        produces almost positive lateral stability. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing description, taken in connection with the
        accompanying drawings it is thought the complete construction,
        operation and advantages of my invention will be clear to those
        skilled in the art to which it relates. </p>

      <p>My present invention relates to the art of aerial navigation,
        and particularly to aeroplanes of the kind disclosed in my
        Patents # 1,750,529, issued March 11, 1930 and # 1,779,005,
        issued October 21, 1930. </p>
      <p>In the practical development of the aeroplanes disclosed in my
        said Letters Patent I have found by experiments and tests that
        the lifting power of the vacuum chamber exceeded my
        expectations, and I have further found that an aeroplane can be
        designed utilizing the principle of the vacuum chamber lift in
        which the wings can be wholly eliminated or reduced to dwarf
        wings, i.e., wings of little lifting power but of sufficient
        area to provide an aeroplane which has little or no wing area
        and yet possesses the principle advantages possessed by the
        planes of my patents aforesaid. </p>
      <p>Further, it is an object to provide an aeroplane with a vacuum
        chamber having dihedral flares extended laterally sufficiently
        to serve in place of wings entirely or substantially. </p>
      <p>Further, it is an object to provide such an aeroplane with
        dwarf wings, for example, which may extend at a level below that
        of the lateral flares so as to support the ailerons usually
        employed in aeroplanes. </p>
      <p>Other objects will in part be obvious and in part be pointed
        out hereinafter. </p>
      <p>To the attainment of the aforesaid objects and ends, the
        invention still further resides in the novel details of
        construction, combination and arrangement of parts, all of which
        will be first fully described in the following detailed
        description, then be particularly pointed out in the appended
        claims, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, in
        which: --- </p>

      <p>In the drawings I have illustrated my invention as applied to
        an open cockpit type of plane, although it is obvious that the
        invention may also be applied to cabin types, as indicated in my
        patents aforesaid. </p>
      <p>Referring now to the accompanying drawings, it will be observed
        that 1 represents the body of the aeroplane, which may be of any
        approved construction, the open cockpit type fuselage being
        illustrated for the purposes of this application. </p>
      <p>The front landing gear is indicated by 2 and the tailskid by 3,
        while the usual tail rudders and elevators are indicated by the
        numeral 4. The propeller is indicated by the numeral 5. In open
        cockpit type machines there are openings provided at 6 and 7 for
        the passengers and aviator, these openings being provided with
        side ports, if desired, or the aviator may simply step over the
        top of the fuselage into the openings provided. All of the
        aforesaid structure may be of any approved type, or in lieu of
        the open cockpit type of fuselage the cabin type, such as
        indicated in my prior patents, may be used. </p>
      <p>Extending upwardly along the top of the body is a fin or
        longitudinal structure 8,the side walls of which extend upwardly
        and laterally to merge with the under walls of the vacuum
        chamber that is located above the body 1 and united to it by the
        fin or longitudinal structure 8. At the front the fin 8 has an
        upwardly and forwardly inclined wall 9 from which extends
        upwardly and backwardly a wall 10, the walls 9 and 10
        constituting a nose of the fin and vacuum chamber. The vacuum
        chamber includes the central major portion 12 and the lateral
        portions 13, the latter being contained in a part of the lateral
        flares 11. The spread across the lateral flares from side to
        side is sufficient so that the vacuum chamber structure, i.e.,,
        the structure supported by the fin or longitudinal body 8, may
        support the weight of the entire flare without the use of the
        ordinary wings now so commonly employed in aeroplanes. </p>
      <p>The vacuum chamber may be3 provided with air buffers 15 for the
        same purpose as the air buffers 29 in my patent # 1,779,005. </p>
      <p>When desired short or dwarf wings 16 may extend outwardly from
        the vacuum chamber sides and carry ailerons 17 for the usual
        purposes. Where the area of the vacuum chamber, including the
        spread across the flares, is sufficient to sustain the vehicle
        the dwarf wings 16 are made only large enough to act as supports
        for the ailerons 17. Furthermore the length of the ailerons from
        fore to aft is very much less than the length of the vacuum
        chamber, as will be seen by reference particularly to Figures 1
        and 2. </p>
      <p>In interpreting the scope of this invention and the claims
        hereunto appended, I desire it understood that the term "body"
        is not to be limited to any particular type of body, be it open
        cockpit or cabin type, or be it simply a blind fuselage with a
        cabin suspended beneath, the gist of the present invention being
        in the provision of the vacuum chamber of such area, design and
        construction that it will furnish the greater part, if not all,
        of the lifting power of the machine, making it possible to
        wholly eliminate the use of wings or to use only dwarf wings as
        described. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing description, taken in connection with the
        accompanying drawings, it is thought that the complete
        construction, operation and advantages of my invention will be
        readily understood to those skilled in the art. </p>

      <p>My present invention relates to the art of aerial navigation
        and particularly to aeroplanes of the kind disclosed in my
        Letter Patents 1,750,529 issued March 11, 1930, 1,803,805 issued
        may 5, 1931, and 1,813,627 issued July 7, 1931. </p>
      <p>Primarily my present invention has for its objects to produce
        an aeroplane having a high degree of inherent stability,
        bringing closer the ratio of plane to pilot for safety; to
        provide one which needs less space for maneuvering, lass hanger
        room, one which can carry more useful load and has less
        production cost than the aeroplanes now commonly employed. </p>
      <p>Further, it is an object to provide for the concentration of
        lift close in to the center of gravity, the concentrated
        directional forces merging in a common point over a low center
        of gravity to produce a high degree of automatic stability or
        balance. </p>
      <p>Further, it is an object to provide an aeroplane in which the
        airfoil may be a conventional streamlined wing curve with slight
        modification, dihedral in form on the underside and air tight
        with the exception of an opening in the top surface to evacuate
        the air and produce low pressure within the airfoil (hereinafter
        termed "cellule"), creating relatively more lift than the
        conventional wing in one-half the span and thus concentrating
        the lifting forces close in to the center of gravity. </p>
      <p>Other objects will in part be obvious and in part to be pointed

      <p>In the drawings in which like numerals of reference indicate
        like parts in all of the figures, 1 represents the body proper
        of the aeroplane, which may be of any approved construction, 2
        indicates the front landing gear, 3 the tail skid, 4 the usual
        rudders an elevators and 5 the usual motor driven propeller. </p>
      <p>Extending upwardly from the body 1 is a vertical fin-like
        structure 6 which can be a part of the cabin in cabin-type
        planes if desired. This structure serves to connect the body
        with the airfoil. The vertical fin-like structure 6 is provided
        with an open chamber at the front, the forepart of which carries
        a transparent windshield 7 while the rear portion 8 may be used
        to enclose a vacuum chamber or pocket 20 that is in
        communication solely with the interior of the airfoil. </p>
      <p>The bow of the fin-like structure 6 is curved upwardly and
        forwardly as at 9 while the stern is curved downwardly and
        rearwardly as at 10. The airfoil preferably consists of a
        central level (approximately horizontal) part 11 from which
        extend laterally upwardly intermediate parts 12 that terminate
        in tip parts 13, the latter extending approximately parallel to
        the central part 11. Ailerons 14 are provided on the laterally
        extended ends 13 of the airfoil and operated in the usual way. </p>
      <p>The extreme lateral parts of the airfoil are preferably
        provided with tip boards 15 to prevent tip loss and tip drag. </p>
      <p>The airfoil consists of a hollow or chambered body composed of
        a suitable framing and an air-tight envelope covering; the
        covering being intact on the lower surface of the airfoil but
        having an opening 16 in the top surface through which the air
        may be sucked from within the airfoil to evacuate its chamber. </p>
      <p>18 designates the top covered part of the intermediate lateral
        extensions 12 of the airfoil while 19 indicates the top covering
        of the laterally extended ends or tips 13. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 9, which is
        a conventional type aeroplane consisting of the cabin 21 having
        the observation room 22 for the pilot and controls and having
        the conventional wing 23, I modify the construction by making
        the envelope of the wing of an air-tight covering and providing
        a transverse open slot 24 in the top as shown. </p>
      <p>In Figures 7 an 8 I have indicated diagrammatically the
        direction of forces acting to lift the aeroplane. In those
        figures A indicates the bottom surfaces of the intermediate
        portions of the airfoil whose ration of lift approximates 33-1/3
        % (the same as with conventional wings). B indicates the inside
        skin of the airfoil whose ratio of lift approximates 66-2/3 %
        (in the conventional wing its ratio is zero). C indicates the
        top surface of the airfoil whose ratio of lift approximates
        66-2/3 %, the same as with conventional wings. </p>
      <p>From these diagrammatic figures it will be observed that there
        is provided a higher degree of vacuum suction force within the
        airfoil; more efficiency, relatively, in the lift of the surface
        B as a whole; and more square feet exposed to lift surface B;
        and the open top area D allows suction to act on lower surface
        B, thereby increasing lower efficiency to 100%. </p>
      <p>While in the first five figures of the drawings I have shown
        the fin-like structure 6 as provided with a rear chamber 8 in
        communication with the interior of the airfoil to serve as a
        vacuum pocket, it is evident that this chamber or vacuum pocket
        may be dispensed with if desired in order to give more cabin
        room, as its presence is not absolutely essential to a proper
        working of the machine, though it does help in increasing the
        lifting power in a measure. </p>
      <p>I preferably provide air buffers 17 particularly where the
        airfoil is provided with large vents or openings in the top. </p>
      <p>While in the drawings the airfoil is of octagon shape in top
        plan, it could be made in other forms as for example with a
        round outside diameter in the form of a disc, but as the
        geometric form is not material to the invention I do not wish to
        be understood as being limited to any particular form, be it
        octagon, circular or otherwise. </p>
      <p>As heretofore intimated the airfoil is a streamlined wing curve
        with slight modifications, dihedral in form on the underside and
        airtight with the exception of an opening in the top surface of
        its envelope to evacuate the air and produce lower pressure
        within the airfoil. </p>
      <p>By reference especially to the diagrammatic Figures 7 and 8, it
        will be noted that the suction forces that normally acted on the
        top surface C takes action on the lower surface b due to the
        fact that the opening D brings them in contact with the
        rarefaction by suction. This brings efficiency of the lower
        surface B up, due to the fact that in the normal wing the
        suction lift is exposed to the upper skin C of the wing only. It
        will be readily seen that the action of this force adds lift to
        the lower surface A over and above the pressure forces utilized
        in the ordinary section. </p>
      <p>As vacuums and pressures distribute an equal poundage over
        every square inch of surface of a retainer, it will be readily
        seen that the much larger exposure that can be obtained in a
        cellule, gives a greater force value than can be obtained by the
        utilization of the upper surface C only, and when the exhaustion
        or rarefaction in proportion to the speed has taken place, the
        panel in its entirety conforms to the performance of the normal
        wing in regard to top surface exposed. </p>
      <p>The vents in the top surface of the airfoil should be located
        over the center of lift and about one-third distance back of the
        entering edge in order to localize the center of pressure in a
        moderate range over the center of gravity. The vents can be a
        lateral slot or slots, round or oval or holes, whichever should
        prove the most efficient in practice. </p>
      <p>In motion the suction lift forces on the inside bottom skin of
        the airfoil passing through the vents merge or concentrate
        directly over the center of lift (see Figure 8). Due to the
        narrow span of the airfoil the lift is concentrated close in and
        over the center of gravity producing inherent stability of a
        high degree, insuring maneuverability, bringing closer the ratio
        of plane and pilot, requiring less hanger space and being much
        cheaper and lighter to build than the conventional wing. Built
        up spars and ribs in the airfoil are not necessary but may be
        used if desired. </p>
      <p>Structurally the airfoil can be built in three sections, the
        middle or center section, a part of the fuselage, and the two
        outer sections bolted or hinged to the center section, folding
        down, or the airfoil can be built independently of the fuselage.
        Such details of manufacture are within the mechanical ability of
        aeroplane engineers and therefore illustration of the same in
        this application is thought to be unnecessary. </p>
      <p>It is important, however, that the fuselage and airfoil be
        connected longitudinally by a partition to prevent sideslip,
        such a partition as for instance the vertical fin-like structure
        8. </p>
      <p>The theory of getting additional lift from a given wing area is
        applicable to the conventional wing of today with few changes,
        simply by making the wing air-tight and supplying vents or
        openings in the top surface to evacuate the air, thus increasing
        the payload without an increase in structural weight (see Figure
        9). Lift is also exerted on the inside bottom skin of the
        airfoil above the cabin which, on the conventional wing, is
        negligible. On planes with large cabins this additional lift
        would greatly increase payload. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing description, taken in connection with the
        accompanying drawings, it is thought the complete construction,
        operation and advantages of my invention will be clear to those
        skilled in the art to which it relates. </p>

        issued march 11, 1930, 1,799,005 issued October 21, 1930 and
        1,813,627 issued July 7, 1931) has for an object to provide a
        small practical low-priced plane with a high degree of inherent
        stability and lower landing speed than has heretofore been
        obtained, in order to place a plane within the reach (from the
        standpoint of first cost and maintenance) of the average person.
      </p>
      <p>Further, it is an object to provide such a plane with either an

      <p>Further, it is an object to provide an aeroplane of the type
        referred to in which there is a midsection composed of the
        central fuselage-nacelle flanked by two cellules, at the outer
        sides of which are located longitudinal vanes which are
        preferably constructed as a part of the midsection and are
        functionally a part of the midsection of the airfoil to prevent
        air filtering into the open cellules from the top covered
        surfaces of the right and left wings. </p>
      <p>Further, it is an object of the invention to provide a plane,

      <p>In the drawings in which like numerals of reference indicate
        like parts in all of the figures, 1 is the nacelle, 2 the
        fuselage frame and 3 the seat in the cockpit while 4 designates
        the back wall of the cockpit and 5 indicates the front wall
        thereof. The engine is indicated by 6 and the propeller by 7, it
        being understood that when the plane is used as a glider the
        engine and propeller will be omitted. </p>
      <p>The machine is provided with the usual landing gear 8 and
        tailskid 29 as shown. The nose 9 of the nacelle, fuselage is
        provided with an upper covering 10. At each side of the central
        fuselage is a cellule 11 which extends at a dihedral angle to
        the fuselage, the cellule extending part-way along the tail
        portion 12 of the fuselage, the latter being composed of a frame
        triangular in cross-section and covered throughout. </p>
      <p>Horizontal rudders 13 and vertical rudders 14 are provided at
        the tail end of the fuselage and those portions of the side wall
        of the fuselage which extend to the rear of the wing line along
        the tail 12 are covered, as at 15, to reduce air friction. </p>
      <p>16 designates longitudinal vanes at the sides of the
        midsection, these vanes constituting a part of the mid-section
        and are for the purpose of preventing air from the top surfaces
        of the wings 26 from spilling over into the open tops of the
        cellules 11. The nose of the cellules 11 is covered at the top
        as at 17, the covering 17 and the covering 10 extending
        rearwardly to substantially the same distance, but leaving the
        major part of the cellules uncovered to the extreme rear thereof
        so that the cellules in this instance are in the nature of
        troughs, the front ends of which constitute the nose which is
        covered at the top, while the remainder of the top and the rear
        end is open. </p>
      <p>Each cellule 11 is provided with lateral buffers 18 which are
        designed to conform to the curvature of the cellules and whose
        functions are the same as those of the buffers 29 disclosed in
        my patent # 1,779,005. </p>
      <p>The cellules are cross-braced at the rear of the nose portions
        by walls or frames 19 preferably having the openings 20 to
        effect communication between the interior of the nose portions
        of the cellules and the open top chambered portions thereof. The
        longitudinal walls between the cockpit and the cellules are
        preferentially provided with openings 21 and 22 so that the area
        of low pressure may be extended into the cockpit chamber and
        nacelle. If desired, however, these openings 20 and 21 may be
        omitted, in which event they would be closed by suitable
        transparencies so that the aviator could look through the
        windows 23 in the bottom walls of the cellules for navigation
        purposes and in order to see his landing gear. </p>
      <p>The rear wall 4 may also be provided with openings 24
        communicating with the V-shaped channels formed between the
        covered longitudinal partition walls 15 and the inverted V walls
        of the tail 12. These pockets formed between 15 and 12 also
        constitute vacuum or suction chambers. </p>
      <p>A suitable wind shield 25 is provided to protect the aviator. </p>
      <p>The wings 26 extend laterally from the vanes 16 and may be
        built rigidly thereto or detachably or foldably secured thereto
        by methods now well known, which, however, do to per se
        constitute a part of the present invention. The wings 26 are
        also provided with the usual ailerons 27 and preferably, though
        not indispensably, wing tip boards 28 are provided for the usual
        purpose. </p>
      <p>In order that the aviator may enter the cockpit conveniently a
        series of light skeleton steps are provided on one of the walls
        15. </p>
      <p>It will be seen that the mid-section of the plane, composed of
        the fuselage proper and the adjacent cellules, constitutes the
        center section of the airfoil and is so designed as practically
        to eliminate the possibility of a crash due to forced landing by
        materially reducing the landing speed. This result has been
        accomplished by increasing the lift through the effective
        removal of what is known as boundary layer --- a mass of air
        lying on the top surface of a conventional wing, resulting in
        serious down pressure and loss of lift. See Figure 8. Air
        deflected by the leading edge is thrown back over the wing in a
        stream. The movement of the stream over the upper surface
        creates an area of low pressure, into which the wing is drawn
        giving lift to the entire pane, but all of the air is not
        deflected. It is this air which creates the boundary layer and
        prevents the pressure over the upper surface from being nearly
        so low, as it should be and, therefore, decreases the tendency
        to lift. </p>
      <p>Effective means for removing this boundary layer of down
        pressure is gained by omitting the top surface cover of the
        airfoil. With no covered top surface subject to down pressure,
        the boundary layer is dissipated or siphoned off by suction and
        lateral buffers and does not enter the area of low pressure
        within the airfoil (see Figure 9). </p>
      <p>The mid-section as a lift and stabilizing unit bringing into
        play surface not heretofore used, increases and concentrates the
        lift over the center of gravity, and the dihedral form, with low
        pressure within and increased pressures on the outside walls,
        insures equilibrium (see Figure 7). </p>
      <p>This plane is designed so as to reduce the quantity of
        materials, labor costs and weight to a minimum, without
        sacrificing quality or strength. </p>
      <p>It may be made either as a single-seater or designed to carry
        more than one person. </p>
      <p>In flight rain will not enter the area of the cellule and on
        the ground gravity permits the water to drain off. The open
        section of the airfoil is not subject to deterioration from
        moisture due to good air circulation and it also allows better
        inspection. The inside bottom skin of the cellules and nacelle
        can be sprayed with liquid rubber or any resilient waterproof
        dressing to preserve the skin. </p>
      <p>A plane constructed in accordance with my invention to carry a
        single passenger can be made with a span of 14 feet, a length of
        14 feet 9 inches, a height of 4 feet 6 inches and weigh when
        empty from 260 to 275 pounds. It may be driven by a 27 to 30
        horsepower motor. Of course, if a plane to carry more than one
        person is desired it will be made proportionately larger. The
        gasoline tank may be carried in the bottom of the nacelle or
        located in the wings as preferred. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing description, taken in connection with the
        accompanying drawings, it is thought the complete construction,
        operation and advantages of my invention will be clear to those
        skilled in the art to which it relates. </p>

        <p><b>( Cl. 244- 40 )</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The present invention relates to means for increasing the lift
        and flying qualities of an airfoil and it particularly has for
        its object to provide means to increase greatly the lift of an
        airplane at slow speeds without increasing the wing area; to
        provide means by virtue of which quicker takeoffs, faster
        climbs, slower landing speeds and higher top speeds can be
        attained than by the present types of planes. </p>
      <p>Another object of my invention is to provide a plane of the
        Lanier type with means by which the cellules may be provided
        with a top closure that can be put in place after the plane is
        in the air when it may become desirable to close the cellules. </p>
      <p>A further object is to provide, what I may term, an artificial
        slip stream of air over the airfoil while the plane is at rest,
        during the take-off and landing, which will be particularly
        valuable not only in powered aircraft but in gliders also, as it
        may be set up independently of a driving propeller. </p>
      <p>Other objects will in part be obvious and in part be pointed
        out hereinafter. </p>
      <p>TO the attainment of the aforesaid objects and inds, the
        invention still further resides in the novel details of
        construction, combination and arrangement of parts, all of which
        will be first fully described in the following detailed
        description, and then be particularly pointed out in the
        appended claims, reference being made to the accompanying

      <p>In the accompanying drawings in which like numbers and letters
        of reference indicate like parts in all the figures, 1 is the
        body of the plane, 2 the wings, 3 the cellules or vacuum
        chambers, and 6 the spars. </p>
      <p>The wings have closed bottoms, as at 4. The tops of the wings,
        except for the cellules, are closed as at 5, 5*. Following the
        contour of the top surfaces of the wings and crossing the
        cellules are streamlined air ducts 7 having rearwardly directed
        outlets which may be continuous slits 21a, Figure 7, a series of
        holes 21b, Figure 8, or any other suitable shapes, and the
        outlets of the ducts (7, 7x, 7y, 7z ( may have the
        cross-sectional form of either Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, or
        Figure 10, as found most effective in practice. </p>
      <p>In Figure 2 there is indicated a heater surface 20 on the
        bottom of the cellule. In Figure 5 the wall 16 has heating
        elements 20b. In Figure 6 the heating elements are individual
        members 20c. The heating elements may be of any approved kind
        and of desired shape or form. In Figure 11 three different forms
        of heating elements are indicated, namely: short rectangular
        heaters 20c, long rectangular heaters 20d, and individual
        circular heaters 20c; any style or all styles may be used as
        found most convenient. </p>
      <p>The fluid for creating the artificial or auxiliary air streams
        via the tubes or ducts 7 may be obtained in any desired way.
        Preferably, I provide a tank 11 for storing compressed air, see
        Figures 3 and 16. The tank may be charged and kept charged in
        any suitable way, as for example by means of a motor or
        engine-driven compressor 13 which takes in air through an
        opening 14 in the body 1 and passes it through a back check
        valve 12 into the tank 11 from which it is delivered as required
        via a manually controlled valve 10 and ducts 9 and 8 to the
        ducts 7, see Figure 3. As shown in Figure 16, the ducts 7g have
        individual valves 10x to control the velocity of the gaseous
        fluid from each duct 7g so as to create a smooth high velocity
        flow over the entire surface. </p>
      <p>Referring now to Figure 5, it will be seen that the cellule 3
        is provided with a top 16 that can be raised into place or
        lowered to the bottom of the cellule, or located at any desired
        intermediate position. This top 16 has transverse grooves 15 to
        receive the ducts 7b when the top is closed. </p>
      <p>Any suitable mechanism may be provided for mounting and for
        raising and lowering the top 16. For example, in Figure 5 I
        have, somewhat diagrammatically, shown cylinders, pivoted at 19,
        and having pistons (not shown) whose rods are connected to links
        17 that are in turn connected with the floor of the cellule
        (bottom of the wing) and with the top 16 in such manner that
        when the pistons are forced out by fluid pressure in the
        cylinders (admitted thereto by suitable means, not shown, under
        control of the aviator) the links will raise the top into place,
        and conversely as the pistons recede the links will lower the
        top to the place desired. </p>
      <p>In Figure 12 screw jacks 23, 24 are shown for lifting ad
        lowering the cover 16d, the jacks being operated by means of a
        worm shaft 25 and 26, the latter extending into the body 1d to a
        convenient place for operation by the aviator. </p>
      <p>In the modification shown in Figure 13, the cellule top 16a is
        hinged, as at 27, at the aft end and may be raised and lowered
        by a cylinder and piston device 18e, or other suitable means. </p>
      <p>In the modification shown in Figures 14 and 15 the cellule 3f
        extends to the aft edge of the wind or airfoil 2f and the cover
        is made in two major parts, one of which embodies the aft
        section 5xf which is hinged at 34 and is secured to a rotatable
        shaft which has a gear 35 meshing with a worm 36 on a shaft 37
        that is operated by a hand wheel 38 located in the body of the
        airplane; the other part is composed of hinged shutters 28 on
        rods 29 which have gears 30 that mesh with worms 31 on worm
        shaft 32 that has a hand wheel 33 for operation by the aviator.
      </p>
      <p>In Figures 4, 5, and 6 and in Figures 12 to 15 inclusive, those
        parts which correspond to like parts in Figures 1 and 2 bear the
        same reference numerals plus the index letter a (Fig. 4), b,
        (Fig 5), c (Fig 6), d (Fig 12), e (Fig 13, and f (Figs 14 and
        15, respectively. In Fig 17 those parts which correspond to like
        parts in Fig 4 bear the same reference indicia plus the prime
        mark. In Fig 18 the parts which are the same as those in Fig 16
        bear the same reference indicia as in Fig 4 plus the double
        prime mark, 20a indicating heaters. </p>
      <p>It is a well known fact in aerodynamics that as the velocity of
        air is increased over an airfoil, the pressure on the top
        surface will decrease; and naturally the lower the pressure on
        the top of the airfoil the higher the lift will be. Lift is
        produced on an airfoil by the forward motion of the airplane
        moving through the fluid (air) and causing a diversion of the
        airflow to produce a negative pressure on the top and a positive
        pressure on the underside of the airfoil. As the speed of the
        airplane decreases, so does the velocity of the airflow over the
        airfoil, The smoother the flow, the higher the velocity. The
        greater the velocity, the higher the lift. </p>
      <p>In my invention lift is not totally dependent upon forward
        speed or motion of the airfoil moving through the air. With my
        invention embodied in an airplane, a considerable degree of
        negative pressure can be produced on top of the airfoil while
        the plane is at rest on the ground. This adds greatly to the
        quick lift of the plane as it starts over the ground and also
        enables the plane to land in a much smaller area than would be
        the case were my invention not used. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing it may be readily seen that the result will
        be a plane of greater load carrying capacity. Reduced takeoff
        and landing speeds, etc. The boundary layer flow should be
        favorably influenced so as top reduce drag and increase the
        burble point. The speed should also be greatly increased due to
        the practicability of using an airfoil section with extremely
        low drag characteristics. </p>
      <p>The streamlined tubes 7 may be made of steel, dural,
        wood-plastic, plastic, or like material. The number to be used
        in any given installation and the proper distances apart will be
        determined by tests well within te skills of the aviation
        engineer. </p>
      <p>The compressed air flowing from the tubes of the airfoil
        rearwardly, creating a negative pressure on the topside of the
        airfoil over the cellules, thereby creating suction lift
        according to the degree of negative pressure created. The degree
        of negative pressure is dependent upon the velocity of the air
        or gas flowing from the tube outlets. In practice it is
        preferable that the velocity of the fluid issuing from ducts 7
        be so equalized in each jet, as to make a smooth flow moving
        from fore to aft of the airfoil. </p>
      <p>By heating the air in the cellules, or topside of the airfoils,
        the molecules of air are split, thus making the air lighter.
        This lighter air is easier to move by suction than heavy cool
        air, and a faster and greater reduction of the pressure on the
        top side of the airfoil is the result. </p>
      <p>If desired, the jets and heat need not be operated excepts for
        takeoffs and landings. </p>
      <p>My invention is adaptable to all shapes and aspect rations of
        wings. </p>
      <p>The pressure to create the tube jet velocity may be made either
        by the use of a gas-mixing chamber and pressure valves connected
        to the tubes, or by using an air scoop in front of the plane,
        preferably at the front of the motor, or by the means
        hereinbefore referred to an illustrated in Fig 3. The compressed
        air in the tank will allow landings to take place without the
        main motor running. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing description, taken in connection with the
        accompanying drawings, it is thought that the complete
        construction, operation and advantages of my invention will be
        clear to those skilled in the art. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> An aircraft provided with airfoils of the
        non-rotating type that are configured and arranged to provide
        greater lift while at the same time offering stable flight at
        ultra-low airspeeds. The airfoils are arranged as a biplane and
        consist of a fixed wing and a movable wing which are designed so
        as to permit a much steeper takeoff and landing angle as well as
        offering more efficient flight at higher speeds with greater
        inherent safety. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to aeronautics and more specifically to
        airfoils, of the so called biplane type, and their relationship
        and arrangement with respect to one another as distinguished
        from airfoil construction. </p>
      <p>The design of an aircraft, particularly commercial and
        corporate types, which can safely operate in limited areas, such
        as city centers and suburban airports, has been and still is a
        goal of the aircraft industry. In this endeavor the industry has
        leaned towards a VTOL, vertical take off and landing, and STOL,
        short take off and landing, aircraft. The complexity of the VTOL
        type of aircraft together with its marginal safety and
        performance in certain flight areas, as well as its high cost,
        has resulted in directing the efforts of some manufacturers
        towards the STOL concept. </p>
      <p>In the majority of instances a VTOL aircraft utilizes a rotary
        wing or a tilt-jet flow principle for propulsion, such as in the
        British Harrier type of aircraft. As distinguished from the
        foregoing a STOL aircraft employs lower wing and power loadings
        plus high lift devices, such as large slots and flaps to
        increase the lift characteristics of the aircraft and thus
        provide various degrees of STOL capability. </p>
      <p>It is known that aspect ratio serves an important function in
        aircraft wing design. A high performance glider is made with a
        very high aspect ratio while a high aspect ratio is employed in
        high load cargo or passenger planes. The high aspect ratio
        provides less induced drag and a higher lift at a lower angle of
        attack while increasing the range of the aircraft. On the other
        hand the same type of aircraft having a very low aspect ratio
        wing would be relatively inefficient. </p>
      <p>A very low aspect ratio wing of proper design gives high lift
        and drag at large landing angles. However its drag is low at low
        angles of attack as is its lift. A low aspect ratio wing is less
        efficient than a high aspect ratio wing for high load long range
        duties, but a low aspect ratio wing is very good for steep
        approach landings while its stall angle of attack is very high.
        Thus each type has its advantages and its disadvantages. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention is directed to a STOL type of aircraft
        utilizing the principle of a biplane in conjunction with certain
        of the advantages of both a high aspect ratio wing and a low
        aspect ratio wing. The aircraft is provided with a variable
        movable upper wing and a fixed lower wing that is provided with
        circulation augmenters. The movable or variable upper wing is
        pivotally mounted upon suitable forward supports so the wing can
        change its angle of incidence in relation to the position of the
        lower fixed wing. The foregoing arrangement permits the upper
        wing to achieve, within reason and independent of the lower
        wing, any position or angle of attack that might be desired. </p>
      <p>The present invention tends to increase the lift of the
        circulation augmented lower fixed wing on take-off and landing
        by the creation of a trough or channel effect of accelerated air
        flowing from the variable movable wing that is caused by the
        positive change of angle of attack of said movable wing. The
        lower fixed wing is of a high aspect ratio type while the
        movable upper wing is a low aspect ratio type. The adjustability
        of the upper wing enables same to be unloaded by decreasing its
        angle of attack so that said wing is capable of floating through
        a certain plus and minus range. Such an arrangement permits the
        upper wing to automatically seek the minimum drag cruise or high
        speed incidence positioned for various total aircraft loadings.
        In this manner most of the total aircraft lift is shifted to the
        fixed bottom high aspect ratio wing with its low induced drag
        and thereby increasing the wing loading of the lower wing. The
        upper wing thus functions mostly as a streamlined nacelle for
        the engines and for giving directional stability. This is
        important for smooth high speed flying. </p>
      <p>One of the objects of the present invention is to provide an
        aircraft having a fixed large span lower wing and a movable or
        adjustable short span upper wing. The adjustability or
        movability of the upper wing in relation to the fixed lower wing
        tends to provide for optimum cruise and high speed
        characteristics plus optimum load carrying and super short
        take-off and landing at slow speed characteristics in a single
        aircraft. Thus the concept of the present invention will provide
        for an aircraft having a super-slow take-off and landing
        characteristics, plus an unusually high cruising speed per
        horsepower with high load capabilities, plus ultra safety. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Referring to the drawings there is shown in FIG. 1 an aircraft
        having a fuselage 10 with a vertical fin and rudder assembly 12.
        A horizontal stabilizer 13 is provided in the nose portion of
        the aircraft as distinguished from having same mounted in the
        conventional manner in the empennage. The fuselage 10 has
        mounted thereon a fixed bottom or lower high aspect ratio wing
        14. A conventional nose wheel 16 is mounted on the lower surface
        of the forward portion of the fuselage 10 while the lower
        surface of the bottom wing 14 is provided with the conventional
        main landing gear and wheels 18. </p>
      <p>The upper surface of the fuselage 10 is provided with a pair of
        vertically extending streamlined support members 20 that are
        disposed about mid-chordwise of the fixed lower wing 14. The
        support members 20 are each disposed at an acute angle with
        respect to a vertical plane through the fuselage 10 and lower
        wing 14 and are secured at their outer ends to the lower surface
        of an upper low aspect ratio wing 22. The outer ends of the
        support members 20 are secured to the upper wing 22 in such a
        manner as to permit the wing to move or pivot with respect to
        said supports, in the manner as shown in broken lines in FIG.
        10, so that said movement provides for a variable incidence
        upper wing 22. The support members 20 are preferably streamlined
        and same are attached or hinged to the upper wing 22 near its
        center of lift. </p>
      <p>The aft of trailing edge of the upper wing is provided with a
        single streamlined support 24 that is carried by the fuselage
        10. The support 24 is capable of vertical movement or adjustment
        which may be occasioned by hydraulic means, such as a piston and
        cylinder structure of a suitable mechanical movement such as a
        vertically movable shaft. The movement or adjustment of the
        support 24 causes the upper wing 22 to pivot about or with
        respect to the forward support members 20 so that said wing can
        become variable and change its angle of incidence in relation to
        the lower fixed wing 14 and by the pivotal connection to the
        support members 20 the upper wing can achieve any position or
        angle of attack desired independent of the aircraft attitude. </p>
      <p>The upper wing 22, as illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 11 is
        relatively thick and is of small span with rather large dihedral
        angles. This shape of the upper wing extends from the forward or
        leading edge to the trailing edge and is relatively true and
        consistent for both the top and bottom of the airfoil. A wing
        having this configuration of a deep chord and narrow span with
        large degrees of dihedral tends to give less drag at speeds
        corresponding to climb and cruise. Such a wing at high positive
        incidence angles tends to create a certain type of drag effect
        that is needed for ultra slow landings. An upper wing of the
        foregoing type or shape would not provide for a practical
        airplane without having a lower large span fixed wing 14 in
        combination therewith. </p>
      <p>The direction of lift forces on said upper wing 22 is shown in
        FIG. 11 by broken line arrows that terminate in an apex which is
        the center line of the aircraft. This forms a stability factor
        that assumes considerable importance when the aircraft is
        travelling at ultra-slow speeds. The shape of the upper wing
        also provides for a trough effect on the upper surface which
        tends to protect against the loss of low pressure or partial
        vacuum on said surface. The upper wing 22 is provided with a
        pair of jet turbo-shaft engines 26 that are embedded in said
        upper wing and are provided with contra-rotating propellers 27.
        As shown in FIG. 3 the engines 26 are cross shafted by means of
        a central gear box 28 so if one engine should fail both of the
        propellers 27 would continue to operate from the remaining
        engine. The upper wing 22 is also provided on its leading edge
        with air intakes 29 for the turbo-shaft engines 26 and the
        exhaust from said engines may be directed to an exit on the
        trailing edge of said upper wing to further increase the lift
        characteristics of the aircraft. It is to be understood that in
        lieu of the jet turbo-shaft engines 26 that turbo prop engines
        could be employed. </p>
      <p>The upper wing 22 is, by means of the adjustable support 24,
        adjusted to the desired angle of attack so that the angle of
        incidence of the variable incidence upper wing in relation to
        the lower fixed wing position will be set and locked in said
        position for short steep take-off or for steep approach and
        short landings. If the upper wing is thus set for take-off, then
        after the take-off a level flight attitude has been realized,
        the upper wing 22, through the adjustable support 24, may have
        its angle of attack decreased until said wing is unloaded which
        would be the condition for optimum high speed and cruise
        performance. Thus most of the total lift of the aircraft would
        then be shifted to the bottom high aspect ratio wing 14. The
        upper wing 22, through its pivotal connection to the forward
        supports 20 and the adjustable rear support 24, could be
        arranged to float through a range of possibly 4.degree. negative
        to a 4.degree. positive incidence range so that the upper wing
        would automatically seek the minimum drag cruise or high speed
        incidence position dependent upon the airfcraft loading. </p>
      <p>Thus when the aircraft takes off and climbs to its designated
        altitude it is then prepared for traveling to its destination at
        cruising speed by unloading the top or upper wing. When the top
        wing is unloaded by the pilot through the support 24 the upper
        wing will automatically seek its lowest drag angle for a given
        aircraft cargo, passenger and fuel weight. At this time the
        upper wing can establish its minimum drag attitude in
        coordination with the fixed lower wing and the overall aircraft
        and thereby produce a highly efficient cruising speed for large
        variable passenger and cargo loads. When the upper wing 22
        reaches the aforementioned conditions the pilot then through the
        adjustable support 24 is able to lock the wing in said position.
        When so locked most of the lift will be shifted to the lower
        wide span fixed wing 14 and its true wing loading will increase
        while the true wing loading of the upper narrow span wing 22
        will decrease. In this unloaded condition the upper wing 22 is
        acting in the manner of a streamlined nacelle. When the aircraft
        subsequently approaches an airport for the purpose of landing to
        discharge passengers and cargo the upper wing is again adjusted
        by the pilot to the correct angle of attack for landing which of
        course changes the angle of incidence of the upper wing 22 with
        respect to the fixed lower wing 14. If after landing additional
        fuel or cargo is added or the passenger loading is changed the
        pilot will upon taking the aircraft off and climbing to his
        designated cruising altitude will upon reaching said altitude
        readjust the setting of the upper wing for minimum drag attitude
        after which said upper wing can be locked into position by the
        adjustable support 24. </p>
      <p>There is shown in FIGS. 4 to 6 a modified version of the
        aircraft of FIG. 1 in that the upper wing 122 does not embody
        the center line of chord dihedral angles such as shown in FIG.
        2. The upper wing 122 is provided with a pair of engines 126
        which are positioned within suitable nacelles 128 to provide for
        a streamlining effect, although it is to be noted that the
        nacelles extend both above and below the wing. The engines 126
        are provided with propellers 130 which may be of the high lift
        design in order to afford maximum lift to the aircraft in its
        short take-off procedure. In view of the high angle of attack at
        which the upper wing may safely operate, the lift of the
        propellers becomes a very sizeable factor as the air flow from
        the propellers flows over the low aspect ratio narrow span upper
        wing 22. The change or variance of the angle of attack of the
        upper wing 22 will result in the creation of a trough or channel
        effect with respect to the lower fixed wing 14 so that the lift
        of said lower wing will be further increased. In addition the
        slip-stream from the propellers 130 will further increase the
        acceleration of air moving through said trough or channel and
        thus increase the lift of the lower wing particularly at
        take-off and landing attitudes. </p>
      <p>The aircraft shown in FIG. 7 through 9 is similar in most
        respects to the aircraft shown in FIGS. 1 through 3 as the upper
        wing 22 is provided with the same dihedral angles. The aircraft
        of FIGS. 7 through 9 is provided with a pair of jet engines 226
        in the upper wing 22 which engines are positioned within
        suitable nacelles 32. The upper wing 22 substantially
        encompasses the engines 226 and the exhaust from said engines
        may be ducted to the trailing edge 34 of the wing 22 where
        suitable exits 36, FIG. 9, are provided. </p>
      <p>As regards the upper wing support members 20, in the various
        forms as illustrated, it is important that the pivot points or
        rotation points of the upper wing on said supports be on the
        center of lift for a given airfoil section. This may readily
        vary with different airfoil sections from approximately 25% to
        50% of the wing chord. The necessity of having the pivot point
        or points on the center of lift of the upper wing 22 becomes
        apparent when it is realized that the wing is unloaded and the
        aircraft is on automatic pilot if the attaching point is
        rearward or forward of the center of lift position the free
        floating upper wing, will at cruising speed, exert either a nose
        up or nose down pitching moment. Thus if the attaching or
        rotation point of the upper wing 22 with respect to the supports
        20 is not on the center of lift of the wing, the wing will be
        fighting itself and the aircraft and this would defeat the
        automatic unloading factor of the present invention. </p>
      <p>Although the foregoing description is necessarily of a detailed
        character, in order that the invention may be completely set
        forth, it is to be understood that the specific terminology is
        not intended to be restrictive or confining and that various
        rearrangements of parts and modifications of detail may be
        resorted to without departing from the scope or spirit of the
        invention as herein claimed. </p>

      <p>passage being converging from, and rising upwardly and
        rearwardly from an inlet on the lower aerofoil surface, the
        passage being defined by a fixed front wall and a rear wall 63
        movable from a closed position, Fig. 1, in which both ends of
        the passage are closed, and a passage open position, Fig. 2, in
        which a lower portion 62 of the rear wall forms a scoop
        projecting below the lower surface of the aerofoil, there being
        a flap 74 pivoted on this lower portion which moves from a
        closed position flush with the aerofoil, Fig. 1, to an open
        position projecting below the scoop. Fig. 2. There may be a
        further flap 29 on the upper aerofoil surface, and a further
        converging passage 17 further forward on the aerofoil. The
        movable rear wall may comprise a flexible surface 63, 53 of
        which the upper part is pulled open by a link 66, 58, the lower
        part only being attached to ribs 64, 43 which pivot at 66, 56 to
        open the inlet of the passage. The scoop 62 and the flap 74,
        Fig. 4, both assist in increasing the airflow through the
        passage, where it is accelerated and then added to the boundary
        layer on the upper aerofoil surface. It is stated that an
        aircraft with wings of a cross-section as shown flew at 19 miles
        per hour without loss of height. Actuation,-The linkage may be
        controlled by torque tubes 19, 21 which in turn control either
        rods, as shown, or cables, and/or possibly hydraulic circuitry
        or electric servomotors. Actuation of torque tube 21 alone will
        move spoiler flap 29 only (by links 23 and 28), the compensatory
        mechanisms 24, 26 imparting no movements to arms 47, 69 until
        arms 46, 68 are moved by torque tube 19. Movement of torque tube
        19 opens both the passages 17, 18, the throat of the front
        passage 17 being controlled by link 34, bellcrank 36 and link
        58, and link 32, crank 33 and link 42 controlling the movement
        of rib 54 pivoting at 56, links 34, 37 transmitting control to
        similar linkages for the rear passage 18. As the front passage
        is opened crank 33 transmits via rod 44 a movement to arm 46 of
        the compensating mechanism 24. This transmits a portion of this
        movement to arm 47, the portion depending on the position of arm
        31. Movement of arm 47 controls flap 57 by link 48, bellcrank 49
        and link 51. The rear flap 74 is similarly controlled via
        compensating mechanism 26. </p>
