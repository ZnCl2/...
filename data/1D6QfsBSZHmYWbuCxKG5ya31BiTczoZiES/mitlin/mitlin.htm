      </div>
      <b><br>
        By James Morgan<br>
      </b><br>
      The waste fibres from hemp crops can be transformed into
      high-performance energy storage devices, scientists say.<br>
      <br>
      They "cooked" cannabis bark into carbon nanosheets and built
      supercapacitors "on a par with or better than graphene" - the
      industry gold standard.<br>
      <br>
      Electric cars and power tools could harness this hemp technology,
      the US researchers say.<br>
      <br>
      They presented their work at the American Chemical Society meeting
      in San Francisco.<br>
      <br>
      "People ask me: why hemp? I say, why not?" said Dr David Mitlin of
      Clarkson University, New York, who describes his device in the
      journal ACS Nano.<br>
      <br>
      "We're making graphene-like materials for a thousandth of the
      price - and we're doing it with waste.<br>
      <br>
      "The hemp we use is perfectly legal to grow. It has no THC in it
      at all - so there's no overlap with any recreational activities."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Secret sauce</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In countries including China, Canada and the UK, hemp can be grown
      industrially for clothing and building materials.<br>
      <br>
      But the leftover bast fibre - the inner bark - typically ends up
      as landfill.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Mitlin's team took these fibres and recycled them into
      supercapacitors - energy storage devices which are transforming
      the way electronics are powered.<br>
      <br>
      Conventional batteries store large reservoirs of energy and
      drip-feed it slowly, whereas supercapacitors can rapidly discharge
      their entire load.<br>
      <br>
      They are ideal in machines that rely on sharp bursts of power. In
      electric cars, for example, supercapacitors are used for
      regenerative braking.<br>
      <br>
      Releasing this torrent requires electrodes with high surface area
      - one of graphene's many phenomenal properties.<br>
      <br>
      Stronger than diamond, more conductive than copper and more
      flexible than rubber, the "miracle material" was the target of a
      £50m investment by UK Chancellor George Osborne.<br>
      <br>
      But while this carbon monolayer is the state-of-the-art material
      for commercial supercapacitors, it is prohibitively expensive to
      produce.<br>
      <br>
      Finding cheap, sustainable alternatives is the speciality of Dr
      Mitlin's former research group at the University of Alberta.<br>
      <br>
      They have experimented with all flavours of biowaste - from peat
      moss to eggs. Most recently, they turned banana peel into
      batteries.<br>
      <br>
      You can do really interesting things with bio-waste. We've pretty
      much figured out the secret sauce of it," said Dr Mitlin.<br>
      <br>
      The trick is to tailor the right plant fibre to the right
      electrical device - according to their organic structure.<br>
      <br>
      "With banana peels, you can turn them into a dense block of carbon
      - we call it pseudo-graphite - and that's great for sodium ion
      batteries," he explained.<br>
      <br>
      "But if you look at hemp fibre its structure is the opposite - it
      makes sheets with high surface area - and that's very conducive to
      supercapacitors."<br>
      <br>
      The first step, he explained, "is to cook it - almost like a
      pressure cooker. It's called hydrothermal synthesis.<br>
      <br>
      "Once you dissolve the lignin and the semicellulose, it leaves
      these carbon nanosheets - a pseudo-graphene structure."<br>
      <br>
      By fabricating these sheets into electrodes and adding an ionic
      liquid as the electrolyte, his team made supercapacitors which
      operate at a broad range of temperatures and a high energy
      density.<br>
      <br>
      Direct comparisons with rival devices are complicated by the
      variety of measures for performance.<br>
      <br>
      But Mitlin's peer-reviewed journal paper ranks the device "on par
      with or better than commercial graphene-based devices".<br>
      <br>
      "They work down to 0C and display some of the best power-energy
      combinations reported in the literature for any carbon.<br>
      <br>
      "For example, at a very high power density of 20 kW/kg (kilowatt
      per kilo) and temperatures of 20, 60, and 100C, the energy
      densities are 19, 34, and 40 Wh/kg (watt-hours per kilo)
      respectively."<br>
      <br>
      Fully assembled, their energy density is 12 Wh/kg, which can be
      achieved at a charge time less than six seconds.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Growth industry</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      "Obviously hemp can't do all the things graphene can," Dr Mitlin
      concedes.<br>
      <br>
      "But for energy storage, it works just as well. And it costs a
      fraction of the price -$500-1,000 a tonne."<br>
      <br>
      Having established a proof of principle, his start-up company Alta
      Supercaps is hoping to begin small-scale manufacturing.<br>
      <br>
      It plans to market devices to the oil and gas industries - where
      high-temperature operation is a valuable asset.<br>
      <br>
      His move to the US coincides with a change in regulatory attitudes
      - with signs that hemp could be making a comeback.<br>
      <br>
      In China the crop is widely cultivated, and in Canada, the
      industry for textiles is growing.<br>
      <br>
      "Fifty miles down the road from my house in Alberta there was an
      agricultural hemp processing facility. And all that bast fibre -
      it just sits in a high bay, and they don't know what to do with
      it," Dr Mitlin told BBC News.<br>
      <br>
      "It's a waste product looking for a value-added application.
      People are almost paying you to take it away."<br>
      <br>
      And if the technology really takes off - it could help economies,
      he argues.<br>
      <br>
      "It's a robust plant - you can even grow it in Alberta, Manitoba.<br>
      <br>
      "A lot of farmers would be thrilled to grow hemp."<br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>[ Excerpt ]</b><br>
      <br>
      In 1937, Popular Science published an article called “Hemp: The
      New Billion-Dollar Crop” that listed over 25,000 potential uses
      for the plant.<br>
      <br>
      While this ancient crop has recently started to gain popularity
      around the world, it still hasn’t received the attention it
      deserves.<br>
      <br>
      Which might be due to the fact that hemp is just a type of
      marijuana that can’t get you high.<br>
      <br>
      But as more countries start to see the benefits of this incredibly
      eco-friendly crop, a lot of cool R&amp;D has been happening behind
      the scenes. Here’s 5 of our favorite innovations being developed
      from hemp:<br>
      <br>

      <b>5. Graphene-Like Nanomaterial</b><br>
      <br>
      Canadian engineers believe hemp could revolutionize nanotechnology<br>
      <br>
      Graphene is often touted as the future of nanotechnology and the
      thinnest, strongest, and lightest material ever made. But how does
      hemp compare? Apparently, it’s even better.<br>
      <br>
      Earlier this year, chemical engineers from the University of
      Alberta turned hemp fiber into a nanomaterial with similar
      properties as graphene, but a much lower price tag.<br>
      <br>
      What’s more, when it comes to making energy storage devices like
      batteries and supercapacitors, the hemp nanomaterial showed
      “superior electrochemical storage properties” compared to
      graphene.<br>
      <br>
      Research is still in its early stages, but if the results hold,
      hemp could eventually be used for a wide range of nanotechnology
      applications, from flashlights to solar cells. <br>

        <i>Electronics: Researchers turn agricultural waste into a

      Graphene might one day be used in batteries, solar cells,
      transparent electrodes, and a host of other electronic gadgets.
      But graphene is still quite expensive to make. Now researchers at
      the University of Alberta have demonstrated a low-cost process for
      turning agricultural waste into graphenelike nanomaterials for use
      in energy storage electronics (ACS Nano 2013, DOI:
      10.1021/nn400731g).<br>
      <br>
      With high surface area and conductivity, graphene is ideal for use
      as electrodes in batteries and supercapacitors, which are energy
      storage devices that excel at providing quick bursts of power.
      Supercapacitors charge and discharge faster than batteries can
      because they store energy in the form of fast-moving charges on
      the surfaces of their electrodes. Currently, supercapacitors are
      used in braking systems for buses and fast-charging flashlights.<br>
      <br>
      Commercial supercapacitors use activated carbon electrodes, but
      experimental devices made with graphene can store more energy.
      Unfortunately, graphene’s production costs can’t come close to
      competing with the price for activated carbon, about $40 per
      kilogram, says University of Alberta chemical engineer David
      Mitlin.<br>
      <br>
      Part of Mitlin’s research is finding ways to use plant waste as
      feedstocks for commercial materials. He thought he could transform
      waste from the cannabis plant (Cannabis sativa) into a carbon
      nanomaterial that had similar properties to graphene and with a
      much smaller price tag. The cannabis plant’s notorious use is for
      producing marijuana, but people also grow the plant to use its
      fibrous parts for products such as rope, clothing, oil, and
      plastics. The plants used for these industrial applications are
      referred to as hemp, and have lower levels of psychoactive
      compounds. Hemp is relatively inexpensive, since the plant grows
      rapidly in a variety of climates without the need for fertilizer
      and pesticides.<br>
      <br>
      Mitlin and his colleagues focused on a barklike layer of the plant
      called the bast, which is usually incinerated or sent to landfills
      during industrial hemp production. “Hemp bast is a nanocomposite
      made up of layers of lignin, hemicellulose, and crystalline
      cellulose,” Mitlin says. “If you process it the right way, it
      separates into nanosheets similar to graphene.”<br>
      <br>
      The Alberta researchers start the process by heating the bast at
      180 °C for 24 hours. During this step, the lignin and
      hemicellulose break down, and the crystalline cellulose begins to
      carbonize. The researchers then treat the carbonized material with
      potassium hydroxide and crank up the temperature to 700 to 800 °C,
      causing it to exfoliate into nanosheets riddled with pores 2 to 5
      nm in diameter. These thin, porous materials provide a quick path
      for charges to move in and out, which is important when a
      supercapacitor charges and discharges.<br>
      <br>
      The team built a supercapacitor using the nanosheets as electrodes
      and an ionic liquid as an electrolyte. The best property of the
      device, Mitlin says, is its maximum power density, a measure of
      how much power a given mass of the material can produce. At 60 °C,
      the material puts out 49 kW/kg; activated carbon used in
      commercial electrodes supplies 17 kW/kg at that temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Liming Dai, a chemical engineer at Case Western Reserve
      University, says the hempbased material shows promise as a
      low-cost substitute for graphene. Yury Gogotsi, a materials
      scientist at Drexel University, sees room for improvement. He
      points out that the 24-hour high-temperature process will have
      some associated costs when scaled up. But he’s impressed by this
      first step. Finding scalable production methods like this one will
      be key, Gogotsi says, if researchers want to move nanostructured
      materials out of the lab and into the marketplace.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      We created unique interconnected partially graphitic carbon
      nanosheets (10–30 nm in thickness) with high specific surface area
      (up to 2287 m2 g–1), significant volume fraction of mesoporosity
      (up to 58%), and good electrical conductivity (211–226 S m–1) from
      hemp bast fiber. The nanosheets are ideally suited for low (down
      to 0 °C) through high (100 °C) temperature ionic-liquid-based
      supercapacitor applications: At 0 °C and a current density of 10 A
      g–1, the electrode maintains a remarkable capacitance of 106 F
      g–1. At 20, 60, and 100 °C and an extreme current density of 100 A
      g–1, there is excellent capacitance retention (72–92%) with the
      specific capacitances being 113, 144, and 142 F g–1, respectively.
      These characteristics favorably place the materials on a Ragone
      chart providing among the best power–energy characteristics (on an
      active mass normalized basis) ever reported for an electrochemical
      capacitor: At a very high power density of 20 kW kg–1 and 20, 60,
      and 100 °C, the energy densities are 19, 34, and 40 Wh kg–1,
      respectively. Moreover the assembled supercapacitor device yields
      a maximum energy density of 12 Wh kg–1, which is higher than that
      of commercially available supercapacitors. By taking advantage of
      the complex multilayered structure of a hemp bast fiber precursor,
      such exquisite carbons were able to be achieved by simple
      hydrothermal carbonization combined with activation. This novel
      precursor-synthesis route presents a great potential for facile
      large-scale production of high-performance carbons for a variety
      of diverse applications including energy storage.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) electrochemically
      supercapacitive arrays is disclosed. The arrays comprise
      multi-walled carbon nanotubes conformally covered by
      nanocrystalline functional materials such as vanadium nitride and
      firmly anchored to glassy carbon or Inconel electrodes. These
      nanostructures demonstrate a respectable specific capacitance of
      289 F/g, which is achieved in 1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate
      of 20 m V/s. The well-connected highly electrically conductive
      structures exhibit a superb rate capability; at a very high scan
      rate of 1000 m V/s there is less than a 20% drop in the
      capacitance relative to 20 m V/s. Such rate capability has never
      been reported for VN and is highly unusual for any other oxide or
      nitride. These 3D arrays also display nearly ideal triangular
      voltage profiles during constant current charge-discharge cycling.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0003] Electrochemical capacitors (ECs), have attracted wide
      interest as energy storage/conversion devices owing to their
      outstanding properties of high power delivery, rapid
      charge/discharge rates, high cycle efficiency, and extremely long
      cycle life. Such predominant advantages make them good candidates
      in a large variety of applications including portable electronics,
      hybrid and fully electric vehicles, and load leveling for
      stationary power. Depending on the charge-storage mode,
      electrochemical capacitors are generally classified into two major
      types: electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC) and
      pseudocapacitor. The capacitance in the former is electrostatic in
      origin, arising from charge separation at the interface of the
      high specific- area electrode and electrolyte. Activated,
      mesoporous, and carbide-derived carbons, graphene, carbon fabrics,
      fibers, nanotubes, onions, and nanohorns as well as various
      nanostructured polymers with high specific surface area and
      moderate cost have been widely investigated for EDLC applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Pseudo-capacitors that utilize transition metal nitride
      electrode materials are attracting increasing scientific
      attention. These nitrides were recently named as one of the three
      greatest recent achievements in the electrochemical capacitor
      field. Compared to transition metal oxides, transition metal
      nitrides exhibit superior properties in some respects, such as
      markedly better electrical conductivity and in some cases
      excellent chemical stability. Various materials such as molybdenum
      nitrides (MoN and Mo2N) and vanadium nitride (VN) have been
      investigated for electrochemical capacitor use. Among the
      nitrides, VN is considered to be one of the more promising
      materials. In previous studies of VN, however, the capacitance
      would significantly degrade at high voltage scanning rates/
      current densities. For example, the superb capacitance reported in
      reference 13 degraded by more than 50% when an intermediate scan
      rate of 100 mV/s was utilized.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Another promising supercapacitive technology is based on
      nanocomposites, with an inner electrically conducting tubular core
      and an outer nanoscale functional coating. Due to their excellent
      electrical conductivity, inherent nanoscale dimensions, and high
      surface area, carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays have attracted great
      interest as three-dimensional (3D) current collector materials for
      such applications. Unfortunately the extremely high packing
      density and intrinsic hydrophobicity of ordered CNT arrays
      prevents the conformal chemical or electrochemical deposition and
      utilization of the capacitive materials. The capacitive materials
      wind up only being deposited near the CNT tips or at their contact
      junctions. Alternatively, loose CNTs may be mixed with a binder
      and a functional material, and subsequently applied onto a current
      collector. This approach is more involved and often yields
      unsatisfactory results. For example, vanadium nitride/carbon
      nanotube composites were prepared by sonicating nanocrystalline VN
      with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in methanol. The
      capacitance values reported were modest: the absolute best
      performance reported was a capacitance of roughly 160 F/g at scan
      rate of 100 mV/s.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Ideally one would create supercapacitive nanocomposites
      directly anchored onto electrically conducting current collectors.
      This not only would reduce the complexity of the synthesis process
      but also would ensure improved power performance due to
      elimination of interparticle resistance. In many cases, however,
      CNTs are grown on non-conducting substrates (especially Si02 and
      A1203), requiring their removal and transfer. An A1203 barrier
      layer is also extensively utilized to grow CNTs on a variety of
      other substrates such as Ni and Fe foils, glassy carbon (GC), and
      Ta. Ajayan and co-workers have developed a novel strategy for
      direct growth of CNT arrays on an Inconel 600 metallic alloy. The
      authors proposed that a tenacious nanoscale passivating layer of
      Cr203 on the Inconel surface plays a key role for CNT growth.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0034] A method of creating an energy storage or energy generation
      device is disclosed comprising growing anchored carbon nanotubes
      (CNTs) on an electrically conducting substrate with a spacing
      suitable for functionalization, and functionalizing the CNTs by
      conformally coating the CNTs with an energy storage or generation
      material. The resulting device is also disclosed comprising
      anchored carbon nanotubes (CNTs) extending from an electrically
      conducting substrate with a spacing suitable for
      functionalization, and an energy storage or generation material
      conformally coating the CNTs. In one embodiment, the electrically
      conducting substrate comprises growth catalyst particles. For
      example, the electrically conducting substrate may comprise a CNT
      growth support film with the growth catalyst deposited onto, built
      into or forming part of the CNT growth support film.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The principle of selection of the growth support film and
      growth catalyst is as follows: The support film should 1) prevent
      excessive catalyst wetting or dewetting, i.e., have the
      appropriate film-support interaction to generate a desired
      catalyst particle size, distribution and spacing, which in turn
      dictates the CNT size, distribution, spacing and height; 2)
      prevent or reduce to an acceptable level the interdiffusion of the
      catalyst into the support film and/or the underlying substrate; 3)
      be sufficiently electrically conductive and electrochemically
      stable for the desired application; 4) maintain a strong bond with
      the bulk substrate, not delaminating or spalling; and 5) maintain
      a strong bond with the grown CNTs as to prevent CNT delamination
      or separation from the substrate. The spacing and dimensions of
      the dewetted catalyst particles and hence of the CNTs may be
      tailored by the use of the force-balance wetting equation, knowing
      that the catalyst mass is conserved, and knowing that the
      as-deposited catalyst thickness is in the 1 - 10 nm range. The
      wetting angle for the film on the support should be greater than
      30[deg.] but less than 90[deg.]. Balancing the forces on the
      wetted catalyst results in the following range of energies, i.e.,
      [gamma]: y{substrate-vapor} = y{catalyst-vapor}*cos(30[deg.]) +
      y{substrate-catalyst} to y{substrate-vapor} = y{catalyst-
      vapor}*cos(90[deg.]) + y{substrate-catalyst} .<br>
      <br>
      [0036] For those materials and methods for which experimental data
      is not provided herein, in general, the predicted utility is based
      on the disclosed results and application of known principles of
      vapor and liquid-phase deposition technologies and of
      supercapacitor and battery materials. The materials for which
      predictions are provided have been demonstrated to work in bulk or
      in other nanoscale embodiments. Functionalizing the surfaces of
      the CNTs with the predicted materials will improve their
      performance over bulk or other nanoscale embodiments. This is
      because the CNT supports will provide an excellent electrical
      conductivity path to the underlying substrate while enabling an
      ultra-high surface area-to-volume ratio for the battery or
      supercapacitor material coating. Predictions are also based upon
      the thermodynamics and phase diagrams of the respective materials
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Exemplary bulk substrates include Inconel, copper,
      stainless steel, glassy and vitreous carbon, graphite, aluminum,
      magnesium, conventional steel, niobium, titanium, molybdenum,
      tungsten, zirconium, silicon carbide, and tungsten carbide. Each
      of these materials has excellent electrical conductivity, which is
      in or near the metallic range. This makes them suitable as
      electrodes. Exemplary growth support films include oxides of
      metals, of non-metals and of alloys including oxides of Si, Mg,
      Fe, Cr, Cr-Ni, Ni, Ir, Zr, Sc, Ti, Mo, and Ta, such as Si02, MgO,
      Ti02, NbO, Nb02, Nb205, Ti-doped Nb02, Cr203, etc. Support films
      also include nitrides such as TiN and TixVi_x N (TiVN). These
      support growth films would work because 1) they are stable at the
      CNT growth temperatures (i.e. Tmeltmg of film " growth
      temperature), 2) they may be used to block diffusion of the CNT
      growth catalyst into the substrate, and 3) they have some
      thermodynamic chemical interaction with the growth catalyst,
      therefore causing partial wetting and preventing catalyst
      agglomeration.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Exemplary growth catalysts include metals as Ni, Fe, Cr,
      Co, Cu, Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, Mn, Mo, Sn, Mg, and alloys that combine
      two or more of these elements, oxides of these metals and of their
      alloys, and nitrides of these metals and of their alloys. These
      growth catalysts would work because they chemically interact with
      the precursor hydrocarbon gases (such as ethylene). In addition
      they all possess some solubility (in solid or liquid phases) for
      atomic carbon and/or they form carbides, the presence of at least
      one of the two being a necessary requirement for CNT growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Exemplary energy storage or generation devices include
      lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors. The achieved CNTs may
      be functionalized with a variety of energy storage materials that
      either act as hosts for Li ions (batteries) or provide reversible
      faradaic electrochemical oxidation/reduction reactions and
      therefore act as supercapacitors. In regards to batteries, these
      materials may be used in the positive (cathode) and/or the
      negative (anode) electrodes. In regards to supercapacitors, these
      materials may be used for symmetrical or asymmetrical electrodes.
      In regards to battery materials such embodiments include, but are
      not limited to, elemental materials such as Si, Al, Sn, and their
      alloys, oxides and hydroxides such as Co02, Fe203, Mn02, Fe304 and
      FeOOH, hydrides such as MgH2, sulfur and sulfides such as FeS, and
      elemental and alloy nitrides such as TiVN. In the case of
      supercapacitor applications such embodiments include, but are not
      limited to, oxides such as NiCo204, Co304, Fe203 and Mn02,
      hydroxides such as cobalt and/or iron hydroxide, and nitrides such
      as VN and TiVN. These materials would work because it is possible
      to deposit them onto the carbon nanotubes using a variety of
      techniques such as physical vapor deposition. Furthermore these
      materials would work because they have been demonstrated to
      function as an energy storage phase in the CNT-unsupported state.
      However in the current embodiment we expect these materials to
      possess improved performance since they are intimately coupled to
      an electrically conductive skeleton, which would not only
      accelerate the electronic conductivity but also the ionic
      conductivity through field effects. Furthermore the CNT arrays
      provide a natural way for the coating materials to achieve
      nanoscale dimensions. This would improve the kinetics via a
      reduction of the diffusion distances of the diffusing species. It
      would also improve the gravimetric energy density due to a higher
      surface area-to-volume ratio of the energy storage phase created
      by the underlying support skeleton.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Deposition techniques for depositing a growth support film
      and growth catalyst include one or a combination of physical vapor
      deposition (PVD) methods such as sputtering, evaporation, and
      pulsed laser deposition; chemical vapor deposition (CVD); atomic
      layer deposition (ALD); electroplating and electroless deposition;
      and wet chemical techniques. These deposition techniques would
      work since they are capable of coating the CNT arrays with the
      desired materials with high mass-loading accuracy (some techniques
      such as ALD and sputtering down to microgram) and uniformity.<br>
      <br>
      [0041 ] Growing of the CNTS may be carried out by all suitable
      methods including and related to chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
      such as conventional CVD, thermal CVD, and plasma- enhanced CVD.
      These methods would work since they are scientifically established
      and widely technologically demonstrated methods for CNT growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Functionalization techniques include one or a combination
      of physical vapor deposition (PVD) methods such as sputtering
      (including reactive sputtering), evaporation, and pulsed laser
      deposition; chemical vapor deposition (CVD); atomic layer
      deposition (ALD); electroplating and electroless deposition; and
      wet chemical methods such as precipitation, hydrothermal
      processing, and ionothermal processing. These methods would work
      since they have been scientifically established and
      technologically demonstrated for deposition of these functional
      materials on other types of carbon-based supports (not anchored
      CNT arrays), such as loose CNTs, graphene flakes, and activated
      carbon powder. It is expected that it will be possible to utilize
      all of the above techniques given the exquisite control of the CNT
      array spacing and height demonstrated here.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The device may be used, for examples, as a capacitor,
      battery or a hybrid battery- capacitor. Each of these applications
      requires a good electrical path from the functional material to
      the electrode. In each case a significant benefit is achieved when
      the functional materials and current collectors (dual role of the
      CNT array as a skeleton support and a current collector) are
      directly anchored to the underlying substrate (electrode) as they
      are shown herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Spacing of the CNTs is preferably greater than 100 nm, more
      preferably in the range 200-300 nm. Dry deposition techniques such
      as PVD and CVD are preferred for depositing the support film and
      catalyst, growing the CNTs and conformally coating the CNTs. <br>
      <br>
      [0045] A specific example of the method and device is disclosed in
      this patent document. However, we can soundly predict that the
      additional examples given above will work in like manner to the
      specific examples disclosed due to the similar nature of the
      processes and materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] We approach electrochemical capacitor synthesis in a new
      way. In some embodiments our methodology involves no wet chemical
      routes and creates in one embodiment 3D arrays of nanostructures
      that are directly anchored on bulk GC or bulk Inconel electrodes.
      This is achieved using three steps: First, we use physical vapor
      deposition (PVD) or other suitable methods disclosed in this
      document to deposit a CNT growth support film such as an
      Inconel-based growth support film and a CNT growth catalyst onto a
      bulk substrate. By this example, we create an electrically
      conducting substrate with a spacing suitable for
      functionalization. For a baseline, we also examine the feasibility
      of using a "conventional" A1203 CNT growth support. Second, we
      grow anchored 3D arrays of CNTs via conventional chemical vapor
      deposition (CVD) or other suitable methods disclosed in this
      document. We demonstrate that the achieved CNT distribution is
      ideally suited for subsequent functionalization. This
      functionalization is achieved through a conformal coating of the
      CNTs by a nanocrystalline VN film or other suitable materials
      disclosed in this document. The nitride is deposited via PVD or
      other suitable method and constitutes the third and last step in
      this example of the synthesis process. These structures are then
      electrochemically tested. The CNT growth support film may have the
      growth catalyst particles deposited onto, built into or forming
      part of a CNT growth support film.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] One significant advantage of our synthesis methodology is
      its potential commercial scalability. Both CVD and PVD are
      well-established advanced manufacturing technologies, being widely
      employed for batch-process manufacturing of microelectronics and
      solar cells. In addition to, or instead of, PVD, atomic layer
      deposition (ALD) may be utilized to grow the conformal functional
      oxide or nitride coatings on the CNT arrays. In regards to aligned
      CNT arrays (not loose tubes), a CVD-based method has the most
      potential for industrial -scale production because it is the
      technique that is capable of growing nanotubes directly on desired
      substrates. CVD-based techniques for growth of CNTs are also
      rapidly evolving in their efficiency and process control accuracy,
      with several notable examples. Recent advances include
      water-assisted supergrowth of dense and aligned CNT forests;
      additional dramatic process improvements which allow CVD to be
      utilized to grow centimeter tall, aligned CNT arrays, as well as
      arrays that fully cover 210 x 297 mm (A4 paper) substrates; and
      work by researchers at our institute, who produced CNT films on a
      large scale using a commercial CVD reactor. We utilize the same
      manufacturing-scale CVD reactor for the current study. The
      nanocomposite 3D array methodology detailed here may also be
      utilized for other applications where electrical conductivity to
      the substrate is essential, such as proton exchange membrane (PEM)
      fuel cells and Li -ion battery electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The following discloses experiments that provide a factual
      basis for the predictions in this patent document.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Two types of bulk substrates were utilized in this study:
      polished Inconel and GC, both being round disks 11.32 mm in
      diameter and 2 mm in thickness. These materials had the dual role
      of also being utilized as the electrodes in the electrochemical
      experiments. The disks were polished to a mirror finish with 6.0,
      1.0, 0.25, and 0.05 um polycrystalline diamond paste (Allied High
      Tech Products, Inc.) in sequence. After each polishing step, the
      electrodes were ultrasonically cleaned in Milli-Q (Millipore)
      water. Finally, the electrodes were ultrasonically cleaned in 8 M
      HN03, acetone, isopropanol, and Milli-Q water in sequence, and
      dried under argon flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Inconel support films of 150 nm in thickness were
      synthesized via PVD onto the electrodes. This was achieved via
      radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering (AJA International,
      Inc.), from an Inconel-600 target (VBM Precision Machine), in
      ultra-pure argon (99.999%) plasma. Prior to all depositions the
      sputtering chamber reached a base pressure of less than or equal
      to 5 [chi] 10 &lt;s&gt; Torr. A substrate temperature of 800
      [deg.]C was used to obtain crystalline Inconel films. The films
      possessed good adhesion to either electrode. For this PVD step,
      the sputtering rate was accurately measured in-situ using a
      crystal monitor at the substrate plane. A deposition rate of 2.5
      nm/min was utilized. Inconel-coated electrodes were then placed in
      the center of a tube furnace (MTI, GSL1100X). Oxidation was
      accomplished by heating the samples to 700 [deg.]C at a rate of
      15[deg.]C/min under a flow of dried air (100 seem total). The
      sample was held at that temperature for 60 s. Then the furnace was
      slowly cooled to room temperature under an argon flow (200 seem
      total). This oxidation process produced roughly a 100 nm thick
      passivation oxide (blue in color), which acted as the diffusion
      barrier layer for the CNT growth. A 1 nm Cr/1 nm Fe-30 atom % Ni
      bilayer CNT growth catalyst was subsequently deposited via direct
      current (DC) magnetron sputtering and co-sputtering, using
      elemental targets.<br>
      <br>
      [0051 ] In order to investigate the effect of CNT density on the
      resulting VN/CNT composite structure, CNT growth catalyst was
      deposited on an A1203 support as well. Twenty five nanometers of
      A1203 was reactively sputtered by dc magnetron sputtering from an
      Al target (99.995% purity) in mixed argon-oxygen plasma. The
      substrate was held at 350 [deg.]C during deposition. The total
      pressure in the sputtering chamber was maintained at 5
      &lt;[chi]&gt; 10&lt;"3&gt; Torr for all the experiments, and the
      volume flow rate ratio of argon to oxygen was 9.5: 1.5 (total 11
      seem) . After sputtering, the oxide films were annealed at 400
      [deg.]C for 60 min. Deposition rate calibration was performed ex
      situ through the use of a profilometer (KLA-Tencor Alpha-Step IQ)
      to measure step heights. The 1 nm Cr/1 nm Fe-30 atom % Ni bilayer
      CNT growth catalyst was subsequently deposited on top.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The CNT arrays were synthesized via a commercial CVD
      reactor (Tystar, Inc.). The mass-production designed system
      handles up to fifty 150 mm wafers simultaneously, with industry
      standard process control. The basic process flow is load, heat and
      reduce, grow, cool, and unload. The electrodes were loaded into
      the reactor at 550 [deg.]C; the reactor was then purged with argon
      and heated to the growth temperature of 750 [deg.]C using a rate
      of 10 C7min under a flow of 10% hydrogen in argon (3000 seem
      total).<br>
      <br>

      the Supporting Experiments<br>

      <br>
      [0054] The electrodes were then held at 750 [deg.]C for a total
      time of 40 min. During the growth stage, 15% ethylene and 10%
      hydrogen in argon (3300 seem total) flowed into the reactor for a
      time of 4-6 min. The reactor was then cooled to 350 [deg.]C under
      a flow of argon (2700 seem total), and the samples were removed.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Vanadium nitride thin films were grown using a similar
      approach to that by Zasadzinski et al. The methodology consisted
      of reactive RF magnetron sputtering from an elemental vanadium
      target (99.995% purity) in mixed argon-nitrogen plasma. The
      optimum substrate temperature for well-crystallized films was
      found to be 580 [deg.]C. With the heater at temperature, the base
      pressure in the chamber was less than 5 [chi] 10 &lt;s&gt; Torr.
      High -purity argon and nitrogen were injected directly into the
      chamber with a volume flow rate ratio of 16.8:3.2 (total 20 seem).
      The deposition pressure in the sputtering chamber was maintained
      at 4 [chi] 10&lt;"3&gt; Torr. The VN films were subsequently
      annealed in the chamber at 610 [deg.]C for 60 min in a nitrogen
      flow (10 seem, 4 [chi] 10&lt;"3&gt; Torr). Deposition rate
      calibration was performed ex situ through the use of a
      profilometer (KLA- Tencor Alpha-Step IQ) to measure the step
      heights. The deposition rates of VN were on the order of 1 nm/min.
      The VN mass loading was calculated from the film thickness and the
      known density of crystalline VN. The loading is presented in units
      of milligram per geometric (not real) surface area.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The phases present were identified using glancing angle
      X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker AXS D8 Discover
      diffractometer with a GADDS area detector. Phase identification
      was performed on -350 nm thick VN films grown on 4 in. Si
      substrates. The wafer was oriented to avoid the primary Si
      reflections in the detector. Sheet electrical resistivity
      measurements were taken using a four-point probe configuration
      (Lucas Laboratories). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was
      performed using a Hitachi S-4800 operated at 20 kV accelerating
      voltage. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed
      using a JEOL 2010 operated at 200 kV accelerating voltage. For TEM
      analysis the structures were mechanically removed from the
      electrodes and dry-dispersed onto grids. Electron diffraction
      simulation was performed using the commercial software Desktop
      Microscopist(TM), with the input of the well-known space group
      information for the constituent cubic VN phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were
      performed using an Axis Ultra spectrometer (Kratos Analytical)
      with a base pressure of 5 [chi] 10&lt;"10&gt; Torr. X-rays were
      generated by an Al mono (Ka) source operated at 210 W. The spectra
      were collected at a 90[deg.] takeoff angle. For the survey
      spectra, the analyzer pass energy was 160 eV, and for the high
      -resolution spectra the pass energy was 20 eV. The bonding energy
      scale in XPS measurements was corrected for the charging effect by
      assigning a value of 284.6 eV to the C Is peak of adventitious
      carbon. Peak-fitting identification was performed using the system
      software and the NIST XPS database as a cross-check.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and
      differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) (SDT Q600, TA
      Instruments) were applied to precisely determine the weight
      fractions of carbon nanotubes, amorphous carbon, and catalysts.
      As-prepared carbon nanotubes were scraped from the substrates, and
      the analysis was performed in an aluminum oxide crucible under a
      constant dried air flow (2 mL/min). The samples were heated from
      room temperature to 1000 [deg.]C at a heating rate of 5 C7min.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] All electrochemical measurements including cyclic
      voltammetry and constant current charge-discharge cycling were
      performed using a standard rotation disk electrode (RDE) system
      (Princeton Applied Research model 616 RDE), a potentiostat (Versa
      STAT 3), and an in-house fabricated three-compartment Teflon cell.
      A helical Pt wire counter electrode and an Hg/HgO reference
      electrode with taper joint (CHI 152, CH Instruments, Inc.) were
      used. The GC and Inconel working electrodes were directly
      assembled into Teflon holders. All electrochemical measurements
      were carried out in 1 M KOH (analytic grade, Fisher Scientific) at
      room temperature without any rotation. All CV curves depicted in
      the results represent the steady state after -40-50 cycles unless
      specifically indicated otherwise.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements
      were carried out to further verify the merit of a 3D CNT/Inconel
      support on the electrode performance. All the tests were conducted
      (three-electrode system, with Hg/HgO as reference electrode) on a
      Solartron 1470 electrochemical test station, applying an
      alternating current in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 20 kHz,
      with 5 mV amplitude, around 0 V vs open circuit potential (OCP,
      around 0.16 V vs reference electrode).<br>
      <br>
      [0061 ] We use a series of shorthand notations for the types of
      samples examined in this study. The abbreviation along with the
      sample description and purpose are presented in Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Fig. 1 A provides an SEM micrograph of the as-synthesized
      CNT array on Inconel/GC. The diameters of the CNTs on Inconel/GC
      are in the 60 nm range. The nanotubes are relatively coarsely
      distributed on the substrate, with spacing on the order of 200-300
      nm. The height of these CNTs is 45 [mu][iota][eta]. The number
      density of the CNTs is (1.01.5) &lt;[chi]&gt;
      10&lt;9&gt;/cm&lt;2&gt;. These dimensions and spacings yield a
      ratio of -15 for the true substrate surface area versus the
      geometric surface area.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Simultaneous differential scanning calorimentry (DSC) and
      thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed in a dry flowing
      air environment. Such analysis allows for an estimate of the mass
      proportion of carbon nanotubes, amorphous carbon, and residual
      catalysts. Fig. IB shows the results. The decomposition onset
      temperature for MWCNTs is around 515 [deg.]C. All the amorphous
      carbon was burnt before this onset temperature, with its mass
      fraction being on the order of 5%. By 710 [deg.]C, 98% of the
      total mass is lost, which indicates that 93% of the material by
      mass is MWCNT. At higher temperatures only the growth catalyst
      remains.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Fig. 2A presents an SEM micrograph of a 60 nm thick VN film
      grown on a GC substrate. The film had a mass loading of 0.037
      mg/cm&lt;2&gt; by geometric area of the GC substrate. In the
      subsequent results, unless indicated otherwise, the VN mass
      loading is that value. The film was continuous and had good
      electrical conductivity. Its average measured resistivity was 43.5
      [Gamma][Pi][Omega] cm. It is well-known that good electrical
      conductivity is key for fast and reversible redox reactions at
      high charging/discharging rates. Fig. 2B shows the XRD pattern of
      the synthesized vanadium nitride thin film. Three strong
      diffraction peaks are observed at 2[Theta] value of 38. ,
      44.3[deg.], and 64.4[deg.]. These diffraction peaks can be
      ascribed to the crystal planes of (111), (200), and (220). The
      as-prepared VN film can be considered to be a cubic crystal system
      (Fm3 m [225]), with a unit-cell parameter a = 4.085 A, which is
      almost identical to the 4.09 A of the stoichiometric VN (space
      group [225] Fm3 m , Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction
      Standards (JCPDS) Power diffraction File Card No. 25- 1252). We
      can conclude that the VN synthesized by reactive sputtering in
      ultrapure argonnitrogen mixture is nearly stoichiometric.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] It also can be concluded that the diffraction peaks of VN
      are broadened, indicating a small size of individual crystallites.
      While the grain size is expected to be different between the
      several tens of nanometer thick (for example, 60 nm VN on GC) and
      the hundreds of nanometer thick samples, the structure of the
      nitride phase should be nearly identical.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Fig. 2C and Fig. 2D highlight the VN/CNT/Inconel/GC system.
      The case of VN/CNT/Inconel/Inconel is not shown, since the
      electrochemical capacitor structure (i.e., CNT diameter, height
      and spacing, VN coverage) is nearly identical to that of
      VN/CNT/Inconel/GC. For both the blanket VN films and for the
      CNT-supported VN, a faceted VN nanocrystallite crystallographic
      morphology is observed. Such morphology is expected for VN films
      deposited at high temperatures, where crystals nucleate in their
      equilibrium Wulff shape, due to fast long-range mass transport on
      the film surface. Fig. 2E provides a summary schematic of the 3D
      array of the VNCNT nanocomposites, with all the support and
      catalyst layers included. Conceptually the figure is similar to
      the "ideal" electrochemical capacitor core-shell structure
      proposed by Simon and Gogotsy, though in our case the
      supercapacitive film is fully conformal to the CNT array whereas
      in their case, it is depicted as partially wetted. Though we did
      not investigate this in detail, it is reasonable to assume that
      the CrFeNi catalyst film will dewet on the oxidized Inconel,
      forming catalyst islands that are roughly on the same scale as the
      diameter of the resulting CNTs. What is not captured in the
      schematic is that limited tip growth may also occur. In both the
      base-growth (depicted) and the tip- growth cases, the catalyst is
      likely to be ultimately encapsulated by a graphitic layer. Further
      investigation is needed to fully understand the structure of this
      particular catalyst and its interaction with the oxidized Inconel
      support.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Figs. 3A-3D show the TEM characterization results of the
      VN/ CNT/Inconel/GC 3D arrays. Fig. 3A shows a bright field
      micrograph of the top of the CNTs, highlighting their coverage by
      the nanocrystalline VN. Figs. 3B and 3C show bright field and high
      angle annular dark field (HAADF) (Z -contrast) micrographs,
      respectively. The nanostructures were sheared from the electrode
      right at the base. The portions imaged in Figs. 3B and 3C were
      close to the fracture surface, i.e., near the bottom. These images
      confirm that the VN nanocrystallites conformally cover the CNTs.
      The coverage is not perfectly uniform, however. The CNTs were not
      fully vertically aligned and hence received somewhat varying
      levels of coverage depending on their orientation to the atomic
      flux. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
      pattern and accompanying simulation is shown in Fig. 3D. The
      pattern displays the expected VN diffraction ring pattern.
      Additionally there are the 0002 and 0004 "graphitic" MWCNT
      reflections.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] CNT arrays grown on A1203/GC are both much denser and much
      longer compared to those on Inconel (see Figs. 4A and 4B). A
      typical height and diameter of a CNT is 35 um and 10 nm,
      respectively. The spacing of CNTs is quite fine, being on the
      order of 10-15 nm. The coverage of the VN on CNTs grown using the
      A1203 support films is quite different from that of the Inconel
      case. Carbon nanotubes grown using Inconel are covered by the VN.
      In the case of the CNTs grown using the A1203 support, the VN
      covers only the very top fraction of the nanotubes.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The difference in the morphology between CNT arrays grown
      using the Inconel versus the A1203 films is likely due to varying
      catalyst substrate interaction. The CNT height, diameter, and
      spacing difference between the two arrays can be ascribed to
      catalyst stability. It is well known that for thin-film -based
      catalysts, CNT growth is a two-step process. First is the
      restructuring of a thin film into separated nanoclusters of
      catalyst particles and subsequent particle coarsening. The
      kinetics of thin film de wetting and breakup have been recently
      detailed by Luber et al. The second stage occurs upon the
      introduction of the carbon feedstock gas and involves graphitic
      network formation and actual CNT growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] An A1203 support layer is one of the more effective
      substrates for CNT growth. Its relatively strong chemical
      interaction with the Fe-based catalyst particles results in a
      narrow and fine particle size distribution that is relatively
      stable against coarsening. A narrow and stable catalyst size
      distribution, in turn, is known to lead to well-ordered and
      uniform arrays of vertically aligned CNTs, as is observed in this
      study. Conversely, Inconel-based films have a weak interaction
      with Fe-based catalysts. Catalyst substrates with a weak chemical
      interaction will result in catalyst islands that are widely spaced
      and dimensionally coarse at elevated temperatures. During CNT
      growth these particles will also undergo accelerated Ostwald
      ripening relative to the case of the reactive substrates, e.g.,
      see ref 42 and citations therein. Coarsened catalyst particles
      will grow CNTs with correspondingly large diameters and spacing.
      The CNTs' coarse spacing will lead to them folding over during
      growth due to low steric hindrance as is evident from Fig. 1A.
      Because the CNTs grown on A1203 are too dense to become fully
      coated by VN during sputtering, the remainder of the paper will
      focus on CNTs grown on Inconel as the electrochemical properties
      are also clearly superior.<br>
      <br>
      [0071 ] We utilized cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current
      charge-discharge (CD) cycling to evaluate the supercapacitive
      behavior of VN on the different substrates. The specific
      capacitance (SC), in farads per gram, based on CV and CD cycling
      can be calculated by the following equations:<br>
      <br>
      "; - - 2 ) where Q is the integrated cathodic (or anodic) charge,
      m is the mass of the active material, [Delta][Epsilon] is the
      potential window, i is the discharge (or charge) current, and At
      is the discharge time. All SC values were calculated by averaging
      the capacitance of symmetric anodic and cathodic halves. We first
      investigated the electrochemical stability of CNTs on Inconel/GC,
      without the presence of VN. Since the actual CNTs are stable in
      KOH, these results provide insight regarding the electrochemical
      stability of the oxidized Inconel and of the catalyst particles
      that anchor the CNTs at their base. Degradation in the capacitance
      could then be largely attributed to corrosion at sites where the
      CNTs are anchored, and subsequent CNT detachment from the
      electrodes. The samples were tested with 10000 CV cycles at a 50
      mV/s sweep rate. Fig. 5 A shows the CV curves of CNTs on Inconel
      at cycle 1 and at cycle 10000 where only minimal degradation is
      observed. Fig. 5B shows the CV curves for GC and for a VN/GC film
      tested at a 100 mV/s sweep rate. According to the CV data the
      specific capacitance of the VN on GC was 84.3 F/g. In the case of
      exposed GC there is a clear redox peak around -0.25 V. This is
      indicative of two-electron reduction of oxygen to H02&lt;" 43&gt;
      Naturally, this redox peak is detected in all CV curves, albeit at
      slightly different potentials due to the different nature of the
      electrode surface, GC, CNT, and VN. The CV curve of VN/GC shows a
      broad relatively symmetric redox peak centered at -0.61 V during
      charging and at -0.63 V during discharging. An additional smaller
      peak is observed at -0.94 V during charging, and at -0.98 V during
      discharging. These features are unique to the samples with VN, and
      can be related to redox processes on the VN surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The CV curve of CNTs on Inconel/GC, scanned at 20 mV/s, is
      shown in Fig. 5C. After the CV measurement, the carbon nanotubes
      were removed, and a CV test of the remnant CNT growth catalyst
      particles on Inconel/GC was performed under identical conditions.
      This curve is also shown in Fig. 5C. It can be seen that the
      current density of catalyst/Inconel/GC is much lower than that of
      CNT/Inconel/GC, and the peak positions in these two curves are
      different. Thus we can safely conclude that the remnant catalyst
      particles have a negligible contribution to the overall
      electrochemical supercapacitance. As was already demonstrated, the
      carbon nanotubes are thoroughly covered by the VN. Since the CNTs
      are not in contact with the electrolyte, their capacitive
      contribution is also zero (apart from acting as a support for the
      VN). Similarly, any catalyst particles that wound up giving tip
      growth would be fully encapsulated by the VN. Fig. 5D shows the CV
      data for the CNT/Inconel/GC vs VN/CNT/Inconel/GC, at 100 mV/s. The
      geometrical area normalized electrical double layer capacitance
      for CNT/Inconel is 0.001216 F/cm&lt;2&gt;.The CNTs grown on
      Inconel were too light to accurately ascertain their mass per
      geometrical squared centimeter (and hence to obtain specific
      capacitance per mass). The geometrical area normalized capacitance
      of the VN/CNT/Inconel is 0.01022 F/cm&lt;2&gt;. The specific
      capacitance of VN/CNT/Inconel is 276 F/g. Since the VN is
      conformal to the CNTs, the electrochemically accessible surface
      areas are similar for both types of structures. Therefore the
      electric double layer contribution for the VN/CNT/Inconel can be
      estimated as 12% of the total capacitance.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Fig. 6A shows the cyclic voltammetry diagrams of VN/
      CNT/Inconel/GC nanostructures. The potential range of -1.0 to 0.06
      V is sampled at different scan rates. There is a slight shift of
      peak positions due to the voltage drop caused by electric
      resistance at high sweep rates. Otherwise, in the sweep rate range
      of 20 mV to 1000 mV/s, the shape of all the curves is quite
      similar. Fig. 6B gives the relationship between the specific
      capacitance and the scan rate, in the case of VN/CNT/Inconel/ GC,
      using three different nitride loadings. The specific capacitance,
      in F/g, degrades with increasing material loading. This is an
      expected result: with increasing loading the films get thicker,
      while their total surface area still follows that of the
      underlying CNT array. Since pseudocapacitance arises from charge
      transfer reactions at the materials surface, thicker VN films
      essentially waste material. For each mass loading, when the sweep
      rate was increased from 20 to 1000 mV/s, the specific capacitances
      decreased by less than 20%. Our material shows superior rate
      capability over the early studies on and comparable performance to
      Glushenkov et al. and Zhou et al.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] It should be mentioned here that at low scan rate (e.g., 20
      mV/s as shown in Figs. 12A and 12B) the cathodic current is higher
      than anodic current, although the differences are much smaller
      than for the bare GC and CNT electrodes shown in Figs. 5A-5E.
      These results show that the oxygen reduction reaction has much
      slower kinetics and is of much smaller influence for the VN
      functionalized electrodes compared to bare carbons and will have
      only very minor influence on the calculated value for the specific
      capacitance of our VN coated CNT arrays. Our results are in good
      agreement with the results of a recent publication by Zhou et al,
      who indicated that the CV of VN nanoparticles is also far from
      "symmetric" with respect to zero current at low scan rates. As
      shown in Figs. 5B and 5D, VN/GC and VN/CNT/Inconel/GC exhibit
      excellent reversibilities at 100 mV/s, the CV curve is symmetric
      with respect to zero current, indicating a dominant fast and
      reversible redox reaction. At 20 and 100 mV/s, the capacitances of
      VN/CNT/Inconel/CNTs are 289 and 276 F/g, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The charge-discharge cycling test is considered to be an
      alternative and arguably better quantitative method to evaluate
      the supercapacitive nature of an electrode material as opposed to
      the CV measurement. The supercapacitive behavior of
      VN/CNT/Inconel/GC is further analyzed by constant current
      charge-discharge cycling, with current densities from 0.3 mA/cm
      (i.e., 8 A/g) to 2 mA/cm (i.e., 54 A/g). These results are shown
      in Fig. 6A. As shown in the figure, all the charge- discharge
      curves possess close to an ideal triangular shape. The variation
      of the specific capacitance value deduced by charge-discharge
      curves at different current densities is shown in Fig. 6D. The
      specific capacitance decreases gradually from 295 to 214 F/g as
      the current density increases from 0.3 to 2 mA/cm . This result
      shows the same trends as the CV measurements. In addition, it can
      be seen from Fig. 6C that the charge time and discharge time are
      different during galvanostatic charge and discharge at low current
      density. At 0.3 mA/cm (i.e., 8 A/g), the charge time and discharge
      time are 24.8 and 39.5 s, respectively. This difference arises
      from some slow and irreversible reactions, probably involving
      oxidation of the active material although more work will be needed
      to conclusively establish the root cause of such reactions.
      Glushenkov et al. encountered a similar problem, who indicated
      that the VN electrodes fail to charge and discharge in 1 M KOH at
      low current densities. However at 0.7 mA/cm , the charge time and
      discharge time are 11.1 and 11.5 s, respectively, which are quite
      close. At higher current density, the charge time is almost the
      same as the discharge time, suggesting a good reversibility at
      high charging-discharging current density.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Although there are some slow and irreversible reactions at
      low scan rates and low charging-discharging current density, for
      supercapacitor applications, high charge-discharge rate is very
      important. Therefore we believe the VN/CNT/Inconel composite is a
      promising material for fast charge-discharge applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Figs. 7A and 7B show the Nyquist plots of the
      CNT/Inconel/GC and VN/CNT/Inconel/GC electrodes in 1 M KOH, as
      well as the simulated curves. The spectra were fitted to the
      equivalent electronic circuit shown in Fig. 14. The calculated
      equivalent series resistance (ESR) and charge-transfer resistance
      (Rct) of CNT/Inconel/GC are 2.76 and 0.11 [Omega], respectively.
      The 0.11 [Omega] for the CNT array probably corresponds to the
      charge transfer resistance of the oxygen reduction reaction,
      which, as was already mentioned, is much faster on the carbons
      than on VN. After coating with VN, the ESR and R^ are 2.94 [Omega]
      and 0.28 [Omega], respectively. Our value for R;t is almost a
      factor of 10 lower than that reported by Zhou et al., which shows
      how the CNT array improves the rate capability compared to powder
      electrodes. Low charge-transfer resistance helps to achieve good
      rate capability because cycling stability is an important property
      of a supercapacitor, the VN/CNT/Inconel/ Inconel electrode was
      subjected to a long-term cycling test. The results are shown in
      Fig. 8A. After 600 CV cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV/s, the
      specific capacitance values remain at 64%, 63%, and 64% of the
      original values for the 0.037, 0.092, and 0.135 glc VN films,
      respectively. To further understand the electrochemical stability
      of VN in alkaline solution, SEM analysis was carried out on the
      pre- and post-electrochemically cycled VN/CNT/Inconel/Inconel
      samples. Figs. 8B and 8C show the SEM micrographs of the
      pre-cycled and the post-cycled (250 cycles) materials. The SEM
      micrographs reveal that no substantial changes in the VN
      nanocrystallites' morphology or size are incurred by the
      electrochemical cycling. <br>
      <br>
      [0078] X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the
      post-cycled materials was carried out on 160 nm VN/Si. These
      planar samples received the same 250 electrochemical cycles. XPS
      spectra of the VN thin films before and after 250 electrochemical
      cycles are shown in Figs. 9A- 9D. Besides the experimental peaks
      (black), the figures also show the model predictions of individual
      and summation peaks and background fits (lower lines). The peaks
      were identified using the aforementioned NIST XPS database. Fig.
      9A shows the V peaks and O peaks obtained from the as- synthesized
      film, which was stored at ambient conditions for approximately 24
      h prior to analysis. Both the V 2p and V 2p appear to be a sum of
      the spectral lines from several valence states of vanadium. The V
      2p is fitted with three peaks. The peak at 513.75 eV can be
      attributed to vanadium 3+ in the vanadium nitride structure. The
      peaks at 514.7 and 516.8 eV most likely correspond to V 5+(V203)
      and V (V205) oxidation states of vanadium, respectively. We can
      therefore conclude that vanadium oxide is present in multiple
      stoichiometrics. The O Is peak at 530.2 eV is also shown. In the
      V205 structure the O Is spectral line is in the 529.8-530.6 eV
      range. In the V204, V203, and V02 structures, the O Is spectral
      peaks are at 530.4, 530.3, and 530.0 eV, respectively. Since these
      peaks are quite close in energy, it is difficult to ascribe a
      particular oxidation state from the oxygen peak data. Fig. 9B
      shows the portion of the spectrum containing the nitrogen peak,
      before cycling. The nitrogen peak, which is at 397.3 eV, is in the
      position expected for a metal nitride (N spectral line Is:
      396.8-398.9 eV). Since both the oxide and the nitride peaks are
      present in the as-synthesized sample, we can conclude that even
      prior to electrochemical cycling the VN crystals are at least
      partially oxidized. Most likely the coverage is uniform, with the
      nanometer-scale thickness of the mixed oxides still enabling
      detection of a signal from the underlying VN.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Figs. 9C and 9D show XPS results for the
      post-electrochemically cycled VN films. The V curves are different
      from those of the pre-cycled films. The V 2p line shifts to 515.1
      eV (V ) and 517.1 eV (V ), with an increase in intensity that
      indicates a change in the relative amounts of each oxide during
      electrochemical cycling. The underlying nitride, at 397.4 eV, is
      still clearly present after the cycling. The nitrogen peak N Is,
      which is at 397.4 eV, is still clearly present after the cycling
      with a minor shift. It should be mentioned that the nitrogen peak
      is also in the position expected for oxidized nitrogen species
      like N03&lt;"&gt; (N Is around 397.4 eV). As discussed above, the
      nitrogen peak N Is at 397.3 eV can be definitely attributed to the
      underlying VN prior to the cycling, but because of the strong
      overlap with the nitrate peak position, we cannot entirely exclude
      formation of nitrate species in the cycled material. <br>
      <br>
      [0080] The possible charge-storage mechanism of VN has been
      studied by several groups. Choi et al. discussed in detail the
      surface reactions of the VN nanocrystals in aqueous electrolyte of
      high pH (-14). The authors proposed that in the presence of
      OH&lt;"&gt; ions an equilibrium reaction could occur on the
      nitride or oxynitride surfaces. The reaction is a combination of
      electrochemical double layer formation and a Faradaic redox
      reaction VNxOy + OH &lt;-&gt; VNxOy¦¦OH + VNxOy- OH + e (3) where
      the VNxOy¦¦OH&lt;"&gt; represents the electrical double layer
      formed by the hydroxide ions physisorbed on nonspecific sites,
      whereas VNxOy- OH represents chemisorption in the faradaic redox
      reaction. Impedance measurements in the study by Zhou et al.
      revealed that a charge transfer reaction is indeed happening. More
      precise determination of the reaction mechanisms would be possible
      using spectroscopic techniques such as FTIR and XPS in situ, but
      that would require a specialized electrochemical setup.
      Theoretically, a lot of information about the redox processes
      could be gained from detailed studies of CV peak positions and
      currents as a function of scan rate, electrolyte concentration,
      etc., but this is outside the scope of the present paper.<br>
      <br>
      [0081 ] The maximum capacitance obtained in this study is
      different from the values reported by Zhou et al. (161 F/g),
      Glushenkov et al. (186 F/g), and Choi et al. (1340 F/g). The
      extraordinary capacitance 1340 F/g reported by Choi et al. was
      achieved at a very slow scan rate of 2 mV/s. Subsequent studies by
      the same group reported more modest capacitance values for
      nanocrystalline VN synthesized nominally in the same manner. The
      best performance that the authors could obtain was 160 F/g. These
      study-to-study variations may be related to the differences in
      both the surface area-to-volume ratios and in the surface state of
      each material. Glushenkov and coworkers argued that for the VN
      system the composition structure of the surface oxide layer has a
      tremendous influence on the capacitive performance. This is a
      reasonable conclusion since the vanadium oxide phases are
      generally poor electrical conductors. Their presence in sufficient
      thicknesses would degrade the capacitance through resistive
      losses. Furthermore, the various valence vanadium oxides are
      expected to have differing electrical conductivities. For a given
      oxide, its electrical conductivity is generally expected to
      improve with increasing oxygen deficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Choi et al. proposed that the cycling performance was
      determined by several parameters like crystallite size, oxide
      layer, material loading, electrolyte concentration, and potential
      13<br>
      window. Our cycling results support the above argument regarding
      the importance of surface structure. The observed change in the
      oxide may be the factor leading to the electrochemical cycling-
      induced capacitance loss. There is discernible difference between
      the as-synthesized (289 F/g) and the post-cycled (185 F/g) samples
      in the composition and/or relative amount of the various mixed
      oxide phases on the material's surface. If during cycling the
      oxide layers grew thicker and/or became less electrically
      conducting due to a change in stoichiometry or the relative volume
      fractions of each phase, the capacitance would degrade. It is
      unlikely that the contribution from electrical double layer
      capacitance varies due to cycling. As we showed in Fig. 5 A, the
      electrical double layer capacitance of CNTs on Inconel does not
      evolve. Since the VN conformally covers the CNTs, it is not
      expected that the total electrochemically accessible surface area
      will be drastically different in the case of VN/CNT/Inconel versus
      CNT/Inconel. During cycling, there is little evidence of the
      VN/CNT/Inconel nanostructures physically degrading in a way as to
      reduce that area.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] It has been previously argued that poor rate capability is
      a key disadvantage of utilizing VN-based electrodes for
      electrochemical capacitor applications. For example Choi et al.
      found that the capacitance of highly porous VN powders decreased
      dramatically (more than 50%) when the sweep rate was increased
      from 2 to 100 mV/s. Such rate -dependent loss is attributed to the
      morphology of the as-prepared VN nanocrystallites, which normally
      consist of weakly interconnected nanoparticles. Ohmic losses due
      to these interparticle contacts would increase linearly with
      current density, resulting in a sharp drop in capacitance at
      higher currents and/or scan rates. In this study, conversely, the
      capacitance decreases only very slowly with increasing current
      density at higher currents and scan rates. For an electrochemical
      reaction involving charge transfer, the overpotential increases
      only logarithmically with current according to the Butler-Volmer
      equation. Hence, in our case, the behavior of the material seems
      to be determined entirely by the charge- transfer kinetics of the
      relevant redox processes. The fact that the VN nanocrystallites
      are in the form of a continuous shell around a conducting core
      that directly anchored to a conductive substrate eliminates ohmic
      losses, resulting in excellent rate capability.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Among previous studies, only Glushenkov et al. and Zhou et
      al. obtained rate capability comparable to ours albeit at lower
      specific capacitance. Variation in the other studies involved a
      slightly different ratio between VN, Super P conductive additive,
      and poly(vinylidene fluoride). This suggests that the final
      performance of the supercapacitor is very sensitive to small
      variations in the electrode preparation process. As mentioned in
      the Introduction, our approach has the big advantage of being a
      "drop-in" for an industrial thin film fabrication environment and
      involves no handling or mixing of the active materials.
      Additionally, CNTs grown on conductive electrodes are just one of
      many highly electrically conductive, high surface area substrates,
      such as carbon paper, carbon cloth, CNT paper, or graphene that VN
      can be vapor-deposited onto. As we demonstrated in this study when
      these materials consist of a three-dimensional open network,
      uniform coverage by VN would be achievable given a sufficient
      spacing of the features.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] This study demonstrates a direct synthesis methodology to
      achieve three-dimensional arrays of carbon nanotube-vanadium
      nitride nanostructures. Since the resultant arrays come firmly
      anchored to the electrically conductive electrodes, the developed
      methodology is highly advantageous for electrochemical capacitor
      applications. The skeleton of multiwalled carbon nanotubes was
      grown via chemical vapor deposition using an Inconel-based support
      film. The outer layer of vanadium nitride was subsequently
      synthesized using physical vapor deposition (reactive sputtering).
      Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicates that the
      vanadium nitride layer consists of a shell of interconnected
      sub-50-nm scale nanocrystallites that conformally cover the
      nanotubes.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] For the three-dimensional arrays grown using the
      Inconel-based support film, a specific capacitance of 289 F/gwas
      achieved in 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 20 mV/s. Cyclic voltammetry
      measurements indicated that the nitride-nanotube composites
      exhibit superb high rate capability (up to 1000 mV/s) and a long
      cycle life. At a sweep rate of 1000 mV/sthe specific capacitances
      decreased by less than 20%. After 600 cycles the specific
      capacitance remains at roughly 64% of the original value.
      Electrochemical analysis performed by constant current
      charge-discharge cycling, in the range of 0.3-2 mA/cm ,
      demonstrates close to an ideal triangular shape of voltage versus
      time behavior.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was performed on
      the as-synthesized and the post-electrochemically cycled blanket
      films of vanadium nitride. Vanadium oxide peaks of several
      valences and vanadium nitride peaks were present in the
      as-synthesized and in the post-cycled samples. Hence we conclude
      that even prior to electrochemical cycling the nitride crystals
      are at least partially oxidized. Scanning electron microscopy of
      the post-electrochemically cycled samples revealed minimal
      morphological changes of the nanocrystalline nitride.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] We also examined the feasibility of creating similar
      nanostructures using a much denser array of carbon nanotubes grown
      on "conventional" A1203 support films. The high CNT density did
      not allow for conformal coating by the nitride.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Raman spectroscopy is widely used for examining the
      structure of carbon nanotubes. In this study, first-order Raman
      spectroscopy (532 nm) was employed on the 3D CNT array grown on
      Inconel/GC. Raman measurements were carried out with a confocal
      microprobe Raman system (Thermo Nicolet Almega XR Raman
      Microscope) using an air-cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) and a
      green diode laser operating at 532 nm. A 2000 groove/mm
      holographic reflection grating was used. The spatial resolution,
      confocal resolution and spectral resolution are 1 um, 2
      [mu][iota][eta] and 2 cm&lt;"1&gt;, respectively. The Raman
      -scattered light was collected normal to the sample surface where
      at least five positions were randomly chosen on each sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] As shown in Fig. 10, the Raman spectrum normalized to D
      peak demonstrates two Raman bands, the G band and the D band. The
      G band, at -1571 cm&lt;"1&gt;, is related to the graphite
      tangential E2g Raman active mode, which is due to the stretching
      vibration of 5/J&gt; -hybridized carbon. The D band, at -1343
      cm&lt;"1&gt;, is a breathing mode of Aig symmetry, which only
      becomes active in the presence of disorder and defects.
      Accordingly, the intensity ratio of IG I ID can provide
      semiquantitative information about the CNT quality. The average
      value of calculated IG I ID is 1.60, indicating good crystallinity
      of the as-prepared CNT array, with low levels of disordered
      carbonaceous impurities.<br>
      <br>
      [0091 ] Fig. 11 A shows HRTEM image of a CNT grown on Inconel.
      Fig. 1 IB is an HRTEM image of a CNT grown on A1203. Clearly, the
      diameter is much smaller and the resulting packing density much
      higher (see Figure 4) for the nanotubes grown on A1203. Fig. 12A
      shows the CV curves of GC and of VN/GC at a slow scan rate of 20
      mV/s. Fig. 12B shows the CV data for CNT/Inconel and for
      VN/CNT/Inconel at a slow scan rate of 20 mV/s. It is clear that
      the cathodic current is higher than the anodic current. These
      results suggest that at low scan rates there are some slow and
      irreversible reactions that only occur in the cathodic region.
      Fig. 13A shows the CV results (scan rate of 50 mV/s) for the case
      of the CNT/A1203. After 10000 cycles the specific capacitance
      (Csp) is approximately 1/3 of the original value. When the GC disk
      was removed from the solution after testing, we observed that a
      significant amount of the CNTs had peeled off the electrode. This
      electrochemical instability of the CNT/A1203 system can be
      attributed to the well-known amphoteric property of A1203, which
      is unstable in both highly acid and highly alkaline environments.
      Fig. 13B shows the CV results for CNT/A1203 and for VN/CNT/A1203
      at a sweep rate of 20 mV/s. There is only a minimal difference
      between the two curves: with the presence of VN film the current
      density increases only marginally, while the shape of the CV
      remains similar to that of the uncoated CNT array. A small
      symmetrical redox peak is observed at -0.65 V. The total
      capacitance of the VN-covered array is the sum of the capacitance
      due to double layer charging and the electrochemical
      pseudocapacitance of the VN overlayer. Furthermore since the VN
      covers a relatively small fraction of the CNTs, one can assume
      that the mass available for double layer charging is about the
      same in each case. The pseudocapacitive contribution due to the VN
      surface film can then be obtained from the difference of the two
      CV curves. This value is calculated to be 131 F/g. This is roughly
      50% higher than that of VN/GC, indicating only limited improved
      utilization of the nitride.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The above results demonstrate that although such dense CNT
      arrays have large surface areas and are useful as electrochemical
      double layer capacitors, they are difficult to functionalize via
      PVD. Interestingly, a similar limitation was reported by Zhang et
      al.&lt;17&gt; for the case of electrodeposition of manganese oxide
      on a dense array of parallel CNTs. The authors attributed the
      inability to fully coat the CNTs to limited ion access to the CNT
      surface and electrical shielding effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The measured impedance spectra were analyzed using the
      complex nonlinear least- squares (CNLS) fitting method on the
      basis of the equivalent circuit,&lt;2&gt; which is given in Figure
      14. At very high frequencies, the intercept at real part ([Zeta]')
      represents a combined resistance of ionic resistance of
      electrolyte, intrinsic resistance of substrate, and contact
      resistance at the active material/current collector interface ( Re
      or ESR ). Rct represents the charge-transfer resistance caused by
      the faradaic reactions and Cdi is the double-layer capacitance on
      the electrode surface. Zw corresponds to the Warburg resistance,
      which is a result of the frequency dependence of ion diffusion/
      transport in the electrolyte to the electrode surface. CL is the
      limit capacitance.<br>
