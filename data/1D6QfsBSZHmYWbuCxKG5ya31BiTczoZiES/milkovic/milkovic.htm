          <p><b>BIOGRAPHY</b></p>
        </center>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Veljko Milkovic</b> was born in
          1949 in Subotica (Serbia), and since 1952 he has been living
          in Novi Sad (Serbia), where he finished secondary school and
          studied History. Apart from being interested in past events,
          he is also a researcher, an inventor, an innovator and a
          writer. Furthermore, he works on futuristic projects. So far
          he has got around 110 inventions and has designed 36 approved
          patents, some of which have been in use for years. Moreover,
          he has received many domestic and international awards for his
          work spanning over many decades. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He invented a self-heating
          eco-house and a number of ecological innovations, which also
          have been in use for a long time. According to his drawings,
          many such eco-houses have been built in Novi Sad, Sombor,
          Zajecar, Ljig (Serbia)... He has taken part in about 30
          scientific gatherings in the field of energetics and ecology
          as well as many projects concerning scientific research. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He is the president of the
          Department for ecological innovations and the organiser of the
          Exhibition of ecological innovations with VRELO Society from
          Novi Sad. He is also a member of the Association for the
          popularisation of science - Novi Sad. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Among various domestic and
          international awards, he has received November charter of the
          city of Novi Sad in 2002 for the remarkable contribution in
          the field of ecology and energetic as well as in 2002 a gold
          medal of Novi Sad fair for the invention hand water pump with
          pendulum. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He is very familiar with
          Petrovaradin fortress (city of Novi Sad, Serbia); he has been
          exploring it since 1960. In 1965 he managed to decipher
          orientation marks at the crossroads and establish the logic of
          subterranean labyrinth with "^", "Y" and "T" crossroads. This
          approach helps him to examine the 20km deep undergrounds of
          the fortress in a faster and safer manner. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">His engineering and ecological
          projects inspired by Petrovaradin fortress are in practice:
          "Selfheating ecological house", "Mushroom garden and
          greenhouse with reflecting surfaces" (mushroom gardens for
          growing bukovace near Cenej and Petrovaradin, Serbia, were
          built), Project "Forests for food production" (in use on
          several locations in the province of Vojvodina, Serbia and
          Montenegro) and "Autonomous battery charger". </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In 1975, librarian Srenko Drk hired
          him as a guide for less known parts of the fortress especially
          subterranean military galleries. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Novi Sad museum awarded him with
          the letter of thanks for the "ardent contribution in research
          of the Petrovaradin fortress". </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the late 70's, as a member of
          scientific and technical editorial board of the Cultural
          Center in Novi Sad, he organized and lectured at panels about
          Petrovaradin fortress. Some of the participants were an
          academician and a professor Bogdan Brukner and a professor
          Milan Vranic. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">An idea of a modern sod house as a
          new way of living gave him élan to continue with researching
          subterranean galleries. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In 1983, Veljko Milkovic and Mr.
          Srenko Drk founded "The club of friends of Petrovaradin
          fortress" within "Vladimir Nazor" library in Petrovaradin
          (Serbia). </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In 1997 he announced the book
          entitled "Mysteries of Petrovaradin fortress", which was
          published as a feuilleton, a script and a book. That was the
          first time that the gap in the literature about Petrovaradin
          fortress and its underground has been filled. It is
          interesting that many journalists and authors like Mr. Živko
          Markovic, a historian, claimed that subterranean military
          galleries represent the largest attraction in Petrovaradin. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In his numerous lectures and during
          short excursions he talked about dangers, but also about great
          tourist potential of Petrovaradin, Fruška Gora, Srem (Serbia)
          and the central part of the (river) Danube-basin. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">During public appearances in
          previous years, Veljko Milkovic announced major archaeological
          discoveries from Palaeolithic age at the location of
          Petrovaradin fortress and in the central Danube basin.
          Experienced archaeologists stated that "it is beyond dreams"
          and that it was "absolutely unexpected"... </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">But it happened and it was
          confirmed by the latest archaeological discoveries from
          Palaeolithic age. In his numerous public appearances, Milkovic
          claimed that the central Danube basin is a cradle of
          prehistoric period, which was confirmed by the recent
          discoveries by European scientists. He is also in possession
          of a unique and unusual archaeological collection. He also
          gathered numerous minerals and fossils, from the Danube-basin,
          as well as remains of previous civilisations. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In his research study he worked
          hard on gravitation phenomenon and also on the improvement of
          anti-gravitational experiments and, connected to that,
          anti-gravitational operating systems. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the last few years he has been
          working in the field of single and double mechanical
          oscillations, which represent a new source of widely, used
          energy, based on which he has 22 approved patents. His present
          aim is to explore and use practically the potentials of double
          oscillations and, in connection to that, a new source of
          energy based on inertial forces and gravitational potential. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Among other things in his
          experiments, he managed to get 12 times more output energy
          than input energy. In last 10 years, no one argumentatively
          disputed research and measurings carried out by Milkovic.
          Through such achievements, Veljko Milkovic laid the path for
          new challenges in physics in the 21st century, which could be
          the forerunner of the new great scientific revolution. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Milkovic is in possession of
          numerous prototypes and models (photo &amp; video), as well as
          ideas for various machines and devices. Over the years,
          Milkovic received many positive comments and opinions relating
          to his research from domestic and foreign physicists,
          professors, academicians, engineers, researchers etc. It is
          more and more definite that Milkovic's inventions can be used
          for production of numerous practical devices, thus creating a
          range of new products which could help in improvement of
          overall economical situation and better the situation in
          society. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">So far he has published the
          following books: </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"<i>Solarne zemunice - dom

          potentials"), (2006). </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Milkovic also published noticeable
          feuilletons and notes: </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"Niskoenergetski život"

        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">His book have been accepted both in
          domestic and foreign prestigious libraries, such as the
          Library of Congress, Washington DC and his publications can be
          found in the British Library in London, Moscow Library and
          Library of Alexandria. His publication have also been quoted
          in many Internet encyclopaedias and other sources. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">He also found the solution how to
          lessen the problem of the "endangered inventor" and needs to
          make his secret public. That is exactly what Veljko Milkovi?
          is doing by publishing his books and publications. </p>

          presentation of the hand water pump with a pendulum during the
          Agricultural Fair in Novi Sad (Serbia), 2003. The invention
          won a gold medal during the 2002 fair. </p>

          </center>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">New and technically original idea -
          hand water pump with a pendulum - provides alleviation of
          work, because it is enough to move the pendulum occasionally
          with a little finger to pump the water, instead of large
          swings. Using the minimum of human strength in comparison to
          present classic hand water pumps enables efficient application
          in irrigation of smaller lots, for water-wells and
          extinguishing fires even by old people and children, which was
          proved by a large number of interested future consumers during
          the presentations. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hand water pump with a pendulum is
          a realisation of a new, original, and even unbelievable, by
          very simple solution for pumping water. Work is alleviated
          because easier, long-lasting and effortless use of the hand
          water pump has been enabled. Input energy for starting the
          process of pumping, in form of occasional pushing of the
          pendulum, is much less than with typical hand pumps. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">To get the water running out of the
          pump, the pendulum needs to be out of balance. After that,
          based on gravitational potential, the piston starts
          oscillating and the continuous stream of water is coming out
          of the output pipe. The pendulum should be occasionally
          pushed, to maintain the amplitude i.e. the stream of water. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The pump works well with all sizes
          of the pendulum, but mainly with the amplitude of 90°. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The advantage of this invention
          compared to present hand pump solutions are: less force to
          start the pump, less water consumption, both arms can be used
          to fetch the water. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The invention is applicable on
          other devices that use lever mechanisms, such as a hand press
          etc. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">It is possible to pump out a 1000
          litres of water per hour, without any fatigue and continue
          with the pumping. Both arms are free for fetching water, and
          both elderly and children can use it, since maintaining the
          oscillation of the pendulum does not request any special
          training or dexterity. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Whereas typical hand pumps require
          significant effort and an average person can use the pump
          continuously only for several minutes, the hand water pump
          needs the minimum of the effort, because it is only necessary
          to swing the pendulum and maintain the oscillation for several
          hours, without any fatigue. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">All details on the hand water pump
          with a pendulum and the information can be provided by the
          author, Veljko Milkovic, who is willing for any form of
          cooperation with all potential strategic partners and
          customers for production and application. So far, there was a
          lot of interest for the application of the hand water pump
          with a pendulum both in domestic and foreign markets, as well
          as for further development of the product. </p>

          Milkovic did several measurings, which showed the energetic
          excess, 12 times larger than the input. That means that
          two-stage oscillations (

          around 12 times more than the input. </p>

            DIFFERENCE IN POTENTIAL</i> </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Energy is created due to the
          difference in existing devices. Consumers of energy use the
          difference in the potential between the plus and the minus
          (direct current) and zero and the phase (alternate current).
          All heat and thermal motors accomplish useful work due to the
          higher temperature and pressure. Mills and power plants use
          different levels of water... </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">However, difference in the
          potential of two-stage oscillator, "unusual machine" has not
          been considered so far. </p>

            Potential during Oscillation of the Physical Pendulum</b> <br>

        </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Since there is a difference in
          potential (Figure 2.) between the weightless state (1) and
          culmination of force (2) during oscillation of the pendulum,
          the same is true for centrifugal force, which is zero in upper
          position, and culminates in the lower position at maximum
          speed. Physical pendulum is used as a single-stage oscillator
          in the system with a lever. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">After many years of trials,
          consultations and public appearances, it could be said that
          this occurrence is being researched and investigated all over
          the world (author is in possession of evidence). Simplicity
          enables construction of houses by owners themselves. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Efficiency of the model can be
          increased by mass, since the relationship between the volume
          of the lever weight and its surface increases the mass. </p>

          pendulum works better. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">According to the theory of

          can be deemed unreachable, according to Einstein's formula
          E=mc2, because the mass would be infinite. However, the mass
          does not change with speed, and the kinetic energy increases
          with the square speed. Therefore, the speed of light can be
          reached by future space crafts, if these ideas are considered.

        <p style="text-align: left;">Although the basic model, which
          Veljko Milkovic called "The mechanical hammer with a physical
          pendulum", showed in the first experiments that the output
          energy is larger than the input energy, Milkovic concentrated
          on the practical use of the model. This can be seen by the
          order of the patent requests. Later, it turned out that this
          model is also a perpetuum mobile, when usage of input energy
          is in question. However, the model is energetically open both
          at the entry and the exit part, so the exact measurement of
          efficiency would be complicated. The matter of the exact
          measurment was postponed, but the noticed fact was that the
          model represents a new type of a simple machine, and that is
          very interesting and useful, even without multiplying input
          energy. </p>

          percentage. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Mechanical hammer with a physical
          pendulum is an original device - a machine which is turning
          the oscillations of the physical pendulum, hanged on an arm of
          a two-armed lever, into the oscillations of the weight on the
          arm of the same lever. The axis of rotation, the axle of the
          physical pendulum is parallel to the axis of rotation, the
          axle of the lever. The axle bed of the lever is connected to
          the surface with girders. The axle of the physical pendulum is
          oscillating up and down, when the pendulum is out of balance.
          Thus, the weight on the other arm of the lever is oscillating
          as well. The arm on which the pendulum is positioned is lifted
          with every movement of the pendulum away from the balance,
          because the weight of the pendulum weight is decreasing, and
          the same lever arm is lowering when the pendulum is closer to
          the balance position and that happens in succession. The
          period of oscillation of the lever and the weight on it is
          twice shorter than the period of oscillation of the physical
          pendulum and the weight on it. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In Picture 1, the triangle
          represents the support for the two-armed lever. The small
          circles are the two axis. The lever rotates on one and the
          physical pendulum on the other. On the right arm of the lever
          is an angle on which the physical pendulum is oscillating, and
          on the left arm is the weight which oscillates together with
          the lever. As soon as the physical pendulum is out of balance
          and begins to oscillate, the lever starts to oscillate as
          well.. </p>

          </center>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Forced oscillation of the weight on
          the lever can be of an impact type when the weight, at the end
          of every oscillation, hits the surface or an object on the
          surface like a hammer. At that moment, the force of the impact
          is greater than the force maintaining the oscillation of the
          pendulum, which still does not say anything about the balance
          of energy since the effect of these two forces is not
          simultaneous. It would be a completely different story if we
          were talking about strength and not force, but we would need a
          different approach in that case. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><i>"EXCESS" ENERGY</i> </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Veljko Milkovic conducted a series
          of experiments on the basic model - mechanical hammer with a
          physical pendulum. All the experiments led to the conclusion
          that the input energy is smaller than the output energy. Since
          the law of energy sustainability could not help here, he did
          not spend too much time to explain the occurrence in a
          theoretical way. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">One of the possible explanations
          was the effect of the forces involved in the work of the
          oscillators. Forces are more specific and simple physical
          entities than energy. However, there were many different
          forces present during the experiments, so it was hard to
          compare them. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Most of the experts and scientists
          familiar with experiments conducted by Milkovic did not go
          into more detailed analysis, with an exception of professor
          Bratislav Toši?. Unfortunately, his extensive mathematical
          analysis did not provide a clear result concerning the energy
          balance. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Experts usually followed their
          instinct. Some were "in favour", some were "against" perpetuum
          mobile. Among the first group, after some hesitation, was
          Nebojša Simin. Sceptical at the beginning, as many other
          physicists involved in this research, his resistance was
          defeated with a simple gesture. He put his hand on the lever
          which was oscillating. The pendulum continued to sway as if
          nothing happened, while the energy was transferred from the
          lever to his arm. The lever was working tirelessly, without a
          decrease in the oscillatory energy of the pendulum. ?imin did
          not need a more convincing proof than this to convince him
          that this is the perpetuum mobile. It practically makes no
          difference whether the lever is doing something or not. That
          work does not reflect the oscillation of the pendulum, and the
          pendulum in return, as it oscillates, makes the lever to
          oscillate too. Simin was positive that the efficiency
          percentage of the lever with a physical pendulum larger than
          the one. At the same time, it meant that the law on energy
          sustainability can not be applied for this model, which is
          only a step away from the autonomous perpetuum mobile. For the
          model to be autonomous, it was necessary to come up with an
          idea how to return a part of the energy from the lever to the
          pendulum, so that it would not stop because of friction and
          air resistance. Milkovi? solved this problem as well through
          his patents. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Unlike Milkovic and his associates,
          Simin did not like the idea of giving the main role to the
          gravitational potential. If the friction is neglected,
          pendulum work force is equal to zero. On the other hand, no
          one doubted the meaning of the centrifugal force of the
          pendulum. It was clear from the beginning that they should
          follow that lead. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A lot of time was spent on the
          basic model and the matter of maintaining the oscillation of
          the pendulum, having in mind the friction and air resistance.
          Milkovic solved that problem with electromagnetic bumpers in
          the patent "The piston water pump with the pendulum and
          electromagnets" ,which he handed in for registration on
          02/22/01. In that way, he completed his previous model:
          "Electric generator with the pendulum and magnetic bumpers" ,
          from 06/14/00. Observed individually, neither of these two
          models are autonomous, but together, they are. The combination
          of these two models is the first model of perpetuum mobile. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Milkovic was also troubled with the
          problem of the relatively slow oscillation of the pendulum,
          which produced low-frequency current. He did not solve this
          problem fully so far. An attempt with the model: "The electric
          generator with an elastic pendulum handle" ,which offers
          faster oscillations, does not solve the problem, because that
          is a single-stage oscillator which has an efficiency
          coefficient lower than one. Among the first nine patents, this
          is the only one which has nothing in common with perpetuum
          mobile. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"Surplus" or "excess" energy was
          usually attributed to the gravitational potential. For
          sceptics, that was the "proof" that this could not be
          perpetuum mobile, because the gravitational field during
          oscillation of the pendulum is zero. In their opinion, that
          was enough to conclude that there could not be "excess"
          energy. The only thing everyone agreed on was the efficiency
          of the device. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Qualms about the efficiency
          coefficient could not be satisfied without a deeper analysis.
          The matter was the participation of the centrifugal force of
          the physical pendulum in the lever oscillations, as well as
          energetic consequences of that participation. That force does
          not influence oscillation of the pendulum, but is directly
          responsible for the oscillation of the lever. It is clear that
          the axis of the pendulum, if we neglect the rotation, does not
          have kinetic energy in the pendulum system, but it does in the
          lever system. However, potential energy of that point changes
          in the lever system. It was not clear whether the change of
          the potential energy, despite it is zero during one
          oscillation, has any effect on the phenomenon as a whole. As
          far as the work is concerned, the pendulum operates against
          friction and air resistance, and the lever operates, for
          example, through the hammer hitting the surface, or by
          producing the alternative current by means of induction. It
          was not clear which work force was bigger, the pendulum or the
          lever. The response could not be a direct one, because precise
          measuring was needed, but it could not have been conducted on
          the original model. This was also the case with the models
          Milkovic constructed in the meantime. One of them is the fan,
          which is a two-stage oscillator (Picture 2.). The fan is
          swaying for unusually long time after the pendulum has only
          once been put out of balance. But, the theoretical explanation
          in this case is even more complicated that the one of the
          original model. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;">

        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Let us get back to the basic model.
          Some things are obvious just when you look at the movements of
          the two-stage oscillator. There is a significant difference
          between the two conditioned oscillators. The lever is forced
          to oscillate, unlike the pendulum. The opposite is not
          possible because of the influence of gravity on the weight of
          the pendulum. If the pendulum is connected to an external
          energy consumer, the pendulum soon stops with oscillations, as
          well as the lever. However, if the lever is connected to an
          external energy consumer, the pendulum continues with
          oscillations. If the external consumer does not take all the
          energy from the lever, it will continue to oscillate with a
          smaller amplitude. If we suppose that the positive work force
          of the lever, and it's useful work force are greater than the
          work of the pendulum while it is overcoming friction and air
          resistance, we get "excess" energy. That "excess" can occur
          only due to the centrifugal force of the pendulum. However, is
          that really "excess" energy or does it just seems so? </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><i>ENERGY OF A PENDULUM AND A LEVER</i>
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">By definition, energy is a
          capability of an object to perform work. Therefore, energy
          does not cause any consequences on anything, but it could and
          could not have consequences in regards of another object
          starting to move. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Even a basic model made by Milkovic
          established that a change of the lever energy does not change
          the pendulum energy. Mechanical energy of the lever, in the
          pendulum system, is equal to zero, so that the lever is not in
          position to affect the pendulum. In the surface system, the
          lever energy is different than zero, and it can perform work
          if something is on its way. The lever can perform work be
          hitting the surface, but it would still not affect the
          pendulum. What ever happens to the lever, the pendulum energy
          will not change. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Energy of the lever is at the
          disposal of an external energy consumer, which does not affect
          the energy of the pendulum, whether the lever is doing
          anything or not. If the external consumer takes over a part of
          this energy, the oscillating amplitude of the lever will
          decrease. Since the lever is the one oscillating forcibly and
          not the pendulum, it continuos with oscillations even when
          partly dampened. Oscillation of the pendulum is uninterrupted
          even when the lever oscillation is completely dampened. As
          soon as the lever stops being a working body and stops
          providing energy to the external consumer, it starts
          oscillating again, with a same amplitude as before. This is a
          clear and unambiguous sign of "excess" energy. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Mechanical energy of the lever
          occurs without additional input of energy from the outside,
          due to the way in which the pendulum is moving. Work force of
          the lever does not mean that a pendulum must lose it's part of
          the energy. Pendulum just needs to be moving. On the other
          hand, the pendulum is not moving because it is getting the
          energy from somewhere outside, but because of inertia. In
          other words, the lever is capable to denounce a part of its
          energy for the external consumer, even though that process
          does not include any working body outside of the device. This
          is all under condition that the pendulum is oscillating
          without obstructions. It is understood that the pandulum has
          been previously thrown out of balance. After a short time,
          this energy in the total operational, energetical or power
          balance can be neglected. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Friction and air resistance were
          the stumbling block, in both theoretical and practical sense,
          especially on the pendulum. Milkovi? solved this problem in an
          indirect way, with the combination of two models. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In this way, interpretation of the
          device does not fall under the usual theory of energy
          sustainability. Classic mechanics either did not foresee
          objects such as multi-stage oscillators or it overlooked
          certain characteristics of these object. Or, maybe both. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><i>GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL
            EVERYWHERE</i> </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Whether we like it or not, gravity
          exists and we can not influence it, since there is still no
          gravity isolator. However, physical pendulum is in weightless
          state in its upper position during oscillations. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <center>
            <p><img src="oscil07.jpg" height="195" width="300"></p>
          </center>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This works as a substitute for a
          gravity isolator, and the efficiency proved to be extremely
          high at two-stage oscillators shown above. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Experiments also confirmed
          supplemented formula for kinetic energy, which explains the
          surplus of energy. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Speeds are added together,
          originating from the impulse i.e. energy invested in
          maintaining the pendulum in oscillation, which happens in the
          upper position. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Additional acceleration of the
          pendulum is due to gravity. If the above mentioned formula is
          applied for calculation, the surplus of energy is clear, and
          it originates from gravitational potential. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;">

            <p><img src="oscil09.gif" height="61" width="161"></p>
          </center>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In addition to results in earthly
          conditions, space probes had excellent results, so it is
          useful to mention that kinetic energy can be increased with
          the help of gravity. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">(1) When the pendulum is out of
          balance it becomes a system without inertia, which uses
          gravity to oscillate and turns it into rotation through the
          lever. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">(2) Obstructions on the lever do
          not influence the pendulum, which means that the pendulum is
          independent from the lever, but the opposite is not the case.
          In other words, gravity is the reason for mechanics. It is a
          reversible gravitational-mechanical process which turns
          gravity into mechanical work and vice versa, an obvious
          process in nature. The sum of gravity forces is always larger
          than the sum of losses: which is the precondition for constant
          movement of heavenly bodies. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">(3) The double oscillator is also
          the best mechanical analogy of the alternating current, even
          better than Tesla’s analogy. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A model has been set up in Mr
          Milkovic’s apartment: a water pump that needs only a slight
          pressure with one finger to put the pendulum out of balance
          and add impulses with a minor force. The output is enormous
          compared to the input force of pumping. Practical advantages
          are obvious. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">It is very strange, but it turned
          out that the same invention fulfils two ancient human dreams.
          One about a machine which works continuously, and the other
          about the flying device which moves according to the wish of
          the person on the device. Here, of course we do not mean
          aeroplanes and rockets, but a flying machine that does not use
          any kind of fuel. A vehicle with such a motor could move on
          the ground, in the air or anywhere in space, without fuel. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Anti-gravitational motor is machine
          that confronts so-called "laws of nature". This idea could not
          have been believed in, without being pronounced naive or
          demented. Anti-gravitational motor belong to the field of
          science-fiction, although contemporary physics knows the case
          where a law of action and reaction does not apply in one
          inertial system. This is the magnetic force which is emanated
          by two particles as they move. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Inconsistency is frequent in
          physics. Besides, mechanics is somehow outdated, and left to
          technicians and mathematicians. These three disciplines do not
          have the same basis, and they are more inconsistent than it is
          usually recognised. Physics explores occurrences and events in
          nature, independent of their meaning to humans, whilst
          technique deals with the possibility to join these occurrences
          in one whole. Mathematics precisely defines conditions under
          which these occurrences happen, but does not, and can not,
          take into account the meaning of these occurrences, which is
          an integral part of physics. Mathematics also can not express
          practical purpose of an occurrence, which techniques can.
          Therefore, these three disciplines, in spite of having things
          in common, can not merge into one another. Physics basically
          abandoned the field of mechanics, as if it has nothing more to
          say. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Classical physics is, in large
          part, Newton's physics, and he was more of a mathematician
          than a physician. Maybe that is one of the reasons why there
          is a span of several centuries between the discoveries of
          Galilei and perpetuum mobile, and even an anti-gravitational
          motor. Physics is relying too much on quantification of
          physical constants that are part of a certain occurrence,
          while, at the same time, it ouches the qualification of these
          same occurrences to the side. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">As far as technique is concerned,
          it prospered immensely, especially in the 20th century. On the
          other side, it is well known that new discoveries are usually
          technically very simple. For example, from a technical point
          of view, Milkovi?'s cart shown in Picture 2. looks more like a
          toy than an attempt to make an anti-gravitational motor. When
          you look at it from the physics point of view, it looks
          completely different. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>

        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This cart contains everything an
          anti-gravitational motor needs. As with other models made by
          Milkovi?, there is an inertial force pushing them in one
          direction. The main part of the model is a physical pendulum
          which is askew and is moved by gravity. Gravitational field
          should be replaced with a magnetic field, to enhance the
          efficiency of the model. Milkovi? made a model with two askew
          pendulums, which oscillate with phases positioned towards one
          another in an angle of 180°. </p>

          contains many similar "scraps", awaiting future exploration. </p>
