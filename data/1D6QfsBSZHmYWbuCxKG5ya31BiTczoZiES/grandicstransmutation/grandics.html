      <b>Inventor(s): GRANDICS PETER</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention provides a method for atomic transformations
      carried out under conditions akin to chemical catalysis. Liquid
      and solid state catalysts are used in a two-step process. We have
      found that the high ionic/electric activity of concentrated sodium
      hydroxide solution in combination with heating is sufficient to
      induce atomic transformation and provide a solid phase catalyst of
      high aluminum and silicon content. This product when heated at a
      temperature of 1000 DEG C. yields numerous elements of higher
      atomic masses. Thus, atomic transformation (transmutation) is
      demonstrated by using common chemicals and simple laboratory
      procedures<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This invention relates to atomic transformation reactions,
      in particular to the synthesis of magnesium, calcium, aluminum,
      silicon, iron, nickel, chromium, manganese, copper, silver, gold,
      palladium, zirconium, tungsten and others. Currently, the
      conversion of elements into each other is performed in nuclear
      reactors or utilizing other sources of nuclear radiation. These
      methods are unsuitable for the low-cost mass production of
      elements and produce many undesirable radioisotopes. The present
      invention aims to provide a method allowing low-energy atomic
      transformations under conditions akin to chemical catalysis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Previously, we have introduced a new model of the atom that
      predicted that atomic transformations (transmutation) could be
      carried out under conditions akin to chemical catalysis. This
      invention provides a proof of this model, using liquid and solid
      phase catalysts in a two-step process. We have found that the high
      ionic activity of concentrated sodium hydroxide solution in
      combination with heating is sufficient to induce atomic
      transformation and generate a solid phase catalyst of high
      aluminum and silicon content. This catalyst when heated at a
      temperature of 1000° C. yields a variety of elements, including
      magnesium, calcium, iron, nickel, chromium, manganese, palladium,
      gold, silver, tungsten and copper. Thus, atomic transformation has
      been demonstrated using common chemicals and simple laboratory
      procedures.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0023] Over the past two decades, numerous research reports have
      emerged on low energy nuclear reactions, e.g., the formation of
      tritium from deuterium on Pd (1), the formation of Fe in gold
      electrodes, or the formation of helium and cadmium in a Pd
      electrode (2), as well as the formation of other elements (3).
      These data were largely viewed with skepticism as low energy
      nuclear reactions are not explainable within our current
      understanding of atomic processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] We recently introduced a new theory of the atom that
      provides a theoretical framework for the design of low energy
      nuclear reactions (4, 5). The theory proposes that atoms are
      complex electromagnetic waveforms that are circulators of the
      space lattice, the carrier medium for electromagnetic
      interactions. We suggested that only electromagnetic energy
      exists, and therefore electromagnetic pressure waves of sufficient
      intensity should induce atomic transformation. In addition, the
      atom should be viewed as a whole, irrespective of whether chemical
      or nuclear reactions are concerned. For this reason, we introduce
      here the term low energy atomic transformation to replace the
      currently used term “nuclear reaction” to describe the synthesis
      of elements under conditions akin to chemical catalysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] We hypothesized that sufficient electric pressure could be
      generated by utilizing high ionic activities of molecules, a
      method commonly used in chemical catalysis. We reasoned that a
      single catalytic step may be enough to produce elements of lower
      atomic masses, and such a procedure is demonstrated in this
      invention. The synthesis of elements of higher atomic masses
      requires an additional catalytic step.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is a
      method of elemental transformation comprising:<br>
      <br>
      [0027] (1) providing a liquid phase catalyst utilizing high
      ionic/electric energy;<br>
      <br>
      [0028] (2) heating the liquid phase catalyst;<br>
      <br>
      [0029] (3) neutralizing the liquid phase catalyst to prepare a
      solid phase catalyst;<br>
      <br>
      [0030] (4) performing solid phase catalysis by heating the solid
      phase catalyst at high temperature; and<br>
      <br>
      [0031] (5) heating the solid phase catalyst with an element or its
      compound to achieve elemental transformation.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In one alternative, electric pressure is generated in order
      to facilitate elemental transformation. In another alternative,
      heating and electric pressure are used in combination.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The liquid phase catalyst can be a base or an acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Typically, the reaction temperature of the liquid phase
      catalytic step is between about 80° C. and about 250° C.
      Typically, the reaction time for the liquid phase catalytic step
      is from about 5 hours to about 24 hours. Typically, the heating
      temperature of the liquid phase catalyst is between about 100° C.
      and about 120° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The neutralization step can yield a solid phase catalyst in
      the form of a white precipitate. The white precipitate can contain
      sodium, aluminum, silicon, and oxygen as main constituents. The
      white precipitate catalyst can be heated at a temperature range of
      from about 800° C. to about 1700° C., optionally with an element.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] New elements can be generated by the method; for example,
      the new elements can include at least one element selected from
      the group consisting of magnesium, aluminum, calcium, palladium,
      copper, gold, silver, zinc, tungsten, iron, manganese, nickel,
      zirconium and chromium.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The synthesized elements produced by the method can have an
      atomic mass higher than sodium.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Another aspect of the present invention is a method of use
      of a product produced by the method described above in a
      biological system. The biological organism can be a microorganism
      or a eukaryote, such as a higher plant or a human.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Materials and Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0039] All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and were of
      ACS grade or equivalent. All containers coming in contact with
      reaction media were glass. The elemental transformation method
      described here involves a two-step reaction. In the first step,
      4.5 liters of 3.7 M NaOH were gently refluxed for 5-24 h in a
      round-bottom glass reactor. After cooling to room temperature on a
      chilled water bath, the pH was adjusted slowly to slightly acidic
      (pH 4-5) with 1:1 HCl under gentle stirring. The solution became
      turbid; a white precipitate began to form early in the
      neutralization process. It is important to avoid significant
      warming up of the solution. The best approach is to perform the
      neutralization on a chilled water bath and keep the temperature at
      around 20° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] From the slightly acidic pH, the mixture was re-adjusted to
      mildly alkaline by using 1M NaOH solution until pH 8 was reached.
      After stirring was stopped, the supernatant slowly cleared and a
      white precipitate settled out. After the precipitate settled
      overnight the supernatant was carefully aspirated off using a
      peristaltic pump. The precipitate was re-suspended in 8 L of
      deionized water and allowed to settle overnight again. The settled
      precipitate was transferred into 1-L centrifuge tubes with
      deionized water and spun at 3,500 rpm for 35 m in a Sorvall model
      RC3B centrifuge. The precipitate was washed 3 more times by
      resuspension in deionized water to remove residual salts, and
      spread out on a glass tray to air dry. Subsequently, it was heated
      at 70° C. for 7 hours to reach a constant weight and weighed. The
      granular, soft white material was ground to a fine powder in a
      porcelain mortar and stored in a plastic jar at room temperature.
      The second catalytic step involved heating the white precipitate
      to 1000° C. for 1 hr in a Sentrotech STT-1600 tube furnace in an
      air atmosphere. SEM-EDS analyses were performed using a Philips
      Quanta 600 instrument.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results and Discussion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0041] In a new theory of the atom and atomic processes (4, 5), we
      proposed that the atom is a complex electromagnetic waveform with
      constituents that form a balanced, coupled system. We also
      suggested that the atom should be treated as a whole, regardless
      of whether chemical or nuclear reactions are concerned. For this
      reason, we have introduced the term low energy atomic
      transformation as opposed to the currently used nuclear reaction
      to describe the synthesis of new elements under conditions similar
      to chemical catalysis. As the atom is formed out of the space
      lattice by electromagnetic pressure waves (4, 5), the atom may
      also be transformed (transmuted) by electromagnetic force alone.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] A large body of evidence is now accumulating on low energy
      nuclear reactions demonstrating that electromagnetic effects may
      be sufficient to achieve atomic transformation (1-3). As chemical
      reactions are electric, we reasoned that the high ionic/electric
      activity of extreme pH could be sufficient to drive atomic
      transformation reactions. Heating the reaction mixture amplifies
      the electric activity of high pH and should thus increase reaction
      rates.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] To study whether atomic transformation may occur in a
      heated NaOH solution, we first set up the reflux of a 3.7M NaOH
      solution for increasing times (FIG. 1). We also hypothesized that
      reaction product could become enriched in silicon, because this
      element resides at wave amplitude of the 5th octave in the spiral
      periodic table of elements [6] and so it is a potential end
      product of the transformation of sodium. Therefore, after
      neutralization with acid, the silicon-rich reaction product should
      precipitate out. In fact, we found a white precipitate forming
      early in the neutralization process. No precipitate forms before
      boiling takes place. For neutralization, we used both acetic and
      hydrochloric acids and found that HCl neutralization yields a more
      robust precipitate. Despite this, settling of the precipitate
      takes a long time and even with centrifugation a small loss of
      fines occurred. The precipitate was subsequently dried at 70° C.
      and weighed.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] We also noticed a minor breakdown of the glass material of
      the reaction vessel, and an average mass loss of 2 g of the
      reaction flask over a 24 h refluxing. This is only 1/10th of the
      amount of precipitate obtained during the reaction. In the 5 h
      reactions, an average weight loss was observed of 0.9 g of the
      reaction vessel. The average yield of the white precipitate in
      three reactions was 20.1 g. The amount of precipitate generated in
      the reaction mixture increased nearly linearly with the boiling
      time indicating that the reaction potential was not exhausted over
      24 h of boiling (FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The elemental composition of the white precipitate differs
      substantially from that of the starting neutralized NaOH as well
      as the glass material of the reaction vessel. In Table 1, the
      compositions of the starting neutralized NaOH, the white
      precipitate and the reactor glass material were compared by
      ICP-MS. Analysis of the white precipitate by SEM-EDS (FIG. 2) and
      ICP-MS (Table 1) demonstrated a high concentration of silicon that
      was not present in the starting reagents. In fact, the silicon
      concentration in the HCl neutralized NaOH solution at zero time
      was merely 1.5 ppm, consistent with ACS grade chemicals. The
      concentrations of magnesium, aluminum, and calcium were also
      greatly increased compared with the starting reagents. As 666 g of
      NaOH yielded 20.1 g of precipitate, a conversion factor of 33.13
      can be used to estimate the relative concentration changes of
      elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The data demonstrate that Mg, Ca, Al and Si appeared
      (likely in the form of a mixed sodium silicate compound) as the
      main new constituents during boiling of NaOH. The reactor glass
      contributes just 8% of the silicon content of the white
      precipitate. The consumption of Na during reflux was also evident.
      In addition, the concentration of a number of other elements
      increased to varying degrees in the white precipitate relative to
      time zero. Among these, the greatest increases were shown by Cu,
      Fe, Ti, Mn, Zn and Zr. The concentrations of Al, C, Na, and Si in
      the samples were confirmed by X-ray fluorescence.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] This observation can be interpreted by our new theory of
      the atom (4, 5) as well as the theory of spiral periodic table of
      elements introduced by Russell (6, 7). He suggested that all
      elements are aggregates of light units progressing through their
      evolutionary cycle of disappearance and reappearance. In other
      words, all elements follow a similar life cycle and therefore
      “stable” elements do not exist. According to Russell, all elements
      of matter are positioned along a nine-octave sine wave cycle of
      motion. Each octave has 7 tones (elements) plus a “supertone”
      noble gas that records all information of elements of its octave.
      Atoms can be considered merely as various states of motion of one
      cosmic substance, and are locked into their energetically
      permitted positions on their octave waves.<br>

      [0048] In the reflux reaction, high purity NaOH is used which
      contains sodium, the element consumed during reflux. Sodium is
      positioned as the first element of the fifth octave of the spiral
      periodic table of elements (6, 7). Silicon is at wave amplitude of
      the fifth octave, i.e., it is the element of highest orbital
      velocity, the highest melting point, the most compact
      crystallization, and the hardest one among the elements of the
      fifth octave.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] As objects of matter can be considered to be accumulations
      of electric energy (5, 6), elements may be converted into each
      other by the proper injection of electric energy, which can switch
      an element's gyroscopic plane of motion to the next locked
      position on its octave wave, or up to octave wave amplitude or
      even further up into higher octaves.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In our atomic transformation reaction, we have relied on
      the high ionic/electric activity of extreme pH to inject the
      electric pressure necessary to cause a switch of the gyroscopic
      sodium atom into other locked positions on its octave wave, and
      thus transform it into Mg, Al and Si at increasing concentrations
      in the very same order. Heating is necessary because heating
      destabilizes the normally locked gyroscopic oscillatory motion of
      elements, and facilitates transition into other locked positions
      that correspond to other elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] We have tested whether the white precipitate had an
      autocatalytic effect on itself and could give rise to previously
      absent elements. We heated 0.2 g of white precipitate in a
      platinum crucible at 1000° C. for 1 hr in air atmosphere. On
      SEM-EDS analysis, the heated sample showed significant composition
      changes compared to the starting sample (FIGS. 3 &amp; 4).
      Numerous bright, highly electron-dense crystals appeared, highly
      variable in appearance and elemental composition (FIGS. 4-6 and
      7-9). These were previously undetectable.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The elemental composition of the silicate matrix in FIG. 4
      also differs from that of the starting white precipitate (FIG. 2).
      The concentration of Na increased, with Mg and Ca appearing as
      prominent new elements (FIG. 8). Some loss of Si was also evident.
      We have performed the analysis of a bright, electron dense cluster
      located in the center of FIG. 4. Analyses show high Fe
      concentration, accompanied by Cr, Ni, Mn and Cu (FIGS. 10A &amp;
      10B). Subsequently, we selected stand-alone crystals for analysis.
      Crystal 1 contains high concentrations of Al and Zr (FIGS. 5 &amp;
      9). Crystal 2 (FIG. 6) is mainly composed of Au and Pd (FIG. 11),
      while crystal 3 (FIG. 7) is composed of almost pure W (FIG. 12).
      Au and W were both undetectable in the white precipitate.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] These observations indicate an innate catalytic ability,
      and raise the possibility of the de novo synthesis of a wide range
      of metals of industrial significance. Possibly, the white
      precipitate is an “electrically activated” substance, a property
      common to catalysts, capable of stimulating atomic transformations
      of its own. Although the overall yield of elements of higher
      atomic numbers is low, this will be possible to improve with
      further research.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The results confirm our hypothesis that atomic
      transformation requires electric pressure along with heating,
      which may be Nature's method of synthesizing matter. We have also
      confirmed fundamental observations of the spiral periodic table of
      elements (6, 7). In agreement with Russell's theory, we have
      redefined atomic transformation as atomic rather than “nuclear”
      (5) and now propose that the nuclear atom hypothesis is
      inconsistent with Nature's processes. If atomic bodies are
      generated by external electromagnetic pressure waves (4-7), the
      atom cannot have an energy of its own capable of attracting from
      the inside, e.g., from a solid nucleus. Instead, the atom should
      be viewed as a wound-up spring that seeks equilibrium with its
      low-pressure environment, and will do so unless maintained by a
      continuous input of energy. The physical nature of such an energy
      source remains to be determined.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] We have proven that atomic transformations are feasible
      under conditions typical of chemical catalysis, and so it is
      plausible that the ancient art of alchemy could have had
      substance. Acidic (vinegar) and basic (lye) chemicals have been
      known since ancient times. Silicate compounds are widely
      distributed in Earth's crust. High temperatures and alkaline as
      well as acidic conditions are also present there. Therefore, the
      geochemical conditions are given for the ongoing de novo synthesis
      of elements in Earth's crust, and it is likely that some marine
      chemicals may actually help build continents.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Kervran described that egg-laying hens when fed with
      calcium-deficient but potassium and silicon-containing diet still
      laid hard-shell eggs (8). In our experiment, calcium formation was
      also observed in the white precipitate, as well as during its
      subsequent heating. We have demonstrated the formation of elements
      of higher atomic numbers during heating of the white precipitate.
      Living organisms have the ability to catalyze reactions that would
      require temperatures of 1000° C. by nonbiologic methods of
      chemistry. It is possible that an electrically activated silicon
      compound, when ingested, could be transformed into elements of
      higher atomic numbers inside living cells and thus provide a novel
      avenue of mineral supplementation.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] This study opens the possibility of low energy controlled
      synthesis of elements, and demonstrates the need for a revision of
      our theoretical framework of atomic processes. Further studies in
      this field could help resolve a number of environmental problems
      including the accumulation of radioactive waste, as well as
      pollution caused by mining operations. It appears that new
      theoretical considerations of the atom may well propel physical
      and material sciences into a new era of inconceivable
      possibilities.<br>

      [0066] This study opens the possibility of low energy controlled

      combination of the high ionic/electric activity of extreme pH that
      is operational at both ends of the pH spectrum; i.e., both basic
      and acidic catalysis can be used to different ends. In addition,

      <b>Abstract</b> -- Previously, we introduced a new model of the
      atom that predicted that atomic transformation (transmu-tation)
      could be carried out under low energy conditions akin to chemical
      catalysis. In this paper, we provide proof of this model, using
      liquid and solid state catalysis in a two-step process. We have
      found that the high ionic/electric activity of a concentrated
      sodium hydroxide solution in combination with heating is
      sufficient to induce atomic transformation and provide a product
      high in sodium, alu-minum and silicon. When heated at a
      temperature of 1,000°C, this product yields numerous elements of
      higher atomic masses. Thus, atomic transformation was
      demon-strated using common chemicals and simple laboratory
      procedures. Our results suggest that current theories of the atom
      and atomic processes should be revised to account for low energy
      atomic transformation. Introduction At this time, elemental
      transformation (transmutation) is carried out in nuclear reactors
      or using other sources of nuclear radiation. These methods are
      unsuitable for low cost, mass production of elements and generate
      many radioiso-topes. Over the past two decades, numerous research
      reports have emerged on low energy nuclear reactions, e.g., the
      for-mation of tritium from deuterium on Pd, 1 the formation of Fe
      in gold electrodes, or the formation of helium and cad-mium in a
      Pd electrode, 2 as well as the formation of other elements. 3
      These data were largely viewed with skepticism, as low energy
      nuclear reactions are not explainable within our current
      understanding of atomic processes. We recently introduced a new
      theory of the atom that provides a theoretical framework for the
      design of low ener-gy nuclear reactions. 4,5 The theory proposes
      that atoms are complex electromagnetic waveforms that are
      circulators of the space lattice, the carrier medium for
      electromagnetic interactions. We suggested that only
      electromagnetic energy exists, and therefore electromagnetic
      pressure waves of suffi-cient intensity should induce atomic
      transformation. In addition, the atom should be viewed as a whole,
      irrespective of whether chemical or nuclear reactions are
      concerned. For this reason, we introduce here the term low energy
      atomic transformation to replace the currently used term "nuclear
      reaction" to describe the synthesis of elements under condi-tions
      akin to chemical catalysis. We hypothesized that sufficient
      electric pressure could be generated by utilizing high ionic
      activities of molecules, a method commonly used in chemical
      catalysis. We reasoned that a single catalytic step may be enough
      to produce ele-ments of lower atomic masses, and such procedure is
      demonstrated in this invention. The synthesis of elements of
      higher atomic masses requires an additional catalytic step.
      Materials and Methods All chemicals were obtained from
      Sigma-Aldrich and were of ACS grade or equivalent. All containers
      coming in contact with reaction media were glass. The elemental
      transforma-tion method described here involves a two-step
      reaction. In the first step, 4.5 liters of 3.7M NaOH were gently
      refluxed for 5-24h in a round-bottom glass reactor. After cooling
      to room temperature on a chilled water bath, the pH was adjusted
      slowly to slightly acidic (pH 4-5) with 1:1 HCl under gentle
      stirring. The solution became turbid and a white precipitate began
      to form early in the neutralization process. It is important to
      avoid significant warming up of the solution. The best approach is
      to perform the neutraliza-tion on a chilled water bath and keep
      the temperature at around 20°C. From the slightly acidic pH, the
      mixture was re-adjusted to mildly alkaline by using 1M NaOH until
      pH8 was reached. After stirring was stopped, the supernatant
      slowly cleared and a white precipitate settled out. After the
      precipitate set-tled overnight, the supernatant was carefully
      aspirated off using a peristaltic pump. The precipitate was
      re-suspended in 8L of deionized water and allowed to settle
      overnight again. The settled precipitate was transferred into 1L
      centrifuge tubes with deionized water and spun at 3,500 rpm for
      35min in a Sorvall model RC3B centrifuge. The precipitate was
      washed three more times by re-suspension in deionized water to
      remove residual salts, and spread out on a glass tray to air dry.
      Subsequently, it was heated at 70°C for 7h to reach a constant
      weight and then was weighed. The granular, soft white material was
      ground to a fine powder in a porcelain mortar and stored in a
      plastic jar at room temperature. The second catalytic step
      involved heating the white precipitate to 1,000°C for 1h in a
      Sentrotech STT-1600 tube furnace in an air atmosphere. SEM-EDS
      analyses were performed using a Philips Quanta 600 instrument.<br>
