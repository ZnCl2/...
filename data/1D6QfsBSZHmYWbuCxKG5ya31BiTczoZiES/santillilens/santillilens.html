      Thunder Energies Corporation, an optics, nuclear physics and
      energy company, claims to have detected "invisible entities"
      living in Earth's atmosphere... The corporation is run by
      controversial Harvard-educated Italian-American nuclear physicist
      Dr Ruggero Santilli... The nuclear physicist says the discovery
      was made using the Santilli Telescope he has developed to try to
      discover proof of theoretical anti-matter galaxies, anti-matter
      cosmic rays and anti-matter asteroids... It uses a concave lens -
      the opposite to the convex lenses of standard telescopes... <br>
      <br>
      He said: "This is an exciting discovery. We do not know what these
      entities are, they’re completely invisible to our eyes, our
      binoculars, or traditional Galileo telescopes, but these objects
      are fully visible in cameras attached to our Santilli
      telescope..." <br>

      <b>1. Foreword</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dr. R. M. Santilli, Chief Scientist of Thunder Energies
      Corporation (see his Curriculum , Prizes and Nominations ,
      Publications in antimatter , and the General Archives ) has
      conducted three decades of mathematical, theoretical and
      experimental studies on antimatter initiated in the early1980s
      when he was at at Harvard University under DOE support.<br>
      <br>
      This extended research has produced basically new telescopes,
      today known as Santilli telescopes, which have been conceived,
      designed, constructed, tested and produced to detect antimatter
      galaxies, antimatter cosmic rays and antimatter asteroids
      (international patent pending irrevocably owned by TEC without
      royalty payments).<br>
      <br>
      Since matter and antimatter annihilate at contact into light, as a
      condition for its existence at the classical macroscopic level,
      antimatter must have all characteristics opposite to those of
      matter. For instance, matter-light has a positive index of
      refraction while, as a condition for its existence,
      antimatter-light must have a negative index of refraction (Figure
      1).<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, the focusing of images of matter-light require
      convex lenses as occurring in the Galileo telescopes, while the
      focusing of images of antimatter-light requires concave lenses, as
      occurring in Santilli telescopes (Figure 2).<br>
      <br>
      The above features imply that none of the refractive Galileo-type
      telescopes existing on Earth or in space can detect
      antimatter-light because they are all based on convex lenses.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, we will never see images of antimatter-light with our
      naked eyes because our cornea is convex, and as such, it disperses
      images of antimatter-light all over our retina. The sole
      possibility to detect images of antimatter-light is via images on
      a digital or film camera.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Detection of antimatter galaxies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Santilli telescopes should always be used in pair with
      optically aligned conventional Galileo telescopes, both telescopes
      having the same diameter of the primary lenses. the same curvature
      of the primary lenses and the same focal distances, with the
      understanding that curvature and focal distances become negative
      for the Santilli telescopes (Figure 3).<br>
      <br>
      Under these conditions, the detection of antimatter galaxies with
      a pair of the Galileo and the Santilli telescopes can be made
      according to the following rules (consult TEC for more technical
      information):<br>
      <br>
      1) All alignments in the night sky are done with the Galileo
      telescope which is generally equipped with an eyepiece;<br>
      <br>
      2) All images are taken from equal digital or film cameras in both
      the Galileo and the Santilli telescopes as shown in Figure 3;<br>
      <br>
      3) Whether digital or film, the images from the two telescopes are
      subjected to the same magnification, until faint images become
      detectable over the background;<br>
      <br>
      4) Digital cameras are sufficient for initial scans of the night
      sky, although much more detailed views can be obtained via a film
      camera; and<br>
      <br>
      5) Images focused by the Santilli telescope are considered valid,
      if and only if, they do not exist in the images from the Galileo
      telescope under the same magnification.<br>
      <br>
      Since antimatter galaxies cannot exist in our galactic environment
      and can only exist far away, their images are faint. Consequently,
      the detection of their images are suggested to be done with long
      camera exposures, such as exposures for 15 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      This long exposure generates streaks in the digital cameras that,
      as such, can be clearly distinguished from the background as well
      as from impurities or imperfections of the cameras since said
      impurities and imperfections remain stationary.<br>
      <br>
      The tracking of antimatter galaxies with the Santilli telescope is
      discouraged at the moment. This is due to the fact that, in case
      of tracking, antimatter galaxies will produce small stationary
      dots in the camera that, as such, cannot be distinguished with
      certainty from camera impurities or anomalies.<br>
      <br>
      Matter-Antimatter annihilation also requires that antimatter-light
      must have energy opposite that of matter-light, as predicted by P.
      A. M. Dirac in 1932 and verified by R. M. Santilli in his decades
      of research on antimatter (see the the theoretical confirmation
      and the experimental confirmation).<br>
      <br>
      Under 15 second exposure, the Galileo telescope creates an image
      of matter galaxies consisting of streaks of light over the
      conventional background (Figure 4) while, by contrast, the
      detection of antimatter galaxies with the Santilli telescope
      creates streaks of darkness (Figure 5) over the conventional
      background.<br>
      <br>
      This is essentially due to the fact that the negative energy of
      antimatter-light annihilates in the camera pixel the positive
      energy due to matter-light of the background, resulting in this
      way in streaks of darkness.<br>
      <br>
      It then follows that a conventional matter-light background is
      necessary (under our current knowledge) for the detection of
      antimatter galaxies because, in its absence, no image of far away
      antimatter galaxies could be visible in the camera due to darkness
      of the background.<br>
      <br>
      This is the reason all detections of the night sky with the
      Santilli telescope have been done to date at sea level where the
      conventional matter-light background is sufficient to distinguish
      streaks of darkness.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Detection of antimatter asteroids</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The detection of antimatter asteroids follows rules different than
      those for antimatter galaxies. Since matter and antimatter repel
      each other gravitationally (antigravity), antimatter asteroids are
      repelled by Earth's gravitation and can impact Earth only when
      they have certain value of kinetic energy computed by Dr. S.
      Beghella-Bartoli in the scientific work<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, antimatter asteroids hitting Earth must have said
      minimal impact kinetic energy or more; they annihilate at contact
      with our matter atmosphere; and they produce instantaneous streaks
      of darkness (under 15 second exposure) in the digital or film
      camera generally in the downward direction of penetration in our
      atmosphere. Streaks of darkness over the matter-light background
      in the Santilli telescope under 15 second exposure are candidates
      for the detection of antimatter asteroids when they have a
      direction different than those of the streaks of matter and
      antimatter galaxies (Figure 6).<br>
      <br>
      It should be indicated that, at this stage of our knowledge, we do
      not know how to detect antimatter asteroids in space prior to
      their impact on Earth, because our matter-light (whether from our
      Sun or from our lasers) could be absorbed without reflection when
      hitting antimatter asteroids that generally are at absolute zero
      degree temperature.<br>
      <br>
      One of the reasons Thunder Energies Corporation is involved in the
      study of antimatter light is precisely due to the need to develop
      new technologies for the advance detection of antimatter asteroids
      because, in the event we are hit by a small antimatter asteroid
      the size of a football, all our military, industrial and civilian
      communications will be disrupted for days due to the extreme
      excitation of our atmosphere from the radiations emitted by the
      matter-antimatter annihilation, as suggested by Dr. R. Anderson et
      al. in the scientific work<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Detection of antimatter cosmic rays</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The detection of antimatter cosmic rays follows rules different
      than those for the detection of antimatter galaxies and antimatter
      asteroids. As it is the case for conventional cosmic rays of
      matter, antimatter cosmic rays are the result of primordial
      explosions in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, antimatter cosmic rays reach our atmosphere at very
      high speeds; they annihilate in the upper layer of our atmosphere;
      and their sole detection is that via the antimatter-light produced
      by their annihilation that reaches us at the ground level.<br>
      <br>
      The detection of antimatter cosmic rays via the Santilli telescope
      is then provided by dots of darkness over the matter-light
      background despite the 15 seconds exposure, which feature confirm
      the virtually instantaneous propagation in our atmosphere of
      antimatter-light originated by the antimatter cosmic rays (Figure
      7).<br>
      <br>
      It should be clarified that the instantaneous dots of darkness
      created by antimatter cosmic rays by the Santilli telescope are
      not caused by ordinary light since the same dots are absent in the
      Galileo telescope. Also, antimatter-light is physically different
      than ordinary matter-light (see Figure 1 for the different
      refraction).<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. Expected new technologies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Due to the democracy between matter and antimatter requested by
      physical laws (such as the PCT theorem), the above advances
      predict the possible future development of a basically new digital
      camera with pixels detecting photons with negative energy, as a
      complement of current pixels that solely detect photons with
      positive energy. In the eventuality, the indicated new camera is
      developed, the matter-light background is not needed for the
      detection of antimatter images.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETECTION OF INVISIBLE TERRESTRIAL ENTITIES (ITE) OF THE FIRST
        AND SECOND KIND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      While it's deep space capabilities are well documented in
      scientific journals, it was only by chance that our telescope
      detected invisible terrestrial entities within the earth's
      atmosphere. Scientifically, this should be impossible because when
      ordinary matter and anti-matter come into contact, the annihilate
      one another.<br>
      <br>
      So, what are these invisible terrestrial entities (ITE) that have
      been observed and photographed? These entities defy our current
      scientific knowledge. Some appear to move at highly erratic speeds
      while others appear to be almost stationary. Some ITE appear as
      dark entities (Figure 8) while others give off a luminous glow
      (Figure 9). To say anything beyond this would be speculation. What
      I can say is that these entities are invisible to the human eye
      and to conventional telescopes and binoculars; they can only be
      observed with our telescope.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Santilli has developed his telescope with concave lenses also
      for the study of other forms of light besides antimatter light.
      Thunder Energies Corporation is supporting research for the
      possible conversion of matter-light, from its conventional form
      with positive index of refraction, into a form with negative index
      of refraction without its necessary origination from antimatter
      (TEC international patent pending).<br>

      </b><b>Abstract. </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In preceding works, the author has: 1) developed an anti-Hermitean
      image of the mathematics used for matter characterized by a map
      called isoduality and denoted with the upper symbol d; 2) achieved
      the isodual classical representation of neutral antimatter via the
      conjugation of all physical quantities and their units, thus
      resolving the inconsistencies of negative energies; and 3) shown
      that the the isodual (antimatter) light has negative energy Ed =
      􀀀E, experiences a negative curvature tensor Rd = 􀀀R
      gravitational repulsion) when in a matter gravitational field,
      and possesses a negative index of refraction nd = 􀀀n when
      propagating within a transparent matter medium. In this paper, we
      show, apparently for the first time, that the only possible
      detection of antimatter light with a negative index of refraction
      is that via a telescope with concave lenses; we build the first
      known antimatter telescope verifying these conditions; and report
      the first known detection of images apparently focused by a
      telescope with concave lenses, which images appears as being of
      darkness, rather than light, thus supporting the negative energy
      of their origination. In the event confirmed, these unusual
      images may result in being the fiorst detection of antimatter
      galaxies, antimatter asteroids and antimatter cosmic rays. The
      main result of this paper is an apparent confirmation of Dirac's
      [5] original 1928 conception of antiparticles as possessing
      negative energy because necessary for consistency with the
      negative energy of light in the electron-positron annihilation e+
      + e􀀀 􀀀!&nbsp; + d, the consistency of negative energies being
      apparently assured by their treatment via the isodual mathematics.
      The paper ends with the suggestion to test the gravity of the
      photons in the electron-positron annihilation and conduct other
      truly basic tests on antimatter.<br>

      Abstract. In preceding works, R. M. Santilli [1] has developed the
      new isodual mathematics and related theory for the treatment of
      antimatter at the classical as well as quantum levels in a way
      compatible with existing experimental knowledge, and the
      prediction that antimatter light has a negative index of
      refraction. More recently, Santilli [2] has shown that the sole
      possible detection of antimatter light with a negative index of
      refraction is that via a telescope with concave lenses; he has
      built such a telescope for the first time, hereon called
      Santilli's telescope and provided tentative views of the Epsilon
      Alpha and Beta region of the night sky suggesting the possible
      detection of antimatter galaxies, asteroids and cosmic rays. In
      order to initiate the expectantly laborious process of verication
      or dismissal of these findings, by using the same telescopes, the
      same camera and the same conditions as those used by Santilli [2],
      in this paper we present pictures providing apparent conrmation
      of the focusing of light in a telescope with concave lenses whose
      most plausible origination is that due to antimatter light.<br>

      Contemporary tbeories of antimatter have a number of
      insufficiencies which stimulatod the recent construction of the
      new iso&amp;al theory b?[,1d on a certain anti-isomorphic map of
      all (classical and quantum) formulations of matter called
      kofualiry. ln this note we show that the isodual theory predicts
      that antimatter emits a new light, called isodual light, which can
      be distinguished from the ordinary light emined by matter via
      gravitational interactions (only). In particular, the isoduat
      theory predicts that all stable antiparticles such as the isodual
      phoion, thi positron and the antiproton cxperience antigravity in
      the field of matter (defined as ihe reversal ofthe sign ofthe
      curvature tensor). The antihydrogen atom is therefore predicted '
      to: experience antigravity in the field of Earth; emit the isodual
      photon; and have the same spectroscopy ofthe hydrogen atom,
      although subjected to an anti-isomorphic isodual map. In this note
      we also show that the isodual theory predicts that bound states
      ofelementary panicles and antiparticles (such as the positronium)
      experience ordinary gravitation in both fields of matter and
      antimatter, thus bypassing known objections against antigravity. A
      number of intriguing and fundamental, open theoretical and
      experimental problems of "the new physics of antimatter" are
      pointed out.<br>

      The invention introduces for the first time telescopes for the
      detection of images originating from light emitted by antimatter
      stars or galaxies whose specifications are opposite to those of
      conventional telescopes for the detection of images of far away
      stars or galaxies in accordance with known conjugations in the
      transition from matter to antimatter. In particular, conventional
      convex lenses or concave mirrors for the detection of stars and
      galaxies are replaced with concave lenses and convex mirrors for
      the detection of antimatter stars or galaxies. The invention also
      includes means for the conversion of conventional refractive or
      reflective telescopes for the detection of matter stars or
      galaxies into their conjugate for the detection of antimatter
      stars or galaxies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to a novel arrangement of
      optical lenses, and more particularly, an arrangement of optical
      concave lenses.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] There exist today a large variety of telescopes,
      monoculars, binoculars, camera lens assemblies and other such
      arrangements of lenses, hereinafter referred to as conventional
      optical instruments, to focus and amplify light. The light focused
      by conventional optical instruments is typically the light that is
      emitted by matter at high temperature, including for example, the
      light of a star or the light of a flame, hereinafter referred to
      as matter-light.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Turning to FIG. 1, conventional optical instruments
      essentially operate in the manner of Galilean's refractive
      telescopes, or equivalent optical arrangements, whose main
      principles are as follows. Light 2 is attracted by the
      gravitational field of a matter body 1 such as Earth, as
      illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] FIG. 2 depicts a matter-light beam 4 penetrating within a
      transparent matter-medium. As a complement of the attraction
      described above and illustrated in FIG. 1, a matter-light beam 4
      penetrating within a transparent matter-medium such as water 3
      experiences a deviation from its natural trajectory for an angle
      5. The angle 5 will tend to be positive, as light passes from a
      medium of one density (e.g., air) to a medium of a greater density
      (e.g., water). The deviation of the light from its natural
      trajectory is called refraction, as illustrated by angle 5 in FIG.
      2.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] FIG. 3 depicts a convex lens. Conventional optical
      instruments use refraction, as described above in conjunction with
      FIG. 2, to focus the image of a faraway matter object such as a
      star. This is typically done in a telescope or binocular using one
      or more convex lenses 6, of the general type depicted in FIG. 3. A
      convex lens is characterized by curvature that is oriented toward
      the source, as illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] FIG. 4 depicts a conventional optical instrument in the
      form of a Galilean telescope. A Galilean telescope for viewing
      light 50 from a faraway star is composed of a tube 7 containing in
      its interior a convex primary lens 6 that focuses the image in the
      eyepiece or camera 8. The telescope is completed with a mechanism
      9 configured for a fine adjustment to alter the distance between
      lens 6 and the eyepiece or camera 8. The adjustment assures that
      eyepiece or camera 8 is at the correct focal distance of lens 6,
      as illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5. Binoculars or other conventional
      optical equipment for viewing images of matter-light adhere to the
      same general principles as the Galilean telescope.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0036] Various embodiments disclosed herein deal with a new type
      of optical instrument that may take the form of telescopes,
      monoculars, binoculars or other optical instrument specifically
      conceived, developed and tested to focus light emitted by
      antimatter at high temperature. Such light may derive from an
      antimatter star or antimatter fuel combustion, and is hereinafter
      called antimatter-light. The new optical equipment is the
      culmination of research in antimatter by the present
      inventor—research that began with the discovery of a new
      mathematics built by the inventor as a member of the Department of
      Mathematics at Harvard University in the early 1980s. Today this
      branch of mathematics is known as isodual mathematics. The
      telescope, binocular or other optical instruments based on the
      isodual mathematics are, therefore, called isodual telescope,
      isodual monocular, isodual binocular, or more generally, an
      isodual optical instrument.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Experimental evidence establishes that in the transition
      from matter to antimatter there is the conjugation of each and
      every property belonging to matter. This total conjugation is
      necessary for the representation of the annihilation of matter and
      antimatter when they touch each other, to such a level that, in
      the event only one property of matter is not conjugated in the
      transition to antimatter, would be inconsistencies for the
      representation of matter-antimatter annihilation.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The isodual mathematics has been constructed to achieve the
      conjugation of all physical quantities of matter. The mathematics
      underlying the conventional Galilean telescope and other optical
      instruments for matter-light is characterized by the basic left
      and right units +1 at all levels of study. By contrast, the
      isodual mathematics underlying the isodual optical instruments is
      based on the left and right negative unit -1, and then the
      reconstruction of functional, differential calculus, mechanics,
      optics, etc., in such a way to admit -1 as the correct left and
      right unit. On mathematical grounds, the transition from matter to
      antimatter requires an anti-isomorphism in order to represent
      experimental evidence, for instance, the annihilation of matter
      and antimatter at contact. The most elementary mathematics which
      is anti-isomorpohic to the conventional mathematics used for
      matter is that whose fundamental left and right unit is -1 at all
      levels, including numbers, functional analysis, differential
      calculus, or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The above mathematical and theoretical foundations are
      described in detail in the monograph by R. M. Santilli entitled
      “Isodual Theory of Antimatter with Application to Antigravity,
      Grand Unification and the Spacetime Machine,” Springer (2006), the
      content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its
      entirety for use in explaining the theory and principles of
      isodual mathematics.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] FIG. 6 depicts a convex lens assembly according to an
      embodiment of the present invention. Since faraway stars have to
      be studied at the classical level and must be assumed as being
      neutral, the isodual mathematics has permitted the classical
      conjugation from a neutral matter-star to a neutral
      antimatter-star via the conjugation of all physical quantities,
      except charge. The above main features can be improved in a
      variety of ways. FIG. 6 illustrates a convex lens assembly for the
      reduction of the aberration consisting of a convex lens 10 and a
      conjugate lens 11, with the flat terminal surface arranged as
      shown in FIG. 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Consequently, physical quantities of a matter-star such as
      mass, energy, speed, or the like are characterized by positive
      numbers usually measured with positive units of mass, energy,
      speed, or the like. By contrast, all characteristics of an
      antimatter-star, such as mass, energy, speed, or the like have
      negative values as a condition to comply with matter-antimatter
      annihilation, although said negative values are measured via
      negative units of mass, negative unit of energy, negative unit of
      speed, or the like. The referral of negative physical values to
      negative units of measurement eliminated known inconsistencies for
      negative physical quantities.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] There is a similar conjugation for the transition from
      matter-light and antimatter-light. Recall that light has no
      charge. Hence, charge conjugation cannot be used for the
      conjugation of light. The isocdual mathematics allows indeed a
      consistent conjugation from matter-light to antimatter-light
      characterized by the change of sign of all physical quantities,
      such as energy, frequency, polarization, or the like, although
      always measured in terms of corresponding negative units. In
      particular, antimatter-light has negative energy as originally
      predicted by P. A. M. Dirac in 1932 although measured with a
      negative unit of energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Following decades of mathematical theoretical and
      experimental research, the present inventor has identified and
      experimentally confirmed the principles of the isodual telescope
      indicated below, including for example, the following five
      principles illustrated in FIGS. 7-11:<br>
      <br>
      [0044] 1) FIG. 7 illustrates antimatter light being repelled by
      the gravitational field of a matter-body. For example,
      antimatter-light 13 is repelled by the gravitational field of a
      matter-body 12 as illustrated in FIG. 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] 2) FIG. 8 illustrates the refraction of antimatter light as
      it passes from a transparent material of a given density (e.g.,
      air) to a material of higher density (e.g., water). As a
      complement of the above repulsion, an antimatter-light beam 14
      penetrating within a transparent matter-medium such as water 3
      experiences a deviation from its natural trajectory for an angle
      15 which is the opposite of the angle 5 of FIG. 2 for
      matter-light, and is therefore assumed to be being negative. Thus,
      the antimatter light has a negative index of refraction defined by
      angle 15, since the antimatter light is deflected in the opposite
      direction by an amount angle 15 as compared to the deflection
      angle 5 of FIG. 2 for matter-light. That is, the antimatter light
      is deflected towards the left side of FIG. 8 (forward, as compared
      to the angle of entry into the higher density medium) rather than
      being deflected towards the right side of FIG. 2 for the
      matter-light (rearward, as compared to the angle of entry into the
      higher density medium). The deviation of antimatter light passing
      from a transparent material of a given density (e.g., air) to a
      material of higher density (e.g., water) is called isodual
      refraction, as illustrated in FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] 3) FIG. 9 depicts a concave lens for focusing and
      amplifying antimatter-light from a faraway antimatter star or
      galaxy. As a result of a refraction opposite that for matter-light
      refraction, in order to focus antimatter-light from a faraway
      antimatter star or galaxy, a telescope must use one or more
      concave lenses 16 namely lenses whose curvature is oriented away
      from the source, as illustrated in FIG. 9.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] 4) FIG. 10 depicts an isodual optical instrument using a
      concave lens as shown in FIG. 9. The isodual telescope, isodual
      monocular, isodual binocular or isodual optical instrument for
      viewing antimatter-light 51 from a faraway antimatter-star or
      galaxy is typically composed of a tube 52 containing in its
      interior concave lens 16 that focuses the image of a faraway
      antimatter star or galaxy in the eyepiece or camera 8. The tube 52
      is typically made of a material with sufficient rigidity and
      strength to hold the lens(es) and eyepiece or camera 8 securely in
      place. Such materials may include metal, cardboard, plastic or
      other synthetic solid materials, or the like. The tube 52 often
      has a round cross-section, but may be configured with a
      cross-section having various other shapes, e.g., rectangular,
      triangular, oval, or the like. The tube 52 may be configured with
      one or more adjustment mechanisms that allows a user to alter the
      distance between the lens(es) and the eyepiece or camera 8. The
      device depicted in FIG. 12 is configured with a fine adjustment
      mechanism 9 to alter the distance from lens 16 to the eyepiece or
      camera 8. This ensures that the concave lens 16 can be adjusted to
      be the correct focal distance from the eyepiece or camera 8. The
      device may also be configured with a course adjustment mechanism
      for making larger adjustments to the distance from lens 16 to the
      eyepiece or camera 8. The eyepiece or camera 8 depicted in FIG. 10
      is shown mounted at the end of tube 52. In some embodiments, for
      convenience of the user, the eyepiece or camera 8 is located
      alongside the tube 52 with an additional assembly of lenses
      provided to reflect the image from the rear of the tube (where
      eyepiece or camera 8 is shown in the figure) forward to the more
      convenient location of the eyepiece or camera 8. In such
      embodiments the eyepiece or camera 8 may be located anywhere
      alongside the tube 52, or even away from the tube itself, so long
      as a lens or mirror assembly is provided to allow antimatter-light
      51 traveling down the tube 52 to be directed to, and pass through
      or into, the eyepiece or camera 8. That is, the eyepiece or camera
      8 is configured to receive antimatter-light 51 travelling down the
      tube 52 and focused by the concave lenses 16 or other lens
      assembly within the tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] 5) FIG. 11 depicts a concave lens assembly that includes a
      concave lens 17 and a conjugate lens 18 for reducing aberration in
      the viewed object. The above main features of the isodual optical
      instruments can be improved in a variety of ways. For instance,
      for the reduction of the aberration, the concave lens assembly
      consists of a concave lens 17 and a conjugate lens 18 with flat
      terminal surface shown in FIG. 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] FIG. 12 depicts an isodual telescope paired with a
      conventional Galilean telescope for spotting purposes. It should
      be noted that the isodual telescope does not focus images
      originating from matter-light, since the latter is dispersed in
      the internal walls of the telescope. In the same way, the Galilean
      telescope cannot focus or amplify any image whatsoever caused by
      antimatter light because the latter too would be dispersed in the
      internal walls of the telescope.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Consequently, in order to identify which portion of the
      night sky is observed, the isodual telescope may be combined in
      pair with a Galilean telescope, as illustrated in FIG. 12 with the
      optically achieved parallel alignment of their respective symmetry
      axes 23 and 24 as well as viewfinders 21 and 22. This may be
      implemented by aligning the two telescopes and fastening them
      together using brackets 55 and 56. In this way, the identification
      of the observed region of the sky is made via Galilean telescope
      and finders 21 and 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Both the Galilean and isodual telescopes have a diffused
      background light 60 that can create difficulties in the detection
      of images via a digital or film camera. In order to distinguish
      faint images from said background, the coupled Galilean and
      isodual telescope are set to view a given region of the night sky
      for a sufficiently long exposure, such as 15 seconds, or any
      required length of time from 1 second to 180 minutes or more.
      Using a sufficient time exposure will create images in the form of
      a streak 35 in the Galilean telescope that, as such, is so clearly
      distinguished from the background that its existence is beyond
      scientific doubt.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Contrary to expectations, the inspection of the night sky
      via the above identified pair of telescopes has established that
      the isodual telescope does focus and amplify streaks 36 depicted
      in FIG. 14 which have the same orientation and length as those of
      the Galilean telescope. While streaks 35 of FIG. 13 in the
      Galilean telescope are streaks of light, streaks 36 of FIG. 14 in
      the isodual telescope are of darkness, thus confirming that
      antimatter-light has negative energy. The only conceivable or
      otherwise plausible origin of black streaks 36 is that they
      originate from antimatter stars or galaxies since there is no
      possibility whatsoever that such streaks could be formed by
      matter-light in a telescope with concave lens. More specifically,
      streaks of ordinary light are formed on a conventional digital
      camera thanks to the photoelectric effect occurring at the level
      of individual pixels, according to which ordinary light hitting a
      pixel creates a different of electric potential which is used by
      the electronic system to form an image. Since observations have
      been conducted to date at sea level, the camera used for FIG. 14
      did detect diffuse light originating from ordinary galaxies which
      is depicted as a background in the figures. Therefore, the streaks
      of darkness repeatedly detected by the inventor and depicted in
      FIG. 14 can only be created by annulling the photoelectric effect
      at the level of individual pixels caused by ordinary light. In
      turn, such annulment of the photoelectric effect is a confirmation
      of the historical hypothesis by Paul M. Dirac, the discoverer of
      antimatter, according to which antimatter carries a negative
      energy. In fact, only a light carrying negative energy can annul
      the difference of potential created by the photoelectric effect of
      ordinary. In turn, the negative value of the energy of light
      emitted by antimatter is a confirmation of the isodual mathematics
      based on the left and right unit -1. Note the absence of
      contradiction for negative energy since they are measured with
      negative units, thus being equivalent, but conjugated to ordinary
      positive energies measured with positive units.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The present inventor has additionally detected clear dots
      37 of FIG. 15, as well as darkness in the image focused by the
      isodual telescope. The dark dots originate from antimatter cosmic
      rays since the dots were obtained from a 15 second exposure. Only
      a virtually instantaneous propagation of light under a 15 seconds
      exposure could have created dark dots 37. In turn, the sole
      scientific origin is that of antimatter cosmic rays annihilating
      in the upper regions of our atmosphere with the resulting
      antimatter-light rapidly reaching the observer at sea level.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The present inventor has also detected long streaks 38 of
      FIG. 15 of darkness. This too was observed under 15 seconds of
      exposure. It should be noted, however, that streaks 38 have an
      orientation and length completely different than those of streaks
      35 and 36. Consequently, the objects originating the latter
      streaks cannot possibly be faraway antimatter stars or galaxies
      and cannot possibly be antimatter cosmic rays. The sole plausible
      scientific origin is that of small antimatter asteroids at great
      speed annihilating in our upper atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIG. 16 depicts an optical arrangement of two lenses
      designed to decrease aberration. The basic concave lens of various
      embodiments disclosed herein can be improved in a number of ways.
      FIG. 16 illustrates an improvement to decrease aberration via the
      pairing of concave lens 100 and a convex lens 101 with matching
      conjugate curvature, the latter ending with a plane surface
      perpendicular to the symmetry axis.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] It should be noted that the human eye will never be able to
      view antimatter object in a distinct way in the manner of viewing
      matter objects because the human iris is convex and, as such, it
      will disperse all over the retina antimatter light, rather than
      converge it into an image. Yet another novelty of this invention
      is the experimental confirmation that a film camera 8 is
      distinctly better than currently available digital cameras for the
      detection of faint images caused by antimatter-light. This is due
      to the fact that the chemical processes in a film occur at
      molecular distances, while processes in the pixels of a digital
      camera occur at distances at least one thousand times larger. The
      greater sensitivity of the former over the latter is, therefore,
      evident.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIG. 17 depicts an optical arrangement for converting a
      Galilean refractive telescope into an isodual telescope. Recall
      than mankind has produced a large variety of telescopes, with
      several of them being in orbit around Earth outside of the
      atmosphere and the distortion it introduces. Yet none of the
      variety of conventional telescopes are capable of detecting
      antimatter stars or galaxies. Another novelty of this invention is
      the conversion of a Galilean or similar refractive telescope into
      an isodual telescope. The conversion may be achieved via the
      addition of a removable concave lens assembly depicted in FIG. 17
      consisting of a tube 107 with outside diameter equal to the inside
      diameter of tube 103 of a conventional Galilean telescope, which
      tube 107 is open at one end and at the opposite end a concave lens
      106 whose curvature radius is the same as that of the convex lens
      104. The concave lens assembly 109, as depicted in FIG. 18, is
      then inserted inside the tube 103 of the Galilean telescope in
      such as way that the insert of the concave lens 106 achieves the
      desired concave conversion of the convex lens 104, at which point
      the Galilean telescope is turned into an isodual telescope.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The embodiments disclosed herein that convert a
      conventional refractive telescope into a refractive isodual
      telescope afford the advantage of the knowledge of the exact
      location of the region of the sky under detection, since such a
      location can be accurately detected via the conventional Galilean
      telescope prior to its conversion into an isodual telescope.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] FIG. 19 depicts another class of telescope for the focusing
      of matter-light is based on a concave mirror 111, rather than lens
      5. In this case, as depicted in FIG. 19, matter-light 110 from a
      faraway star of galaxy enter the tube 120 of the telescope, is
      reflected by the concave mirror 111 resulting in an image on a
      camera or other instrument located at the focal point 112.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] FIG. 20 depicts an isodual reflective telescope according
      to embodiments disclosed herein. Yet another novelty of this
      invention is given by the isodual reflective telescope of FIG. 20
      in which the main mirror 150 is convex due to the negative
      character of the index of refraction and refection of antimatter
      light. Convex mirror 150 is housed at one end of tube 151 the
      opposing end being open. Antimatter-light from a faraway
      antimatter star or galaxy reaches mirror 150 and it is focused on
      a detecting apparatus 114 which is located at the focal point of
      mirror 150, The reflective isodual telescope is equipped with
      mechanical means for small adjustments of the position of
      detecting apparatus 114 so as to ensure proper focus, external
      conventional viewer and other conventional components, the details
      of which would be known to those of ordinary skill in the art and
      are therefore not depicted in the figures.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] FIG. 21 depicts an optical arrangement for converting a
      conventional reflective telescope into a reflective isodual
      telescope. Yet another novelty of this invention is the conversion
      of a conventional reflective telescope into a reflective isodual
      telescope. As depicted in FIG. 21 the conversion is done via an
      assembly 118 similar to that of FIG. 18 housing a convex mirror
      116 with the same but conjugate focal distance of concave mirror
      111 and its own detection apparatus 117 located at the focal point
      of convex mirror 116. Following the removal of detection apparatus
      112 from the conventional telescope, assembly 118 is inserted in
      inside tube 120 of the conventional reflective telescope, at which
      point the latter becomes a reflective isodual telescope. The
      conversion herein considered has the advantage that the region of
      the sky inspected by the isodual telescope is known with precision
      because detected via the conventional refractive telescope.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] FIG. 22 depicts an isodual optical assembly with a single,
      primary, convex lens with flat back surface. Another novelty of
      this invention is given by accurate means for focusing
      antimatter-light. In FIG. 22, we present the main optics of a
      single, primary, convex lens 200 with flat back surface 201
      perpendicular to the symmetry axis 202, by showing that a
      conventional matter-light 300 is first subjected to a conventional
      refraction with angle 203 when passing through the convex lens,
      and then to a second refraction with angle 204 when passing
      through the flat back surface, both refractions and related angles
      being crucial for the accurate prediction of the focal distance as
      well as its accurate construction, as well known to the skilled in
      the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] FIG. 23 depicts the isodual lens of FIG. 22 by showing
      that, in this case, the flat back surface is divergent, rather
      than convergent. FIG. 23 illustrates the corresponding case for
      antimatter-light by showing that antimatter-light 301 passing
      through the primary concave lens 205 is indeed subjected to the
      new isodual refraction of this invention with negative angle 207
      also called isodual angle, but that, contrary to the case for
      matter-light of FIG. 22, when antimatter-light passes through the
      flat back surface 206, it experience a deflection with angle 208,
      rather than the second isodual refraction needed for proper
      focusing of the antimatter-light.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] FIG. 24 depicts an improved single, primary, concave lens
      with front main concave surface and a back equally concave surface
      with bigger diameter for proper focusing of antimatter-light. FIG.
      24 illustrates one embodiment disclosed herein for the solution of
      the above problem and the proper focusing of antimatter-light.
      FIG. 24 shows the case of one single primary concave lens and
      essentially consists in the replacement of the flat back surface
      of FIG. 23 with a concave surface whose radius 210 is bigger than
      the primary concave radius 209 for an amount set by the isodual
      focal distance, here referred to the focal distance for isodual
      lenses of the isodual optical instrument.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] FIG. 25 depicts an improved doublet 214 configured to focus
      antimatter-light consisting of a primary concave lens an inter
      media convex lens to reduce aberration and a back concave surface
      with radius larger than the primary one for proper focusing of the
      antimatter-light according to various embodiments disclosed
      herein. The embodiment depicted in FIG. 25 may be achieved by
      combining two complementary flat backed isodual lenses 212 and 213
      which are similar to the lens shown in FIG. 23. The lenses 212 and
      213 are mated at their flat surface 213.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The following paragraphs include specifications of an
      embodiment for an isodual telescope or monocular for the focusing
      of antimatter light as depicted in FIG. 10 with manufacturing data
      as per actual samples constructed and tested by the inventor.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] FIG. 27 presents TABLE 1 listing manufacturing data for a
      conventional telescope with 2010 mm primary convex single lens and
      1.250 focal distance. Consider a conventional refractive Galilean
      telescope with conventional, convex primary single lens of 210
      outside diameter (OD) and 1.250 meter in focal length. The body of
      the telescope, also called tube, is notoriously realized in light
      weight synthesis substances, such as PVC, or in aluminum depending
      on needs. Since such a body is widely available commercially all
      over the world, its detailed construction data are ignored, and
      will not be needed by one of ordinary skill in the art. Therefore,
      we shall concentrate here on the manufacturing data of the primary
      convex 2010 mm lens which is depicted in FIG. 26 and its
      manufacturing drawing for the indicated OD and focal length are
      presented in Table 1 which is provided as part of FIG. 27, with
      all data, including curvatures and focal distances expressed via
      positive numerical values as well known to the skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] We now consider the isodual telescope or monocular of FIG.
      6 for the focusing of antimatter-light with one single, primary,
      concave lens also of 210 mm OD and with the isodual focal lens of
      -1.250 meters (that's minus 1.250 meters), by noting that in the
      isodual optics all isodual quantities, including radii and focal
      distance are expressed in terms of negative numbers. FIG. 28
      presents a drawing of the new single, primary lens with double
      concave surfaces of this invention while all its construction data
      are presented in Table 2 which is provided as part of FIG. 29. The
      extension of the manufacturing data to the double isodual lens of
      FIGS. 6 and 25 would be known to those of ordinary skill in the
      art and, therefore, it is omitted for brevity and clarity of
      description.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] FIG. 30 depicts a flowchart for a method of practicing an
      embodiment disclosed herein. The method of FIG. 30 begins at block
      3001 and proceeds to block 3003 to identify information from the
      Global Positioning System (GPS). In block 3003 the operator
      identifies an accurate consistent with the GPS system, and also
      identifies the GPS Coordinates of the optically aligned pair of
      Galilean and isodual telescopes of FIG. 12 mounted in any desired
      tripod, the details of which would be known to those of ordinary
      skill in the art and are therefore not depicted in the figures.
      The pair of telescopes are then aligned in block 3005 via
      conventional viewers 21 and 22 to a desired star in the night sky.
      In block 3007 the selected digital or film camera 8 is set at the
      desired sensitivity and at the desired exposure generally of the
      order of 15 seconds or more. Proceeding to block 3009, camera 8 is
      placed in the Galilean telescope and in block 3011 its focal
      position is adjusted via means 9m. In block 3013 pictures of the
      selected region of the night sky may be taken. In block 3015 the
      same camera 8 may be mounted on the isodual telescope, as depicted
      in FIG. 12, following assurance that its focal position is the
      same as that of the Galilean telescope. In block 3017 additional
      pictures are taken of the selected region of the night sky with
      the isodual telescope. Block 3019 involves comparative analysis,
      to detect valid images of antimatter object that are solely
      present in the pictures taken by the isodual telescope, but absent
      in the corresponding pictures taken with the Galilean telescope.
      The method of FIG. 30 ends in block 3020.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The same procedure as above also applies for view of the
      night sky taken via the conversion of a Galilean telescope into an
      isodual telescope according to FIGS. 17 and 18. In this case,
      pictures are first taken via the Galilean telescope, then concave
      lens assembly 209 is inserted in the Galilean telescope which is
      then converted into the isodual telescope. Additional pictures of
      the same region of the sky with the same camera and the same
      exposure may then be taken with the converted isodual telescope,
      and the related pictures are subjected to the above indicated
      comparative analysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The same or similar procedures also apply for a pair of
      conventional reflective and isodual telescopes respectively of
      FIGS. 19 and 20 optically aligned according to the same rules used
      for the aligned of the refractive telescopes of FIG. 12. Pictures
      in the two telescopes are then taken via the same rules as above
      and subjected to comparative analysis the same rules as those for
      the conversion of the refractive telescope into an isodual version
      also apply for the conversion of a reflective telescope into an
      isotopic version as depicted in FIG. 21.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The following passages describe operation of the isodual
      telescope or monocular in a first embodiment of this invention,
      that coupled to an equivalent Galilean telescope or monocular
      according to FIG. 12, both telescopes having the same 210 mm OD
      primary lens, the same focal length in absolute value, the same
      tubes, the same conventional exterior alignment scopes, the same
      adjustment for the fine setting of the focal distance, and the
      same final detection, whether a conventional digital or film
      camera as commercially available all over the world and as very
      well known to any skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Upon identifying the accurate time, the operator identifies
      the GPS Coordinates of the optically aligned pair of Galilean and
      isodual telescopes of FIG. 12 mounted in any desired tripod (not
      shown). The pair of telescopes may be adjusted to align them via
      conventional viewers 21m 22 to a desired star in the night sky.
      The selected digital or film camera 8 is set at the desired
      sensitivity and at the desired exposure generally of the order of
      15 seconds or more. The length, in time, of the exposure depends
      on the desired length of the streaks so as to be clearly distinct
      over the background.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Longer, in time, exposures will produce longer lines on the
      film. Camera 8 is then first placed in the Galilean telescope and
      its focal position is adjusted via means 9m after which pictures
      of the selected region of the night sky are taken. Then the same
      camera 8 is mounted in the isodual telescope as depicted in FIG.
      12 following assurance that its focal position is the same as that
      of the Galilean telescope, and additional pictures are taken of
      the selected region of the night sky with the isodual telescope.
      Via subsequent comparative analysis, valid images of antimatter
      object are those solely present in the pictures taken by the
      isodual telescope and absent in the corresponding pictures taken
      with the Galilean telescope.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] A similar procedure as above applies for view of the night
      sky taken via the conversion of a Galilean telescope into an
      isodual telescope according to FIGS. 17 and 18. In this case,
      pictures may first be taken via the Galilean telescope. Then the
      concave lens assembly 209 may be inserted in the Galilean
      telescope to convert it into an isodual telescope. Additional
      pictures of the same region of the sky with the same camera and
      the same exposure may be taken with the converted isodual
      telescope, and the related pictures are subjected to the above
      indicated comparative analysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] A similar procedure also applies for a pair of conventional
      reflective and isodual telescopes respectively of FIGS. 19 and 20
      optically aligned according to the same rules used for the aligned
      of the refractive telescopes of FIG. 12. Pictures in the two
      telescopes are then taken via the same rules as above and
      subjected to comparative analysis the same rules as those for the
      conversion of the refractive telescope into an isodual version
      also apply for the conversion of a reflective telescope into an
      isotopic version as depicted in FIG. 21.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The extension of the above specifications from to arbitrary
      smaller or bigger diameter telescopes, or to a monocular optical
      device, is within the skill of one of ordinary skill in the art
      and it is, and therefore is not further described.<br>
