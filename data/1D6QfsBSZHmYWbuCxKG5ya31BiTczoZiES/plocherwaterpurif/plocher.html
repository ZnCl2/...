      <br>
      In the last decades there has been a growing awareness of the
      existence of energy forms other than the known ones of
      electricity, magnetism, radioactivity, chemical and thermal
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      It is one of these "other" forms of energy which is utilized by
      Roland Plocher in his Energy System. It appears to be omnipresent
      in Nature. Presently it rather belongs in the faculty of
      theoretical physics or philosophy than in the exact sciences.<br>
      <br>
      The energy itself is assumed to have a minute wavelength and can
      therefore not be measured by instruments currently available to
      science, but the results derived from its practical application
      can be measured, quantified and replicated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Plocher Apparatus</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the Plocher System this fine energy is concentrated by an
      apparatus and used to copy or imprint the attributes of one or
      more substances onto other substances. It works much like a photo
      copier or a laser printer where the energy of the laser beam is
      replaced by the focused energy of the Plocher apparatus.<br>

      </b><b>Inventor: PLOCHER ROLAND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A swimming pool water filter has a housing (1) with an inlet (4)
      and an outlet (10) with a base panel (3) and cover (2). The
      housing is sub-divided into several co-axial chambers (6.1-6.3)
      arranged in the direction of water flow from the core outwards.
      &lt;??&gt;The chambers are packed with bulk solid filter materials
      e.g. gravel, basalt, zeolite, evacite, active carbon granules
      etc.. The packing materials are inserted in different mixtures,
      ratios and grain sizes. The outer chambers are preferably of
      larger cross-sectional area than the inner chambers. The feed(10)
      pipe (4) enters through the base (3) and discharges against the
      cover inner face. Having descended through the first chamber water
      passes radially under a curtain wall (5) to the second chamber
      through which it rises to overflow at the top into the outermost
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a device for cleaning, treating,
      filtering, pollutant reduction and oxygen enrichment of liquids,
      in particular of water with a container, which is associated with
      at least one inlet and at least one outlet.<br>
      <br>
      Such devices are known for example as a carbon filter, as they can
      be used in a conventional circuit, for example a swimming pool or
      the like. They serve u. a. also to free conventional hot water
      from unpleasant and unwanted odors and germs.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage, however, is that previous and conventional
      devices are not suitable, for example, soiled water, especially
      soiled water of a swimming pool to reprocess so that it is
      germ-free, clean and free of contamination.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has for its object to provide a device of
      the type mentioned, which eliminates the disadvantages mentioned
      and in which liquid, especially water to be enriched with oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, impurities and heavy metals are to be absorbed and
      germs reduced. Furthermore, the life in such a device should be
      increased considerably.<br>
      <br>
      To achieve this object, that the container is divided into several
      durchströmmbare chambers.<br>
      <br>
      In the present invention, a device is provided in which individual
      chambers are arranged coaxially to one another, which can be
      traversed individually in succession by a liquid to be cleaned.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, the individual chambers, which are arranged
      coaxially from the inside to the outside, flows through from the
      inside to the outside in succession. The individual chambers are
      filled with Stützkies, basalt, zeolite, Evazit, activated carbon,
      etc. in different grains and compositions.<br>
      <br>
      In the preferred embodiment, the coaxial outer chambers are formed
      cross-sectionally, larger than the inner chambers, so that a flow
      rate decreases from the inside to the outside. As a result, the
      liquid flowing through the container has a larger wettable
      surface, so that the cleaning effect, the reduction of germs and
      the absorption of heavy metals is substantially improved.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, in the third chamber, an outer lateral surface is
      permeable to liquid, preferably designed as a perforated plate, so
      that the liquid entering the third chamber flows through it
      partially and penetrates partially through the lateral surface and
      outside on the perforated plate, additionally oxygen enrichment
      takes place.<br>
      <br>
      The inventive device can be used for example in a hot water cycle
      of a swimming pool.<br>
      The resulting germs in the process water are degraded or reduced,
      the absorption of heavy metals optimized, so that at the same time
      by the optimal cleaning effect, the chlorine concentration of the
      water can be reduced to zero, which significantly contributes to
      water quality. It can even be dispensed with a chlorination or
      ozonization or other conventional treatment of process water to
      achieve an even better cleaning effect than conventional cleaning
      methods.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, it is also advantageous if the materials which are
      arranged in the individual chambers, such as basalt, zeolite,
      gravel, activated carbon, are treated, in particular treated. As a
      result, their effectiveness and mode of operation can be
      significantly improved. This should also be within the scope of
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Further advantages, features and details of the invention will
      become apparent from the following description of preferred
      embodiments and from the drawing; this shows in<br>

      <br>
      According to FIG. 1, an apparatus R1 according to the invention
      for cleaning, treatment, filtering, for pollutant reduction and
      for oxygen enrichment comprises a container 1, which is formed
      from a cover element 2 with a bottom element 3.<br>
      <br>
      In approximately the middle, an inlet 4 opens into the bottom
      element 3, which rises almost inwardly against the cover element
      2.<br>
      <br>
      Through the inlet 4, which may, however, also be arranged in the
      region of the cover element 2, the liquid to be purified or the
      water to be purified is pumped into the container 1.<br>
      <br>
      Coaxially around the inlet 4 is formed between the cover element 2
      and the bottom element 3 via a wall 5, a first chamber 6.1
      coaxially surrounds the inlet 4.<br>
      <br>
      For example, a connection 7, for example, is formed as an opening
      between the wall 5 and the base element 3, wherein a further wall
      element 8coaxially and at a distance surrounds the wall 5, so that
      a second chamber 6.2 is formed.<br>
      <br>
      The chamber 6.2 is, as is apparent from Fig. 2, formed in a
      circular cross-section and completely surrounds the wall 5 and the
      first chamber 6.1.<br>
      <br>
      The wall element 8 is preferably connected to the bottom element 3
      in a manner impermeable to liquids, wherein a liquid-permeable
      connection 7 is likewise formed on the end side between the cover
      element 2 and the wall element 8.<br>
      <br>
      The wall element 8 is surrounded by a lateral surface 9, which
      allows the liquid to pass.<br>
      Cover element 2 and bottom element 3 respectively adjoin front
      side of jacket surface 9, wherein bottom element 3 overlaps shell
      surface 9 and simultaneously serves as a collecting container for
      the cleaned liquid, wherein bottom outlet 3 is assigned an outlet
      10.<br>
      <br>
      The chamber 6.3 formed between the lateral surface 9 and the wall
      element 8, which is also of an annular cross-section, allows
      liquid to flow outward through the lateral surface 9. This then
      trickles along the perforated plate down into the bottom element.
      3<br>
      <br>
      Thus, during cleaning, treatment, filtering, in the reduction of
      pollutants at the same time an oxygen enrichment of liquids,
      especially water to improve hygiene, to reduce sulfur, to reduce
      nucleation is optimized, the first chamber 6.1 with a filter
      element 17, in particular as a filter cotton , possibly formed as
      a filter cartridge used and filled an underlying area with support
      gravel 11. The water to be purified, which flows in via the inlet
      4, enters the first chamber 6.1 and flows completely through the
      filter element 17 and then through the support gravel 11. The
      filter element is preferably washable and / or used as an
      exchangeable filter cartridge or as an exchangeable filter cotton
      in the chamber 6.1. Subsequently, the water in the frontal region
      of the wall 5, near the bottom element 3 in the second chamber
      6.2, and there must flow through the introduced basalt 12, then
      the Evazit 13 and the overlying gravel 14 and zeolite 15.<br>
      <br>
      Subsequent to the second chamber 6.2 flows from the second to the
      third chamber 6.3 in the region of the connection 7 frontally
      between the wall element 8 and cover element 2, the water in the
      third chamber 6.3, which is completely filled with zeolite 16. A
      part of the liquid or of the water passes through the
      water-permeable lateral surface 9 to the outside and trickles
      along this lateral surface 9 into the bottom element 3, is
      collected there and discharged via the outlet 10. The other part
      of the water flow flows through the chamber 6.3 completely and is
      collected at the bottom element 3.<br>
      <br>
      In this way, for example, contaminated water of a swimming pool,
      which is interspersed with germs, treat almost completely
      germ-free or clean. As a result, for example, in the water
      treatment of swimming pools on chlorine or other treatments of
      water with bspw. Ozone or UCV light are dispensed with, which
      contributes significantly to the water quality.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Position Number List</b><b><br>
      </b>Important in the present invention is also that in different
      areas in the individual chambers 6.1 to 6.3 support <b>gravel,
        basalt, evacite and zeolite</b> can be arranged in different
      grain sizes and grain sizes. This should also be within the scope
      of the present invention. It should also be within the scope of
      the present invention, as shown in a device R2, that the
      individual chambers 6.1 to 6.3 may be square-shaped, preferably
      hexagonal, honeycomb, polygonal and / or even rectangular in
      cross-section. The invention is not limited thereto. 1 Container2
