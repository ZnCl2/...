    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      A secret £7 million weather project in Abu Dhabi has resulted in
      dozens of man-made rainstorms, according to reports.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists employed by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan,
      president of the UAE and leader of Abu Dhabi, successfully created
      more than 50 rainstorms in the state's Al Ain region last year,
      mostly in July and August when there is virtually no rain at all.
      It is believed to be the first time the system has produced rain
      from clear skies.<br>
      <br>
      They have been using giant ionisers, shaped like giant lampshades,
      to generate fields of negatively charged particles, which create
      cloud formation.<br>
      <br>
      In a company video, seen by The Sunday Times, Helmut Fluhrer, the
      founder of Metro Systems International, the Swiss company in
      charge of the project, said: "We are currently operating our
      innovative rainfall enhancement technology, Weathertec, in the
      region of Al Ain in Abu Dhabid. We started in June 2010 and have
      achieved a number of rainfalls." <br>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> ... Since 1992, the Russian company
      Elate Intelligence Technologies, Inc. has demonstrated its ability
      to radio-control rainfall on demand over an area of 200 square
      miles. The corporate slogan is "Weather made to order". An Elate
      weather-control system is in operation at Moscow's Bykovo Airport.
      The <i>New York Times</i> (Sept. 24, 1992) reported that some
      Russian farmers were using the technology to improve their crops.
      Elate executive Igor Pirogoff was quoted in the <i>Wall Street
        Journal</i> (Oct. 2, 1992) as saying that his company could have
      transformed Hurricane Andrew "into a wimpy little squall". </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">On November 13, 1997, the <i>Wall
        Street Journal</i> also reported "Malaysia to Battle Smog with
      Cyclones" using "new Russian technology to create cyclones... to
      cause torrential rains washing the smoke out of the air". The
      Malaysian government approved the plan in conjunction with the
      Malaysian company BioCure Snd. Bhd. and "a government-owned
      Russian party". </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The method of atmospheric ionization
      to modify weather was first patented by William Haight in 1925
      (British Patent # 251,689). He actually constructed two electrical
      rain-making towers in California. Haight claimed that the earth
      contains a positive charge of static electricity and the
      atmosphere has a negatively-charged region. Between the two is an
      insulating region of dry air that prevents the positive and the
      negative charges from combining to produce a lower temperature
      that would cause clouds to condense and rain to fall. By
      discharging high frequency alternating current into the insulating
      layer, electrical contact is established between the positive and
      negative layers. The temperature drops in the clouds, causing them
      to condnese and rain. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The technique can be adapted to
      produce clouds where none exist, or to disperse fog by forming
      clouds. The insulated apparatus was not grounded, so as to
      discharge only into the atmosphere. He used a 5 kilowatt generator
      to produce a 150-200 KHz signal (1200-2000 meters) that could
      control the weather within a radius of 5 miles. (Figures 10 &amp;

      Moscow and produced rain with a large ionizer. The device was
      described by Mikhail Shakhramanian, the director of the ministry's
      research institute, as "a metal cage crisscrossed by tungsten wire
      [that] emits a vertical flow of oxygen ions that stirs the air and
      raises humidity".<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention is generally directed to an apparatus
      for creating an upward flux of moistened air for use in the field
      of weather modification.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE ART</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] At present, weather modification methods, known as seeding
      methods, are generally based on introducing small particles of a
      specific medium into clouds. The particles of seeding media are
      typically delivered to clouds by airborne carriers such as
      aircrafts or rockets, or with the aid of natural updrafts such as
      orographic lifting. Seeding methods are also deployed for the
      dissipation of fog, which is actually a cloud with no bottom
      boundary when located on the surface of the Earth. Clouds consist
      of water droplets, ice particles, or a mixture of both, suspended
      in the air, which are formed when the air temperature falls below
      dew point, causing relative humidity (RH) of the air to exceed
      100%, i.e. vapor supersaturation.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] There are two primary ways to seed clouds. The first method
      is based on enhancing the coalescence (a process of merging
      droplets into bigger ones) of the rain formation process. Seeding
      particles introduced into a cloud grow in size by coalescing with
      droplets in their path, eventually becoming large and heavy enough
      to fall as precipitation. The second method of seeding clouds
      employs the ice-crystal (Bergeron) process. Small particles of
      silver iodide are introduced into a cloud that generally contains
      both ice crystals and supercooled water droplets. Silver iodide
      particles are ice nuclei since they act like ice crystals by
      depositing vapor onto themselves. As the equilibrium vapor
      pressure over ice is lower than that over water, ice nuclei may
      further grow at the expense of surrounding liquid droplets,
      absorbing more vapor compared to the case of condensation. The
      growing crystals eventually become heavy enough to fall as
      precipitation.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Alternative methods for cloud and fog modification are
      based on enhancing coalescence by introducing electric forces via
      droplet charging or deploying other charged aerosols.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Numerical modeling and experimental observations suggest
      that, to be effective in enhancing coalescence, charged aerosol
      particles (typically droplets) should each carry hundreds of
      elementary charges. Such droplets are referred to hereinafter as
      supercharged droplets. Approaches to the problem have focused on
      creating devices to supercharge droplets which are then to be used
      as seeding media for cloud modification. In practice, however,
      producing supercharged droplets at the rate required to seed a
      reasonable volume of cloudy or foggy air would meet with severe
      engineering difficulties. Seeding charged particles into clouds,
      as with any traditional seeding technique, usually requires
      deploying airborne carriers which leads to high associated costs.
      Furthermore, seeding large volumes of cloudy air may need to be
      repeated due to the limited lifetime of the supercharged state of
      particles. Some other problems associated with dispensing highly
      charged particles into the atmosphere have been discussed in
      detail by Vonnegut at al. (1967).<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Accordingly, there is still a need in the art for improved
      methods and devices for weather modification.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0007] The inventive apparatus for weather modification may be
      used to create upward moisture flux, which may cause modification
      of the vertical humidity profile by increasing relative humidity
      at higher altitudes at the expense of drying the air near the
      surface of the Earth. The process may occur even in a stable
      atmosphere when the convective updrafts normally responsible for
      the vertical transport of humid air do not form. An upward
      moisture flux achieved by deploying the inventive apparatus may
      lead to the formation of new clouds and/or to supersaturation in
      existing clouds, thus enhancing the development of precipitation
      and/or facilitating the inflow of the evaporated moisture from a
      water reservoir inland.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The instant apparatus comprises a Van der Graaf generator
      (VDGG) having a capacitor and grounded charging engine and one or
      more air ionizers, such as a source of alpha particles, located in
      the vicinity of the capacitor. Preferably, the elevation distance
      of the capacitor is equal to about the ion propagation distance.
      The one or more air ionizers are disposed along the bottom half of
      the capacitor.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] To improve efficiency of the inventive apparatus, a
      ventilation hole may be positioned substantially near the top of
      the capacitor and at least one fresh air conduit may be provided
      to facilitate fresh air supply from inside the capacitor.
      Preferably, at least one fresh air conduit is provided near each
      of the one or more air ionizers. The fresh air conduits may be
      positioned on each air ionizers or between about an alpha particle
      range to two times the alpha particle range from the air ionizers.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The apparatus may be powered by a source of renewable
      energy.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0017] Under certain conditions atmospheric vapor may be out of
      aerostatic equilibrium, which results in an upward force being
      exerted on a volume of air (Makarieva et al., 2007). Conditions
      for this process include (1) evaporation that is sufficiently
      intensive, in particular to saturate vapor through the atmospheric
      column up to a sufficiently high altitude; and (2) the atmospheric
      temperature lapse rate [alpha]=[partial differential]T/[partial
      differential]z (reduction of temperature T with altitude z) being
      greater than a critical value [alpha]o=TsMwg/Qw, where Ts is the
      absolute dew point temperature at the surface of the Earth,
      Mw=1.8*10&lt;-2 &gt;kg mol&lt;-1 &gt;is the molar mass of water,
      g=9.8 ms&lt;-1 &gt;is the acceleration of gravity, and Qw=44 kJ
      mol&lt;-1 &gt;is the molar latent heat of evaporation for water.
      At sea level, standard temperature Ts=288[deg.] K. (+15[deg.] C.),
      the value for [alpha]o is 1.15 K km&lt;-1 &gt;and [alpha]o does
      not typically exceed 1.3 K km&lt;-1&gt;. The condition
      [alpha]&gt;[alpha]o is satisfied in most cases of ambient values
      of [alpha] and T, even for absolutely stable layers
      ([alpha]o&lt;[alpha]&lt;6 K km&lt;-1&gt;) when convection
      typically does not occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] At any altitude, actual vapor pressure eventually cannot
      exceed the pressure of saturated vapor as any moisture excess in
      the air is removed by vapor-to-liquid and possibly vapor-to-ice
      phase transition processes. This limitation on vapor pressure,
      governed by the vertical temperature profile where
      [alpha]&gt;[alpha]o, assures that at any altitude the partial
      pressure of vapor is greater than the pressure of vapor mass in
      the atmospheric column above this altitude, bringing the vapor out
      of aerostatic equilibrium. In terms of differential equations this
      means that the vertical gradient of the partial pressure of vapor
      is greater than the weight of a unit volume of vapor at any
      altitude. This difference appears as a force acting on a volume of
      moist air, causing an updraft.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The abovementioned removal of excess moisture in a volume
      of air by phase transitions occurs when the partial pressure of
      vapor at an altitude initially exceeds the vapor saturation
      pressure at a temperature determined by a given temperature
      profile. The air becomes supersaturated with vapor and thus
      subject to a phase transition. Condensation of vapor into liquid
      water starts on atmospheric aerosol particles acting as
      condensation nuclei, which grow into liquid droplets at the
      expense of vapor until the air is no longer supersaturated. Areas
      of droplet-laden air appear as clouds. Droplets may further be
      merged, via the collection of smaller droplets by a larger droplet
      (collector) that is moving, usually due to the force of gravity.
      This process, known as coalescence, causes droplets to grow until
      they are large enough to fall as rain.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] At temperatures below the freezing point for water (0[deg.]
      C.), droplets are super-cooled, i.e. they may remain in a liquid
      state down to extremely low temperatures (as low as -39[deg.] C.).
      Some super-cooled droplets may freeze and further grow by freezing
      the vapor onto ice, via a process known as deposition. Deposition
      of vapor is a phase transition process, in this sense analogous to
      condensation. Ice particles may also merge with super-cooled
      droplets and drops, causing the latter to freeze. This process of
      collecting ice and liquid water particles into larger ice
      particles, called riming, in this sense is analogous to
      coalescence, but is also a phase transition (liquid water to ice)
      process. These processes of supersaturated moisture removal and
      release of latent heat at temperatures below the freezing point of
      water will be additional to the condensational moisture removal
      and latent heat release. Furthermore, such ice-related processes
      may be dominant over condensation in forming the updraft under
      consideration as vapor deposition pressure in the presence of ice
      particles is lower than the vapour condensation pressure in the
      presence of liquid droplets, and particle collection via riming,
      in contrast to coalescence of droplets, is accompanied by the
      release of additional latent heat. The produced ice-based
      particles may fall as solid precipitation or as rain if they melt
      before reaching the surface of the Earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Latent heat released in the removal of excess moisture by
      phase transitions increases the buoyancy of air and thus augments
      the initial updraft caused by the discussed aerostatic
      non-equilibrium of vapor. Maintaining this process requires a
      continuous and sufficient supply of vapor from the surface of the
      Earth. In contrast, if the atmosphere is stable and, at the same
      time, the intensity of evaporation on the surface is insufficient
      to maintain the above process, which is often the case, an updraft
      is not produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Accordingly, an apparatus is disclosed for providing a
      continuous upward vapor flux to produce or augment an updraft of
      vapor. To achieve this, the instant apparatus causes extraction of
      the vapor from the air at lower altitudes to moisten the air at
      higher altitudes.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Without being bound by theory, it is believed that a
      mechanism of selectively transporting the water vapor component of
      atmospheric air, which is responsible for such modification of the
      vertical humidity profile, is as follows. Air molecules acquire a
      momentum transferred from a moving ion by scattering. In the
      absence of an electric field, this process is random (Brownian)
      and the average macroscopic momentum transfer is zero. However, if
      the motion of ions is organized to be in the same direction, e.g.
      by having unipolar, i.e., predominantly of the same sign, ions
      driven by a sufficiently strong electric field, this
      ion-to-molecule momentum transfer appears on a macroscopic scale
      as a force exerted on the air by the applied atmospheric electric
      current, causing the air to flow. This phenomenon is known as "ion
      wind" generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Applicants have unexpectedly discovered that, under certain
      conditions, the generated "ion wind" accelerates water vapor to a
      degree significantly higher compared to other air components. In
      contrast to molecules of other air components, a molecule of water
      (H2O) possesses its own electrical dipole moment. Therefore, when
      colliding with a charged particle, it experiences a
      charge-to-dipole interaction additionally to the short-range
      Van-der-Vaalse interaction which is common to all air molecules in
      collision processes. In this regard, water molecules behave
      differently during collision (scattering) events on atmospheric
      ions, and this difference is described in terms of the collision
      cross section.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Trajectories of water and non-water molecules are shown in
      FIG. 1, illustrating the effect of the increased collision
      cross-section for a water molecule, moving parallel to axis X at a
      distance r from it (scattering distance) towards an air ion of
      radius R. Non-water molecules moving parallel to the axis X at a
      distance r from it can be scattered only if r&lt;R, so R is their
      maximum scattering distance. In contrast, due to the additional
      attractive charge-to-dipole electric force, water molecules with
      the maximum scattering distance [rho] can also be scattered at
      R&lt;r&lt;[rho]. The effective cross-section for water molecules
      determined by [rho] is larger than that for other molecules
      determined by R as [rho]&gt;R.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The collision cross-sections ratio of water to non-water
      molecules, called enhancement factor EF, for a range of air ion
      sizes has been estimated by Nadykto et al., (2003). For ions with
      diameters 0.6 nm and 1.2 nm, the values for EF were found to be 7
      and 2.2 respectively. For the average diameter of air ions of
      about 0.9 nm, EF 4. For water molecular clusters with dipole
      moments larger than those of the water molecule H2O, such as water
      dimer (H2O)2 and others ((H2O)n, n&gt;2) which appear in higher
      concentrations when vapor is closer to saturation, the values for
      EF are found to be even higher.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The larger the ion-to-molecule collision cross-section, the
      larger the number of air molecules that collide with a moving ion
      and the larger the total momentum transferred to the molecules
      from the ion per unit of time. The total momentum transferred to
      molecules of a volume of air per unit of time is the macroscopic
      force exerted on this volume of air. As the collision
      cross-section for water molecules is greater (EF&gt;2), and
      therefore the ion-to-molecule momentum transfer is also greater,
      the electric force exerted on water vapor will be significantly
      greater compared to other air components. As a result, the vapor
      moves ahead of other components in the air flow produced along the
      electric field lines. This microphysical process of separation of
      water vapor from other air components by an atmospheric electric
      current of unipolar ions (unipolar atmospheric electric current or
      UAEC) is referred to hereinafter as selective moisture transport
      (SMT). The latter leads to the re-distribution of the available
      atmospheric vapor and the formation of buoyant parcels of
      moistened air.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In general, SMT causes an increase in relative humidity in
      some areas at the expense of it decreasing in others from which
      the moisture was taken, i.e. closer to the origin of UAEC.
      Although at first it may be not obvious, an increase in humidity
      reduces the density of the air and vice versa. This is because the
      number of molecules of all components in a volume of air is
      constant at a given temperature and pressure. Adding or removing
      water vapor with a molar mass of 1.8*10&lt;-2 &gt;Kg
      mol&lt;-1&gt;, which is lower than the molar mass of air of about
      2.9*10&lt;-2 &gt;Kg mol&lt;-1&gt;, will respectively reduce or
      increase the mass per unit volume of the air, i.e. its density.
      According to Archimedes' principle, dehydrated air parcels descend
      while moisturized ones ascend. In this way, the moisture
      separation achieved with the aid of a locally generated UAEC
      appears as upward moisture transport on a larger scale, ultimately
      due to the forces of gravity and reasonably long lifetimes of air
      parcels with artificially modified humidity. The ascending
      moistened air will reach saturation at and above a certain
      altitude, and the initial updraft may further be augmented by
      latent heat release and aerostatic non-equilibrium of vapor as
      discussed previously.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Generating an atmospheric electric current requires
      producing atmospheric ions acting as current carriers and a source
      of electric field which drives the ions.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] All air ionization methods are based on moving electrons
      between gas molecules. If a gas molecule loses an electron, it
      becomes a positively charged molecular ion. If a gas molecule
      gains an electron, it becomes a negatively charged molecular ion.
      Within nanoseconds, molecular ions bind up to 10 molecules of
      water and possibly some trace gases, forming small air ions.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Accordingly, the instant apparatus includes one or more air
      ionizers. Preferably, the air ionizer component utilizes high
      energy particles produced in the process of radioactive decay. In
      general, the radioactive decay produces alpha, beta, and gamma
      emissions ionizing the air by moving electrons. Radioactive decay
      produces bipolar ionization, i.e., ions of opposite sighs.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Accordingly, the one or more air ionizers comprise a source
      of high energy particles in form of a radioactive solid substance.
      Suitable substances include, but are not limited to, isotopes of
      americium, polonium, plutonium, uranium, thorium, actinium,
      radium, or combinations thereof, with Americium-241
      (&lt;241&gt;Am), Plutonium-239 (&lt;239&gt;Pu), or Plutonium-238
      (&lt;238&gt;Pu) being the preferred substances. In practice,
      alloys of the said isotopes with a corrosion resistant metal
      compound, for example nickel-chrome based, are preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Alpha radiation is the main source of air ionization by
      radioactive decay. The alpha particle, a helium nucleus consisting
      of two neutrons and two protons, collides with air molecules
      knocking out electrons, until it loses its energy over a definite
      distance in the air. Such a distance, referred to hereinafter as
      the alpha particle range, is defined as the distance traveled by
      the alpha particle before it loses its energy. The alpha particle
      range is determined by the energy of alpha particles which is
      specific for a particular substance of the source. For example,
      alpha particles produced by &lt;241&gt;Am have the energy of about
      5.48 MeV and a range of about 3 cm, limiting the air ionization
      zone by this distance. Plutonium isotope &lt;239&gt;Pu produces
      practically only alpha particles with the energy of about 5.15
      MeV.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Air molecules that lose electrons become positive molecular
      ions. The free electrons do not exist in air for very long before
      they are captured by neutral gas molecules, forming negative
      molecular ions. Molecular ions are further clustered into small
      air ions. Alpha ionizers produce bipolar ionization, which means
      that positive and negative ions are always created in equal
      numbers.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Producing ions alone, however, is not sufficient for the
      SMT to occur, even if they are produced in large amounts. In order
      to produce UAEC, an electric field may need to be generated to
      dissociate ions of opposite signs and to form an atmospheric
      electric current of the ions with preferred sign. Accordingly, the
      instant apparatus also comprises a static electric field
      generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Generating a static electric field can be achieved by
      accumulating electric charges of the same sign in some area of
      space, typically in an electrically conductive object confining
      the charges, acting as a charge capacitor or electrically coupled
      to a charge capacitor and acting as a charged electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The generated electric field causes ions with the opposite
      charge as the capacitor to drift towards and recombine on the
      capacitor or electrode. For ions with the same charge, this field
      drives them away from the capacitor thus forming a UAEC at
      distances from the capacitor greater than the thickness of the air
      ionization zone limited by the alpha particle range. Such a
      continuous charge separation and removal of ions signed oppositely
      to ions of the produced UAEC, which prevents the direct
      recombination of ion pairs, is maintained by charging the
      capacitor.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In principle, the sign of the accumulated charge may be
      either positive or negative, but generating a current of negative
      ions is preferred because the latter achieve higher velocities in
      an electric field.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] To produce a UAEC in the above method, the air ionizers are
      preferably located in the vicinity of or, preferably, on the
      surface of the charged capacitor or charged electrode. The air
      ionization zone is the zone within the alpha particle range from
      the air ionizer. The term "vicinity" means the distance from the
      capacitor so the electric field generated by the capacitor in the
      air ionization zone is sufficiently strong to dissociate the
      opposite sign ions.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Compared to the short range of alpha particles, ranges of
      generally less energetic beta and gamma emissions are much longer,
      which makes it technically difficult to achieve the separation of
      the bipolar ionization produced by beta and gamma emissions with a
      static electric field. Furthermore, producing intensive long-range
      beta and gamma radiations is not desirable as it may require
      radiation safety procedures at distances over the alpha particle
      range. Therefore, radioactive materials providing the highest
      alpha and lowest beta and gamma radiation outputs are preferable.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] To determine the strength of electric field sufficient to
      dissociate the bipolar ionization, the atmospheric electric
      current may be measured at different values of electric field
      strength. For example, a plot for the atmospheric current produced
      by a 0.9 [mu]Ci &lt;241&gt;Am source from a typical smoke alarm in
      the applied electric field produced between the plates of a
      capacitor is given in FIG. 4. The distance d between the plates is
      3 cm (the maximum ionization distance is within the produced
      electric field) and the measurements are taken at different values
      of the voltage on the capacitor. The complete dissociation of
      bipolar ionization corresponds to the saturation of atmospheric
      current which occurs, as shown on the plot, at capacitor voltage
      U=300 V. The corresponding electric field strength is
      E=U/d=300/0.03=10 kV/m. This is the minimum value for the required
      strength of the electric field to be achieved for this particular
      source. In general, sources with a higher radiation output require
      a stronger electric field.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] FIG. 2 illustrates an embodiment of the instant apparatus
      for weather modification 20, suitable for practicing the
      invention. In this embodiment, the electric field generator
      comprises a Van der Graaf generator (VDGG) 21 having a preferably
      spherical capacitor 22 and a charging engine 23 placed on a base
      26. The capacitor 22 is elevated above the surface of the Earth by
      a non-conductive support structure 24. The charging engine 23 is
      coupled to the capacitor 22 with an electrical conductor 25. The
      base 26 of the charging engine 24 is grounded.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] One or more air ionizers with sources of alpha ionization
      27, preferably in the form of flat sheets of radioactive
      substance, may be disposed on or near the surface of the bottom
      hemisphere of a capacitor 22. The capacitor 22 is preferably made
      from a corrosion resistant metal. It is preferable that air
      ionizers are made from an alloyed metal comprising the same metal
      that the capacitor is made from and an alpha radioactive element.
      In this configuration, negative ions will flow away from the
      capacitor tending aside of it and towards the surface of the Earth
      which acts as a collector electrode for these ions, if the
      capacitor is negatively charged.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Since the energy loss of the alpha particle per ion pair
      formed is nearly constant, the specific ionization, i.e. number of
      ion pairs produced per unit length of the particle path, is
      proportional to the rate of the loss of alpha particle energy E
      with the distance of penetration x, -dE/dx, and so a plot for
      ionization as a function of the distance of penetration is of the
      Bragg curve shape as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] As shown in FIG. 3, most bipolar ionization is produced at
      some distance from an ionization source, referred to hereinafter
      as the maximum ionization distance. Referring to FIG. 3, the
      maximum ionization distance extends from point 30 up to the
      source-specific alpha particle range, indicated as 31.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Depending on the capacitor's size and charging engine
      design, a voltage up to several megavolts can be achieved on a
      VDGG capacitor. The strength of electric field is sufficient to
      dissociate the opposite sign ions. The voltage U on spherical
      capacitor of radius R is related to the accumulated charge q as
      U=q/4[pi][epsilon]R, where [epsilon]=8.85*10&lt;-12 &gt;F/m is the
      dielectric permittivity of the air. At the same time, the electric
      field strength E at the distance r&gt;R from the capacitor's
      center is related to q as E=q/4[pi][epsilon]r&lt;2&gt;, therefore
      E=UR/r&lt;2&gt;. For example, if the capacitor with a radius of
      0.8 m is operating at a voltage of 2 MV, the electric field
      strength at a distance of 3 cm from its surface (about maximum
      ionization distance) is 2.32 MV/m. The electric field of this
      strength is sufficient to dissociate bipolar ionization from
      radioactive sources with an output much higher that of the source
      discussed previously as an example.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] As mentioned above, the most intensive ion generation by a
      radioactive source attached to the capacitor occurs in a zone at
      the maximum ionization distance from the source surface referred
      to hereinafter as the maximum ionization zone. As a result, two
      UAECs of opposite polarity ions and associated air flows originate
      from the maximum ionization zone due to ion dissociation in the
      electric field. For a negatively charged capacitor, negative ions
      flow away from the capacitor and positive ions flow toward the
      capacitor, leading to the formation of a low air pressure layer at
      distances from the source of about the maximum ionization
      distance. Bursts of fresh air parcels into the low pressure layer
      may occur, in particular, between streams flowing out from the
      alpha ionization sources, which are responsible for the SMT,
      causing a partial mixing of the moistened and fresh air parcels.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] To minimize the latter effect, the following optional
      modifications to the design may be utilized. Referring back to
      FIG. 2, conduits 28 to facilitate the fresh air supply from inside
      the capacitor made of a non-conductive material may be provided
      near one or more air ionizers 21. Each conduit 28 has an outlet
      29, which is preferably positioned in the lower pressure zone
      (i.e., maximum ionization zone), more preferably between the
      middle and the outer limit of this zone. The capacitor 22 may also
      be provided with a ventilation hole 30 on its top. For example,
      conduits may have a threaded base which is screwed into threaded
      holes in the capacitor. The rim of the ventilation hole is
      preferably smooth and preferably shielded with an insulating
      material to avoid unfavorable corona discharge. By way of a
      non-limiting example, a rubber or flexible plastic ring with a
      notch for the rim of the ventilation hole can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] A recommended option to mount alpha radiation sources and
      conduits is presented in FIG. 5. The shape of the air ionizers 51
      corresponds to a section of the top part of the sphere with a
      radius r&lt;&lt;R, where R is the radius of the spherical
      capacitor 52. Air conduit 53 made of a non-conductive material is
      screwed into a threaded hole in the capacitor, passing through a
      hole in the center of the air ionizer. To avoid corona discharge
      on the edges of the air ionizer, all edges of the air ionizer are
      made smooth and covered by non-conductive material. The edge of
      the air ionizer's hole is covered by the conduit's flanges 54a and
      54b and the side edge of the air ionizer is also covered by covers
      55a and 55b in a similar way to the edge of the capacitor's
      ventilation hole. Avoiding or minimizing corona discharge is
      desirable because the production of hazardous gases such as ozone
      and nitrogen oxides and high corrosive stress are likely to occur
      on sharp points, especially in a highly ionized environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Such configuration may also generate a higher electric
      field, compared to that of the capacitor, achievable in the
      ionization zone as the conductive surfaces of the apparatus are
      equipotential and r&lt;&lt;R. In this case where the ionization
      source acts as a charged electrode electrically coupled to the
      capacitor, free electrons produced by ionization and accelerated
      in the electric field may achieve a velocity sufficient to ionize
      air molecules in their path, the ionization energy of which is
      about 35 eV. This secondary ionization, also known as
      amplification, can additionally produce many free electrons and
      further negative ions for each primary electron that was formed by
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] FIG. 6 illustrates another optional modification to the
      apparatus aimed at the further reduction of the mixing of the
      ascending moistened and the incoming fresh air flows. In this
      configuration, one or more conduits 61 are connected to the
      ventilation hole 62 of the capacitor 63 with air ionizers 64 and
      air conduits 65 as described above. The conduits 61 extend beyond
      the zone of the ascending moistened air represented by arrows 66a
      and 66b.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The height of the capacitor, referred to hereinafter as the
      elevation distance, is preferably as high as possible to treat a
      large volume of air and, for increased safety, to minimize beta
      and gamma ray intensities on the ground. At the same time, the
      elevation distance preferably does not exceed the distance that
      small air ions propagate in the applied electric field during
      their lifetime, i.e. most of them should terminate on the surface
      of the Earth (the collector).<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The ion propagation distance is determined mostly by the
      attachment of ions to atmospheric aerosol particles, also known as
      large or heavy ions, which are not moved by the electric field and
      do not contribute to the SMT. If the elevation is too high, too
      many immobile large ions may accumulate above the surface as a
      layer of space charge, which reduces the intensity of the electric
      field along ion trajectories. The ion propagation distance can be
      evaluated by measuring the vertical profile of the electric field
      for a particular system and numerically integrating the ion motion
      equation over time up to the ion lifetime which can be determined
      experimentally using well-known methods. Elevating the ion source
      to a distance between one half and two thirds of the ion
      propagation distance determined in the abovementioned way is a
      guide. In some embodiments, depending on the system design and the
      concentration of pollutants in the air, the elevation distance may
      vary between several and 10-15 meters, which is also acceptable in
      terms of radiation safety for a number of typical alpha sources
      including &lt;241 &gt;Am.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The operation of a typical VDGG is sensitive to leakage
      currents. Any liquid moisture on the operating equipment can
      negatively affect the system's performance. As a VDGG produces a
      nearly constant electric current at a variable voltage on the
      emitter electrode, leakage currents may cause the voltage to drop
      below a threshold for effective ion separation. As a result of
      SMT, drizzle may be produced around the operating apparatus even
      under clear sky conditions. Condensational moisturizing may also
      occur on the equipment. To prevent the accumulation of continuous
      water film on moisture-sensitive parts of the system, including
      the charging engine of the VDGG and the support for the capacitor
      and ventilation hole conduits such as rigid structures or a
      tethering rope which anchors a supporting lighter-than-air craft
      to the surface of the Earth, these parts may be coated with a
      water repulsive wax-like substance. Also, techniques to prevent
      condensational moisturizing, such as, for example, sufficient
      heating of moisture-sensitive parts is also recommended.
      Preferably, the charging engine of the VDGG is hermetically
      sealed.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] A source of renewable energy for the generator of
      atmospheric electric current, such as rechargeable batteries
      powered by solar panels and/or windmills, is recommended,
      especially in the absence of a power supply infrastructure.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In another aspect, a method of weather modification is
      provided, which is based on the modification of vertical humidity
      profile by increasing the relative humidity at higher altitudes at
      the expense of drying the air near the surface of the Earth. This
      method may work even in a stable atmosphere when the convective
      updrafts normally responsible for the vertical transport of humid
      air do not form. The method comprises deploying and operating the
      apparatuses described above. Operating the instant apparatuses
      augments or creates a moisture updraft, which may lead to the
      formation of new clouds and/or an increase in supersaturation in
      existing clouds, thus enhancing the development of precipitation.
      Operating the apparatus is most efficient in areas of high
      humidity when the atmosphere is stable and convective updrafts of
      moist air are weak or absent. Creating strong updrafts of moist
      air near a shoreline, preferably in the presence of low-level
      winds from the ocean, would facilitate the inflow of the
      evaporated moisture from a water reservoir into inland, benefiting
      the terrestrial hydrologic cycle. For example, such conditions can
      be found in many locations along the shorelines of Middle Eastern
      countries.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Although the invention herein has been described with

      <div align="center"><b>1985 Peter Toyer displaying rainmaker</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      At an inventors meeting&nbsp; in Casino NSW in 1985, I met Jack
      Toyer with his Toyer Rainmaking Machine. Previously I&nbsp; had
      worked for the Bureau of Meteorology in Northern Territory as a
      weather observer.&nbsp;&nbsp; My background is in Agricultural
      Science and Engineering specializing in taking moisture out of
      agricultural products. I asked Jack a series of questions all with
      the view of discovering how the Toyer Rainmaker Machine worked and
      the types of energy needed to bring&nbsp; rain out of the
      atmosphere. I knew the value of such a machine to the agricultural
      sector in Australia would be worth billions.<br>
      <br>
      At that meeting Jack stated that whilst he was a sea captain in
      the 1960s static from the build up of coastal storms often
      interfered with his afternoon short wave radio
      transmissions.&nbsp; He believed if he could copy these conditions
      of static and heat he could also make it rain.&nbsp; Jack&nbsp;
      decided to build a machine that would cause this same static and
      heat.&nbsp; He experimented with a series of magnetic coils in his
      shed however his Palmers Island neighbours complained of the
      noisy squawking and interference to their TV reception.&nbsp; This
      lead Jack on a thirty year endeavor to make an effective
      rainmaking machine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Peters Involvement</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      When I met Jack I suggested a few modifications. I reverse
      engineered what I was doing (taking moisture out of products) to
      create a very effective rainmaker. Jack was successful and with my
      modifications we now had a atmospheric ionization rainmaker. I
      also quietened Jacks noisy squawking magnetic coils. We now had a
      machine which would prove to be 100% effective in causing
      rain.&nbsp; Jack and I became great friends until his death in
      1993. As I was the only one to believe in old Jack the family
      passed the rainmaker to me on his death.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Rainmaker Exposure</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The rainmaker went on display at World Expo88 in Brisbane. It has
      featured on TV and radio news since the 1980s and has been the
      subject of many articles,The Jack Toyer Rainmaking machine (as it
      was then called) was shown working Between Dubbo and Orange, NSW
      on the This Day Tonight with George Negus&nbsp; and Mike
      Willesse&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Although somewhat skeptical&nbsp; Jack had the last laugh with
      rain falling all around Dubbo and Orange over a thousand Square
      Kilometers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Rainmaker Effectiveness</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1987 Jack was in Longreach running the machine for three days.
      He drove back through flood water! He also ran the machine in the
      Crows Nest area making rain within several hours. In1992 the Gold
      Coast&nbsp; had been in severe drought. Jack offered to make it
      rain which it did after twenty four hours of setting up his
      machine. Jack proved many times how effective the rainmaker now
      was.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Rainmaker 2014</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The defining moment was in 1994 when the Moree Cotton Growers
      Association told me they didnt want rain even though the country
      was in drought. Because of lack of credibility I had had enough
      and returned the rainmaker to the Toyer family<br>
      <br>
      What followed was 12 years of drought. Then In 2006 I rebuilt the
      rainmaker at the request of a former Commonwealth Magistrate Wayne
      E Cross from the Gold Coast His words were you are the remainder
      man and funded the rebuilding of the rainmaker. Wayne visited me
      in Casino, NSW was amazed at how green Casino district was. Now a
      believer Wayne saying my street was the greenest in
      Australia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;





      <br>
      <br>
      I then researched and fine tuned the Rainmaker forming the
      Atmospheric Ionization Research incorporated association  It has
      proved to be 100 percent in making it rain over large areas.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How To Make Rain</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Exactly how do I bring Rain? With the help of the rainmaker I open
      my mind and focus my intent<br>
      <br>
      <b>How the rainmaker works</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      rainmakerThe rainmaker has a 72inch diameter (1.8 metre)&nbsp;
      variable focus&nbsp; octagonal mirror. I adjust this mirror to
      reflect the suns rays into any region needing rain. This can be
      anywhere in the world.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Magnetic Coils</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are magnetic coils under the mirrors. These coils are tuned
      to cause a spinning vortex of magnetic flux combining with ionized
      and heated air.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Negative Ionizers</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The ionizers are placed around the mirror charge the air. This
      ionized air vortexes up into the atmosphere and attracts moisture
      to form rain. Even with blue skies there is plenty of relative
      humidity, moisture in the atmosphere.<br>
      <b><br>
        Infrared Lights</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are 4 infrared spectrum lights placed around the mirrors.
      They allow the air to remain hot above the mirrors increasing the
      intensity of the ionized air vortex. These lights replace the
      suns heat at night allowing the machine to be operational 24
      hours a day.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pulsing Vibrations</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      While the rainmaker is operational&nbsp; we allow the magnetic
      coils to relax their hold on the atmosphere every 6 hours This
      prevents severe weather events<br>
      <br>
      <b>Tilting the Rainmaker</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The machine is built to allow the mirrors to be tilted to focus
      more intently on the region&nbsp; Im focusing on. The whole
      machine can rotate to track the sun.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Unwinding Cyclones and Hurricanes</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      By beaming in a contrary rotating magnetic field beside the
      weather event I can cause cyclones and hurricanes to unwind or
      change direction<br>
      <br>
      <b>How Long Until Rain Falls</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Clouds usually form within hours and rainfall expected normally
      within 24 to 36 hours over the&nbsp; focused site<br>
      <br>
      <b>How to Make Rain with the Rainmaker</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Atmospheric Ionization creates a vortex that draws in surrounding
      atmospheric water vapour which, depending on the charge, leads to
      cloud or fog formation and ultimately rain precipitation in
      targeted areas. Zonal Ionization can also deflect cyclonic storms
      from protected areas.<br>
      <br>
      While rainfall can usually be generated over hot dry areas like
      Death Valley and Phoenix, Arizona, the results cannot always be
      predicted as this depends upon the amount of relative humidity as
      water vapour held in the atmosphere.<br>
