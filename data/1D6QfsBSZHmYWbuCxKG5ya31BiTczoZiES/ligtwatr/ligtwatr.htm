          <p><b><font size="+1">Light Water Production Launched</font></b></p>
        </center>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Russian Institute for Biological
          Medicine launched production of light water, differing from
          ordinary water by stimulating all human systems' activities
          through data-flow level. Institute's vice-president claims
          such developments are unique and cannot be found anywhere else
          in the world. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Natural light water is found in
          mountain rivers and melting glaciers. Scientists designed
          rectifying columns for water fractional distillation and
          derived water free from its heavy components. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Light water normalizes any
          pathology found in an organism. It also improves body
          resistance to harmful effects of physical, chemical and
          biological origin. Clinical trials revealed light water's
          ability to dissolve higher concentrations of various
          substances and to penetrate membranes easier than ordinary
          water. Light water showed anti-inflammatory effect and
          eliminated tissue puffiness. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Recently developed "Langway" water
          is already available at the US market. Tests proved its
          potential to refine cell metabolic processes through
          accumulating energy inside a cell. Light water is highly
          recommended for skin regeneration stimulation. "Langway" tones
          the skin, reduces its greasiness, narrows skin pores, slows
          ageing and helps skin to resist negative environmental impact.
          Light water also regulates excretion of toxins, salts of heavy
          metals, cellular debris and infectious germs. Another positive
          aspect is that such water lowers blood sugar and cholesterol,
          thus it can be recommended for patients, suffering from
          diabetes, atherosclerosis, obesity and hypertension. </p>

                rejuvenating effect</font></b></center>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Russian scientists developed and
          began to produce “live water” – light water that removes
          harmful substances from body and produces rejuvenating effect.
          “ “Langway-IBMED-50” purifies and removes toxic products from
          body, salts of heavy metals and other harmful substances”, -
          informed “Interfax” Chief Medical Doctor - Director of the
          Institute of Biological Medicine (IBMED), Academician Y.
          Bloshansky. According to him, natural water is one of the
          factors of our body’s imperceptible poisoning. “It contains
          heavy isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium) and oxygen in
          quantities that considerably slow energy processes in cells,
          harm body’s vitality and damage genic apparatus.” It is caused
          by its dissociation with terrestrial organisms due to space
          origin. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">“Light water that has been purified
          of heavy isotopes acts on all body cells and results in a
          healthy glow and skin”, said Y. Bloshansky. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The academician is sure that usage
          of light water with low contents of deuterium can prolong life
          of every organism both unicellular and multicellular one. </p>

          active healing water at a low content of heavy hydrogen
          isotopes involves operations of preliminary purification of
          original water from hazardous and poisonous substances, water
          cooling and subsequent removing heavy hydrogen isotopes -
          deuterium and radioactive tritium from water in the water flow
          by an optionally solid condensation of these heavy isotopes in
          two stages. Upon obtaining the required icethickness the
          crystallization process is stopped and simultaneously heavy
          oxygen isotopes Ä17 and Ä18 is removed. Thereafter the light
          water with a low content of heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotopes
          is collected, thawing and pouring of condensate is performed,
          obtained water is activated by an optimization of mineral
          composition and structure thereof. Before removal of heavy
          hydrogen isotopes from water the original water is overcooled
          to the temperature of -0.5...-10c with an intensive agitation
          thereof. A plant for realizing the method contains a unit of
          preliminary cooling the original water, condensation
          apparatus, apparatus of overcooling below 0 0c and intensive
          agitation of the original water. The condensation apparatus is
          made in the form of closed vertical disposed hollow water
          conduit of -like form, which has heat-exchangers installed,
          which are connected to the refrigerating fluid and heat
          carrier sources, and straight flow pump with flow regulator.
          The upper branch of the water conduit is connected to the unit
          of preliminary cooling original water and to the apparatus of
          preliminary purification and decontamination of water, and the
          lower one is connected to the apparatus for optimization of
          mineral composition and structure of water. The heat
          exchangers are made in the form of tubular multi-row spiral
          having space between the coils filled with heat-conducting
          material and noble minerals. The apparatus of overcooling and
          intensive agitation of the original water contains processing
          chamber of cylindrical form with conical bottom and cover. The
          system of water condensation is disposed under cover, and
          above the cover the apparatus for reciprocal rotation of heavy
          water isotopes is disposed which is made in the form of
          tubular multi-row spiral. </p>

          Abstract --- An system for separating tritiated water from
          common water, using gravity and the freezing point of
          tritiated water to cause tritiated water to freeze along the
          inside of a conically-shaped collection chamber. The common
          water and liquid tritiated water that pass out the bottom of
          the conically-shaped collection chamber are pumped back to the
          top of the conically-shaped collection chamber for repeated
          runs until sufficient tritiated water has frozen to the inside
          of the conically-shaped collection chamber. A water wheel is
          positioned to assist in powering the pump that drives water
          through repeated runs. </p>

          Abstract --- An apparatus and method for separating heavy
          isotopes of hydrogen from contaminated water. The apparatus
          includes a treatment chamber with an elongated hollow core
          fiber (HCF) extending within the chamber. A reservoir holds
          contaminated water mixed with beads formed of an exchange
          resin, the mixture of contaminated water and beads forming a
          flowable slurry. The slurry is continuously circulated through
          the hollow core fiber and the reservoir preferably by a
          pulsating peristaltic pump. The beads absorb a portion of the
          heavy isotopes from the slurry by exchange with waters of
          hydration of the beads while the hollow core fiber allows
          permeation of only light water from said slurry outwardly
          through the HCF wall as a permeate. </p>
