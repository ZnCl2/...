      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When air is saturated with
          water vapor, it rains, and one should be inclined to think
          that the air is saturated, when it cannot take up any more
          water. This conception is wrong, for air can contain almost
          any amount of water, providing it is presented to it in the
          right form. Air, having a vapor pressure of 31.8 mm of
          mercury, is said to be saturated at 30 C, but we can add water
          drops of a very small diameter, and they are taken up and
          transformed into invisible water vapor until the pressure
          amounts to several times the initial pressure.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is said that air is
          saturated with water vapor when the air is above a flat
          surface of the same temperature, and when the same number of
          water molecules leave the surface as return to it, but when
          the surface of the water is convex towards the air --- as it
          is in water drops --- the saturation pressure is higher. There
          is no condensation, even at a great supersaturation, unless
          there are some solid or liquid nuclei, on which combination of
          the vapor molecules can take place.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dines mentions on one of his
          papers that the water content of the air above Europe would
          yield a rainfall less than one inch per day. The high rainfall
          of that continent is due to the ascending air currents, for a
          current saturated at 50 F, ascending at a speed of 1 m/sec,
          would produce a rainfall of one inch per hour. Such an air
          current carries with it water drops formed on nuclei, until
          these drops are big enough to fall quicker than the current
          rises. This is, however, only one factor in rain-making.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Others are connected with
          the electric potential of the air, of the earth, of the drops,
          and of the nuclei.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Considering the conditions
          on the surface of the earth, condensation there takes place in
          the form of dew, and the circumstances are very similar to
          those in higher regions. Dew is condensed humidity and is
          deposited chiefly on objects which are good radiators, and at
          the same time bad conductors of heat. The humidity of the air
          is given either (1) as relative humidity, i.e., the proportion
          of the quantity of water vapor which the air contains, to that
          which it would were it saturated; or (2) as absolute humidity,
          i.e., the weight of the water vapor existing in one cm or one
          cu ft, given in grams or grains, respectively. Since the
          relative humidity depends on the temperature as a rule, the
          absolute one is used.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For a longtime the question
          as to whether the dew rises or falls was difficult to answer.
          Aristotle was the first who asked it, and, according to him,
          the dew fell --- a view which was taken for granted until the
          end of the 18th century, when Charles Wells made his careful
          experiments, which he described in his "Essays on Dew" in
          1814. His experiments showed clearly that the dew fell, and
          though later many scientists worked on this question, nothing
          was added until John Aitken (1) showed, in 1880, that the
          formation of dew was not quite so simple as Wells had thought,
          but a complex phenomenon. Aitken proved that the following
          conditions are favorable to the formation of dew: good
          radiating surface, still atmosphere, warm moist ground or some
          other supply of moisture in the surface layers of the earth.
          The first four conditions he considered to be necessary, the
          fifth important to obtain a copious deposit. The formation of
          dew over a moist soil may be of great practical importance,
          for it can protect plants against night frost. As long as a
          distillation between the earth and the plant goes on, the
          water, condensing on the leaves would tend to keep their
          temperature high, but if this heat lost by radiation were
          compensated by condensation from the air, then the cooling
          process would continue.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was Aitken who called
          attention to the water drops on the leaves, which one can see
          glistening in the morning sun. These drops are regarded as the
          most striking example that dew has been deposited. He is of
          the opinion, however, that these drops are not condensed from
          the air but exuded from the pores of the plant. Aitken is
          usually referred to as the man who proved that dew rises or
          falls, or travels in both directions, as the conditions may
          be.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Generally speaking, dew is
          formed when the dew point curve and the dry bulb cut at the
          surface of the earth; if they cut above the surface, mist will
          be formed, and if below, a distillation between the layers of
          the earth takes place, and thus considerable quantities of
          water are transported, a process of which our knowledge is
          still very limited.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is an important
          difficulty regarding apparatus measuring the amount of dew per
          unit area of surface, the drosometer as it is called. The
          recorded measurements are never absolute, but relative,
          representing the phenomenon of condensation from the air. Thus
          the figures for the annual depth of water fallen as dew differ
          considerably. Loesche estimates the amount of dew for a single
          night on the West African coast at 3 mm, equal to one-eighth
          of an inch. On the Desertas, uninhabited islands near Madeira,
          dew falls so heavily that sometimes rivulets run down the
          mountain slopes. Dr Marloth, of Cape Town, showed that, from
          December 1902 to February 1902, Iin56 days, on the Table
          Mountain, moisture condensed equal to nearly 80 inches of
          rain; thus, during the dry season about 150 inches of water
          fall, exclusive of rain. These experiments were doubted, and
          he made further investigations near Maclear's beacon (3500
          ft), and found that, in January 1904, 1.44 inches of rain
          fell, but his dew gauge collected 48.42 inches of water. In
          the same month at Woodhead Reservoir (2500 ft), 1.83 inches of
          rain and 13.73 inches of dew were registered.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The amount of dew collected
          by different materials is largely due to their nature. W.C.
          Wells gives a list of materials according to their capacity
          for collecting dew. By far the highest effect was found with
          swan's down, then flax and cotton, followed by silk, paper,
          straw, wool, earth, charcoal, glass-sand, river-sand, chalk
          powder --- a list which runs roughly parallel to the specific
          heats of the materials names.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, it is improbable
          that the humidity of the air is only condensed on the surface
          of the earth; it certainly is absorbed in great quantities,
          too. Beside the plants, which are able to absorb water from
          the air with their leaves, the soil absorbs it as well.
          Ginestous (2) has shown that in the northern part of the
          Sahara desert the moisture of the regularly blowing
          north-easterly wind gradually decreases with the distance from
          the sea. At Sousse, the humidity is 17 gr/cm, at Metlauli 10
          gr, and at Tamanrasset, which is about 200 miles distant from
          the sea, 2.5 gr in the summer. In this distance of 200 miles
          the air loses 14.5 gr water per cm, or about 30 tons of water
          per square mile, assuming the velocity of the air current to
          be 3 cm/sec. Ginestous is of the opinion that this water is
          absorbed by the soil, this giving the necessary moisture to
          the plants during the rainless season, for it is worth
          mentioning that the humidity of the air is much greater in the
          summer than in the winter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the Nullarbor Plain, at
          the border between South and Western Australia, the
          atmospheric conditions are very similar to those described
          above. There, too, a regular wind carries moisture from the
          sea inland; but, unfortunately, there are very few
          meteorological stations.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As already mentioned, nuclei
          are essential for the condensation of water from the air,
          either in form of dew or of rain, but it is no0t yet clear how
          a nucleus is to be understood and how it works. Aitken
          invented a simple apparatus by means of which the nuclei
          present in the air could be counted, and which showed that
          their number is not increased by blowing coal, coke, or
          ordinary dust into the air.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sometimes a difference is
          made between solid dust particles and hygroscopic substances
          in the air, but one cannot see why, e.g., a calcium chloride
          particle suspended in more or less humid air should be more
          hygroscopic than a carbon particle under the same
          circumstances. One would rather attribute a different effect
          of a nucleus and an ordinary particle to a different electric
          potential. However, this will not be further discussed at
          present.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Is it possible to make rain?
          Everybody has heard of the attempts to produce rain by firing
          shells against the sky, by exploding dynamite, by blowing sand
          or chemicals, with or without electric charges, into the
          clouds, and these methods may be effective under appropriate
          atmospheric conditions; but they certainly are highly
          expensive and economically unsound. A different method was
          employed by Graham Balsillie, who experimented in Australia
          during the Great War. It happens, especially in the inner
          parts of Australia, that clouds cover the sky day and night,
          but no rain falls and the clouds dissolve over some other part
          of the country. Balsillie tried to break these clouds up by
          using electric waves in order to enlarge the particles, so
          that rain might fall. He claimed to have caused exceptionally
          heavy dews, whereas the Weather Bureau proved that there were
          similar large condensations in districts remote from the place
          of the experiments. This says nothing against the attempts,
          and it would be worthwhile to go further into this matter, for
          it seems probable the water particles could be enlarged by
          electric power.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One process of making rain
          may be mentioned, because it is not well known, and is
          supposed to be effective, though it has not been studied
          scientifically. Some of the northern parts of Mexico consist
          of desert-like plains, partly overgrown with cacti. Under
          certain conditions, which appear to be great heat, no wind,
          and a cloudless sky, the Indians set the cacti afire, thus
          creating a tremendous heat. After a very short time a downpour
          of rain sets in, which lasts for a few minutes only. This is
          the description given to the author, and if true the
          explanation may be that the heat of the fire pushes wet layers
          of the air higher up, that they get cooled beneath the dew
          point and drop their water in the form of rain.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus the prospect of
          rain-making is not too encouraging, though there are many
          places in the world where mankind has made use of the humidity
          of the air by condensing it, and a number of processes have
          been developed to draw liquid water from the air.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On the Canary Islands a very
          primitive way of obtaining water is employed, by shaking the
          trees in the morning and collecting the dew condensed on the
          leaves.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In England two different
          processes are to be found. In Cornwall, the rustics smooth the
          surface of the slop of a mountain by means of clay, thus
          preparing an area of about 40 sq ft, which they surround with
          a small wall. This are is covered with a thick layer of straw.
          During the night the straw collects dew as grass does, but the
          former is said to be more effective. As the climate of
          Cornwall is damp and the night temperatures in the mountains
          low, the process works quite well, but the straw has to be
          renewed frequently as it putrefies quickly, being moist day
          and night.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The best known process is
          that of the English dew ponds, mostly in the Midlands and the
          South of England, which are characterized best by saying that
          they do not fail to give water when other ponds at low levels
          have dried up. This fact is indubitable, for many observers,
          from Gilbert White onward, have confirmed it. The name of dew
          pond has been used since the beginning of the 19th century,
          but it appears to be purely a scientific expression, for most
          of the farm laborers in Sussex, when questioned about dew
          ponds, rejected the name and called them mist ponds.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is easy to get
          information about the construction of these ponds, as many
          know how to build them, thought there are many different
          varieties. Generally, such a pond consists of a saucer-shaped
          mould covered with a layer of straw, on top of which a layer
          of puddled clay is rammed, the latter being frequently
          protected by stones or chalk. Martin has given a minute
          description of the structure of the different ponds. For
          ramming the clay carefully, and puddling the surface, the
          rustics used to drive horses round and round and through the
          pond for a whole day. Martin speaks of a man who remembered
          that, as a boy, he knew a pond which sometimes contained a
          little water. When this was so he obtained permission to drive
          the horses on the way home through the pond in order to
          cleanse their hoofs. After having done it frequently, the pond
          commenced to hold more and more water, showing that it ceased
          to leak by the stamping hoofs of the horses.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The base of dew ponds is
          covered with grass, and most of them are surrounded by trees
          or bushes. IF ther is no grass, the pond dries up regularly.
          Martin has, to a certain extent, put an end to the discussion
          about dew ponds, by proving that they are not replenished by
          dew falling on their water surface, as, with few exceptions,
          the water is warmer than the air, and no dew could be
          deposited on them. Consequently, either mist condenses on the
          water as Martin believes, or the grass collects dew which
          flows towards the center, forming a pond. Both explanations
          are probably true. Dew ponds are typically English, as they
          rely on the English climate, and there are very few known in
          other parts of the world. To give some idea of the amount of
          water collected in such ponds, Gilbert White may be quoted. He
          says that a pond near his house at Selborne, west of London,
          which was never more than three feet deep in the center and
          not more than 30 feet in diameter, contained about 15,000
          gallons of water and was never known to fail, though it
          afforded drink for 300 sheep and 20 head of cattle every day.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the Libyan Desert,
          Northern Africa, the Italians have endeavored, since the Great
          War, to create a water supply from the atmosphere. They have
          built high walls of mud bricks with sloping sides, both of
          which they covered with smooth, condensing surfaces. At the
          bases of either side, troughs or channels are fitted running
          the whole length of the alls. Though the desert is arid and
          barren, the wind carries moisture from the sea towards the
          land, and water is deposited in the inner parts of the walls.
          A similar process has been used in Spain for centuries, and
          the thick walls of stone which are so common in Dalmatia
          undoubtedly retain a great deal of water.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The so-called Foggaras of
          the Sahara Desert are elaborate constructions, consisting of
          subterranean passages many miles long. They are dug by hand
          into the slopes of the mountains, and are big enough for a man
          to walk through upright. They are connected with the surface
          of the earth by an air tube at every 75 ft distance. Some of
          the foggaras are built on the surface and collect the humidity
          of the air, whereas those underneath certainly are fed by
          seepage, too.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These are the processes for
          condensing water from the atmosphere, as they are known and
          used today; they are not frequently employed, but the old
          literature shows that, in the times before the creation of the
          Roman Empire, whole townships relied on water condensed from
          the air, and many descriptions are given in old books. And it
          was by reading Maimonides that the author received the idea of
          thus condensing water. He was a Spaniard who lived roughly
          1000 years ago, and wrote, besides philosophic books, a
          description of Palestine and its people in the Arabic
          language. This book contains some hints regarding such a
          condensation of water as used there.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shortly after the war
          experiments on dew were carried out, and, the study being a
          hobby, it took a good many years to come to a conclusion, for
          the question was not to condense water from the air simply by
          cooling it artificially (as this was too easily solved), but
          to construct a highly effective building which condenses water
          without or with very low running costs. Gradually it was found
          that the knowledge of erecting buildings for water
          condensation from the air was spread all over the world, but
          that the old Greeks seemed to have had the best knowledge of
          the process. The usual description of these buildings in our
          archaeological literature runs like this" Covered troughs or
          channels were found leading up the slope of a mountain right
          to the top, where ruins of a great vault were detected, which
          seemed to have contained water. It is not known how the water
          got there, but certainly the town possessed a very great
          supply of water from sources which disappeared". Such
          descriptions were found for about 50 towns, which obtained
          their water in this way, and most of which belonged to the
          sphere of Greek influence, but the old Incas used the same
          principles and the mystic buildings on some of the Pacific
          Islands may have served this purpose, too.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The principle is a very
          simple one. In India and other tropical countries, rooms are
          found in houses which have very thick walls and small windows
          right under the ceiling. These rooms are remarkably cool, and
          that is understandable, for the cool air flows through the
          windows into the room during the night and is kept there in
          the daytime, since it cannot escape through the windows, and
          as these rooms are well insulated by their thick walls. If, in
          such a room, holes are made near the bottom, so that the cool
          air can flow out, water condenses on the walls, for the
          humidity condenses on the cool surfaces.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This process relies not only
          on the humidity of the air, which is everywhere present, but
          also on the difference between day and night temperatures ---
          the greater this difference the more favorable are the
          conditions --- and this is the reason why the buildings of
          ancient times were situated on the tops of the hills.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At first the process was
          tried by insulating a room of a house and making holes at the
          ceiling and at the bottom, but this method did not work very
          well, as houses in Europe usually stand in the valleys.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A better method consisted in
          selecting a mountain slope, smoothing it with cementitious or
          other material apt to make the surface watertight, and
          covering it with an insulating material, so that the cover
          formed over the area a canopy or roof which was supported by
          pillars or ridges. The sides of the canopy were closed,
          whereas the upper and lower ends were left open by
          constructing holes or vents to allow the air to pass under the
          roof. This construction proved to be very successful, as the
          cooling surface of the inner part was highly effective. The
          disadvantage was that the structure was very expensive, and so
          a return was made to the block house type.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Many types of building were
          tried, but that finally adopted was a sugarloaf shaped
          building, about 50 ft high, with walls at least 6 ft thick,
          with holes on the top and at the bottom, the inner surface
          being enlarged by a network of walls of a material with great
          surface. The outer wall is made of concrete to be able to take
          up a great amount of thermal units, the inner surface consists
          of sandstone or any other porous material. The building
          produces water during the day and cols itself during the
          night; when the sun rises, the warm air is drawn through the
          upper holes into the building by the out-flowing cooler air,
          becomes cooled on the cold surface, deposits its water, which
          then oozes down and is collected somewhere underneath. It is
          wrong to think that this process works only on days with dew,
          as the inner surface becomes much cooler than one should
          expect. In Dalmatia, that day was a rare exception which
          failed to produce water.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nearly all the experiments
          were performed in Yugoslavia, most of them on the numerous
          islands of the Adriatic Sea, some in the inner parts of
          Dalmatia. The southern parts of the northeastern coast of
          Adria have plenty of rain in the winter, but in the summer
          rain falls only occasionally, and, as the soil consists of
          pervious limestone, this is one of the dry districts of
          Europe, though the humidity of the air is high.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The essential principle in
          obtaining water from the air has thus been shown to be --- a
          great water condensing surface which must be well protected
          against the heat of the sun and at the same time it is
          necessary that the air should pass to the condensing surface
          slowly, in order that it may cool properly and so deposit its
          water. The conclusion of this is --- that a big heap of stones
          would do the same thing as the above-described buildings. The
          last experiments in Yugoslavia followed this line, where one
          did produce a small amount of water, though this work was not
          completed. This process, too, was used by the old Greeks for
          the water supply of the town of Theodosia on the Crimean
          Peninsula, where artificial heaps of stones condensed the
          necessary water on the surrounding hills, whence pipes ran
          down to the city. These heaps were about 10,000 ft square and
          30 ft high, and each of them yielded more than 500 gallons of
          water per day.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This paper would be
          incomplete without mentioning that in Paris, Achille Knapen
          (4) is working on the same line independently of the author.
          To dry wet walls of buildings, he has invented a tube, closed
          at&nbsp; one side, which he calls "<i>siphon atmospherique
            monobranche</i>", and it has proven successful, as its use
          is simple, cheap, and effective. He transferred the principle
          of this tube to a building, shaped similar to the above
          proposition, and erected a big experimental "<i>Puits Aerien</i>",

          as he calls it, near Trans-en-Provence in Southern France. He
          has met with success, though his published results have not
          yet been seen by the author.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In conclusion, the author
          feels confident that it is possible to use this process under
          Australian conditions, and so has decided not to apply for a
          patent, as this would hinder its application. It would give
          him much pleasure if one day this process could be seen to
          have helped those living in the outback.</font> </p>
